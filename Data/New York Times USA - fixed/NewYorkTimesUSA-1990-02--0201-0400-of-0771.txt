HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Three-Day Gold Rally Ends As Profit Takers Move In

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Profit taking pushed prices of gold futures lower yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange, ending a three-day rally that peaked when the contract for April delivery failed to find support above $430 an ounce.
Silver futures also turned lower and, in other commodity markets, oil futures were mostly lower.
Gold futures settled $1.10 to $1.50 lower, with the contract for delivery in February at $421.30 an ounce. Silver finished 2.3 cents to 2.4 cents lower, with March at $5.33 a troy ounce. 
Gold for February delivery had surged a total of $10 an ounce in the three previous sessions, mainly on supportive chart signals that defied the recent anti-inflationary rise in interest rates, which is usually a bearish fundamental factor.
 
Other Metals Lagged
Analysts also noted that gold's strength had not been confirmed by similarly sharp increases in silver and platinum prices.
The gold rally passed a milestone Monday when the heavily traded contract for April delivery moved above $430 an ounce, but confidence in the market then waned.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said gold historically has performed poorly in February, which might account for traders' reluctance to keep betting on higher prices. ''If history serves as a guide, I would be on my guard here,'' he said.
But Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Company said uncertainty surrounding stock prices and the political upheaval in Eastern Europe could keep investors interested in gold.
 
Petroleum Prices Mixed
Petroleum futures turned in a mixed performance on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as the American Petroleum Institute issued its weekly inventory report that showed higher-than-expected supplies.
The institute reported an increase of 7.7 million barrels in United States stocks of crude oil, a rise of 4.7 million barrels in gasoline stocks and an increase of 4.5 million barrels in supplies of petroleum distillates, which include home heating oil.
Analysts said the report could prompt selling of futures today.
In trading yesterday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 12 cents higher, with March at $22.51 a barrel; heating oil was 0.15 cent lower to 0.24 cent higher, with March at 56.19 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.08 cents lower to 1.2 cents higher, with March at 61.88 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: OPEC Chief Sees Demand Keeping Prices High

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Fewer oil shipments from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe have led to higher demand for oil from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That should keep world prices above $18 a barrel this year, the head of OPEC said today.
Although demand should slip modestly in the coming months, a sharp break in prices ''is not in the cards,'' even though OPEC production exceeds the limits the organization set in November for its 13 members, Subroto, OPEC's Secretary General, said in an interview.
Analysts have said that oil output in the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, has declined by about 800,000 barrels a day, to about 11.5 million a day, in the last two years. $60 Billion Needed Dr. Subroto, the former oil minister of Indonesia and the chief spokesman for OPEC, was in Houston to speak at a conference of oil industry executives sponsored by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. He said that with worldwide oil demand rising faster, and the prospect of increased demand from growing economies in Eastern Europe within a few years, OPEC believes it must raise $60 billion to finance more production within five years. 
The analysts estimate that OPEC produced more than 23 million barrels a day last month, or a million barrels more than the daily ceiling of 22 million barrels that took effect on Jan. 1. The United Arab Emirates is the only nation producing far more than its quota, the analysts said.
Dr. Subroto said total production capacity within OPEC should be increased by as much as five million barrels a day, or by nearly 20 percent, by the mid-1990's. Some OPEC nations have operated at full capacity in recent years, and they risk losing billions in future revenues if they do not expand oil-export capacity soon. 27 Million Barrels The production capacity of OPEC is estimated at nearly 27 million barrels a day. Dr. Subroto said the organization's output should reach 28 million barrels a day by 1995.
Joseph A. Stanislaw, an expert on Middle East and European energy markets for Cambridge Energy, said commercial lenders and private oil companies in the West were the most logical sources of money for the OPEC's expansion plans.
He said he estimated the capital needs for the OPEC effort at $35 billion to $50 billion through the mid-1990's. A similar total would be needed to increase refining and transportation operations within OPEC nations, Dr. Stanislaw said.
Some money would come from revenues dervied from OPEC's oil exports, but as much as three-fourths of the total must be attracted from foreign sources, he said.
But many large oil companies are likely to be cautious in re-establishing ties with OPEC nations.
 
'Political Problems'
John S. Jennings, the managing director of the Shell Transport and Trading Company, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said some OPEC nations could have ''tremendous political problems'' in inviting foreign financiers and oilfield operators back to their nations.
Commercial bankers are especially wary of financing oilfield projects in Iran and Iraq, where each side caused severe damage to the other during the eight-year war that ended in 1988.
Yasushi Kajiwara, the head of energy lending at the Industrial Bank of Japan, said commercial banks were urging the OPEC nations to pledge that refineries, pipelines, oil ports and other energy centers would not be attacked during future wars that might occur in the region.
Without the assurances, he said, new production would be limited in the future and global oil demand could push prices to $40 a barrel by 1995 and $60 by the year 2000.
OPEC oil prices averaged $19.41 a barrel in the fourth week of January, down from $20.40 a month earlier, but well above the minimum of $18 a barrel for the first half of 1990 that was set in November. ''We expect that it will slide a little bit more during the second quarter,'' Dr. Subroto said.
One of OPEC's largest producers, Iraq, recently agreed to ship oil to Hungary and Czechoslovakia, Dr. Subroto said. Iraq said for the first time last week that it would consider foreign investment to help raise its oil production. Iran has also held talks on beginning shipments, he said.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Envoy Besieged in Spying Inquiry Is Called Security Risk and Ousted

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Felix S. Bloch, the American diplomat who came under intense Federal investigation last year when officials said he was photographed with a Soviet spy, was told today that he was being dismissed because he is a national security risk, the State Department said.
The action came after six months in which Mr. Bloch was publicly identified as a suspected Soviet intelligence agent, besieged by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reporters, and barred from his Washington office, but never charged with a crime.
Mr. Bloch has been on leave with pay from the State Department's bureau of European and Canadian affairs since June 22. Today, the department removed him from its payroll and said he would be dismissed in 30 days.
The State Department announcement leaves Mr. Bloch with the choice of accepting his dismissal, and implicitly conceding guilt, or contesting it without guaranteed access to details of the allegations that led to his ouster. Under Federal laws governing dismissal of employees suspected of being security risks, the State Department is required to submit a summary of charges ''stated as specifically as security considerations permit.'' 
Under the law Mr. Bloch can contest the decision through administrative hearings at the State Department, including an appeal to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. Should he fail, he would then have the option of taking the matter to Federal court. It was unclear today what Mr. Bloch would do. Mr. Bloch's lawyer, John M. Bray, said his client had no comment. Mr. Bloch did not answer the telephone at his home near downtown Washington.
 
Trail Growing Cold
The State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today that the inquiry into allegations of espionage by Mr. Bloch remains active. Officials have conceded, however, that they so far lack the evidence to make a court case against their target and that his trail grows colder each day.
Federal officials denied that a motive in dismissing Mr. Bloch was the hope that the move would produce additional evidence of wrongdoing through administrative hearings, court battles or other steps he might take to contest the action. Dismissal is the strongest action that can be taken against Mr. Bloch short of filing criminal charges, which the available evidence does not support, law enforcement officials say.
It is ''farfetched indeed'' to think Mr. Bloch's dismissal is a Federal ploy to force the disclosure of new evidence against him, Michael Schatzow, a Baltimore lawyer who prosecuted John A. Walker, the master Soviet spy, said in an interview. Indeed, he said, the Government has abandoned similar proceedings in other cases to avoid disclosing classified evidence.
''In these proceedings the burden usually goes the other way,'' he said, meaning the Government must show that its actions are justified. ''Mr. Bloch obviously has a good lawyer. He's not going to stick his foot in his mouth now.''
 
An Eerie Composure
For the State Department, Mr. Bloch's dismissal was also dictated by financial considerations. Officials noted that Mr. Bloch receives an $80,000-a-year salary for a job he is barred from performing.
Through it all, the balding, 54-year-old bureaucrat has maintained an eerie composure, repeatedly declining opportunities to deny that he was a spy and challenging investigators to find enough evidence to prove otherwise.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, today refused to describe the specific allegations of wrongdoing that led to the decision to dismiss Mr. Bloch, saying those charges are confidential under privacy laws.
The Federal law covering Mr. Bloch's case allows the removal of employees ''in the interests of national security.'' An Administration official said today that the State Department had not previously used the law, and that its last known use, in 1983, was by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
State Department lawyers have been studying the agency's options under the law since at least last autumn, an Administration official said today.
''It's a pretty complicated legal issue because it involves balancing the national security and due process,'' the official said. ''We do feel like we moved promptly in terms of the work that had to be done, but cautiously.''
Mr. Baker decided last week to invoke the Federal law, and the agency's Under Secretary for Management, Ivan Selin, ordered the dismissal.
If Mr. Bloch is dismissed next month, the State Department would consider taking action under another law to reduce or eliminate his pension, the Administration official said.
Mr. Bloch was the second-ranking American diplomat in Vienna during much of the Reagan Administration. In that job, he effectively ran day-to-day embassy affairs in a city that is a center for sensitive arms negotiations and other strategic matters.
 
Charges Go Back to 70's
Since 1988, he had worked in a Washington office that deals with European economic relations and restrictions on technology exports to the East bloc.
American officials have said they believe that Mr. Bloch began spying for Moscow in the 1970's, when he was an officer at American embassies in West and East Berlin. But officials said he came under F.B.I. scrutiny only last spring, when he turned up in a secret videotape of a known Soviet agent whose European movements were being followed.
Mr. Bloch was immediately placed under heavy surveillance, and his automobile and telephone were wiretapped. Officials said the automobile wiretap later recorded Mr. Bloch telling his wife, Lucille, that he had accepted money from the Soviet Union.
Numerous news reports said the inquiry also turned up evidence that Mr. Bloch had spent large sums of money, well beyond the means of a mid-level diplomat, for a prostitute's services during much of his stay in Vienna.
The Soviet agent appears to have cryptically told Mr. Bloch in a telephone conversation last May that he was under surveillance by the F.B.I. Shortly after the tip, the State Department suspended Mr. Bloch.
Last July, reporters detected the heavy surveillance, and a horde of writers and photographers joined Federal agents in a round-the-clock siege of Mr. Bloch's home.

HEADLINE: Congress Approves $42 Million in Aid to Panama

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The House and Senate today approved a $42 million package of emergency aid for Panama that would also lift many trade sanctions that had been intended to press Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The aid package was approved by a voice vote in both chambers and sent to the White House. It was the first step in a much broader aid proposal advanced by the Bush Administration to help Panama rebuild its economy after the American invasion and the damage inflicted by the Noriega Government and United States sanctions. There was little debate today. 
''We support the Administration's analysis of the urgency of the matter,'' said Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 
Criticism From House Speaker
Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, said that ''if this area of the world was important enough to risk and lose American lives, it is worth our capital'' to help restore democracy.
The measure also includes $10 million in aid ''to support the process of democratic transition'' in Eastern Europe, intended to reach that region before the flurry of elections expected this spring, congressional aides said.
Thomas S. Foley, the Speaker of the House, spoke with unusual force today of the Democrats' intent to keep pushing for more aid for Eastern Europe. ''The Administration had flat zero, zero dollars proposed to assist democratic elections in Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Foley said at his morning news conference.
''The Administration - and I am not trying to denigrate it - the Administration has $1 billion proposed for Panama and can't seem to muster anything like that for the rest of Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Foley said. ''This is not a time when we can assume that these democratic changes in Eastern Europe are permanent.''
The measure approved today restores to Panama many of the trade and aid privileges revoked by the United States because of General Noriega's failure to cooperate in the war against drugs. The Panamanian leader has been indicted in Florida on charges of drug trafficking.
 
Trade Privileges to Resume
Panama would be eligible, once again, for trade privileges under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a United States program to stimulate the region's economy, as well as other international economic programs like loans from the Export-Import Bank. The measure also includes $32 million in direct, emergency aid and an additional $10 million in loan guarantees for the construction of low-income housing.
The action today is the first step in President Bush's proposal for a $1 billion package of grants, loans and other types of assistance for Panama.
Administration officials have testified that Panama's gross domestic product, which measures the output of goods and services, declined about 16 percent in the last two years, while unemployment rose to 25 percent.
While there was broad support for the Panamanian aid, some objections were expressed today.
Some members asserted that the aid for Panama was being transferred from money set aside for Africa; the Democratic leadership gave assurances that the money would be replaced later this year. Other members said they continued to have concerns about money laundering in Panama.
But a measure of the political popularity of the Panamanian invasion came on a seperate resolution commending the President and the American military and urging Mr. Bush ''to continue his efforts to foster democratic ideals in Panama and the establishment of a democratic government so long sought by the people of Panama.''
The measure passed by a vote of 389 to 26.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: TRADE;
Negotiations Are to Begin on Ending Restrictions Against Soviet Imports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The first round of talks on a trade agreement that could end nearly a half-century of American discrimination against Soviet imports will start on Monday in Washington, the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, announced today.
Both Governments hope to conclude the talks before President Bush meets with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union in June.
Moscow would like an end to the restrictions under the Jackson-Vanik law of 1974, which prevents the Soviet Union from receiving most favored nation status, or normal tariff treatment on imports from it, until it adopts an open emigration policy. Most favored nation status gives countries the benefits of tariff reductions that have been adopted since the 1930's. 
 
U.S. Seeking Soviet Commitments
American trade officials said the United States would also have some demands, seeking commitments by the Soviets on protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property, mechanics for settling commercial disputes, safeguards for preventing surges of cheap imports, and the right to have offices for American representatives in the Soviet Union.
Mrs. Hills announced the talks during testimony on trade matters before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. She said Yuriy N. Chumakov, a Soviet deputy foreign trade minister, would lead the Soviet delegation.
Mrs. Hills said she intended to keep pressure on Japan, South Korea and other trading partners to open markets to American exports, but apart from the Soviet trade announcement she made no major disclosures.
 
Hope for Market-Driven Economy
Through the negotiations, she stressed, the United States hopes to ''encourage economic reform'' within the Soviet Union as it moves toward a more market-driven economy.
A successful agreement, she also noted, will ''create opportunities'' for American business in the Soviet Union.
Congressional sensitivity over contents of the agreement and the process by which Congress will review it was evidenced by particularly close questioning of Mrs. Hills by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Noting the importance of maintaining close consultations with Congress, he said that if the Nixon Administration had kept Congress better informed in the early 1970's while it was negotiating a trade agreement with Moscow, the Bush Administration would not now have to deal with the existing limitations on Soviet trade.
 
Effect of Jackson-Vanik Law
This was a reference to the Jackson-Vanik curbs, which Congress wrote into the Trade Act of 1974. The linkage to Soviet emigration policies caused Moscow in early 1975 to abort that trade pact, which had been under negotiation for two years.
Under Jackson-Vanik, tariffs on imports from the Soviet Union are as much as 10 times higher than they would be from most other countries. For American consumers, ending the curbs would mean, for example, $1.25 off the retail price of a bottle of vodka, which is one of the big Soviet exports to the United States.
The United States is considering granting Jackson-Vanik waivers on imports from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and East Germany. Hungary recently obtained a waiver. The curbs against Poland were lifted in 1987.
Senator Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, said he understood that ''there are those within the Administration who really want to limit consultations with this committee or Congress'' and ''I want to see the consultation requirement lived up to.''
Mrs. Hills insisted that ''there is no question in my mind that this Administration wants to consult.''
 
Congressional Review Problem
One problem is how the Congress is going to review the trade agreement following the so-called Chadha decision of the Supreme Court in 1983, which declared a legislative veto illegal.
Under Jackson-Vanik, approval of a trade agreement that restores most favored nation treatment would require a concurrent resolution - an act of Congress that is not signed by the President. The resolution would be subject to the approval of the Senate and the House.
But under Chadha, lawyers say, this procedure is probably unconstitutional because it could amount to a legislative veto.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Urges 'Real World' View of China

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger asked Congress today to take a more tolerant view of China, saying it was ''less completely evil'' than it seemed in June, when the Chinese Army crushed the democracy movement in Beijing.
''China is not a benighted society from top to bottom,'' he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in the Administration's most comprehensive defense of its policy toward China. ''The forces favoring reform have not disappeared.'' The mood of many senators was expressed by Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who described the Chinese leaders as ''gangsters'' and said, ''There are many evil regimes in the world today, but none more deserves to be overthrown by its people than the one in Beijing.'' 
Senators Gordon Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, and Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Bush was so afraid of offending China's leaders that he seemed to treat China as a client state. Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Sarbanes both said Mr. Bush, a former chief of the United States mission in Beijing, seemed to have a lingering case of ''clientitis,'' an excessive tendency to defend the interests of the country where he served.
Members of Congress from both parties expressed fear that the United States response to China might embolden hardliners in the Soviet Union to believe that they could crack down on dissent without paying a longterm price in relations with Washington.
Mr. Eagleburger and President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, visited China in July and December. On the first trip, he said, China was told that ''the United States does not condone the appalling violence used to suppress the peaceful demonstrations, nor do we condone the repression that has followed.''
China's response to those admonitions was ''inscrutable,'' he said. ''They understood us, but there was no real reaction, other than, 'You tied the knot, you have to untie the knot.' ''
Mr. Eagleburger acknowledged that repression continued in China after the first visit. On the second trip, he recalled, he and Mr. Scowcroft told Chinese leaders ''how they could improve their relations with the United States.'' The results have been ''favorable,'' he said, noting that China lifted martial law in Beijing and released 573 people from detention.
But in response to questions, Mr. Eagleburger said there was no reason to expect that martial law would be lifted in Tibet. He said that he could not confirm reports from Beijing today that China would toughen restrictions on young people planning to study abroad, but that if such restrictions are enforced, that would represent ''a serious step backward.''
''Today, in the eyes of many foreign observers, China's leaders seem unable to do anything right,'' Mr. Eagleburger said. He asserted that ''we need a better balance between our fascination with the China of the early 1970's and today's mood of disappointment and hostility.''
''In the real world,'' he said, ''we need to see that China is less completely charming than the land of panda bears and the Great Wall and also less completely evil than a night in June when the 'goddess of democracy' was crushed by tanks in Tiananmen.''
Mr. Eagleburger said that President Bush's policy toward China would not ''lead to a rapid payoff.''
''This is a long-haul situation,'' he said. ''It will take a good bit of time. We are hopeful, but can certainly not guarantee that the process we are now following will, in fact, lead the Chinese Government toward reform and democratization, economic and political. I can't promise it.''
Mr. Eagleburger said that if the United States isolates China, it would play into the hands of Chinese officials who oppose democratic change.
''The process of isolating ourselves from the Chinese people, cutting off the contacts, reducing the dialogue back and forth, will lead to nothing more than an isolated China which returns to the bad old days of a very dictatorial, centralized system that really doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks,'' Mr. Eagleburger said.

HEADLINE: Security Tight for Jackson On Arrival in South Africa

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived in South Africa today for his first visit in 11 years and was immediately surrounded by some of the tightest police security ever given to a foreign visitor.
In the face of hostility toward the American civil rights leader's visit from conservative white groups, the police threw a security cordon around Jan Smuts Airport and checked all vehicles for weapons. When Mr. Jackson left the airport, flanked by a dozen uniformed police officers, there were cheers from a throng of black workers and a lone shout from an burly white man in his 30's, who jeered: ''Go home Jackson! You're supposed to be a man of God!'' A car filled with plainclothes officers, also whites, accompanied the American's entourage to a downtown Johannesburg hotel.
Concerns for Mr. Jackson's safety centered on threats from extreme right-wing white groups already enraged by the program of political relaxation announced last week by President F. W. de Klerk. The climate was not eased when Roelof F. Botha, the Foreign Minister, criticized the American on Tuesday. 
 
Timing of Visit Criticized
In remarks to reporters, Mr. Botha accused Mr. Jackson of saying different things about economic sanctions to the South African Ambassador to the United States than he has been saying publicly, and demanded that he ''make up his mind.'' Mr. Botha also said that the timing of the Jackson visit, ''in the middle of very important business'' for South Africa, was inopportune.
Mr. Jackson appeared anxious to ease tensions, saying at an airport news conference that he would be meeting with Mr. de Klerk and with other white leaders, as well as with blacks, and that he hoped during his visit to address ''the unfounded fears of whites'' about the dismantling of apartheid as well as what he called ''the pain of black people.''
Pressed by reporters to respond to Mr. Botha's criticisms, he declined. He noted that he was here ''on a Government visa'', and added: ''What I have to share with Mr. Botha I will share with him,'' at a meeting scheduled for Cape Town next week.
 
'Apartheid Is Sanctions'
Mr. Jackson avoided statements that the sanctions should be intensified, as he had been quoted as saying after Mr. de Klerk's announcements on Friday. Instead, he emphasized the prospect that sanctions will be lifted as racial laws are dismantled.
''Apartheid is sanctions,'' he said. ''For those who cannot vote, it is political sanctions; for those who cannot borrow money and grow economically, it is economic sanctions; for those victimized by the Group Areas Act, it is land sanctions. So sanctions beget sanctions. The real issue is to end apartheid, and the sanctions will leave.''
Among South African blacks, Mr. Jackson's visit has been widely greeted as the most important by any American political figure since Robert F. Kennedy visited here in 1966.
At the news conference, the American was flanked by Walter F. Sisulu, a recently freed leader of the African National Congress, the Rev. Frank Chikane of the South African Council of Churches, and the Rev. Allan Boesak, a major figure in the United Democratic Front. The three men are among of the country's most influential black leaders. Mr. Sisulu, who released last year after 26 years in prison, praised Mr. Jackson's ''courage and determination,'' and the two men dined together later at Mr. Sisulu's home in Soweto, the black satellite city outside Johannesburg.
 
Visa Denied in '88
Among conservative whites, hostility to Mr. Jackson dates to 1979 during his first visit here, when he was quoted as calling South Africa a ''terrorist dictatorship,'' and from his subsequent support for American economic sanctions. In 1988, during Mr. Jackson's run for the Democratic Presidential nomination, the Government refused him a visa for a visit. This time, a visa was issued for a 12-day visit after Mr. Jackson's application had been strongly supported by the South African Ambassador to Washington, Pieter J. Koornhof.
 
Visit With Mandela Scheduled
If a tentative itinerary circulated by the United States Embassy is followed, the highlight of the trip is likely to be a 90-minute visit with Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, at the Victor Verster Prison outside Cape Town on Monday.
At his news conference, Mr. Jackson appeared to take pains not to paint the government into a corner over the proposed meeting, saying that he had ''no commitment'' from the authorities that a meeting would be held. In any event, he said, he would prefer to see Mr. Mandela ''walking down the streets of Johannesburg'' after he has been released, as Mr. de Klerk promised last week.
In his comments on Mr. Klerk's decision to lift the bans on the African National Congress and on more than 30 other anti-apartheid groups, and to otherwise ease restraints on black political activity, Mr. Jackson said that Mr. de Klerk had ignited ''hope'' in South Africa and around the world.
But he urged the white leader to press forward to a complete end of apartheid. ''If the Government goes backwards, there will be chaos; if it stands still there will be tension; if it goes forward there will be a new and free and democratic South Africa,'' he said. ''In a very real sense, the greatest days for South Africa are beyond apartheid.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Renewing Border Detentions

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAYVIEW, Tex., Feb. 7

 BODY:
In a sharp policy reversal. the Government announced today that it would again start detaining Central Americans who cross the border illegally and then try to seek political asylum.
The detention policy was publicly abandoned just two weeks ago when Commissioner Gene McNary of the immigration service acknowledged that budget restraints were forcing the agency to release aliens from its detention facility here.
But after a rebel offensive in El Salvador late last year the tide of refugees has grown, prompting the renewal of the detention policy.
Mr. McNary toured six newly erected tents at a detention center here today and announced, ''The message we are now sending across Central America and around the world is, 'Just don't drop in on our doorstep without a just cause and a provable case of fear of persecution.' '' 
The renewed policy, he said, is similar to an initiative begun last Feb. 20 in which a tent city was erected here for several months to handle an influx of refugees. The number of detainees grew quickly to reach a maximum of about 3,600 in the spring but began to drop and is now about 1,000.
 
Border Crossings Increase
The number of Central Americans stopped while crossing the border in this area of South Texas had hovered around 800 a month through much of the summer and fall of last year. Then, after the rebel offensive, the number of people apprehended jumped to 1,203 in December and to 1,806 in January, according to immigration officals.
The detention center, situated near a rural crossroads about 20 miles northeast of Brownsville, is now prepared to handle up 2,500 people and the population could go to 10,000, Mr. McNary said.
Mr. McNary said he hoped to send a message to people seeking asylum that they face certain detention under conditions that ''won't be like the Ritz Carlton.''
Although he insisted, ''We are here to stay, make no mistake about it,'' the resources available to carry out the threat appear to be limited.
The Commissioner said about $11 million from the immigration service's budget had been set aside to finance the new detention effort. He said more emergency funds would be available later, but he did not specify what they would be.
Mr. McNary said he had not sought approval for the renewed detention policy from either the White House or the Department of Justice, the service's parent agency. He also said he had not secured any additional money to support the program. So far, he said no additional personnel had been sent to South Texas to carry out the new effort. But he promised that as many as 500 additional border patrol agents would be available if necessary.
Two weeks ago, the Immigration commissioner said in interviews that budget restraints had obliged him to order the population of the detention center here reduced to no more than 668 people. At the beginning of the year, the facility housed about 1,200 detainees, officials said.
 
Detention Up to Six Months
In order to meet the budgetary imperative, hundreds of Central Americans, some of whom had been detained for as long as six months, were suddenly released on their own recognizance. Many of those newly apprehended were held only a few days if they could show they had families in the United States.
The policy of releasing detainees ''has stopped as of today,'' Mr. McNary said at a news conference this afternoon in which he acknowledged that he was reversing tactics.
Robert Rubin, a lawyer with the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs, a group that has contested the immigration detention policies in several lawsuits, said, ''It is difficult to understand the sudden flip-flop in position now because everyone has known for several months that the number of refugees coming from Central America has been increasing in direct response to the increasing level of violence in El Salvador.''
Mr. Rubin said that the most recent wave of people seeking asylum began when the old detention policy was still in effect and well before Mr. McNary ordered the number of detainees reduced last month.
Mr. Rubin added, ''The I.N.S. needs to appreciate that the message of detention does not reach people who are fleeing violence.''
When the original detention policy was begun almost a year ago, the immigration service asserted that the great majority of the refugees were not fleeing political persecution but were seeking economic opportunities, so that they were frivolous rather than true candidates for asylum.
Foreigners who enter the country without submitting to inspection by an immigration officer are subject to detention and possible deportation if they can not prove they have the right to be the United States.
 
One-Day Adjudications Promised
In instituting the detention policy the immigration service promised that by adding hundreds of officials to the staff here it would be able to adjudicate an asylum claim in one day and then either deport the alien or grant asylum. But the process of determining whether individuals had a legitimate fear of persecution bogged down, until many refugees were detained for several months.
Mr. McNary said today that the service would again provide one-day processing, even though no additional agents were likely to be sent here for several weeks. Asked to explain how the refugees could be processed so quickly without additional officers or changes in procedures, Mr. McNary said, ''We are starting from a good blueprint.''
The immigration service's legal basis for the detention policy has come under attack in the court. In a ruling last July, Federal District Court Judge William Wayne Justice found that the frivolity standard was unjustly applied to six individual refugees. He is now considering a motion that the finding be extended to all refugees from El Salvador.

HEADLINE: Tougher Enforcing of Child Labor Laws Is Vowed

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
In the face of record levels of child labor law violations, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole today promised ''immediate action to step up enforcement'' of the laws, larger penalties for violations and a review of all regulations governing children who work.
''Our fines must exact a price or there will be no deterrence,'' Mrs. Dole said in a statement. ''This new strategy will leave no uncertainty about our commitment to enforce the law.''
Department officials said new changes in calculating violations could lead to a quintupling of fines, now often only a few hundred dollars. They also said they expected to take significant enforcement actions within a month. 
 
'Our Future,' Mrs. Dole Says
''The children of America are our future,'' Mrs. Dole said. ''The Department of Labor will do everything within its power to protect children against those who violate our child labor laws. The first step in this process is to reassess our fine structure and take immediate action to step up enforcement.''
Child advocates, who have been pressing the department to toughen enforcement for several years, welcomed the statement but noted that the department, constrained like others by the Federal budget, is not adding money or personnel to enforce the laws. Labor officials said they plan to improve use of existing resources.
''It's important that the department has set this new direction,'' said Linda F. Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League and chairwoman of the Child Labor Advisory Committee, set up by the Labor Department. But she said much more was needed to stop the violations, especially in industries not covered by the laws.
 
'A Slap on the Wrist'
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who has introduced legislation to raise penalties for labor law violations, saluted Mrs. Dole's move. ''This is an area that the Federal Government has neglected for a decade,'' he said. ''The Secretary's interest in the issue can only help.''
But he added: ''I still don't think the penalties are tough enough. Employers will see them as a slap on the wrist.''
Federal labor laws prohibit most paid work for children under 14 years old so as to protect them from commercial exploitation and keep them in school, and the laws set strict limits on how much children under 16 can work after school and on weekends. The laws also restrict children from using hazardous machinery, like slicing machines and trash compactors. Yet labor officials have found children operating such devices.
The Labor Department found a record number of children, 22,508, working in violation of the 52-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act last year. That is more than twice the number of 1982 and the highest since the law was enacted. Violations have risen, officials say, because of the low unemployment rates of the 1980's. Pressed to find workers, employers have been reaching deeper into the population.
Cases of illegal employment of children, some as young as 10 and 11 years old, have become commonplace in New York City's garment district, in fast-food chains and supermarkets, in migrant labor camps and in door-to-door candy sales.
 
First Step: Higher Penalties
In a speech today to the Child Labor Advisory Committee, William C. Brooks, Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards, elaborated on Mrs. Dole's announcement.
In the first step of the new policy, Mr. Brooks said, penalties would be raised in part by changing the procedures for assessing them. At present, an employer can be fined up to $1,000 for each child found working in violation of the laws, regardless of the number of regulations the child is found to be violating. With the change, the employer can be fined for each violation. This, Mr. Brooks said, could yield fines five times larger than those levied now.
In addition, he said, the new system will permit consideration of factors that may further increase the penalty, like when the employer is a repeat offender of the child labor provisions. If an employer is found to keep inadequate work records, Mr. Brooks said, he could be assessed another penalty.
''The bottom line,'' he said, ''is that penalties should not - must not - be an acceptable cost of doing business.''
He said Mrs. Dole planned to set up a working group to explore whether to beef up the department's enforcement practices and to consider revising the classification of jobs deemed hazardous for children. He said the group would also consider the child labor laws and regulations, many of which do not take sufficient account of chemicals and machinery developed since the the laws were enacted in 1930's.
And in cases of especially serious and repeated violations, Mr. Brooks said he would be prepared to go to the courts to seek injunctions against the practices.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Amiable Idea Merchant Who Is Viewed as the Most-Feared Japan-Basher

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Enter Pat Choate's cinnabar-colored Victorian townhouse on Capitol Hill, and you are walking into the Orient. Utamaro woodblocks and a 17th-century painted screen line the gallery of the spare living room. A six-foot-square calligraphy on hammered silver frames the dining room table. A mural of Hokusai's ''Mount Fuji at Dawn'' graces the viewing area of the Japanese rock garden in the backyard.
So why is this bearded and bespectacled economist regarded as Washington's most-feared Japan-basher?
In September, Alfred A. Knopf will publish ''Agents of Influence,'' Mr. Choate's chronicling of the ways Japan shapes American trade and economic policies through contributing to Congressional, gubernatorial and mayoral campaigns, bankrolling think tanks and universities, planting stories in the press, and most of all, through the revolving door, hiring for big money former United States Government officials as lobbyists, lawyers and publicists. 
''This is a town where you can rent power and influence,'' says Mr. Choate, who is vice president of policy analysis for TRW Inc., a $7 billion military and industrial conglomerate. ''We have created a buccaneer class where public service is merely a sabbatical for lobbying and that lobbying has increased for foreign governments and foreign corporations. I'm using the Japanese because they're on the cutting edge.''
 
Variation on a Theme
Mr. Choate (whose name rhymes with boat) says his new book is nothing more than a variation on the theme he has explored for years, in books like ''America in Ruins'' and ''The High Flex Society,'' and in caucuses of the middle-of-the-road Democrats' Democratic Leadership Council and the centrist Republicans' House Wednesday Group: how to make American industry more vibrant and competitive in the new world economy.
Rumors about the book have disturbed Americans with Japanese connections and prompted Japanese officials to try to quash its publication.
A particularly heavy-handed pitch came during a visit to Tokyo last year by TRW's chairman, Joseph T. Gorman, when Matsudo Kuroda, the former vice minister of Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry and now a consultant to the New York-based Salomon Brothers, argued that if the book were published, it would severely damage U.S.-Japanese trade relations. TRW has substantial business dealings with Japan. Mr. Gorman was not swayed.
Mr. Choate is a mild-mannered, nice guy with clout, a contradiction in Washington where political capital is often accrued by self-promotion, leading with one's elbows and making enemies along the way.
 
Strategy on Ideas
But his dogged approach, a legacy from his childhood days picking cotton on his father's farm in Maypearl, Tex., masks a calculated strategy to feed his ideas into the system and watch them bubble up into legislation and policy. In the early 80's, he helped shape the short-lived debate on whether to bolster America's worn-out roads and dams and bridges. In the mid-decade, he made ''competitiveness'' the buzzword of the capital, resulting in Ronald Reagan's making it the centerpiece of his 1987 State of the Union Message and in some Democratic Presidential hopefuls centering their 1988 campaigns on it.
An idea merchant and a master of packaging and timing, Mr. Choate wields power by talking, writing and testifying nonstop. Armed with infinite patience and one of the richest Rolodexes in town, he sways lawmakers, lectures executives, tips off journalists, sits on task forces, attends institutional retreats, argues on talk shows and makes himself available to almost anyone who wants to hear his ideas on how the American economy is changing and how the country should adapt to an uncertain future.
Slightly overweight - he'd rather network over the lunch table than on the tennis court - he has expanded his wardrobe well beyond his uniform of three identical blue suits and white shirts of two years ago. A regular on ''Money Politics,'' a talk show aired on Sunday mornings on ABC's Washington affiliate, he has worked hard to improve his television persona. ''He has gone from an academic discursive style to a TV sound bite style,'' says Neal B. Freeman, the program's executive producer. ''We recently had him remove his glasses in the interest of esthetic appeal.''
 
Predicting What He Knows
He has also perfected the technique of using the show as a vehicle to make predictions that he knows will come true. In response to President Bush's capital gains initiative, for example, Mr. Choate said late last fall that Senate Democrats would find merit in a two-tiered capital gains tax plan. Last month, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who regularly receives advice from Mr. Choate, launched it as a policy inititiave.
In November, Mr. Choate predicted that Senator Jim Exon, the Nebraska Democrat, would send a letter to Carla Hills, the United States Trade Representative, chastising her for backing off from a semiconductor agreement during a recent trip to Japan. Mr. Choate admits that he had already seen the letter, and notes that he never predicts without permission.
For Ronald Morse, a Japan expert and fund raiser for the Library of Congress, Mr. Choate is a ''likeable guy, wholesome, like whole wheat bread.'' For C. Fred Bergsten, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter Administration and head of the Institute for International Economics, though he is open about their differences, Mr. Choate is ''an extremely effective operator.''
But Dennis Whitfield, a partner with The Brock Group, an international trade and investment consulting firm, calls Mr. Choate misguided. ''He's a great idea man, very bright and very personable,'' says Mr. Whitfield. ''He just happens to be wrong.''
For Mr. Whitfield, the only way to attract the best talent into Government is through the revolving door. ''To get people of a high caliber you need people who have proven themselves in other fields,'' he says. ''And you can't prohibit them then from going back and making a living in the manner in which they were before.''
 
'Kind of McCarthyism' Seen
What others find troubling in Mr. Choate's thesis is that when he lumps together everyone who gets money from Japan he suggests a sort of anti-American conspiracy. ''The great danger of Pat's book is that it is going lead to a kind of McCathyism regarding Japan,'' says David D. Hale, chief economist for the Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services, who, like Mr. Choate, argues for much stricter controls on the revolving door. ''Clearly there are people on the take, but other people get their money because no one else is willing to fund their research on Japan.''
One of Mr. Choate's targets has been Mr. Bergsten's think tank, which has significant influence on trade policy attitudes. In a 1988 article that he calls an ''announcement'' of his forthcoming book, Mr. Choate argued that ''while the views of these institutes and scholars are genuinely held, significant foreign funding amplifies their particular perspectives and gives them a sharp competitive advantage in the idea marketplace.''
''I was shocked at his intellectual sloppiness because he knew better; the attack was unjustified,'' says Mr. Bergsten, who adds that his institute has historically received more money from TRW than from Japan, which is the source of less than 3 percent of the group's resources from Japanese nongovernmental sources.
Mr. Choate insists that ''Fred misinterpreted,'' adding, ''What I was saying was not that people change their views to get their money, but that they got their money because they change their views.''
It is not a line of argument that satisfies Mr. Bergsten. ''That's kind of a cute way to put it, but I very strongly object to is the innuendo,'' he says. ''Pat doesn't specifically say that Fred and his institute are influenced, but it's the innuendo, and it's damaging to everything I'm trying to do, including resisting influence.''
Others who agree with Mr. Choate that the revolving door needs more controls and better monitoring, fault him for singling out the Japanese for censure. They argue that there is no difference between the former Pentagon official who leaves public service to represent an American firm like TRW in its military contracts or one who works for a foreign interest. ''The problem is the unethical use of government position for personal gain,'' says Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy. ''The revolving door is a problem, but it's not a uniquely Japanese problem.''
 
Backlash Before Publication
The backlash against the new book has already begun. Some Japan boosters speculate that Mr. Choate has pulled punches by relying on some sources who have told stories and named names with the understanding that their own interests will be protected.
Mr. Choate, who strongly denies the imputation of plea bargaining, is in the enviable position of saying and writing what he wants while at the same time drawing a full-time salary for TRW. He left government in 1977, after serving in the Office of Management and Budget and the Commerce Department in both Republican and Democratic administrations, and since 1981 has operated as a one-man think tank from the conglomerate's office in Rosyln, Va.
Although TRW has two manufacturing plants and a business development office in Japan and a number of American-Japanese joint ventures in North America, he is not required to show his bosses an advance copy of his forthcoming book, which he says he has written in his spare time. Because his wife, Diane, a psychotherapist, is studying Jungian analysis in Zurich, he says he has the luxury of working at home alone.
Mr. Choate knows that he may risk friendships by naming names and detailing unsavory relationships in the book's Appendix A, an alphabetical Who's Who of Washington's Japan promoters, the interests they represent and what they were paid. But he is confident that because of the peculiar political culture of Washington, where alliances of the powerful survive because they have to, the furor will be short-lived.
''There are going to be a lot of people who will be very angry with me when the book comes out, and I will be very angry and then realize ultimately that a lot of the criticism has nothing to do with me,'' he says. ''But sooner or later, the next topic will come along and we can work together on that. So I'm not in great puddles of sweat about this, because I'll be a player long after this book is gone.''

HEADLINE: Senate Votes Bush Education Bill, With Plan for Teacher Standards

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The Senate today overwhelmingly approved President Bush's first major initiative in education. But in passing the measure, the lawmakers added a provision that the President opposes: money for an independent board that is working to develop a voluntary national teacher certification system.
By a vote of 92 to 8, the lawmakers approved the Educational Excellence Act, authorizing the spending of $586 million for the fiscal year 1991, which starts Oct. 1. The measure, first submitted to Congress by President Bush last spring, includes money to improve education in mathematics, science and engineering and money for elementary and secondary schools with large numbers of poor students that make significant progress in raising achievement levels. 
 
Money for Standards Board
The bill, introduced by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, authorized $25 million over three years for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, an independent board created three years ago by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy. Business executives have said they will match that amount.
The standards board plans to start offering certificates in 1993 to qualified teachers who make it through a rigorous evaluation process. The hope is that the ''board-certified'' teachers will ultimately upgrade teacher training and the profession.
The Administration has opposed providing money for the standards board. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said at a hearing in July that the board should remain independent from the Federal Government.
The Senators who voted against the bill, all Republicans, were Jesse Helms of North Carolina; William Armstrong of Colorado, Jake Garn of Utah, Phil Gramm of Texas; Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire; James McClure; and Steve Symms of Idaho and Malcolm C. Wallop of Wyoming.
Passage of the measure is by no means assured in the House of Representatives, where some Democrats like Augustus Hawkins of California, who is chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, object to spending $35 million on a magnet schools program intended to attract gifted students to enriched educational programs. Mr. Hawkins objects to magnet schools unless they are tied to racial desegregation efforts.

HEADLINE: The Third Russian Revolution;
And the U.S.S.R.'s Union. And Its Economy.

 BODY:
It was as though President Bush had proposed in his State of the Union speech to do away with America's two-party system, federalism and private property. Standing there in Moscow, Mikhail Gorbachev confidently proclaimed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party that the party's monopoly of power had to go. Not only that: central control of the Soviet Union from Moscow had to go. And not only that: state ownership of the means of production had to go. 
These are radical reforms, all right. To the old-line Communists, Mr. Gorbachev's radicalism is apostasy and heresy - an assault on, among other things, their power and privilege. But Mr. Gorbachev, who once resisted radical reform, knows they have no better idea of how to save the party, the union or the economy. A radical program is now realistic.
He is facing facts and insisting that policy adjust to them. But can he adjust it fast enough?
Fact No. 1: Few Soviet citizens continue to believe in Communism. Without that belief, the Communist Party's extraordinary power lacks justification. So does the power of the Soviet state.
Mr. Gorbachev's answer to this loss of legitimacy is elections. He's betting that old-line apparatchiks who oppose him won't pass the electoral test and will have to retire. If enough reformers win, they may renew the party. If not, the party's base will erode further, and Party Secretary Gorbachev will have to rely more on his authority as President Gorbachev to get his way.
But elections can legitimize more than his authority. In the Baltic republics, they will give nationalists the basis for demanding their own states.
Fact No. 2. The Soviet Union is less than the sum of its parts. Across the country, nationalists assertively distance themselves from Moscow.
Mr. Gorbachev wants to turn these nationalist pressures to his advantage by moving from union to loose federation. That means devolving political and economic authority to the republics and undermining the power of the apparatchik-dominated ministries in Moscow.
Even so, some republics, not satisfied with greater autonomy, may push to secede.
Fact No. 3. Reform, far from reviving the flagging economy, has deepened the decay. And the apparatchiks continue to resist change. Yet most citizens realize there's no turning back. They're receptive to more radical reform. Mr. Gorbachev has now pointed the way. He's introducing new forms of private property in some sectors of the economy to encourage entrepreneurs.
But this reform may be too narrow in scope and too hedged with restrictions to generate much economic growth. And it will spawn inequality before growth, leading those less favored to denounce privilege and economic experimentation.
Mr. Gorbachev seems to emerge from this week's transformations stronger. But even if his grip on the Kremlin is secure, his right to rule will, with faith in the party and Communism shaken, ultimately depend on the Soviet people. Only they can turn the reforms, however radical, into results.

HEADLINE: Baby Costs Plenty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In response to Laura B. Kennelly (letter, Jan. 31), who suggests that parents work to ''decorate their babies with expensive items'' and that children raised in such an environment will require therapy and special schools, we would like to say, ''Grow up!''
Many dual-income families work out of economic necessity. For those women who choose to work, we hope Ms. Kennelly respects their decision, just as we respect her decision to be a full-time mother with her baby supplies of borrowed clothing, used furniture, and hemmed-up sheets for bedding.
Your publication of such a letter, however, was offensive and hurtful. As young working parents living in New York City, we know how difficult and expensive a task it is to raise a baby. The expense cited by American Demographics magazine for a baby's first year of $5,774 is realistic, if not low. Believe us, it is a struggle to balance family and career and to find quality child care. We are doing the best we can and do not appreciate harsh judgments.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
No End to the Threat

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
On the very day when Mikhail Gorbachev was arguing in a stormy Central Committee session for the Soviet Communist Party to begin sharing power with other political groups, what was President Bush's maladroit message to the world?
''Now, back to war,'' he told American troops during their maneuvers at Fort Irwin, Calif.
The President's hortatory remark was televised at the end of a speech that had interrupted a simulated tank war in Europe. Mr. Bush's presence on the field reflected his determination to maintain an enormous military budget, despite what he conceded were ''encouraging changes'' in what used to be the Communist world, and despite overwhelming domestic spending needs.
Nothing that's happened in Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush maintained at Fort Irwin in a new theme of his Administration, should ''lull us into a sense of complacency.'' 
Of course not, but when he himself - properly, I believe - praises Mr. Gorbachev's leadership and publicly hopes for the success of the Soviet President's reform program, are the American people really supposed to believe that the Gorbachev program may include a conventional invasion of Western Europe and/or a strategic attack on the U.S.?
That's what Marlin Fitzwater, the White House Press Secretary, seemed to suggest when he said the threat posed by Soviet nuclear forces had not diminished and despite lessening of tensions ''the United States must continue to maintain a robust and credible nuclear deterrent.''
Or is Mr. Bush warning that if Mr. Gorbachev is overthrown, his successors may launch an aggression? Either cold war notion asks Americans to discount new and old Soviet weaknesses:
* The loss of Eastern Europe, including East Germany and crippling the supposed strength of the Warsaw Pact.
* The surging internal unrest, from Lithuania to Azerbaijan, that undermines the 70-year Soviet regime and may turn back the calendar not just to World War II but to 1917.
* The pervasive economic and technological stagnation that impelled Mr. Gorbachev's effort to remake Soviet society.
If, despite Mr. Bush's so-called prudence, you believe that all these facts might at last diminish the fear of Soviet aggression that for 40 years has shaped U.S. foreign policy and military spending, Richard G. Darman offers another facile ''threat'':
''There are third parties now - non-superpowers,'' the budget director and this Administration's house intellectual told a television audience, ''who have ballistic missile capability.'' If the Russians aren't coming, folks, maybe somebody else is.
That, Mr. Darman said with a straight face, makes it imperative for the U.S. to spend more - in fact, $900 million more than last year - for the Star Wars missile defense, and to continue building the Stealth bomber ($500 million each). He did not name any ''third parties.''
Star Wars, moreover, is by now a certified non-starter, out of Buck Rogers by Rube Goldberg. Skeptics may well wonder, therefore, if the sickly U.S. education system and the nation's decaying infrastructure (to name only two domestic needs) are really being sacrificed to the 'threat' of North Korean missiles, or actually to Mr. Bush's fear of the Republican right wing.
As for the rest of the President's military budget, do not be misled by talk of ''spending cuts.'' In fact, military spending is going up, though not by as much as once was predicted. The total in fiscal 1991 will be $295 billion, which - though touted as a reduction of 2.6 percent in projected Pentagon spending power - represents an increase of about $5 billion in actual dollars over the current year. Proposed reductions, over all, are limited and ''fairly timid,'' said Les Aspin, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
The resulting military force, bristling as it still does with weapons systems and the ability to project U.S. power anywhere in the world, won't look timid in Moscow. The embattled Mr. Gorbachev will hardly see the helping hand Mr. Bush promised him, in a military budget rising in the face of what is undeniably the retreat and contraction of Soviet military power.
Worse, those in this country who lack jobs, shelter, education, health care and hope can take comfort only in the knowledge that, even with the Warsaw Pact in disarray, George Bush stands militant guard against third parties with missiles.

HEADLINE: Polishing Image, Principal Bans Gold Teeth

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
A Brooklyn high school principal has banned decorative gold caps for teeth because he believes they do not convey the serious image his students need to be successful in the business world.
''You can't go to Wall Street with gold teeth or excessive gold jewelry,'' the principal, Frank Mickens, told an auditorium full of freshmen at Boys and Girls High School yesterday. ''You can be a drug dealer, you can be a prostitute, you can be a pimp.''
As the students reacted to the directive with loud cries of derision, Mr. Mickens said: ''I'm not playing. Don't tell me it's implanted in there.'' He said any student who did not want to comply with his ruling could transfer to another school. 
In banning gold caps on teeth, the principal at the school in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section advanced a national trend in which educators are asking students to leave their expensive clothes and jewelry at home. There are two reasons: In flaunting costly coats and strands of gold the students are vulnerable to crime. And, educators say, they are also learning to place more emphasis on material things than on academic achievement.
In poor neighborhoods in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles there has been an increase in robberies by young people willing to kill for clothes. Mr. Mickens, a tough, outspoken principal who directs a school of 3,500 students, said he believes that three years ago he became the first principal in New York City to ban excessive gold jewelry. He has also banned short skirts, personal tape players and shearling coats.
As far as he knows, he is the first New York principal to ban gold teeth. A spokesman for the Board of Education, Robert H. Terte, said that there is no dress code for New York pupils but that principals have broad authority to set rules. ''The standard is whether it's reasonable and necessary to maintain order and discipline in the schools,'' Mr. Terte said.
 
Incessant Hallway Patrol
The ban on gold teeth is simply the second phase of what Mr. Mickens calls his ''moral mission'' to impart values at 1700 Fulton Street, where he has been the principal for four years. The school sits amid an area infested with drugs and crime and was once regarded as one of the worst schools in New York.
Now, 70 percent of the seniors at Boys and Girls go on to higher education, and the halls are clean and quiet. Much of the success is credited to Mr. Mickens, who incessantly patrols the hallways barking orders, shaking the hands of honor students and cajoling others to try harder. He estimates that only about 100 students wear the gold caps, but he says they are 100 too many.
''In dealing with black and Hispanic young people, I teach them they have to be beyond reproach, people have to look at them and immediately know they are dealing with a good young person,'' said Mr. Mickens, who is black. ''We're on a campaign of self-esteem. It's my belief once a kid feels good about himself he won't need that gold.''
''He is a person setting kids in the right direction,'' said Obah-David Ward, president of the school's Parent, Teacher and Community Association. ''The parents concur in what he is doing.'' Mr. Ward agrees with Mr. Mickens that many parents are too intimidated by their own children to set limits on what they wear.
 
Reasons Are Cosmetic
''You have to look at the broader issue of what is happening to our children and our community,'' Mr. Ward said. ''You look at the troubling unemployment or the parents working two or three jobs and who just aren't there to see their children,'' he said. ''Our children are placing the accent on the wrong thing: the gold here and the gold there, the right shoes, the right dress. We want the emphasis to be on education.''
Most of the gold teeth are simply for cosmetic reasons, students say. The caps, which slip over one's real teeth, range in cost from $40 to over $100. Especially popular right now are gold caps over the two front teeth, sometimes etched with initials or dice or another emblem. Boys wear them more often than girls.
The students say the gold teeth may have first appeared in the mouths of drug dealers or others looking for ostentatious ways to show their wealth but are now simply a fad. Although some students said they believed the ban was an invasion of their privacy, others said they thought the principal had their safety in mind. Others thought gold teeth conveyed a ''tough'' image.
 
'I Like Gold, Period'
''I just like gold teeth,'' said Michael Foreman, 14 years old, who attended the freshman assembly yesterday. He has two in the front of his mouth, one etched with a crown, the other with a star. He said they each cost him $40. But he said he would follow Mr. Mickens's order.
''I've had these for four or five months, since school started,'' Michael said. ''I like gold, period. It's better than silver or anything else. My parents say in some ways gold brings a lot of trouble because people try to rob you.''
A freshman, Ebony Black, 14, said the issue was more one of safety than image. She said ''a lot of people are wondering where you got the money to pay for them. A lot of people think you have to be a drug dealer or something to get them, but you don't.''
Tyrone Johnson, a 17-year-old senior, said he thought many younger students failed to understand that in the mostly white society outside Bedford-Stuyvesant gold teeth are associated with a lack of education or an unwholesome life style.
''People don't take you as seriously,'' said Mr. Johnson, an honors students who has applied to three Ivy League schools. ''They think you're a joke.''
Erskine Tillery, a 16-year-old sophmore, said he would reluctantly give up the two gold caps on his front teeth because he will probably be safer from gold thieves.
He said solemnly, ''People will shoot you if they don't come out.''

HEADLINE: O'Neill's Budget Proposes Job Cuts and Borrowing

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Gov. William A. O'Neill proposed a stringent state budget today that would eliminate 2,000 jobs and borrow against reserve funds, but would not raise taxes.
The $7.2 billion budget, which Mr. O'Neill outlined to the General Assembly in a sometimes emotional speech that was widely seen as the opening salvo of his re-election campaign, would also pare about $600 million in spending at state agencies.
In addition the Governor held down the size of the budget by shifting hundreds of millions of dollars for expenses like housing assistance from the state's main account, the General Fund, to specialized funds that are not calculated as part of the budget.
 
Economic Gains Expected
The budget also is based on expected improvement in Connecticut's lagging economy. It predicts that revenue from the state's 8 percent sales tax will increase 5 percent in the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
Mr. O'Neill said that the employment cuts would be felt in longer lines for things like motor vehicle registration but that basic state commitments - especially aid to cities and towns - would remain intact.
Mr. O'Neill's Republican opponents in the legislature immediately attacked the shifts of budget accounts as a fraud that would would mask deeper budget problems and come back to haunt Connecticut as those special accounts were depleted.
 
'A Shell Game at Best'
''It's a shell game at best,'' said the State Republican Party chairman, Dick Foley.
Mr. O'Neill, who was presenting his 10th budget since taking office in 1980, told the packed audience of lawmakers, lobbyists and visitors in the ornate Hall of the House of Representatives that the budget was an honest one and that hard times had demanded choices.
Repeatedly rousing his audience with a shouted charge - ''Stand up for Connecticut!'' - Mr. O'Neill defended the budget transfers and said that shifted funds, while not counted in the budget total, were not being used inappropriately.
''In these difficult times, our budget must meet complex and sometimes conflicting demands,'' he said.
The dispute, on the opening day of the General Assembly session, resulted into two sharply differing accounts about exactly how much spending would grow in the fiscal year that begins July 1. Mr. O'Neill and other Democrats who control the Assembly said 4.5 percent - the lowest spending growth in 15 years. Republicans, calculating the off-budget shifts, said 8.9 percent.
For both groups, the analysis focused on what in Connecticut politics is one of the more sacred and explosive spending categories - aid to cities and towns. In Mr. O'Neill's budget, a special $215 million property tax relief fund, created in 1985 and scheduled under current law to be distributed to municipalities over 10 years, would essentially be drained to keep the present local grants intact.
The annual distribution of $42 million would be increased by $140 million primarily by mixing in budget items that are currently paid to the towns from the General Fund. Payments, for example, to compensate municipalities for loss of revenue on such tax-exempt properties as hospitals would be paid from the property tax fund.
 
Future Prospects Uncertain
''There's no magic - the budget would have been cut had we not had the resources of that fund,'' said Anthony V. Milano, the secretary of the Office of Policy and Management and Mr. O'Neill's chief budget officer. Asked whether using most of the relief fund this year would threaten the long-term promises to the towns, Mr. Milano said it could not yet be determined.
''These choices have to be made on an annual basis,'' he said of the local aid grants.
In addition to the property fund changes, three regulatory agencies that were formerly financed from the General Fund - the Hospitals and Health Care Commission, the Liquor Control Departnent Commission and the Worker's Compensation Commission, with combined budgets of about $8 million - would be removed from the General Fund under Mr. O'Neill's plan. Those agencies would finance their operations by requiring those it regulates to pay ''assessments.''
 
Borrowing and Bond Sales
A third category concerned budget items formerly in the General Fund that would instead be covered by borrowing and bond sales. About $65 million of those shifts were proposed in the budget, including $35 million for local school construction.
According to Gordon J. Frasinelli, the executive budget officer at the Office of Policy and Management, about half of all the state agencies and commissions in the state will get the same or less money this coming year than they did last year.
The winners, he said, include the Department of Correction, which is responsible for overseeing the state's huge prison expansion. Its appropriation will increase about 20 percent, to $420 million.
The Department of Income Maintenance, which distributes Medicaid payments and aid to the poor - and which has seen its own internal budget depleted by rising medical and welfare costs - will get an 11 percent increase to $1.7 billion. Still, the total is $100 million less than the department had requested.

HEADLINE: Man Suspected in 4 Slayings Dies in Shootout With Police

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DRYDEN, N.Y., Feb. 7

 BODY:
A man suspected of killing a family of four in their home in December was killed today in a shootout with state troopers. The man's mother was arrested and charged with murder in connection with the slayings.
The state police Superintendent, Thomas Constantine, identified the dead man as Anthony Turner, 33 years old. 
Mr. Turner's mother, 54-year-old Shirley Kinge, was arraigned tonight in Town Court in Dryden, a suburb of Ithaca, on four counts of second-degree murder and one count each of arson and criminal possession of stolen property. Town Justice Edwin Sweetland ordered her held without bail.
Mr. Turner's 2-year-old child was turned over to social workers by state troopers.
Superintendent Constantine said at a news conference this afternoon that Mr. Turner was sitting on a bed in his apartment holding a shotgun to his chin when the authorities entered the room.
The suspect turned toward the troopers and fired a single shot, Mr. Constantine said. The three troopers then returned the gunfire, he said.
The Superintendent said an autopsy was planned to determine whether Mr. Turner killed himself or was killed by the shots fired by the police.
 
Suspected for Week
The authorities carried a warrant charging Mr. Turner - also known as Michael Kinge - with four counts of second-degree murder in the Dec. 22, 1989, slayings of Warren Harris, 39; his wife, Dolores, 41, and their children, Shelby, 15, and Marc, 11, during an apparent robbery.
The state police said Mr. Turner had been a suspect for about a week, and neighbors said his apartment had been staked out since Friday. Mr. Turner, an unemployed maintenance worker, had a long criminal history in New York City, including convictions for burglary and theft with a deadly weapon.
 
Threat From Turner
After an arrest in 1982, he said he regretted that he did not ''shoot it out'' with the arresting officer, Superintendent Constantine said.
Superintendent Constantine said Mr. Turner might have known that he had become the focus of the Harris investigation. An unidentified associate of Mr. Turner told the police that Mr. Turner always had firearms with him and would shoot it out with the police if they tried to arrest him for the Harris murders and would kill as many officers as possible, the Superintendent said.
Maj. Robert J. Farrand said there were no other suspects at this time, although the investigation is continuing.
In December, the Harrises were tied up, shot in the back of the head and hours later doused with fuel and set afire in upstairs bedrooms at their home on a large wooded lot.
The bodies were discovered the next day as firefighters responded to a report of a fire at the Harris house.
 
Shot in Head
The police have said robbery appears the most likely motive for the killings. Mrs. Harris ran a country gift and antique store just a few yards from the house. Her husband was a sales director for an electronics distributor.
Three of the family members were found in one room, bound hand and foot and with pillowcases over their heads, Superintendent Constantine said. They had each been shot in the back of the head with a .22-caliber weapon.
Shelby Harris was found in a second bedroom. The police said she had been sexually assaulted and shot in the head.
On the day that the bodies were found, a man and woman used the Harrises' credit cards to buy clothing, electronics and diamonds at malls in suburban Syracuse and Auburn.
Clerks at those stores helped a police artist draw sketches of the people who used the cards.

HEADLINE: Speech Invitation Divides Columbia

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Richard Griffin, who appears with the rap group Public Enemy as Professor Griff, is scheduled to deliver a speech at Columbia University next week. The invitation, from the Black Students Organization at Columbia, has upset other student groups, including Jewish organizations, because of anti-Semitic remarks he made last year.
No one has publicly demanded the cancellation of his talk, scheduled for Sunday evening in the Altschul Auditorium at the School of International Affairs. The leaders of the Black Students Organization said they had asked Mr. Griffin to speak on education in the year 2000, not his remarks about Jews. 
The student group issued the invitation because, it said, it considered Mr. Griffin an important force in black America. Members of the group maintain that they can sponsor his appearance whether or not they endorse his beliefs.
Mr. Griffin said yesterday that the remarks that sparked the controversy, which he made in an interview with The Washington Times, were taken out of their full context. ''If you look into the root meaning of the term,'' he said, ''a black man in America can never be anti-Semitic.''
But some students and administrators at Columbia contend that student funds, made available to the organization for Black History Month, should not be used to underwrite his appearance.
''Inviting him here was a mistake, and appropriating the money was a mistake,'' said the dean of Columbia College, Jack Greenberg. ''But it would be a bigger mistake to withdraw the money now. I don't think he should be thrown off campus. The best way to handle this is just leave him alone.''
 
Rule on Speech Cited
A student group that promotes campus events, the Board of Managers, withdrew $1,000 it had pledged for the Black Students Organization's programs this month. Leaders of the board said they set aside the money after the black students' group had told them about a speech by the writer Maya Angelou. The umbrella group said the black students did not tell them about Mr. Griffin until last week.
''Columbia has a disciplinary statute saying any speech that denigrates another because of race, religion or sexual orientation will be dealt with in the most severe manner,'' said the president of the Board of Managers, David Mlodinoff. ''I thought co-sponsorship of Griff would make me partially responsible.''
Another group, the Columbia College Student Council, decided on Monday not to rescind $9,000 that it had earmarked for the Black Students Organiation and the black history observances.
Mr. Griffin was billed as Public Enemy's ''minister of information'' last May when The Washington Times quoted him as saying that Jews were responsible for ''the majority of wickedness that goes on across the globe.''
Asked in a telephone interview last night what he had meant, Mr. Griffin said: ''There is wickedness that goes on across the globe. Certain atrocities done to black people, yes, Jews had hands in it and black Africans, they had their hands in it. Not only Jews but Gentiles, kings and queens.'' He said he was referring to ''the enslavement and the dehumanization of the black man and woman in America'' and to a Public Health Service program at the Tuskegee Institute that, from 1932 to 1972, withheld treament from syphilitic men. The purpose was to determine the natural course of the disease, regardless of the human cost.
Soon after the interview was published, the songwriter and main rapper for the group, Carlton Ridenhour, known as Chuck D, dismissed Mr. Griffin and announced that Public Enemy was disbanding.
 
'Speaking to His Own People'
''Griff is not anti-Semitic,'' Mr. Ridenhour said at the time. ''He hangs out with Falasha Jews from Ethiopia damn near every other month. His beef was with Israel and its involvement in South Africa, which hurts his people, black people. But you don't blame Jews for Israel. So I made him apologize, and he was demoted. Now he's speaking to his own people instead of the world.''
Public Enemy began appearing together again a few months later, and Mr. Griffin was given a different role, as the group's liaison aide to black neighborhoods and youth programs.
It was Public Enemy that performed ''Fight the Power'' in ''Do the Right Thing,'' the Spike Lee film. The song called Elvis Presley a racist.
More recently, Mr. Griffin has opened the group's shows by strutting in front of a ''security force,'' part of the group's retinue, in mock-military maneuvers. On Jan. 1, Mr. Griffin's routine included a speech in which he said that the AIDS epidemic had been propogated as an experiment by Moscow and Washington.
At Columbia, leaders of the Black Students Organization have defended their choice of Mr. Griffin as a speaker, saying that he and Public Enemy have a wide following.
''He's coming here to speak on education in the year 2000, about the black community to the black community, and we want to hear him on that,'' said the president of the group, Alethia Jones, a junior from Brooklyn. ''What the Board of Managers is doing is trying to exercise economic power over us, which is not fair and not justified.''
When asked whether the black students' organization approved of Mr. Griffin's comments about Jews, the chairman of the group's political committee, Hector Carter, told a student newspaper, The Federalist Paper: ''The B.S.O. is neutral on that. We want to hear what the man has to say. We're not saying, 'Yes, he's right,' or, 'No, he's wrong.' ''
Mr. Griffin said last night that he was willing to meet with Board of Managers officers. ''I have to break up the old relationship between blacks and Jews,'' he said. ''No more master and slave relationship, no more landlord and tenant, no more employee-employer relationship. We are mature. It's 1990 and we should get together at the bargaining table.''
The offer came three days after Jewish groups on campus met to plan a response to Mr. Griffin's appearance. More than 400 students jammed an auditorium in the basement of Butler Library, and 200 others waited outside.
 
Boycott Proposal From Dean
At the meeting, Dean Greenberg proposed that students boycott Mr. Griffin's speech. Then - after a member of the black students' group, Maurice Coleman, urged everyone to go to see Mr. Griffin for themselves - 100 members of the Black Students Organization filed out of the room. The Jewish chaplain at Columbia, Rabbi Charles Sheer, followed them into the corridor and urged them to return. But they did not.
Since then, three petitions protesting the speech have been drawn up, one by the Council of Jewish Organizations, one by the senior class and one by another group of students. More than 1,200 people have signed the Jewish organization's petition, and the group plans to run it as an advertisement in another campus newspaper, The Columbia Daily Spectator.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Is Sending Signals He Won't Run for Governor

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y., Feb. 7

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani is sending strong signals that he will not be a Republican candidate for governor this year, even though he has started a traditional campaign warm-up: a series of speaking engagements throughout New York State.
''I'm not closing the door but I don't want to hold out any great hope that I will be running,'' Mr. Giuliani told editors at The Buffalo News on Tuesday.
And as he flew into the Buffalo area earlier in the day, he said in an interview: ''I've told Republican leaders that they should try to develop other candidates. I can't make a commitment to run as a full-time candidate now.'' 
Mr. Giuliani's words were backed by actions suitable for a politician who wants to keep his political prospects alive - possibly for a Senate candidacy in 1992 - without challenging one of the strongest Democrats in the country, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is expected to seek a third term.
 
'Vision of America'
Some Republicans had said Mr. Giuliani would deliver a speech highly critical of the Governor on Tuesday night at the annual Erie County Republican Dinner here. Republican State Committee researchers had provided him with five pages of economic statistics to use to attack Mr. Cuomo.
But after Mr. Giuliani's advisers told him that such a critical speech would be inappropriate for a noncandidate, he discarded the material, delivering instead a mild 30-minute address on what he called his ''vision of America and vision of New York in the year 2000.'' The speech drew applause from the 500 Republicans in attendance only once.
Mr. Giuliani's advisers say challenging Mr. Cuomo would be an enormous risk, and they concede that a defeat in the gubernatorial race so soon after Mr. Giuliani's unsuccessful mayoral campaign in New York City last year would probably end his brief electoral career. His campaign against David N. Dinkins was his first.
Mr. Giuliani has scheduled about 12 appearances outside New York City in the next six weeks. He said the purpose of the speaking tour was to help the Republican Party raise money and to ''develop a relationship with the party, learn issues and meet people.'' He said he would make a final decision on a gubernatorial candidacy after these appearances.
 
Would Need Bush's Help
If he were to run for governor, Mr. Giuliani said, he would need $10 million to $15 million, a huge sum that his advisers said could be raised only with the all-out help of President Bush, who would then be putting his own political credits on the line. The rationale for Mr. Bush's intervention would be to hobble Mr. Cuomo as a potential Presidential candidate in 1992.
The Republican State Committee, in its latest financial accounting reported last month, said it had less than $5,000 in its treasury despite the efforts of its new chairman, J. Patrick Barrett, a multimillionaire who has donated more than $100,000 of his own money to the committee.
Mr. Barrett said that he had a $6 million fund-raising goal this year but that the money would be used for operating costs and State Senate campaigns and only partly for the gubernatorial candidate.
Of Mr. Giuliani's gubernatorial intentions, Mr. Barrett, who did not attend the Republican gathering here, said in a telephone interview, ''I really don't know what Rudy thinks.'' But he said Mr. Giuliani was not following his advice that an early decision be made.
 
Congressman a Possibility
Mr. Barrett said he was looking to other candidates but named only one, Representative Bill Green of Manhattan, whose East Side district may be merged with that of Representative Ted Weiss of the West Side in the redrawing of Congressional district lines next year.
Mr. Barrett said another potential candidate, State Senator Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan, was ''kind of untouchable because he's in the State Senate.'' Republicans are fearful of losing their last stronghold in the state, control of the Senate.
Another handicap for Mr. Giuliani is that he has apparently not resolved the problem of how a Republican who accepted the Liberal Party's endorsement, as he did in his mayoral campaign, and still counts the Liberal Party leader, Raymond B. Harding, as one of his confidants, can move rightward this year to be acceptable to the Conservative Party. He acknowledged that a Republican usually needs Conservative support to win a statewide contest.
The Conservative Party state chairman, Michael Long, said Mr. Giuliani's Liberal ties are ''a major hurdle.''

HEADLINE: Other Furnishers Aren't Smiling

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
FROM all the talk of nesting and cocooning, one would think that the golden era of the home has arrived. Americans supposedly have given up their wild times on the town to eat take-out food in front of the television, ensconced in comfortable couches, feet solidly on the coffee table.
But it has not turned out that way. There is no boom in the home furnishings business. Companies like the Ralph Lauren Home Collection, whose sales rose 19 percent from 1988 to 1989, are the exception rather than the rule. 
The number of pieces of furniture sold in the United States last year fell by 1.5 percent from 1988, according to the American Association of Furniture Manufacturers. Other areas of the home furnishings industry, like appliances and carpeting, report that sales are down, flat or up only slightly. The percentage of income spent on furniture has fluctuated slightly but remained essentially flat, at roughly 1 percent of income, through the 1980's.
''The industry isn't faring well,'' said Donald A. Belgrad, president of Schnadig Corporation, a Chicago-based company that makes tables and upholstered furniture. ''You see all the electronics and maybe some futons on the floor.''
Jeffrey St. Clair, who studies trends for Retail Planning Associates in Columbus, Ohio, recently conducted in-depth market-research interviews with affluent consumers in the Washington area. He found that most wanted to spend their money creating interesting lives for themselves and their children, on things like entertainment and vacations.
''Feathering the nest,'' he said, ''did not come out as strongly as enriching their lives. They want to consume experiences.''
To help redirect their consumption, a new consortium of furniture makers, the Home Furnishings Council, will soon start an advertising campaign, with a first-year budget of about $7 million, that will try to stimulate home purchases by linking them to the quality of family life. The council plans to use the slogan, ''It All Begins at Home.''
Industry experts blame the current economic climate for disappointing sales. ''Consumers are bracing for a recession,'' said Wallace W. Epperson Jr., who studies the home furnishings market for Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. Personal savings are up, he said, and consumer debt is dropping.
A soft market for new-home construction may be hurting the sales of larger items. Unit sales of dishwashers, refrigerators and stoves are all expected to have fallen in 1989 when final figures are in, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in Chicago.
Those who are buying are decorating slowly because their basic housing costs are taking more of their income. ''You're seeing families furnish over a period of three or four years rather than in the first six months,'' said Greg Silverman, who studies home furnishings for Management Horizons in Dublin, Ohio, consultants to retailers.
Some companies, of course, are doing well, usually because they have clearly defined their style and simplified the decision-making process for the consumer. Often, they help consumers hurdle mental obstacles by making furniture available immediately and displaying it in room settings that make it easy to visualize the decorating possibilities.
IKEA, the large Swedish retailer, saw its sales in the United States grow 40 percent last year. Its four American stores offer a wide range of well-designed modern home furnishings for very low prices, yet are perceived as offering quality. Items are sold individually, but whole rooms are also displayed with a total pricetag. Merchandise, much of it ready-to-assemble, is sold warehouse style and can be carried out of the store.
This spring, IKEA U.S. Inc., which has stores in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, is opening a 270,000 square-foot-store in Elizabeth, N.J., that will be its largest outside of Scandinavia.
Another thriving company that offers reasonably priced items perceived to offer quality is the Bombay Company, which sells reproductions of English antiques. The company's sales grew 49 percent from 1988 to 1989, and it added 52 stores in that time, for a total of 215.
While consumers like to see room displays, they also want to express individuality.
''For our parents, the concept of what was in and what was out was very important,'' said Raymond Chevallier, the 39-year-old vice president of marketing at F. Schumacher & Co. in New York, which sells expensive home textiles. ''There were very strong trends in color. Our generation is much less prone to lock step. Somebody can go to Conran's, and then specify a Schumacher damask.''
Generally, accessories are selling better than big-ticket items. Robert McElroy, manager for home furnishings at Bloomingdale's in New York, said sales of bed sheets costing more than $50 apiece have been exceptional. ''People do not balk at the price,'' he said. ''If they've got the money, they don't mind spending it.''
Sales of home textiles, a $14 billion market that includes things like curtains, drapes, towels and mattress pads, were up 2.9 percent in 1989 from 1988. But this growth was far below the previous year's increase of 7.1 percent, according to HFD, a weekly home furnishings newspaper in New York.
In all categories, Mr. McElroy said, consumers want products that will last. They are buying top-of-the-line sheets from Fieldcrest and Cannon, the Ralph Lauren Line, Christian Dior china and glasses, and crystal from Lalique, Baccarat and Waterford. For the kitchen, he said, they are buying well-known, professional-quality items like Cuisinart, Calphalon and All-Clad.
While many companies have been disappointed by recent sales, industry executives are confident that the maturing baby-boom generation will buy home furnishings in the 1990's.
''The consciousness of millions of people is being directed to the importance of the home,'' said Nathan S. Ancell, the founder and chairman emeritus of Ethan Allen, the big furniture maker with 300 stores. ''The interest in fixing up the home is going to substantially increase.''

HEADLINE: Robots Transform Coal Mining

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WANA, W.Va.

 BODY:
The four-inch carbide-steel claws of a screaming yellow robot tore relentlessly at the coal seam 1,000 feet below the surface, digging enough in 30 seconds to meet the electric needs of a typical suburban house for a year.
The robot's human master, old enough to remember when miners used picks and shovels and loaded coal into carts drawn by dogs, strolled beside, periodically pushing buttons on support equipment.
Coal mining, an unglamorous business known mostly for accidents and bitter strikes, is going high tech, and the resulting productivity gains are important for a nation that is using up its other fossil fuels.
The country's deposits of coal are expected to last more than a century, while oil reserves will last only 10 years at current rates of production, assuming no more oil is found. Gas reserves are also more limited than coal supplies. As oil and gas are used up, finding and extracting them become more expensive; by contrast, because of technical advances like the robot, the cost of digging coal is falling. Thus, over the long term, the price gap between coal and oil and gas will probably grow, and coal could become an even more important energy resource. 
 
A New Mining Method
The robot here, in the Consolidation Coal Company's Blacksville No. 2 mine, 700 to 1,400 feet under the Mason-Dixon line, is perhaps the most advanced in the country. It is but one recent improvement in a highly automated technique called longwall mining, in which coal is removed not by tunneling like a worm through an apple, leaving more of the target than is removed, but by methodically shuttling back and forth across the width of the deposit and devouring nearly everything.
Longwall mining has been around for decades but mine operators have recently made the technique far more efficient. The method can now extract about 75 percent of the available coal, compared with 50 percent for conventional mining, which is done largely with machines that dig tunnels. Moreover, the coal can be recovered far more inexpensively.
While coal has been hailed as the nation's energy savior since the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the cost of oil has not risen enough to make coal a good substitute beyond the power plant, where it is burned to produce electricity. Cutting the cost of coal production is a small step toward wider use. When costs justify it, coal can even substitute for gasoline.
 
Extensive Deposits
Already, coal is the nation's biggest indigenous energy source, and its role has been growing. It supplied more than 23.4 percent of all energy consumed in this country, up from 17.5 percent in 1973, the year of the first oil shock, and 19.1 percent in 1979. And it accounted for nearly one-third of all energy produced in this country last year, up from 22.5 percent in 1973. It is the main fuel used to make electricity, providing about 56 percent, and is also the nation's largest energy export by far.
But increased production of coal also raises intense environmental questions. The issues range from the speculative - like the extent of global warming caused by the burning of carbon-rich fuels like coal - to the spooky, like the collapse of land as robot miners pass beneath. The Government is spending more than $5 billion to find cleaner ways to use coal, and the coal companies have tried harder to ameliorate the effects of the collapse, called ''subsidence.''
Longwall mining is used wherever coal is present in thick, level seams deep under the ground. (Shallow deposits are often exploited by strip mining, in which the surface layers are scraped away and the coal is excavated from an open pit.) Embracing new technologies and sometimes developing technology on its own, Consolidation Coal, a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, last year mined 55 million tons with 9,500 employees. Fifteen years earlier it took 23,000 workers to mine 55 million tons. A big part of the change was installing 22 longwall machines like the robot here.
Despite the loss of employment, the United Mine Workers union generally favors longwall mines. ''Back in the 1950's, John L. Lewis said it would be far better to have highly productive oprations that were able to pay our folks good wages and benefits than to have 600,000 shovelers living in poverty,'' said John Duray, a spokesman for the union.
 
Called Safer
Union officials say longwall mines are also inherently safer in their design, and the mines that can afford them are generally the bigger, better-managed ones.
Consol, as the company that operates this mine is known, is by far the biggest longwall operator.
In the longwall system at Blacksville 2, miners dig a tunnel the height of the coal seam, and in it they set up a row of floor-to-ceiling steel brackets to hold up the rock and soil above. Sheltered by the shields, the miners install a robot that runs back and forth on a track across the 750-foot-long wall of coal on the open side of the bracket. On each pass, a wheel 4 feet in diameter, studded with claws, chews up the coal in a space extending 3 feet high and 30 inches in front of it. The coal falls to a conveyor belt. At the end of the wall, the robot miner, called a shearer, reverses direction and makes a pass just below the first.
When the shearer has finished its second pass, devouring almost all of the six-foot height of the coal seam here, it moves 30 inches forward and starts again. Then, in a sequence worthy of a grade-B science fiction film, each of the 153 steel shields in the row takes it turn stepping forward into the space that the shearer just opened, to be in position for the shearer's next pass. As they step forward, the earth behind them collapses.
The longwall moves forward 17 to 20 feet per eight-hour shift, two or three shifts a day, until it has covered about a mile, over many months. Then, in a few hours, the equipment is moved to another track 750 feet long, and starts work again.
 
Fierce Competition
The process can help coal companies achieve enormous efficiencies. Competition among coal producers is vicious, and executives at Consol say they plan to meet it by increasing productivity 3 to 6 percent annually.
Setting up a modern mine can cost $100 million, and the chance of making a killing is very small. Unlike the price of oil, the price of coal has been fairly stable since the early 80's and is not likely to go anywhere soon; when inflation is taken into account, the price of coal is down by 44 percent since 1975.
The price varies according to the sulfur content and energy content of the coal. In September, the amount of coal required to make a kilowatt-hour of electricity cost only 54 percent as much as the oil needed for the same job, according to the National Coal Association.
Blacksville has two of Consol's 20 longwall machines. There are only about 100 longwall systems running in the 2,000 underground coal mines in the United States, but they produce about one-third the coal that comes from such mines, and some experts think that figure will rise to more than half by the end of the 90's.
About a third of the nation's coal comes from surface mining, mostly in the West. The other third comes from underground mines that use older technologies, either because their owners cannot afford longwall machines or because the coal deposits are unsuitable for them.
 
Further Refinements
Engineers are now working on additional refinements to longwall mining. For example, operators of the Blacksville 2 mine hope that even pushing the buttons to make the 153 shields step forward - now done by a human - will soon be taken over by the robot's computer brain.
Workers at this mine do not believe that this refinement will cut payrolls further because someone will be needed to watch the robots. At other mines, however, the prospect of installing a longwall machine brings dread because of the layoffs that will come with it.
High-tech changes are taking place at the surface, too. In a small factory at the mouth of the mine, the coal is washed in water and other liquids, removing some of the sulfur; it is then dried, crushed and sorted by size. Sometimes it is blended with coal from other mines.

HEADLINE: Bank Tests Its Formula in Texas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When John B. McCoy, chairman of the Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio, talks about himself, he is apt to make self-effacing comments about how he has never (''well, hardly ever'') made a loan and how he was slow to see the opportunities of expanding into Texas.
But Mr. McCoy's modest descriptions of his abilities contain clues about how he helped lead Banc One to become one of the most successful banks in the country. By concentrating on consumer banking and lending to small businesses, as well innovatively applying computer technology, the company has produced 21 consecutive years of rising profits.
Enlarged by last week's acquistion of the Bright Savings Association in Dallas and last June's purchase of 20 banks formerly owned by MCorp of Austin, Tex., Banc One is now the nation's 13th-largest banking company. But it is entirely within Mr. McCoy's character that Banc One was not the first or most agressive bank-holding company to go after foundering institutions in Texas. 
 
'No Large Loans'
Mr. McCoy's lack of ambition to make a mark as a hot-shot lender with the fanciest deals for the largest clients has spared Banc One the troubles that other bankers have found in giving large loans to third world countries, real estate developers or to finance leveraged buyouts. ''We have no large loans,'' Mr. McCoy said, ''because any loan above $50 million has to be signed by me, and I don't make loans.''
When other Banc One executives suggested two years ago that there were opportunites in Texas, Mr. McCoy says he told them: ''We don't want to look in Texas. It just doesn't make sense.'' Eventually he agreed that ''looking is cheap.''
By the time he was convinced to buy the MCorp units, other banks, like the Chemical Banking Corporation and the First Interstate Bancorp, had already bought major Texas banks with many bad loans on unfavorable terms that have caused large losses at both companies.
These episodes should not suggest that Mr. McCoy is an overly cautious banker: He is merely one who has found a formula and is loath to abandon it. By sticking to what it does best, Banc One has consistenly earned far more profit per dollar of assets than other banks its size.
 
Some Unsuccessful Ventures
Not all Banc One's ventures have been successful. A 1979 attempt to develop in-home banking was a failure, as was an earlier program to install machines in grocery stores to verify customers' checks using their credit cards. But there were also successes, like its arrangement in 1977 to process Cash Management Accounts for Merrill Lynch & Company. This eventually led Banc One to become a major processor of credit card transactions for dozens of other banks and credit unions.
With the 100 new branches in Texas, however, it will be back to basics.
''Our plan in Texas is to develop the same retail banking that has worked so well in other states,'' Mr. McCoy said. ''There is a huge displacement of customers in Texas from savings and loans to banks. It's a market where consumers are not used to banking products that have been available in other parts of the country.''
Mr. McCoy sees no reason why MCorp's business-loan-oriented banks cannot learn to be consumer banks under Banc One. To speed the process, he is supporting legislation that would amend a Texas law to allow home-equity lending.
The Texas acquistion is the latest in a long string that has helped Banc One grow, even though Ohio is a slow-growth ''Rust Belt'' state with a declining population. Banc One is the parent company for more than 50 subsidiary banks, identified in signs as Bank One. The parent's name is spelled with a ''c'' because Ohio law limits the use of the word bank.
For many years, the acquisitions were limited to small, profitable banks in Ohio. While they did not mushroom in size, they almost inevitably became more profitable under Banc One. With the hiring in 1984 of William P. Boardman, a tall, silver-haired lawyer who handles acquisitons without guidance from high-priced investment bankers from Wall Street, the expansion accelerated outside Ohio.
 
Move Into Indiana
In 1986, Banc One bought the American Fletcher Corporation, the second-largest banking company in Indiana, with $4.1 billion in assets. In 1988, it bought the Marine Corporation, based in Milwaukee, with $4.3 billion in deposits. Just as it did with smaller banks, Banc One has improved profits at those banks by cutting costs and focusing more on small, high-interest-rate loans.
The Indiana bank, for example, had a reputation as a solid, profitable lender to businesses and had a client list of large companies. Its former chairman, Frank E. McKinney Jr., now president of Banc One, thought there was little chance of earning about $1.06 for every $100 of assets after the acquistion. But by 1988, two years later, Bank One Indiana was earning $1.59 for every $100 of assets.
While Banc One leaves decision-making in the hands of local banks, it handles many of their affairs where economies of scale make them suitable for centralization. Securities investments, for example, are handled in Columbus, while the Indiana bank handles processing of home mortgages. The contribution of the Texas bank may be as a corporate cash-management system.
 
A Booster of Texas
Mr. McCoy, 46 years old, whose father and grandfather were chairmen of Banc One or its predecessors, is too committed to civic improvements in his hometown of Columbus to denigrate Ohio. But he has become a booster of the Lone Star State, well aware that Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston combined are about equal to the entire Ohio banking market.
He also knows that MCorp was weakened in its fight for survival in the flagging economy of the oil state. For example, it had sold its credit card business, a key part of Banc One's business in other states, and had eliminated the division that maintained and built branch offices - another ingredient to successful expansion in the consumer market.
''We have no retail distribution network, no retail sales force and no retail products,'' George Meiling, Banc One's treasurer, said soon after the announcement of the MCorp acquisiton last year. ''Other than that, Texas is just great.''
But within hours after signing the MCorp deal, Mr. McCoy was talking about re-entering abandoned markets. A mass mailing offering credit cards to customers started within weeks and attracted responses from nearly 10 percent of the bank's customers.
 
Extraordinary Cost Savings
And while it is developing a consumer banking business, Banc One is benefiting from some extraordinary cost savings achieved by taking advantage of the ability to renegotiate terms of earlier MCorp contracts.
For example, Banc One renegoiated the lease of the Austin headquarters to $13 a square foot annually for 200,000 square feet, down from 690,000 square feet at $30 a foot. The contract with EDS Inc. to process savings, checking and other transactions was renegotiated to an annual cost of about $35 million, from $70 million under MCorp.
Banc One's vaunted system of financial management starts with the assumption, Mr. McCoy said, ''that everybody is bright and smart, but they just sometimes don't know what to do.'' While the central office in Columbus assiduously keeps its hands off the day-to-day decision-making at its subsidiary banks, it insists on prying into every detail of their financial performance.
Four times a month, every bank prepares forecasts for 12 months ahead. ''By the third day of the following month, we can spot deviations from the forecast,'' Mr. McCoy said.
Because every bank is required to follow the same definitions for expenses and revenues, the monthly figures are readily comparable. And the comparisons are not just for central office officials; executives at the individual banks are encouraged to share information with their colleagues.
''Lots of banks compare themselves with their peer group,'' said J. Douglas Adamson, former head of consumer banking at Bank One in Lafayette, Ind., and now director of the Bank Marketing Association, a trade group. ''But at Banc One, the peers are part of an exchange group, not competitors.''
 
Bankers Given 'Sisters'
To speed the learning process at the Texas bank - which Banc One expects eventually to divide into about 20 smaller banks - Texas bankers in various cities are being paired with a ''sister'' bank in the Midwest. At the top of the Texas bank, Thomas E. Hoaglin, president and an alumnus of Bank One of Dayton, Ohio, has been paired with Harvey R. Mitchell, chief executive officer, a veteran Texas banker who was previously vice chairman at the First Republicbank Corporation, Dallas.
But even with the example of Banc One's Midwestern success, James J. McDermott, a senior vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a securities firm, warned that ''Texas will be the acid test.'' He said that, while Banc One ''comes from a competitive market in the Midwest, in Texas they are playing in the major leagues.''
Mr. McDermott noted that banks like the NCNB Corporation, which bought First Republicbank, and Chemical, which owns the Texas Commerce Bank, are very strong in the same retail banking business that has been Banc One's specialty but are still having problems.
In fact, moves by NCNB and Chemical so far show that they have much the same idea as Banc One - exploit the retail banking market by attracting deposits and making smaller loans while waiting for the rest of state's economy to improve.
Can Banc One be as successful in Texas as it has been in the Midwest? Many analysts and investors had their doubts when the acquisitions were made in Indiana and Wisconsin and when Banc One's stock price weakened. But its earnings since have made believers out of skeptics.
Banc One's stock price has fallen in recent months, like other banks', and probably is suffering because investors expect the company to pay for the Texas acquisitions by selling up to $200 million of new stock. Even so, the share price of around $30 is about 11 times its 1989 per share earnings, the highest of the 15 largest banking companies in the country.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
10-Year U.S. Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A better-than-expected turnout at the Treasury's quarterly auction of 10-year notes spurred a sharp turnaround in the credit markets yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities moved off their lows and closed higher for the day.
The Treasury received $23.9 billion in bids for the $10 billion in notes sold yesterday. That was the highest total on a 10-year note auction since the auction on Nov. 9, 1988.
Still, the welcome accorded the notes was not so strong as the bidding for the $10 billion of three-year notes offered Tuesday. Then, the Treasury received more than $34 billion in bids. 
 
Sharply Higher Yields
At yesterday's auction, the notes were sold at an average yield of 8.59 percent, up sharply from the average rate of 7.94 percent at the last 10-year note sale on Nov. 13. It is the highest yield on a 10-year issue since the May 10, 1989 sale, when bids on the securities produced an average yield of 9.18 percent.
After the Treasury announced the results of the auction the notes rallied, and by late yesterday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.50 percent.
''Everybody was so mesmerized with fear that they bid with a great deal of caution,'' said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. ''Those cautious bids helped to allow the auction to go well.''
Traders said the bidding process was helped by big accounts that sold mortgage-backed securities to buy the new notes, by the Japanese and by individual investors. Still, traders estimated that about 30 percent of the issue remains on the books of primary dealers.
 
Participation of Japanese
Japanese firms are believed to have accounted for 20 to 25 percent of yesterday's auction, after taking an estimated 35 percent of the $10 billion auctioned on Tuesday.
Anxiety about who would buy the new notes - and at what price - was high before the 1 P.M. start of the auction.
Part of the worry stemmed from a big rise in yields on 10-year West German bonds, which moved above 8 percent for the first time since 1984 after Bonn said it intended speed the unification with East Germany by moving rapidly to create a single German currency.
Worries that rising foreign interest rates would siphon money from the Treasury auctions have been prevalent for weeks. But those concerns abated somewhat yesterday.
More impressive than the total ofbids, some analysts said, was the size of the non-competitive bid. In such a bid, the bidder offers to take the issue at whatever price and interest rate the average bid produces.
Individual investors and smaller commercial banks placed $565 million worth of non-competitive bids for the issue, the highest total in more than four years.
''The non-competitive bid is a good barometer for domestic demand,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at the Nikko Securities Company International. ''That sort of interest generally surfaces at the end of bear markets, not in the middle of one.''
 
Chances for Today's Sale
Mr. Brusca said the reappearance of domestic investors gives today's auction of $10 billion worth of 30-year bonds ''the chance of being a pretty good one.''
Moreover, he said, ''since Japanese interest was fairly light at the 10-year, and the yen is stable, we could see much better interest from the Japanese.''
But others were not so sanguine. With a big rise in the Producer Price Index for January expected to be announced on Friday, some dealers said they did not expect demand for the new bonds to be strong.
''Whatever the Japanese don't take, the Street will be forced to hold,'' one government-bond trader said.
Late yesterday the bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.50 percent.
On Tuesday a widely held view on Wall Street was that Japanese participation at the 30-year auction would be limited unless the bonds were yielding around 8 5/8 percent. Based on yesterday's price movements, reaching that level now seems unlikely, analysts said.
 
Secondary Market Turns
The auction results prompted a quick turnaround in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 95 17/32, up 13/32, to yield 8.54 percent. Before the auction results were announced, prices of the closely watched bond were down by about 3/8 of a point.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 97 5/ 32, up 5/32, to yield 8.44 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 18/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.36 percent.
Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.79 percent late yesterday, up a basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.74 percent. But one-year bill rates fell by a basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.57 percent.
In other developments, the State of Maryland offered $130 million of general obligation bonds at a competitive sale in the tax-exempt municipal bond market yesterday.
A bid from a group led by Chase Securities Inc. won the issue, which consists of serial bonds from 1993 to 2005. Yields on the securities range from 5.90 percent in 1993 to 6.80 percent in 2005.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Meanwhile, prices of most actively traded secondary municipal bond issues rose by 1/8 to 1/4 of a point, dealers said.
For the second straight session, there was no new-issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market. Corporate traders said that prices of most issues in the secondary market rose by about 3/8 of a point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
U.S. Acquisitions Surge in Europe

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
FROM Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner who bought Adidas, to United Parcel Service, which purchased parcel delivery services in seven countries, Americans were buying in Europe last year and buying more than ever.
Because of the headlines accorded the purchases of parts of Tiffany & Company and Rockfeller Center by the Japanese and the less noticed holdings by the British and the Dutch, many Americans may think of America being gobbled up by foreign investors.
But with a surge of purchases in the last six months of 1989, American companies led the world in snapping up companies in Europe, according to data collected by Translink's European Deal Review. Acquisitions by Americans, where prices were reported, totaled $15.2 billion, or 27.6 percent of the $50 billion total. Prices were reported for only 40 percent of the 185 American deals reported. 
And the Japanese were far behind, placing sixth with $1.63 billion, or 3.3 percent of the total. Following the United States were France ($10.65 billion), West Germany ($7.32 billion), Britain ($6.1 billion) and Italy ($1.85 billion).
The surge in acquisitions worldwide was a record, according to Translink, and it shows that American companies are positioning themselves for the projected economic union of Europe in 1992.
''It's all a response to 1992,'' said Edward M. Graham, professor of economics at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. ''Companies already in Europe are changing their strategy from country to country to Pan-European. And others, who are not there, are deciding they want to get in.''
Mr. Graham, who is working on a paper on the subject, said the surge by American companies was not a surprise, But he said he was comforted by the data because they are the first to confirm the impressions he had gained from anecdotal evidence and other statistics.
The market in a unified Europe will be almost as large as that of the United States, and with the recent developments in Eastern Europe it could be even larger. With the promise of strong economic growth and the possibility of lowering costs, a unified Europe has finally become a venture that American companies cannot ignore.
A sign that the purchases are more the part of longer-term strategy than a sudden opportunity is that about a third of the deals came in the last three months as the dollar was falling sharply against most European currencies.
''American companies are realizing that Europe is an opportunity that is moving very fast and is an opportunity that cannot be missed,'' added Mark Dixon, the editor of Translink's European Deal Review. ''They are acting sensibly for the first time in four years.''
But American companies are also moving a little out of fear. There is a perception that once 1992 arrives barriers may go up that could make it more difficult to get a foothold.
In their acquisitions last year, American companies were mostly interested in automotive concerns and food and food retailing businesses. The other major purchases were in printing and advertsing, oil and gas, electronics and chemicals and plastics.
Most of the purchases were made at the expense of the British, who were the No. 1 target worldwide. Of the total of $50 billion in worldwide deals, $22.9 billion, or 46 percent, were in Britain. Of the $15.2 billion in American purchases, $11.12 billion, or 73 percent, were in Britain, almost three times the total in 1988. Among the largest were Ford Motor's purchase of Jaguar for $2.27 billion, and Pepsico's $1.34 billion acquisition of two competing snack makers, Smiths and Walkers, from BSN S.A. in France.
Not all the deals were successful, although they are counted in the figures. Wasserstein, Perella and the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company failed in their hostile bid for Gateway, the British food stores. They ended up with 40 percent at a cost of $1.35 billion, Translink said.
The surge of acquisitions in the second half of the year was dramatic, with the number of deals rising to 117, from 68 in the first half, and the value surging to $11.22 billion from $3.98 billion.
But this is not all good news. Mr. Graham points out that the Japanese figure is probably low because the Japanese have made larger investments in building new plants in Europe. In addition, he noted that while these figures show that the jump of foreign purchases in the United States is clearly just part of a global trend, the increase in recent years has been much larger in the United States than elsewhere.
And he is also worried about new protectionist trends. American companies now well established in Europe, like General Motors and Ford, he said, are apparently ready to support efforts aimed at limiting the import of Japanese cars, both from Japan and Japanese subsidiaries in the United States.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
For Citibank Official, An End and a Beginning

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For William R. Rhodes of Citibank, yesterday was an end and a beginning. At the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan yesterday, he joined officials from Mexico to sign an agreement to lower Mexico's $48.5 billion in debt with the more than 460 banks involved, winding up almost a year of tough negotiations that he led as co-chairman of the commerical bank advisory committee.
At the same time, Citibank announced his promotion to senior executive, international, a new job that will take him out of the day-to-day business of debt negotiations. But he assumed an overall responsibility for the bank's debt negotations besides his new responsibilities. 
Mr. Rhodes, 54 years old, was involved in most of the primary negotiations since the third world debt crisis began in 1982. Mr. Rhodes has been the chairman or co-chairman of bank negotiating committees for Argentina, Peru, Uruguay and Mexico. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are the three largest debtors in the developing world.
In his new job, Mr. Rhodes will have broader international responsibilities that he said he would use to concentrate some on Eastern Europe. He visited Poland in December. He will also deal with the international financial insitutions, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the Washington officials whose policies affect Citibank's international business. He will report directly to John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, Citibank's parent company.
Mr. Rhodes will be replaced by Robert A. McCormack, 46, who has been a vice president and on Citibank's debt negotiating team since 1987. He will be chairman of the restructuring committee at Citibank. He joined Citibank in 1973 and has since worked in Venezuela, Jamaica, Panama and Puerto Rico and Singapore. He will report to Mr. Rhodes.
Mr. Rhodes, who joined Citibank after graduating from Brown University in 1957 and served in the Caribbean and Latin America, has been waiting for this change in assignments for some time. But he sounded a little reluctant to give up the daily combat of the third world debt crisis.
''I'll still be spending a lot of time on debt,'' he said at the signing ceremony. ''I'll still be very involved.''

HEADLINE: Technology Issues Set Pace As Dow Climbs 33.78 Points

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Strength across the board in technology issues propelled the stock market to a solid gain yesterday on sharply higher volume.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed by 33.78 points, to 2,640.09. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declining ones, 941 to 567.
Turnover on the Big Board, which had been exceptionally slow the first two days of the week, jumped to 186.7 million shares, from 134.1 million shares on Tuesday and 131 million shares on Monday. 
''We are seeing a shift in market leadership away from consumer stocks to industrial production stocks,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., the chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ''This was demonstrated yesterday by the performance of the technology issues.''
 
I.B.M. Up to $103.125
In the technology group, I.B.M. rose 2 1/8, to 103 1/8; Digital added 1 7/8, to 79 1/8; Compaq Computer climbed 4 3/4, to 86 1/8, and Motorola moved up by 1 3/8, to 58 5/8.
Stocks were broadly lower in early trading on concern about the reception for yesterday's and today's portion of the quarterly refinancing by the Treasury. That concern lessened as the session progressed, and it became apparent that participation was greater than expected at the auction of the 10-year notes yesterday, but worries about the auction of the 30-year bond today still kept a lid on any attempts at a sustained advance.
The traders said that about noon, a feeling among some institutions that the market was no longer worried about the auction lifted the Dow to a seven-point gain. The advance was doubled about a half-hour later, when bargain-hunting and some buying relating to futures came into play.
''Traders are beginning to abandon their concern with external uncertainties, including this week's Government financing and the course of interest rates,'' Mr. Peroni said. 8.59% Average Rate The second stage of the quarterly Treasury auction, $10 billion in 10-year notes, was well received, the traders said. The yield on the average discount rate at the auction was 8.59 percent, compared with the last 10-year note sale in November, which had an average rate of 7.94 percent.
Mr. Peroni said the stock market appeared to be diverging considerably from the ''dismal psychology'' that pulled it lower last month. ''This is creating a gradual rejuvenation of confidence in equities,'' he said.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose by 4.09 points, to 333.75, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.98 points, to 184.31.
Among individual issues on the Big Board, Halliburton jumped by 3 points, to 45 3/8, after the oilfield services company reported earnings for the fourth quarter that had been better than expected. They were at 41 cents a share, up from 11 cents a share in the previous year's quarter.
 
Norton a Big Loser
The Norton Company, a maker of abrasives and other products in Worchester, Mass., was the fifth-largest dollar loser, plunging 4 3/8, or 8.4 percent, to 48. The company said its stock sank in response lower-than-expected earnings of 49 cents a share for the quarter, before extraordinary gains, versus 73 cents a share in the 1988 period.
Gold stocks were weak for the second straight day, as the spot price of the precious metal fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York. ASA declined by 2 3/4, to 68 5/8; Hecla Mining slipped by 1/4, to 15, and Sunshine Mining was unchanged at 3 5/8.
Actively traded blue-chip stocks included A.T.& T., which was up by 3/8, to 39 7/8; Philip Morris, which gained 3/4, to 39, and General Electric, which rose by 5/8, to 62 5/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose by 1.61 points, to 356.35, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index gained 2.80 points, to 426.79.
Apple Computer dropped 1 1/2, to 33 1/4, in over-the-counter trading. A spokeswoman for the company, based in Cupertino, Calif., said that the sale of thousands of its MacIntosh computers to the Air Force, as a subcontrator for Honeywell Inc., was in jeopardy because bidding for the contract has been reopened.

HEADLINE: Some Influential Voices Urge Simpler Tax Code

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's top tax officials and the most influential Congressman on tax policy agreed today that aspects of the tax law are too complicated and need to be simplified.
Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy; Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, did not advocate specific changes in the tax code and they insisted that whatever changes were made should not violate the principles of the extensive overhaul of tax law enacted four years ago.
But Mr. Rostenkowski and the Administration officials acknowledged for the first time that they saw merit in the widespread complaints from interest groups and individual taxpayers that some elements of the 1986 law are unreasonably complex.
 
'A Troubling Legacy'
''The legislative frenzy of the past 10 years has left a troubling legacy of complexity, uncertainty and administrative burden on business and individual taxpayers and the I.R.S. itself,'' Mr. Goldberg said. 
Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, said his committee would undertake ''a formal, structured simplification study'' this year.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was the most comprehensive revision of the tax code since World War II. It lowered tax rates dramatically and ended scores of deductions, exemptions and other tax breaks.
With the changes, millions of low-income Americans were removed from the tax rolls and millions more became eligible to file a short form rather than the longer one with itemized deductions. In addition, most taxpayers must keep many fewer records than under the old system.
On the other hand, many businesses and some individuals, most of them wealthy, found themselves burdened by regulations neither they nor their accountants could fathom.
For example, there are hundreds of pages on measures intended to end tax shelters by disallowing deductions for ''passive losses,'' or losses from paper transactions.
James P. Holden, chairman of the tax section of the American Bar Association, told the committee of other ''areas of unnecessary complexity,'' including rules on dependency exemptions, personal interest deductions, pensions and fringe benefits, and foreign tax credits.
 
Under Pressure
The Ways and Means Committee members have faced heavy lobbying for changes in these areas, and lawmakers from both parties agreed today that some parts of the law were overly complicated.
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the top Republican on the panel, said that last year was the first time that he was unable to prepare his own tax returns and had to seek outside help.
Representative Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is a strong supporter of the 1986 law, said, ''The system is so Byzantine that you can't get straight answers from two experts in the same room.''
But Mr. Rostenkowski warned his colleagues ''not to confuse simplification with efforts to substantively reopen tax reform.''
''My invitation for simplification proposals is not an invitation for the restoration of special benefits that were repealed after two grueling years of tax reform,'' he added.
 
Capital Gains Are Issue
The Administration officials agreed basically with that assessment, but they said they would continue to press for a lower capital gains tax rate.
Many Democrats believe a cut in the capital gains rate would undermine one of the basic principles of the 1986 changes, which was to tax all income at the same rate. ''If we move toward capital gains, we're going to resurrect the tax shelter industry,'' Representative Dorgan said. But Mr. Gideon said: ''Our system must adjust to take into account the changing nature of global competition. In order to remain competitive, incentives for savings and investment must be improved. While we must preserve the achievements of the 1986 act, it should not prevent us from adjusting the code to changing economic conditions.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Traders Focus on Marks; Gold Prices Drop in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher against major currencies in domestic trading as the West German mark continued to hold center stage.
Gold prices declined in the United States after moving mostly higher abroad. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $418.10 an ounce, $3.20 lower than Tuesday's close. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold bullion at $418.10 as of 4 P.M., down $2.60 from Tuesday's late bid. 
The dollar has been playing a supporting role to the mark lately because reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are expected to benefit the West German economy, said Keith Raphael, second vice president of foreign exchange at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Meanwhile, negative sentiment toward the dollar has prevailed amid speculation that a softening United States economy will be accompanied by declines in interest rates. Lower rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments, tending to curb demand for dollars.
But the dollar managed to gain against its foreign counterparts in what dealers described as a technical rebound. Overseas, the dollar turned in a mixed performance.
 
Moscow News Factored In
Dealers said developments in Moscow, with Soviet Communist Party leaders agreeing to give up their monopoly on power as proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, had already been factored into foreign exchange markets.
A lack of market-moving news yesterday made dealers reluctant to trade heavily and kept the dollar within a narrow range.
In New York, the dollar ended at 145.60 yen, up from 145.245 yen on Tuesday. It ended the day at 1.6580 West German marks, up from 1.65605 marks on Tuesday and from the 1.6545 closing level yesterday in Europe. The pound gained, ending at $1.6960, compared with $1.7030 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late quotes, included: 1.4890 Swiss francs, up from 1.4763; 5.642 French francs, up from 5.64; 1,236.50 Italian lire, up from 1,233.50, and 1.19455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18755.
Gold prices were mixed, while silver rose.
In London, gold rose to a late bid of $423 a troy ounce, from $420.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $422.25, from $420.75 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid of $417.75 an ounce.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery ended at $5.311 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.306. Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.38 an ounce, from $5.31 bid late Tuesday.

Balanced Race in Patrick Division

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
As the National Hockey League season finishes its third quarter and approaches the home stretch, its most closely contested pennant race is in the Patrick Division, where the most interesting club in that six-team group is the first-place Islanders.
By getting 50 of a possible 60 points in their last 30 games, the Islanders have moved from last place to first and have opened a 3-point lead over the Rangers and a 5-point lead over the Devils. Last-place Pittsburgh is only 9 points out of first. No division is nearly as balanced, but this is the biggest lead of the season for the Islanders, who have won three games in a row. 
If the season were to end today, Pat LaFontaine of the Islanders would be a top candidate for the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in the league. His coach, Al Arbour, would merit strong consideration as the coach of the year. Last season, the Islanders finished 20th in a 21-team league. Last autumn, most experts picked them to finish last in their division. They currently rank eighth in the league with 59 points.
LaFontaine, who scored three goals in Tuesday night's 8-7 overtime victory at Pittsburgh, has 47 goals to equal his career best. He remains 3 goals behind Brett Hull of St. Louis, who leads the league with 50.
During the Islanders' early-season slump, LaFontaine could be heard after games, in the locker room, assuring reporters and teammates that prosperity was just around the corner. In recent games, he can be seen speaking forcefully to groups of players before face-offs, instructing them on technique and strategy.
''It was his time to step up,'' Arbour said, ''and he has assumed the leadership role.''
The 57-year-old Arbour is the oldest coach in the league. Although Arbour shows flashes of his temper from time to time, he builds the psychological stability of a young team with a consistent personality.
''He is worth about a goal a game to that club,'' said a veteran N.H.L. official, who watched a recent game from the press box. ''He doesn't say much, but he always gets the message across.''
Certainly there are other candidates for the top awards. Among the very valuable players are Mark Messier of Edmonton, Hull of St. Louis, Ray Bourque of Boston, Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh and Wayne Gretzky of Los Angeles.
Among the contending coaches are Doug Carpenter of Toronto, John Muckler of Edmonton, Mike Milbury of Boston, Rick Dudley of Buffalo, Bob Murdoch of Winnipeg and Mike Keenan of Chicago.
 
Plans for a New League
Dennis Murphy, the founder of the World Hockey Association of the 1970's, said yesterday that 50 people would attend meetings in Los Angeles tomorrow and Saturday to plan the launching of the Global Hockey League.
The league, with a North American division and a European Division, will begin play in November, Murphy said, with each team making two four-game road trips to the other continent.
Groups from Tampa, Fla.; Cleveland; Atlanta; San Diego; Phoenix; Albany, and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, will be among the North Americans at the meeting, Murphy said. Among European sites Murphy has targeted are London, Stockholm and Dusseldorf, West Germany.
The league will eliminate the center red line (and the two-line offside pass over it), Murphy said, and will award penalty shots to teams victimized by high-sticking. Team owners must put up $2 million each, he said, to cover franchise fees and bonding.
Murphy said the changing political and economic climate in Europe would make the 1990's ''the best time in the world'' for North American-style sports business.
''But people have to understand that we're not all just a bunch of money-grabbers,'' Murphy said.
 
Difference of Opinion
Bob Goodenow, the lawyer selected to replace Alan Eagleson as executive director of the N.H.L. Players Association, admits he represented management in 1982 and 1983 when it successfully battled union organizers at a company called Fire Fighter Sales & Service Company in Pittsburgh.
''I think I represented my client to the best of my abilities,'' Goodenow said. ''To me, this is old news.''
Frank Caputo, a retired business agent for Teamsters Local 249 in Pittsburgh, said in a letter to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Monday that Goodenow is ''an opportunistic chameleon.''
''A group of 10 overworked and underpaid young men were trying to get off the bottom rung of the ladder,'' Caputo wrote, ''and Goodenow made the moral judgment that it was all right to accept pay and keep them on the bottom rung and knock them to the ground.''
Gerald Diduck, the Islanders defenseman who was a member of the players association's search committee, said Goodenow's experience would help the union.
''He knows what tactics management uses when planning a strike or a difficult negotiation,'' Diduck said. ''It's an asset.''

Costs Can Go Downhill If Skiers Are Flexible

BYLINE: By Janet Nelson

 BODY:
rrAt the start of each ski season, skiers are greeted with the news that lift-ticket prices have gone up. Usually the amount of the increases is only a dollar or two, but over the years this has brought some single-day weekend tickets to $35 and $37 at Eastern ski areas.
At the same time that single-day weekend tickets have been going up, there has been a proliferation of discounts and special rates that substantially reduce the cost of a day's skiing.
''In recent years, we've seen more and more ski areas experimenting with different kinds of pricing structures for lift tickets,'' said Tom Meyers, marketing director for the Vermont Ski Areas Association. ''The basic one, of course, is the weekend/ midweek differential where midweek prices are usually 25 to 40 percent below the weekend prices. But recently, there are also more bargains for different times of the year, such as peak and holiday versus the regular-season rates, and early and late season discounts.'' 
Meyers sees this trend in ticket-price variations continuing and expanding to include parts of the day, hourly rates and even individual ride fees. These kinds of changes are becoming possible as new ticketing technology, using computers, bar codes and counting systems, is adopted by ski areas.
For now, though, skiers must study deals and packages to find the most economical way to go skiing. rrThere are a number of areas in the East that offer daily skiing for $20 or less on weekdays during nonholiday periods. One of the best bargains is found at Magic Mountain, Vt., with a $15 daily price, while two other Vermont resorts, Bromley and Haystack, have $20 tickets and Suicide Six has an $18.50 midweek ticket. Saddleback, Me., offers skiing for $18 on weekdays, and Big Squaw and Mount Abram have $15 tickets. In New Hampshire, Mount Sunapee and Dartmouth Skiway both have $20 midweek tickets. Cranmore has a $19 ticket. Ragged Mountain has a $17 ticket, King Ridge and Pat's Peak have $16 tickets and King Pine has a $15 ticket.
In the Catskills of New York, skiers can buy a Sampler Card (914-586-4655) for $10 that permits two skiers to ski for the price of one at nine areas - Holiday, Cortina, Bellearye, Ski Windham, Highmount, Deer Run, Big Vanilla, Hunter and Bobcat -making daily prices for two less than $20 each. At Hunter Mountain, the Sampler Card is good only on the beginners' mountain.
In New Hampshire, several ski areas also offer two-for-one deals. On Tuesdays, Mount Sunapee and Cannon offer twofers. Cannon's midweek ticket is $21. Bretton Wood has twofers on Wednesdays and Gunstock has them on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The midweek ticket at those areas is $22.
Multiple-day lift tickets, available for two to seven days, are another means for skiers to realize substantial savings. While these discounts have traditionally been offered only for midweek periods, some areas are now venturing into discounts for two weekend days and long weekends.
Stratton, Vt., for instance, has a two-day adult weekend ticket for $60, which is $12 less than two separately purchased daily tickets. Magic and Bromley, Vt., have a $50 two-day weekend ticket that must be used at both areas on consecutive days. At Attitash, a two-day weekend ticket is $58, and a third day brings the price to $82. rrInterchangeable passes that offer skiing at several ski areas in a region or in a state not only give savings over normal lift-ticket prices (particularly for the highest-price ski areas in the packages), but also greater variety for every day of a vacation. This year, there are more of these multi-area, reciprocal passes than ever before.
Ski the White Mountains One Pass (603-745-8720) is good for midweek, nonholiday periods for five consecutive days at 10 ski areas. The price is $115 and when a parent purchases a One Pass, one child under 13 years of age skis free. Ski areas where the One Pass can be used are Attitash, Balsams/Wilderness, Black, Bretton Woods, Cannon, Cranmore, Loon, Tenney, Waterville Valley and Wildcat.
First Mountains of New Hampshire offers a seasonlong interchangeable pass good at King Ridge, Pat's Peak, Temple and Crotched, plus several ski touring centers. For $195, skiers get unlimited skiing at those areas and up to 20 lift tickets at Mount Sunapee.
The Ski 93 Midweek Mountain Pass (603-356-3171) lets skiers choose different New Hampshire areas for three out of four days or four out of five days or allows them to ski at one area for an entire midweek stay. The prices are $80 for adults and $60 for juniors for four days and $100 and $75 for five days. The ski areas in the program are Bretton Woods, Cannon, Loon, Tenney and Waterville Valley.
The Valley Pass for Mount Washington Valley (603-356-3171) is interchangeable for three midweek days at Attitash, Black, Cranmore and Wildcat. The price is $66 for adults and $33 for juniors.
In Vermont, Ski Vermont's Classics offers interchangeable tickets any day of the week, although holiday surcharges may apply at some resorts. The three-day ticket is $99 and the five-day ticket is $151 and they are good at Jay Peak, Sugarbush, Stowe, Smugglers' Notch and Bolton Valley.

HEADLINE: Chill of Labor Impasse Threatens Baseball's Spring

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The wintertime hopes of baseball players and fans could be shattered today. The owners of baseball's 26 clubs will meet in Chicago and are expected to carry out their threat to postpone the opening of spring training.
Negotiators for the owners and the players' union have been unable to produce a new collective-bargaining agreement to replace the one that expired Dec. 31. The Player Relations Committee, the owners' labor arm, has said for the last month that if the two sides had no agreement of any sort by today's meeting training camps would not open as scheduled on Feb. 16.
On Wednesday, after the last bargaining session, Charles P. O'Connor, the owners' chief negotiator, referred to a memorandum sent to the clubs on Jan. 9, which said, ''Spring training camps may not be opened until the P.R.C. instructs you to do so.'' He then said that nothing had happened to prompt the owners to change their stance. 
Begun late in the 19th century as a warm-weather boot camp for out-of-shape players, spring training has in recent years become a growing industry that draws thousands of tourists and fills ball parks regularly. In Florida, home to 18 teams, it generates $330 million for the state economy. For fans, it is an early start on summer and a time when every team can be a champion.
The owners have shut down spring training twice before. They kept camps closed in 1973 until Feb. 26, the day after they agreed with the players on a new labor contract. In 1976, the camps remained shut until Bowie K. Kuhn, then the commissioner, ordered them opened March 17. In both cases, the season started on time.
The players have struck four times, twice late in spring training - in 1972 and 1980 - and twice during the regular season, for 50 days in 1981 and for two days in 1985. The 1972 strike delayed the start of the season by 10 days.
The current dispute stems from the owners' desire to implement a new salary system based on a revenue-sharing plan. The owners propose to give the players for salaries and benefits 48 percent of the income derived from ticket sales and radio and television rights. Income from those sources accounts for 82 percent of the owners' total revenue.
The money would be allocated for salaries in two basic ways.
Players who have been in the major leagues between one year and six years would be paid primarily on the basis of a statistically created scale tied to performance. Players with six years of service or more would be free agents, but their ability to sign with new teams would depend on the teams' payrolls. If a team were over a certain payroll level, it would not be able to sign free agents from other teams.
Under the old agreement, a player with less than three years' service negotiates the best deal he can with the club that holds his contract. A player with three to six years' service can submit his salary request to an arbitrator if he fails to reach agreement with his club. A player with six years' service is free to sign with the highest bidder.
 
Players' View of Proposal
The owners' negotiators have been unable to sell the players on any part of the new proposal. Scott Sanderson, a pitcher with the Oakland Athletics and a member of the players' negotiating team, explained the players' views in a telephone interview yesterday.
''The game, even by their admission at the bargaining table, has never been healthier than it is now,'' he said from Chicago. ''At such a time, to get the players to believe there is a need for a drastic change in the structure of baseball is going to be tough to do.
''Second, to propose that at a time when their recent track record has been one of collusion adds skepticism on our part. Third, to not have all the factual information that could support their proposal lends to the skepticism.''
Paul Molitor of the Milwaukee Brewers, the American League player representative, said the owners' collusion against free agents had prompted the players ''to look at this to see what their underlying motive might be.''
''You have to rebuild that trust before you ask us to make a major change,'' he said. ''They talk about partnership, but when they thought of this plan, their idea wasn't partnership; their idea was to do what was best for them. If a partnership came along the way, fine.''
The players mistrust the owners primarily because of their treatment of free agents after the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons. Two arbitrators found the owners had colluded in the first two instances; a decision is pending in the third.
Beyond that, the players are skeptical of the owners' motives because of past negotiations. In 1981, the owners' demand for a professional player as compensation for the loss of a free agent prompted the players' strike. Yet, four years later, in the next negotiation, the owners dropped the professional-compensation provision they had gained.
The owners' negotiators entered these talks with the stated intention of improving labor relations. Donald M. Fehr, the players' labor leader, has noted that the owners endorsed the Player Relations Committee's bargaining strategy last July 18, and that strategy included a lockout if no agreement was reached by the start of spring training.
''So I assume,'' Mr. Fehr said earlier this week, ''that what is about to happen is we're going to have a lockout to make labor relations better. It's an interesting theory. We'll see if it works.''
The lockout is the owners' way of being in control of the timing of a work stoppage. Mr. O'Connor, the Washington-based lawyer who is the Player Relations Committee's general counsel, has explained that the owners didn't want to get into the season and have the players strike, as they did in 1981 (on June 12) and 1985 (on Aug. 6).
An in-season strike would cost the owners television money, especially if it forced the cancellation of the All-Star Game in July or the post-season playoffs and World Series in October. The clubs begin a new four-year $1.06 billion television package this year.
 
Looking for 'Certainty'
The owners say they want the revenue-sharing plan because it would provide them with what Mr. O'Connor calls cost certainty. When negotiations in other industries end in agreement, Mr. O'Connor said, both sides know what the cost will be. Not so in baseball.
He has referred to the escalating player salaries that have reached record heights. Before this winter, no player had a contract that averaged $3 million a year. This winter, nine players signed such contracts.
In the pay-for-performance plan for players who have between one and six years' service in the major leagues, the 26 clubs would equally share all of the salaries. Those salaries would be determined by ranking the players in four groups and paying them based on time in the majors and statistics from the previous two seasons.
The owners' negotiators say that under the plan young players would receive higher salaries than they receive now in their second and third years in the majors. The players object to the plan because it would eliminate salary arbitration, multiyear contracts and guaranteed contracts for these players.
The players object to the payroll-level plan for free agents because it could restrict the mobility and thus the bargaining power of some free agents.
 
Players' Proposals
The focus on the revenue-sharing proposal has overshadowed the players' proposals.
Among other things, the players want to return the eligibility level for salary arbitration to two years from the three years that became the standard in the last agreement; they want the minimum salary raised from $68,000 to a figure between $100,000 and $125,000; they want rosters restored to a mandatory 25-man limit from the 24 the clubs have used the last few years, and they want collusion protection built into the agreement.
The owners' negotiators have said they would discuss the players' proposals only in the context of their revenue-sharing proposal.
The players say one reason they have difficulty with the owners' proposal is the owners' inability or unwillingness to answer what the players see as basic questions:
Will salaries under the plan be higher than at present, lower or the same? If the owners foresee problems with disparity between small- and large-market teams, when will those problems occur? How much money would it take to eliminate any economic disparity between those two groups?
The players also asked if the owners had studied the possibility of allocating joint revenues, like the national television money, in unequal proportions so smaller-market clubs would get more. The owners' negotiators said they had not.
Discussing the plan's potential effect on salaries, Mr. Fehr said: ''It's nearly impossible for us to believe it would produce more money. If it would and they wanted it, they would be trumpeting that all over the place.''
The proposal, he added, is ''very complex with tremendous implications.''
''It takes a lot of study and analysis that we now know their own economics experts were not fully conversant with,'' he said.
Because of what he said was the complexity of the issues and lack of answers, Mr. Fehr questioned the wisdom of a lockout.
But Mr. O'Connor said, ''I share the clubs' view that the deadline now from the standpoint of preserving this season, from the standpoint of keeping it an equal-level playing field between themselves and the union, is a wise judgment.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Accuses 2 Nynex Companies Of Overcharging and Fines Them

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The Government ordered the New York Telephone Company and the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday to pay a total of $1.4 million in fines for what it called an illegal scheme that inflated profits at the expense of customers.
The Federal Communications Commission said customers had been overcharged about $35 million between 1984 and 1988 by the two companies, which are owned by the Nynex Corporation.
The penalty is the largest ever imposed on a regulated telephone company and is the first involving accusations of a major abuse by one of the seven regional telephone holding companies.
Nynex was also ordered to return the $35 million. The commission said the money would not go directly to consumers but would be used to lower the fees that New York Telephone and New England Telephone charge long-distance companies. That would indirectly produce a very small drop in long-distance prices, the commission said. 
The commission said the two phone companies had bought equipment, services and supplies from another Nynex subsidiary at prices inflated by $118.5 million. About $35 million of the cost was passed on to customers through higher rates, it said.
 
Violated the Rules
The commission said such a transaction violated rules requiring that when a regulated telephone company buys from an affiliated company, the telephone company passes on to customers no more than the cost that would have resulted had the transaction been done with an outside company.
The rules were created to protect consumers and competing telephone concerns from anti-competitive practices by the seven regional telephone holding companies created in the breakup of the Bell System telephone monopoly six years ago. Nynex is one of the seven companies.
Ken Moran, chief of the accounting and audit division at the Federal Communications Commission, said the Government thought that the excess charges were intentional and that ''Nynex understood the rules and knew precisely what it was doing.''
But William C. Ferguson, Nynex's chairman, said the company did not intend to overcharge customers. He said the rules to which the commission referred do not apply to this case.
''My first and overriding concern is the good faith of each of our customers,'' he said in a statement. ''I want them to understand clearly that there has been no intention of overcharging.''
The commission imposed the maximum fine possible against the two telephone companies: $709,500 each, or $500 a day for each day of abuse that occurred within the last five years. The period before that falls outside the five-year statute of limitations. Congress recently increased such fines to $6,000 for each day of violation, the commission said.
The F.C.C. has no authority over local telephone bills, and yesterday's action will not affect such bills, the commission said. The commission said it would require New York Telephone and New England Telephone to lower by a total of $35 million the ''access fees'' they charge long-distance carriers like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, MCI Communications and U S Sprint Communications. A.T.&T. is required to pass such savings on to consumers in the form of lower long-distance rates. In the past, MCI and Sprint have lowered their rates to remain competitive with A.T.&T.
 
Possibility of Appeal
Nynex has 30 days to appeal the commission's decision.Robert O'Brien, a Nynex spokesman, said the company planned to study the ruling and respond. Mr. O'Brien said the company thought it had fully complied with F.C.C. rules.
Mr. O'Brien said it was unclear whether the purchasing rules applied to Nynex's supplier. The rules were written in 1977 for transactions between Western Electric and the other companies in the Bell System that it supplied. It was not until 1987 that the F.C.C. wrote a rule applying the 1977 policy specifically to purchases from Nynex's supplier, the Nynex Material Enterprises Company, and similar operations of other regional Bell companies.
The commission said its findings were based on an audit of transactions between Nynex Material and both New York Telephone and New England Telephone.
Nynex Material, which has its main offices at 441 Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, was created in 1984 to centralize Nynex's purchasing requirements. It buys everything from paper clips and note pads to fiber-optic cable and computer switching equipment for Nynex's 12 operating companies. The division manages about $2 billion worth of contracts a year with about 6,200 vendors.
 
Seeking Looser Regulation
Yesterday's decision certainly will not help Nynex and the other regional Bell telephone companies in their attempt to persuade the Federal judge overseeing their operations to loosen restrictions and allow them to enter other businesses.
For Nynex, the ruling is yet another difficulty as it tries to recover from a six-month-long strike and win a major rate increase from the New York Public Service Commission. Nynex took an unexpected $325 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of 1989, giving it a $43.7 million net loss for the quarter.
The company has had difficulty controlling its costs, and its revenues have been hurt by a weak economy in the Northeast and heavy competition from fiber-optic telecommunications concerns that are attracting large business customers by offering private telephone networks.

HEADLINE: Brazil Aspires to Big League in More Than Soccer

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Touring the United States, Japan, Western Europe and the Soviet Union, Brazil's President-elect has carried to world leaders a determined message: Brazil wants to join the ranks of the first world in the 1990's.
''We want to stop being the leading country of the third world to join the group of the first world,'' the President-elect, Fernando Collor de Mello, said in Italy on Monday. On March 15, Mr. Collor is to be inaugurated as President of Brazil, which has the world's eighth largest market economy.
Wearing hand-tailored business suits, speaking four European languages and advocating fewer Government barriers and more foreign investment, Mr. Collor has made it clear that he intends to draw Latin America's largest nation into closer economic integration with the developed world. 
Celebrating this turn, Roberto Campos, an acerbic free-market Senator, wrote in a newspaper column here on Sunday, ''The time has arrived for us to make the choice for wealth - preferring to be the last member of the Jockey Club instead of the first member of the dance hall.''
 
Investors Turn Elsewhere
In the 1980's, Brazil lost appeal to foreign investors as the economy stagnated under weak political leadership, racing inflation, spreading Government controls and the third world's largest foreign debt. In the 1980's, the Pacific basin replaced Brazil as a magnet for foreign credit and investment. Today, many Brazilians fear that the new magnet is Eastern Europe.
Determined to promote ''the New Brazil,'' Mr. Collor embarked on Jan. 24 on a nine-nation, 20-day tour. By the time the trip ends on Tuesday, Mr. Collor hopes that his standing will be bolstered with two key audiences: Brazil's polarized electorate and Brazil's skeptical foreign investors and creditors.
For the domestic audience, Mr. Collor, a former newspaper executive, has pushed Brazil into the age of the photo opportunity.
In Tokyo, the President-elect, a former karate champion, donned his black belt and white togs and practiced exercises with Japanese karate instructors.
In Turin, cameras rolled again as the athletic Mr. Collor deftly bounced and dribbled a soccer ball on the field where Brazil's national team is to make its debut in the World Cup in June.
 
An Invitation From Bush
In addition, rubbing shoulders with the world's most powerful leaders undoubtedly has lent a statesmanlike image to Mr. Collor, who at 40 will be Brazil's youngest President.
While the world press largely ignored the trip, Brazil's television and magazine journalists breathlessly chronicled how President Bush invited Mr. Collor and his wife, Rosane, to the White House for an impromptu buffet dinner, and how President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union left his dacha for an 80-minute meeting with the President-elect.
Although no opinion polls have charted the effect at home, several Brazilians said in interviews that Mr. Collor's foreign tour is winning him support.
''I know two psychiatrists who voted Lula who are now telling me that Collor's trip is making them think again,'' a Rio hostess said at a dinner party on Tuesday night.
In December, in a polarized election campaign, Mr. Collor defeated Luis Inacio da Silva, a socialist widely known as Lula, by 53 percent to 47 percent of the vote. After the election, many of Mr. Collor's opponents were further antagonized when he rented a private jet and embarked on a 13-day vacation in Africa and Europe that was estimated to cost $350,000.
 
Rounding Up Supporters
But the current business trip, conducted on commercial airliners, seems to be helping the President-elect, whose party, the National Reconstruction Party, controls only 35 seats in the 560-member Congress.
Before leaving for New York, his first stop, Mr. Collor charged his designated Justice Minister, Bernardo Cabral, with the task of rounding up congressional support. Encouraged by a series of negotiations, Mr. Cabral has predicted that he will have stitched together a working majority alliance by the time Congress reconvenes on Feb. 15, two days after Mr. Collor's return here.
On the external front, Mr. Collor's lack of coverage in the general press has been compensated for by his blanket exposure to a highly specific, and highly influential, audience: Brazil's overseas investors and creditors. By the end of the tour, Mr. Collor will have met with the heads of state of the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, West Germany, Italy, France, Britain, Portugal and Spain. In each country, hundreds of business leaders have heard him speak.
By next Tuesday, the business men and women responsible for decisions on at least 90 percent of Brazil's foreign investment and credit will have had a chance to size up Brazil's future President personally.
So far, the reviews have been largely favorable.
''It's encouraging to see a leader so young and so sure that the way out for Brazil is by adopting a market economy,'' Carla A. Hills, the United States special trade representative, said after having breakfast with Mr. Collor in Washington.
Summing up Mr. Collor's meetings with United States officials in Washington, Richard H. Melton, the American Ambassador here. said on Tuesday, ''We view his goals and policy objectives as being largely compatible with our own - reorienting Brazil toward the 'first world,' gradually opening Brazilian markets to foreign trade and investment and encouraging market-oriented solutions to Brazil's economic problems.''
 
More Free-Market Talk
Indeed, Mr. Collor has been preaching overseas a slightly sharper version of the free-market dogma that helped him win the presidency at home. Describing Brazilian-made cars as ''clunkers,'' he said in Bonn that the West German and the Japanese were welcome to open car factories in Brazil.
Describing Brazil's controls on computer imports and investment as xenophobia, Mr. Collor told Japanese businessmen that Brazil would open its computer market to foreign investment.
''Brazil cannot run the risk that the 1990's be another lost decade,'' he said in Tokyo.
A Collor supporter who represents an American bank here said of the President-elect: ''I hope he can bridge the gap between words and actions. Don't forget that only six months ago another Latin superstar was playing tennis with Bush.''
This ''superstar,'' President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, has recently come under a cloud as his attempt at a free-market economic program unraveled into double-digit monthly inflation.

HEADLINE: End to Bush Observer Team's Role In Nicaraguan Vote Raises Debate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A decision to disband an official American delegation that was to observe the Nicaraguan elections has intensified a political battle shaping up over the fairness of the campaign.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, co-chairman of President Bush's election-monitoring commission, announced on Wednesday that the bipartisan group, made up of 20 members of Congress, was disbanding because the Nicaraguan Government had denied visas to some of its members.
Nevertheless, the Feb. 25 elections will be closely monitored by hundreds of observers from Latin America, Europe, the United States and the United Nations. Among the groups applauding the preparations for the vote are missions led by former President Jimmy Carter and Elliot L. Richardson, who heads the United Nations group. 
President Daniel Ortega Saavedra is running for re-election against several candidates. Chief among them is Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the main opposition daily La Prensa, who leads a coalition of opposition parties. The coalition, the National Opposition Union, includes parties ranging from right-wing conservatives to socialists and Communists.
 
Many U.S. Observers Anyway
The exclusion of Mr. Lugar's group will make it difficult but not impossible for Congress to accept the legitimacy of the vote. Along with the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Parliament are sending observers. Mr. Carter is leading a team that includes members of Congress from both parties.
If those groups conclude that the election is fair, Congress might accept the verdict. But the Bush Administration has already issued many statements declaring the elections biased, possibly to lay the groundwork for dismissing the results if Mr. Ortega wins.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, asserted that the exclusion of Mr. Bush's observer team, combined with accusations of Sandinista violence against opposition members and Sandinista efforts to delay the distribution of American aid to the opposition, raised doubts about the Sandinistas' commitment to free elections.
Managua told American officials months ago that it would not admit an official American observer team as long as Washington continued to finance the Nicaraguan guerrillas and enforce economic sanctions.
 
The Sandinista View
Paul S. Reichler, the Washington lawyer who has represented the Nicaraguan Government for more than a decade, said today that the Sandinistas would welcome members of Congress, including Mr. Lugar, as members of other observer delegations.
But he said, ''An official U.S. Government delegation is out of the question because the U.S. continues to finance the contras, who continue to make war in Nicaragua and have threatened to disrupt the electoral process.'' Mr. Reichler said there would be 1,000 foreign observers and 1,500 foreign journalists in Nicaragua for the elections.
The various observer delegations will not necessarily agree on the fairness of the elections, and some may be more critical than others, especially if the results are close. Allen Weinstein, president of the Center for Democracy, which has been monitoring the Nicaraguan campaign since March, said the missions organized by the United Nations, the O.A.S. and Mr. Carter ''accentuated the positive, while addressing the Sandinista Government directly on problems they observed.''
Mr. Weinstein, who observed elections in the Philippines in 1986 and in Panama last year, said Nicaragua had ''a mixed record'' in the campaign so far. ''Problems such as the intimidation of poll watchers have to be completely and fastidiously addressed in the weeks remaining before election day,'' he said.
 
Bipartisan Monitors
Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California, who was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's observer delegation, said, ''It looks from a distance as if the election in Nicaragua is likely to be a fairly free and open contest, perhaps because the Sandinistas believe they will win.''
''It would have been in the Sandinistas' own interest if our group could have visited Nicaragua and come back to the United States and vouched for the fairness of the elections,'' Mr. Beilenson said in an interview. ''I'm sorry they didn't let us in.''
Mr. Carter's observer team included these four members of Congress: Senators John C. Danforth of Missouri and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Representatives Doug Bereuter of Nebraska and Bill Richardson of New Mexico. Mr. Danforth and Mr. Bereuter are Republicans; Mr. Dodd and Mr. Richardson are Democrats.
Mr. Bush's delegation, appointed in November, included conservative Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona and Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, as well as liberal Democrats like Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont.

Baker Meets in Moscow On Arms and Afghans

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d opened talks today with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, by setting out a variety of arms control initiatives, as well as a new American proposal for solving the Afghan conflict.
Soviet and American working groups continued to meet late into the night, as the two sides tried to digest the latest American and Soviet technical suggestions for the negotiations on limiting conventional arms, long-range nuclear missiles and chemical weapons.
Negotiators are hoping to hammer out compromises on several key problems holding up the separate negotiations and then have those compromises completed tomorrow when Mr. Baker goes to the Kremlin to meet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Both Soviet and American officials said the most pressing issues - how the Soviets intend to handle the rapidly moving process of German unification and how they will respond to President Bush's recent proposal that both nations slash their troop levels in Europe to 195,000 men - will also await the Baker-Gorbachev session. 
 
Offer on Najibullah
On Afghanistan, the Secretary of State laid out for the Soviets the Bush Administration's new position, officials said. He told them that Washington was prepared to drop its long-held demand that the Soviet-installed President, Najibullah, be removed before any negotiated settlement is possible.
Mr. Baker, aides said, still insisted that Mr. Najibullah must go, but said his removal could be part of gradual, phased transition process.
Asked for the Soviet reaction to the proposal, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said: ''The American side showed us its plan, but it did not take into account the situation in Kabul, the difficulties of the Najibullah Government. But as a whole there was agreement on both sides that it is necessary to look for new approaches. It can be said that the realistic approach is a dialogue of national reconciliation, with the participation of all Afghan sides in the dialogue.''
 
Report on Refugee Quota
On another issue, Mr. Gerasimov said the United States had told Moscow that it would accept up to 20,000 more Soviet emigrants a year as refugees.
''The U.S. side informed us that they are raising their quota this year to approximately 60,000 or 70,000,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. The United States now accepts 50,000 Soviet refugees a year.
But American officials in Washington said today that the Administration had not proposed an increase in the ceiling for the current fiscal year. Administration officials said 10,000 to 20,000 Soviet citizens could conceivably be admitted to the United States outside the refugee program.
While American officials insisted that today's talks were not affected in any way by the preoccupation of senior Soviet officials with the outcome of their latest Communist Party meeting, in which party leaders agreed to relinquish their monopoly on power, there was a palpable difference in atmosphere between the opening of this Baker-Shevardnadze meeting and the last one, held in Moscow in May.
When Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shevardnadze in May, there was a sense that their talks could have a major impact on the course of international events. At today's opening, which took place against the backdrop of the Soviet party meeting and the collapse of Communist power in much of Eastern Europe, the ambiance seemed rather subdued and emotionally flat.
 
U.S.-Soviet Agenda Dwarfed
The contast seemed to reflect the fact that so many aspects of the traditional Soviet-American agenda have been dwarfed, and in some cases rendered almost irrelevant, by the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the last six months.
For instance, the original motivation for this particular meeting was to overcome many remaining obstacles to a strategic arms limitation treaty so Presidents Bush and Gorbachev would be able to sign it at their June summit meeting in Washington.
But the more immediate issues now dominating the agenda in Europe are ones that the American-Soviet dialogue alone can only marginally influence -the reunification of Germany and the disintegration of the Soviet bloc.
Baker aides said Mr. Shevardnadze had devoted most of last night's three-hour meeting with the Secretary to explaining the results of the party session and Mr. Gorbachev's general plans on the domestic front.
The aides quoted Mr. Shevardnadze as telling Mr. Baker that it had become clear that political change in the Soviet Union was outrunning economic change and therefore some far-reaching economic liberalization was going to be called for in the near future.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: The President;
What Is Bush Up To?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the leader of the Democratic majority in the House, said today that ''Americans are asking one question: 'Why is President Bush beating plowshares into swords?' ''
Mr. Gephardt was making a partisan gibe, of course, and by no means all Americans would agree with his characterization of Mr. Bush's performance this week. But to many in Washington, at least, much of the President's activity has seemed seriously, sometimes almost surrealistically, out of sync.
This week, while the Communist Party of the Soviet Union voted to give up its constitutional monopoly on power, while evidence accumulated that the Soviet Union is threatened with rapid dissolution, while West Germany's leaders were working toward uniting its currency (and thus its economy) with that of East Germany, while the Pentagon was saying the Soviet Union no longer constitutes a danger in the Persian Gulf - while all those signs of an ebbing Soviet threat were coming in, Mr. Bush was sending out cold war symbols. 
There he was on Monday, watching American soldiers fight ''Soviet'' tanks in war games at Fort Irwin, Calif. There he was today at Offutt Air Force Base outside Omaha, wearing a leather bomber jacket as he clambered into a B-1 bomber and inspected a B-52 - a pair of lethal machines whose primary mission is to attack the Soviet Union. Is the Bridge Secure? It was all quite deliberate, of course. In this day of image politics, Presidents do not offer up pictures like those by chance, especially not Presidents like Mr. Bush, the man who so skillfully appropriated the American flag as his campaign symbol.
Furthermore, Mr. Bush has made his message explicit. He is loath to walk too quickly across ''a bridge that can lead us from seemingly endless conflict to the promise of a lasting peace,'' he said in San Francisco on Wednesday, before he is certain that ''the bridge is secure.''
But an accomplished politician like the President, who has shown more than once that he is cannier and more calculating than he seems, must surely know, key members of both parties have been saying, that there isn't much real public support for continued huge military spending, and that every fresh sign of Soviet weakness tends to erode even that minimal support.
Mr. Bush has freely acknowledged that he faces a tough selling job. So why has he sent Congress a $295.1 billion 1991 budget for the Pentagon, 1.3 percent above the current one? Why does he keep pushing the Strategic Defense Initiative, running the risk of ridicule by suggesting that if it isn't needed to protect the country against the Russians, it might be needed to block missiles launched by the Iranians or the Libyans or the narcotics barons?
 
Personality, Politics, History
It's a puzzle to which few here pretend to have the answer. But most Presidents act as they do on big issues for several reasons, and this one's actions would seem to grow out of his personality, his political calculations and his sense of history.
White House officials deny, as they would be expected to, that there is any politics at all in the way the President is reacting to headlong change.
No doubt, Mr. Bush's innate caution is one element in the equation, especially at a moment when, as he acknowledged in his speech to the Commonwealth Club, ''the world is moving too fast to forecast'' what is coming next.
No doubt, like most leaders, he finds it uncomfortable to execute sharp turns away from policies that have been followed by his predecessors - in this case, as he also said in San Francisco, from Harry S. Truman to Ronald Reagan. That is one reason why policies almost always outlive the circumstances that gave rise to their adoption.
 
Delight in Military Gear
Perhaps he gets a certain thrill, as an old World War II aviator, from the sophisticated and fascinating modern weapons that technology has made possible. He is not the first President to delight in putting on military gear, as he did at least twice this week, and posing for television. Even his rival of two years ago, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, made a feckless, now-famous attempt to play the game by donning a tank crewman's helmet for the cameras.
But many think that Mr. Bush has an overall political scheme, too.
He has chosen to provide for two manned bombers and two long-range mobile missile systems, while proposing to close or scale down a large number of military bases in the United States, because that puts the Democrats in a box. Most of the affected bases, not by accident, are in areas represented by Democrats. If the Democrats go along, they weaken themselves with voters more concerned about jobs than high strategy; if they protest, they look like hypocrites, eager to cut all military spending eexcept where it hurts them.
''Longstanding critics of defense spending should not turn around and block the closing of a base in their home district,'' he said this week, lest anyone should have missed the point.
 
Gesture to Conservatives
At the same time, the emphasis on modernizing strategic weapons is seen as a gesture to the conservatives in his party whom Mr. Bush has so often taken pains to woo, largely because he knows they suspect him of being a closet liberal. A middle-of-the-road Republican Senator commented the other day, apropos not only of the budget request but also of the bellicose imagery:
''It's a lot of pantomime, designed to placate our right-wingers the same way his gentle words about education and the environment are meant to reassure the moderates. He knows he'll never get all the weapons he's asked for, but he figures that they'll cut whatever list he sends up here anyway, so he may as well start high and work down.''
Most of the Democrats in Congress do seem intent on whittling down the President's requests. No sooner had he proposed to cut American troop strength in Central Europe to 195,000, a figure far below any he had ever entertained publicly before, than he was being pressed to cut many more.
But whatever spin he applies to things, Mr. Bush is storing up trouble for himself by pressing for so large a military budget at a time when the main reason the American people were willing to be heavily taxed to buy weapons - their fear of attack from the Soviet Union - appears to be evaporating.
''I'm absolutely convinced that he can't sustain anything resembling this level of spending this year,'' Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, said in an interview this week. ''We don't need two manned bombers, we don't need lots of things that he has proposed, and when we finish with the budget, the money will not be there.''
 
Drastic Cuts Are Seen
Although he was unwilling to specify an figure of his own, pending the conclusion of hearings on the present shape of Soviet policy and the appropriate American response, Mr. Mitchell predicted that spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative would be ''drastically reduced,'' that either the MX mobile missile or the Midgetman missile or both would be eliminated, that several aircraft carrier groups would be cut and that far fewer B-1 Stealth bombers, if any, would be authorized.
After hearings presided over by Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Mr. Mitchell plans to try to line up most of his party behind an alternate military budget. He acknowledges that some Democratic conservatives might be unwilling to go along, but he expects to win some Republican backing. The target date, he said, is late April. As things now stand, Mr. Bush seems unlikely to prevail in the battle that will ensue. But perhaps time will be on his side. By the time a final vote is taken, events may have made the future clearer and compromise may be possible.

East Germany Agrees to Pay Reparations to the Jewish Victims of the Nazis

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
East Germany, which has long refused to accept responsibility for the crimes of the Nazis against the Jews, has for the first time agreed to pay reparations to Jewish victims, the World Jewish Congress said yesterday.
In a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the congress, Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany said his Government recognized ''the responsibility of the entire German people for the past'' and stood ready to ''provide material support'' for those who were persecuted.
West Germany made a similar declaration in 1951 and has since paid an estimated $37 billion in reparations to Israel, Jewish organizations and individual Jewish claimants.
Some 170,000 victims of the Nazis still receive regular checks from the West Germans. Mr. Modrow's letter, sent to Edgar M. Bronfman, the president of the congress, did not say how much money would be available by the East Germans. 
 
Negotiations on Amount
The amount is expected to be determined in negotiations with Israel and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the same two groups that negotiated the reparations agreement with West Germany almost 40 years ago.
The willingness of East Germany to negotiate is expected to open the way for that country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel.
East Germany has long maintained that it is in no way heir to the crimes of the Third Reich, and that its Communist leadership, long imprisoned by Hitler, fought and helped defeat the Nazis.
Jewish groups have worked hard over the years to get East Germany to accept some responsiblity. The issue was discussed in the 1974 negotiations that led to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and East Germany. Talks between Jewish organizations and the East Germans were begun at that time and have continued intermittently.
 
Collapse of the Communists
It is not clear whether Mr. Modrow's letter is the result of those sporadic talks or of the collapse of Communist dominance in East Germany. Mr. Modrow came to power last year after the fall of Erich Honecker. Under the Nazis, Mr. Honecker spent long years in concentration camps.
Heads of Jewish organizations were cautious in their reaction yesterday. Mr. Bronfman called Mr. Modrow's letter ''an important first step.'' Rabbi Israel Miller, the president of the Jewish claims organization, said, ''I hope that his deeds match his words.''
Philip M. Klutznick, chairman of the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, which administers West German reparations to help rebuild Jewish life in Europe, said such a move by the East Germans was ''only just.''
He added, ''This is a debt that can never be fully repaid.''
Mr. Modrow's letter also dealt with the fear of resurgent anti-Semitism and nationalism in his country. ''The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism and hatred among peoples, so that in the future war and Fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.''
 
West Germany's Impoverishment
It is also unclear how East Germany, which is in economic difficulty, could afford substantial reparations.
But Rabbi Miller said West Germany was impoverished after the war and was nevertheless able to pay $1 billion in reparations to Israel in the form of commodities and manufactured goods like German automobiles. He suggested that East Germany might be able to do the same.
The reparations that Israel received were for the cost of resettlement of European refugees in Israel. At the time of the negotiations over the amount to be paid to Israel, the West German Government said it was ready to assume two-thirds of the cost, arguing that the balance should be paid by East Germany. Following that logic, the East German share for Israel would be more than $300 million.
In addition to the Israeli portion, reparations for individuals and Jewish organizations will be subject to negotiations. Experts could not put a dollar amount on that yesterday.
Along with the 170,000 survivors receiving stipends, thousands of others who have come to the West in recent months from the Soviet Union as the result of the turmoil in Eastern Europe are also expected to apply.
The details of how such funds will be distributed are expected to be worked out in the negotiations. In East Berlin, Dr. Peter Kirchner, the head of a small Jewish group in East Berlin, welcomed the Modrow statement. ''The most important thing is that it's final, that it says, Yes, the G.D.R. fully recognizes its share of guilt, and also that the G.D.R. feels itself bound by this responsibility,'' he said.
 
Modrow's Wish
He said Mr. Modrow's interim government evidently wanted to declare itself on the subject before it was replaced in March by a democratically elected government.
In New York, Rabbi Miller, said he believed that the change to a democratic system was the ''determining factor'' in Mr. Modrow's declaration. Rabbi Miller said he neogtiated the issue of reparations with Mr. Honecker two years ago. ''We were getting no place with Honecker,'' he said.
The Modrow Government has begun talks with Israeli representatives about opening diplomatic relations between the countries. Last week, negotiators for both countries met in Copenhagen. An Israeli statement said relations with East Germany were linked to ''the question of the acceptance by the G.D.R. of its share in the moral and historical responsibility for crimes perpetrated by Germans against Jews during the Nazi regime.''

HEADLINE: Genteel Charleston Shakes Off Hugo And Starts Hurrying Toward Spring

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C.

 BODY:
On a visit to Charleston in 1880, Oscar Wilde and his host strolled through town just after dusk. The Irish author and wit remarked on the beauty of the moon rising over the harbor and the city.
''You should have seen it before the war,'' his host is said to have responded wistfully.
In a city that is synonymous with a gentility associated with the Colonial and antebellum South, that response was once typical of its Charleston-centered world view. When Charleston has been beset by often chaotic and impersonal accidents of history like hurricanes and wars, the city's residents have had an apoplectic tendency to take them personally. 
Preservationists here still speak of Charleston as an ''accreting city'' - one that in its 320 years has been lovingly layered by the passage of time, acquiring not only a variety of distinctive architectural styles but also a certainty about the order of things that has intensified its glow.
 
A Lack of Wistfulness
''But I don't see any of that same sick wistfulness after Hurricane Hugo,'' said Connie Wyrick, a spokeswoman for the Historic Charleston Foundation. ''We're so far past that, and the idea now is to protect this patrimony and move forward.''
It has been more than four months since Hurricane Hugo struck Charleston, and the city is mending. Cosmetic repairs have returned the basics of most of the city's historic buildings and homes to what they were before the hurricane, which struck Sept. 21-22.
Preservationists say that what has not been restored, and in some cases cannot be replaced, are many of Charleston's ancient oaks and such subtle architectural touches as decorative cast-iron pieces and the pressed-tin moldings that adorned cornices.
Moreover, many of Charleston's pampered English gardens are a wreck, and gardeners must wait for early spring to see what remains of the languid crepe myrtle, and the colorful azalea and magnolia. And behind many of the repaired facades, homeowners are still coping with the lingering effects of moisture and other storm damage that takes longer to emerge.
 
Two Damage Assessments
Two reports released recently sought to calculate what has already been lost.
In one report, a draft of a study by the National Trust for Historic Preservation of the hurricane's impact on ''cultural and historic resources'' in North Carolina and South Carolina, damage was estimated at $250 million. In Charleston alone, the report said, more than 2,000 historic structures were damaged.
In the other report, a National Parks Service survey of the 135 buildings in Charleston deemed to be of the greatest historical and architectural significance found that none had been completely lost. But damage to these buildings, ranging from severe structural problems to minor roof damage, was estimated at $10.5 million.
While such reports put the city's situation in some perspective, officials here fear that they may keep tourists away. And that could be devastating to the city, which attracts about three million visitors a year, worth about $400 million to its economy.
 
Very Little Major Damage
''Putting the figures aside,'' said Mayor Joseph Riley. ''the point is that the worst fury of the hurricane hit about 25 miles from the historic district and so, while no building was spared some damage, very little of the damage was major. What we have is a tremendous paint-up, fix-up, tidy-up and repair job, and the first-time visitor couldn't even tell that we had a hurricane.''
Thomas Savage, curator of the Historic Charleston Foundation, said: ''People who visit will not be dumbfounded by the storm damage because the facades are here. The silhouettes of some of the textbook examples of historic architecture are intact.''
Mr. Savage said the foundation was going ahead with its annual spring Festival of Houses and Gardens, which is scheduled for March 22 through April 21. One hundred homes will be featured in tours, he said, and things like roof and plaster damage will not stop the tours ''because that just happens to be the way we are living now.''
J. Jackson Walter, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, praised Charlestonians and particularly Mayor Riley for ''having correct values when it comes to preservation.'' He said there was no mad rush to demolish damaged buildings in Charleston as he said was the case with the National Trust in San Francisco after the earthquake there less than a month later.
 
Praise for City Leadership
''There was no Joe Riley in San Francisco,'' he said. ''Here you had a city leadership that was instantly and strongly aligned toward restoration and conservation.''
But even in a city that is sensitive to the needs of preservation, there have been problems, said Connie Wyrick, a spokeswoman for the Historic Charleston Foundation. Some of the problems centered on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's guidelines for grants for repairs.
In many cases the Federal agency uses formulas that represent standard costs nationally, and such formulas do not apply to restoration of older buildings, Mayor Riley said.
Even though the percentage of homeowners in the city's historic district was high, many of them moved quickly to settle with insurance adjusters, only to have other structural or related damage show up later. Still others chose to get quick repair jobs to damaged masonry and roofs from the army of out-of-town and often unlicensed workers that descended on the city after the storm. And the results of such haste show, some homeowners say.
 
Need for Skilled Craftsmen
''I'm convinced that some of these so-called contractors were ax murderers the week before they showed up here,'' said Mr. Savage, pointing to sloppy roofing jobs and brick work. ''There were good workmen who came in, but this city's preeminence as a preservation city is belied by the fact we just didn't have the skilled craftsmen here to do some of the work.''
For many, the storm damage provided motivation for them to learn more about their homes. For example, Phillip Middleton, a lawyer who lives in a home that was built in 1783, the mystery was how to repair the slate roof damaged when a chimney toppled.
After calling the British Embassy and making several trans-Atlantic telephone calls, Mr. Middleton was able to identify the quarry that supplied all of the purplish slate intended for crown colony buildings in the 18th century, and arranged for a representative of the company to come to Charleston to advise and supply homeowners.
''When he said the quarry had been active and operating since the 12th century, even Charlestonians were impressed,'' Ms. Wyrick said.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Rules A.M.A. Acted Against Chiropractors

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court has upheld a 1987 ruling that the American Medical Association violated antitrust laws by trying to destroy the chiropractic profession.
On Wednesday, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the finding of Federal District Judge Susan Getzendanner, who barred the medical association from boycotting chiropractors, whose treatment is manipulation focusing on the spine.
George McAndrews, a lawyer for the chiropractors, said the rights they want include ''fair treatment by tax-supported institutions, hospitals, insurance plans, H.M.O.'s and other groups that have burdened those patients with anticompetitive barriers.'' 
A.M.A. policy, the plaintiffs charge, has prevented doctors from referring patients to chiropractors or taking referrals from them. The doctors were accused of preventing chiropractors from treating patients at hospitals controlled by medical doctors.
 
Association's Curbs Enjoined
On Sept. 25, 1987, Judge Getzendanner, who has since retired, permanently enjoined the A.M.A. from ''restricting, regulating or impeding'' its 275,000 members or hospitals where they work from associating with chiropractors. Earlier she found a conspiracy ''to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.''
A three-judge appellate panel ruled that Judge Getzendanner had reached a ''reasonable'' decision. The panelists were Judges David Manion, Harlington Wood Jr. and Kenneth Ripple.
She ''found a cognizable danger of recurrent violations, was unimpressed with the A.M.A.'s expressed intent to comply with antitrust laws, was unpersuaded by the effectiveness of the A.M.A.'s discontinuance of its boycott and properly considered the systematic and long-term nature of the boycott,'' the appeals panel said.
 
Internal Amendment Is Directed
Judge Getzendanner also directed the A.M.A. to publish a copy of her order in the Journal of the American Medical Association and mail all of its members and employees copies.
She also required that the association amend its Current Opinions of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, guidelines on ethical behavior to reflect that it is ethical to associate with chiropractors.
The lawsuit, filed in 1977 by four chiropractors, did not seek money damages but challenged the medical doctors' refusal to acknowledge chiropractors' professional abilities.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article by The Associated Press yesterday about an antitrust ruling against the American Medical Association for its boycott of chiropractors described the Federal appeals court's opinion incompletely in some copies. The opinion, by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, said the A.M.A. had economic motives but was acting mostly out of concern about scientific methods in patient care.

HEADLINE: For Nebraska Governor, a Hard Path

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROKEBY, Neb., Feb. 7

 BODY:
She is ''just plain Kay,'' Nebraska's Governor told students in a rural two-room schoolhouse here, but that is not a view that is very widely held.
Gov. Kay A. Orr, the pride of Republicans across the country and a target of Democrats here at home, was pursuing what she says is one of the most pleasurable privileges of her office, visiting public schools around the state.
But on the visits today, as she tackled questions that would have done justice to a news conference in the state capital of Lincoln, not too far away, the topics made it clear why Mrs. Orr, a Republican officeholder in a Republican state, is a beleaguered candidate as she prepares to seek re-election.
A lot of Nebraskans think she has broken faith with them when she merely made a mistake, she told a student who asked her about a change in tax policy that resulted in a tax increase that she said was unintended. One of her pledges in her first campaign was that she would not raise taxes. 
 
Erosion of Poll Standing
The Governor is trying to reverse an erosion in her standing in opinion polls over the last two years. The effort is expected to be bolstered by a fund-raising visit to Omaha on Thursday by President Bush. Support for her campaign has also come from recent visits by Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, and by Jack F. Kemp, Mr. Bush's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
In December 1987, at her highest point in opinion polls conducted by The Omaha World-Herald, 60 percent of Nebraskans interviewed said they approved of the job she was doing as Governor and 25 percent disapproved. By the following March, that rating had fallen to 48 percent approval while 38 percent disapproved.
Since then, her approval rating in the poll has never again topped 50 percent. The latest poll, in December, based on interviews with 615 adults in the state, gave her an approval rating of 47 percent and disapproval of 46 percent, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Those polling results are apparently one element that has encouraged several Democrats to weigh candidacies for the primaries, to be held May 8. So far they include Bill Harris, Mayor of Lincoln; Bill Hoppner, former chief of staff to her predecessor, Bob Kerrey, now a United States Senator; Ben Nelson, an Omaha lawyer, and Mike Boyle, a former Mayor of Omaha. As yet Mrs. Orr has no opponent in the Republican primary. Concern Within the G.O.P. The polls have also stirred concern among national Republicans, who have been able to point to Mrs. Orr as the first Republican woman to be elected Governor of any state, as well as a determination to help keep her in office.
The shadow of the campaign was evident in today's schoolhouse questions and answers.
It was a question from a boy, ''Why did you raise our taxes?'' that gave Mrs. Orr a chance to explain, by inference, her slippage in the polls. That slippage followed a change the Governor pushed through the Legislature in 1987, decoupling state income taxes from the Federal tax system and setting new rate schedules for state taxpayers.
She had run for Governor pledging no tax increases and, she often explains, the change she urged was intended neither to raise nor to lower taxes. As it worked out, however, it raised taxes at many income levels. And, she acknowledges, it has alienated many voters despite the fact that she has successfully sponsored corrective legislation.
''I'm going to be explaining that'' throughout the campaign, Mrs. Orr told the students. ''Folks thought I had raised their taxes, and they were very angry about that.''
The Governor's ''just plain Kay'' remark came in answer to a question, ''What's your real name?'' ''It's not short for Katherine or anything else,'' she said. ''It's just plain Kay.''
When a girl asked about how Mrs. Orr was helping the homeless, the Governor took the opportunity to praise the child, saying, ''That shows you are very sensitive.'' The Governor also took the opportunity to allude to legislation that she regards as one of her triumphs, providing for tax benefits for companies that create job opportunities, saying that ''a healthy economy is one of the ways'' to solve the problems that lead to homelessness.
 
Economic Gains Cited
According to her figures, the results so far are 23,000 new and prospective jobs and a jobless rate that has fallen to 2.7 percent, from 5.5 percent when she took office in January 1987. More neutral commentary gives her considerable credit for the program but puts the figure at closer to 11,000 jobs created so far.
Some of Mrs. Orr's opponents like to picture her as a tough, hard-edged politician, and some have made sarcastic allusions to the fact that she appeared with a 20-month-old grandson on her 51st birthday on Jan. 2 when she announced her decision to run for re-election. Some have speculated that the appearance with her grandchild was a calculated device to demonstrate warmth - a theory that clearly angers her.
''I am also a wife, a mother and a grandmother,'' she said as she described her job to the children. And besides her two children, she continued, she has ''two dogs, two cats and a horse.''
She addressed such criticism another way in a conversation between visits to the two schools. Mrs. Orr warned, ''It's going to be a dirty campaign.''
''They are wrong,'' she said, referring to her critics. ''I am strong, but people who know me know there's no sham.''

HEADLINE: Darman and Moynihan Joust Over Social Security

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, faced off over Social Security today for the first time in a public forum.
By the time the hearing of the Senate Finance Committee was over, it appeared that neither Senator Moynihan's proposal to cut the Social Security tax nor the Bush Administration's plan to use the surplus in Social Security revenues to begin paying off the Federal debt in five years had enough support to become law.
But the Social Security issue has created so much controversy that some changes may be inevitable.
Senator Moynihan's proposal, which would reduce Government income by more than $60 billion over the next two years, has gained little backing among his fellow Democrats. It may have been dealt a fatal blow today when Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said he could not support it. 
 
'Many Mutations' Are Seen
''That much loss of revenue would cause serious problems for the economy,'' Senator Bentsen told reporters. But the Texas Democrat quickly added that ''many mutations'' of the Moynihan plan were floating about and that he might favor one or more of them.
The Administration's plan, which would allow the surplus in Social Security funds to continue to cover general Government operating expenses through 1995, has almost no support among Democrats, and many Republicans have broken ranks with the White House.
But Mr. Darman said the Administration was not wedded to the specific proposal and was willing to consider others.
Adding to the prospects that changes in the system are in the offing, Democratic leaders from the Senate and House have been meeting to work out a Social Security alternative the party can support. So far, they have been unable to agree on one.
 
A Scarcity of Sparks
The confrontation between Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat, and Mr. Darman caused fewer sparks than might have been expected from two of the most nimble minds in Washington, in part because both have made their cases so many times recently.
Mr. Moynihan maintained, as he has for weeks, that it was unfair to collect from workers Social Security taxes meant to finance their retirement, and use the money to cover part of the budget deficit caused by the Government's failure to collect as much in other taxes as it spends for day-to-day expenses. The billions of dollars in revenue that would be lost by his proposal, he declared, would be ''no great sum to make up.'' He suggested that much of it could be offset by deeper cuts in military spending.
Mr. Darman argued that the Moynihan plan risked ''fiscal policy havoc'' by substantially increasing the budget deficit. He suggested that the Senator ''seems to give up on the problem, just when the political system is preparing to deal with it.''
 
Agreement on Problem
While the solutions are in dispute, the ''problem'' to which Mr. Darman referred is recognized by politicians of both parties. It is this:
The Government over all is running a sizable budget deficit. Meanwhile, the Social Security system is collecting an increasing amount more each year in payroll taxes than it is paying out in retirement, disability and survivors' benefits. The excess in this fiscal year is $66 billion. The total Federal deficit, according to the calculation of the Congressional Budget Office, is expected to be $138 billion. But if Social Security is taken out of the calculation, the deficit would be put at $204 billion.
The Social Security surplus is a result of the schedule of payroll tax increases enacted in 1983. The purpose of the increases was twofold: to insure solvency in the system in the short run and to build up a reserve to guarantee that pensions could be paid to members of the baby-boom generation when they retire early in the next century. Workers and their employers now pay 7.65 percent each, 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare, up to a maximum of $3,924 a year.
The Social Security surplus, however, grew much faster than anticipated because the economy did better than expected. The overall budget deficit, caused by lower taxes, higher military spending and the failure to cut spending for domestic programs, also grew more than expected.
 
A Collection of I.O.U.'s
Under law, the Social Security surplus is paid into a trust fund and is used to buy Treasury securities. If there were no budget deficit, the investment of Social Security funds in Treasury securities would mean the Government would have to borrow less from the public, allowing more private money to be invested in plants, equipment and other productive enterprises.
When the budget is in deficit, the money the Treasury gets from selling the securities to the Social Security system is spent for general expenses, from paperweights to warships.
But even when no budget deficit exists, the trust fund is nothing but a collection of i.o.u.'s. When the Treasury securities come due, the Government must tax or borrow enough to repay them. The reserve is merely a Government promise to do that in the next century to pay retirement benefits.
The theory behind building a Social Security surplus was that it would stimulate enough private investment that the economy would grow. The increased standard of living that would result would make it easier for workers in the next century to pay for the retirement of the baby-boomers.
Senator Moynihan maintains that since the money is not now being used to improve the economy, the tax increases ought to be reversed. The Administration's plan is to continue to cut the deficit gradually until it reaches zero in 1995 and to earmark the surplus after that for debt reduction.

HEADLINE: Adversaries at the Table: The Labor Negotiators

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Like players, they have distinctive styles. Like owners, they have distinctive interests.
But Donald M. Fehr, the executive director of the baseball players' union, and Charles P. O'Connor, the executive director of the club owners' labor team, probably have more in common with each other than with the men who preceded them in the economic wars that revolutionized baseball over the last 20 years. Both are lawyers who have spent their careers in labor relations, both are somewhat professional and cool in manner, both are known as negotiators and not as warriors. 
They are also confronting each other in the talks on a new basic agreement for major league baseball. And they should make more baseball news than any of the players and clubs they represent if the spring training camps are kept closed until the two lawyers reach some sort of agreement or understanding.
 
Worked with Miller
Fehr has been there before. He was there as an associate of Marvin Miller in 1976 when the players shattered the century-old assumption that they belonged to the teams that hired them, and he was there during the next decade when the players consolidated their free-agent revolution. Now he is their leader as the players try to retain the clout that has made them entrepreneurs with salaries soaring past $3 million a year.
O'Connor is new to the scene, at least as a visible member of the cast. He is a Washington lawyer who worked on the sidelines for the last two years as an outside labor counsel to the Player Relations Committee, the owners' bargaining arm. Then, like a late replacement for the starting pitcher, he got the call when Barry Rona resigned as director of the committee last November on the eve of the start of negotiations.
''He's reserved and not flamboyant, but he is witty and he has a good sense of humor,'' said Rich Levin of the commissioner's office. ''But he is a tough guy deep down, and he's not afraid of confrontations. Barry was more of a down-home sort; Chuck is more formal. I guess you'd say he is lawyerlike in his manner.''
O'Connor was born in Boston 49 years ago and grew up cheering for the Red Sox. He graduated from Holy Cross in 1963 and from the Boston College Law School in 1966, and he had no doubt what he wanted to do, even when he was working as a bricklayer: he wanted to be a labor lawyer. Started With N.L.R.B. He got his start in the general counsel's office of the National Labor Relations Board in Washington. Then, 21 years ago, he joined the Washington law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. Three years later, he became a partner.
He got into baseball somewhat by chance in 1981, the year the players went on strike for 50 days and the big leagues were shut down for two months. He was asked to work on a project for Anheuser-Busch, which owns the St. Louis Cardinals, and after that he divided his baseball loyalty between the Red Sox and the Cardinals.
He is a formidable figure at 6 feet 3 inches and more than 200 pounds. He and his wife, Linda, have four children. And, although not well known in baseball, he is unmistakably the architect of the owners' radical proposal for revenue-sharing among the clubs and a statistical formula for setting salaries for players who have been in the big leagues between one and six years.
He is also the latest in a line of management negotiators that included John Gaherin, who once represented New York's newspapers in labor troubles; Ray Grebey, once the labor trouble-shooter for General Electric, and Lee MacPhail, the former president of the American League, who served as a ''healing'' choice in the increasingly turbulent relations between the clubs and the players.
 
Into Labor Law Early
The man across the table from O'Connor these days, Fehr, was born 41 years ago in Indiana, the son of a businessman. He grew up in Prairie Village, Kan., earned his bachelor's degree at Indiana University and his law degree in 1973 at the University of Missouri. He also got into labor law early, and stayed.
He started as a law clerk for Judge Elmo Hunter of the United States District Court in Kansas City, Mo., then joined the Kansas City law firm of Jolley, Moran, Walsh, Hager & Gordon. He was there when the landmark case of Andy Messersmith was tried in Federal court in Kansas City in 1975, and the firm was selected as the local representative of the Major League Baseball Players' Association for the trial. Messersmith was suing for the right to become a free agent, and won.
The next year, Fehr joined the players' union full time as general counsel when Richard Moss left, and worked closely with Miller, who was the strategist of the players' revolution and the executive director of their union. When Miller retired in 1983, the union named a Federal mediator, Kenneth Moffett, as his replacement. But he was dismissed in November that year, and Fehr took charge.
 
Not a Warrior or Orator
Fehr is a studied, smooth-faced man of medium height who once rooted for the Kansas City Royals and later the Yankees. He and his wife, Stephanie, have four children. He doesn't resemble Miller as a warrior or orator, and in fact was characterized last year by his mentor in these words:
''He's not as aggressive as he should be with people who lie and cheat. It shows he lacks the background of a trade unionist. It shows a lawyer's mentality.''
''I don't mean Don's wrong,'' Miller said. ''But he and I have different standards in labor-management relationships.''
Miller was asked this week if his successor was confrontational enough, and he said: ''This is no time to be second-guessing anybody. The situation is confrontational now.''

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The Superczar

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Just before his fatal heart attack, Andrei Sakharov went before the Soviet Parliament to plead for an end to the monopoly power of the Communist Party; Mikhail Gorbachev shut him up and cut him off.
Now that multiparty dream is becoming a reality. With the simple presentation to voters of a choice between opposing candidates, the dead hand of Leninist totalitarianism will be lifted. The honoring of opposition is the beginning of political freedom. 
Sakharov and some of his reform group had a second goal: to break the monopoly of Government ownership, permitting private property and free markets to generate national wealth.
That thrust for economic freedom was blunted by the Politburo only six weeks ago, as Mr. Gorbachev agreed with Communist ideologues and apparatchiks to try a form of perestroika that did not give up central control. Such strangling ''democratic centralism'' was again endorsed by the plenum, but a law permitting the privatization of some property is also on the agenda - a little, and late.
Sakharov, almost alone, dared to offer a third goal: to make it impossible in the Soviet Union for any ruler to have too much power. Of what use would a multiparty system and a market economy be if their very existence depended on the whim of one man?
Benevolent despotism exists in Moscow; Sakharov's main concern remains valid. The fever of democracy, the fierce (but secret) debate about direction, the first assemblage of a huge crowd in Red Square in 70 years - all these thrilling, historic events are taking place concurrent with the consolidation of power in a single pair of hands.
''The Party's Over,'' cry the Western headlines - as if the crumbling of Communist Party monopoly guaranteed lusty political competition for the job of national leader.
On the contrary, the coming fractionalization of the party will remove the last challenge to one-man control of the Government. Centralization of authority has not been defeated; the center of power has simply moved across the hall.
Mikhail Gorbachev now has more power than any czar, more of a personality cult than Stalin. He has undermined the corrupt party and created his own Government hierarchy in which only the president need not stand for election. Hello, Superczar.
Should we rejoice at the results of the Moscow plenum? Of course: it was one more manifestation of the victory of capitalism over Communism, a triumph already made plain everywhere by the difference in living standards of free and unfree peoples.
Should we admire the manipulations of the most daring opportunist of our century? Pursued by the wolves of depression and dissension, he has tossed the nations of Eastern Europe from the Soviet sled, and further unburdened himself of heavy Leninist doctrine.
That's admirable, but it's not enough; the wolves are catching up. He has to toss over the heavy arms spending that bogged him down originally, let the Baltic nations slip away to long-deserved independence, and kick weighty Cuba and arms-addicted Syria off the sled.
Without those wolves of necessity at his heels, Mr. Gorbachev would not have felt the urge to spin off the satellites, to demobilize some troops, to attack the Communist Party or introduce the ownership law.
None of that was part of his plan, as his early writing, five years of blunders and recent flip-flops made clear. Improvising brilliantly, the superczar is at last moving toward a multiparty system at home, but democracy cannot be dictated; one-man rule, no matter how benevolent the despot, is no better than one-party rule.
The ability of a crowd to gather in Red Square is just as historic as the secret vote in the meeting hall; that was televised and will be contagious.
Soon we will see more crowds, protest parades, strike-supporting demonstrations. Many will be shouting their anger at food shortages and joblessness, others at ethnic scapegoats, but enough will be demanding more say in their own lives.
President Bush is said to be considering a higher-profile envoy to Moscow, like his fellow Texan Robert Strauss. He should choose that sort of direct dealer who can speak frankly about democracy.
For political freedom, you need a vigorous, organized opposition; for economic salvation, you need private property and free markets; for world cooperation, you need to withdraw your troops from Eastern Europe and free the Baltic nations; for legitimacy, you must make it possible for the people to choose their leaders and have the right to vote them out. Most especially including the President.

HEADLINE: Region Grapples With Sluggish Sales-Tax Revenues

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Like seers pondering the auguries, economists and government officials in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey are sifting through sales-tax receipts for a vision of the region's future.
Their predictions - how much people will spend and thus how much tax money will come in - have always been crucial to the budget process that occupies all three state governments around this time of year. And until recently the job was not difficult. In Connecticut, for example, sales-tax collections - the main source of revenue in the state - rose by a steady 5 percent or more in every year except one from 1971 to 1988. 
But all that has ended over the last few years, with an unexpected slowing of sales-tax collections in the Northeast from Massachusetts to New Jersey. The collections have continued to grow but at a sharply slower rate - about 3 percent to 5 percent a year across the region compared with almost three times that rate in the mid-1980's. As a result, statehouses are searching for new tax-collection formulas, and some tax experts are seeing changes that go beyond a temporary economic slowdown.
 
'Already Bought the House'
''A part of the population is maturing, and they've already bought the house, they've got the VCR, they've got three televisions and they haven't worn out yet,'' said Dr. Richard L. Kaluzny, chief of the office of tax analysis at the division of taxation in New Jersey, where sales-tax revenues are expected to grow by only 3 percent this year, compared with 11 percent or more through the mid-1980's. ''My suspicion is that this has a lot more to do with demographics than we realize.''
The downturn in sales-tax growth has coincided with an increase in the national savings rate, and some experts say this is one sign among several that lower tax collections - and perhaps a long-term slower growth rate for state spending - may become a permanent budgetary reality in the 1990's.
''Sales taxes are like stock prices - an instantaneous expression of what's going on,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, the chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York. ''Elected officials should sit up and take notice.''
State budget officials, who must ultimately make revenue-growth predictions, said however, that with so much of the sales-tax equation depending on the mood of consumers - whether they are optimistic about the future and buying goods or pessimistic and saving money - predicting slower tax-collection rates and cutting state services in anticipation of such declines could be self-fulfilling; they would send an even stronger message to consumers that times are hard, the officials said, and consumers in turn would buy less.
 
An Optimistic Prediction
In Connecticut, for example, budget officials on Wednesday released what they immediately conceded was an optimistic prediction of 5 percent growth in sales-tax revenues for the year that begins on July 1, and said they believed that pent-up demand would provide part of the fuel.
The projected increase, which Mr. Kellner and several other economists rejected as unrealistically high, would follow a year in which sales-tax collections actually fell in Connecticut for the first time in recent memory. Although state budget officials said the dollar totals did increase during the year, it was only because the sales-tax rate went up last July 1, from 7.5 percent to 8 percent.
New Jersey's sales tax is 6 percent. In New York, the state collects a 4 percent sales tax and local sales taxes vary, although most are between 3 and 4 percent.
Dr. Kaluzny in New Jersey said that another problem in predicting sales-tax revenues accurately is that ''nobody wants to believe it'' when a grim revenue forecast is made. If the prediction is wrong, he said, painful cuts in state services may have been made unneccessarily. If the prediction is right, solving the problem will have at least been postponed until the next budget.
Dr. Kaluzny said he beleived that sales-tax revenues would rise about 3 percent in New Jersey in the next year. Gov. Jim Florio will present his budget and sales-tax projection to the Assembly next month.
 
Exemptions Aggravate Problem
''Who goes to the dentist to get preventive root-canal surgery?'' he said. ''You tend not to want to do it.'' What may have also aggravated the prediction problem, at least in Connecticut, are the sales-tax exemptions that were passed into law in the mid-1980's, when revenues were rising rapidly and the money was not needed. The new laws, intended to make the sales-tax fall less heavily on the poor, made any item of clothing under $75 exempt from the tax, as well as any meal costing under $2.
The result was to make the tax base depend even more on consumers' buying higher-priced merchandise, usually the items that consumers could put off buying if need be.
''The regular purchases, the things you buy in good times or bad, have been taken out,'' said Richard H. Mattoon, an economist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, a business-lobby group.
But there are also efforts to broaden the types of transactions covered by the sales tax. In New York, for example, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo - who has also predicted a 5 percent sales-tax growth rate for the next year - proposed a new law last month that would generate $45 million in new revenue by taxing people on the value of their used cars. Under current law, when a car owner trades in his vehicle for a new one, the value of the trade-in is deducted from the price of the new car when the sales tax is calculated.
Last year, the Connecticut General Assembly also extended the state sales tax to cover many services like payments to gardeners or accountants, and repealed the sales-tax exemption for low-cost meals.
Ultimately, however, most economists said that a key source of the sales-tax downturn - the fact that people are not buying, building or furnishing as many houses as they were a few years ago - would persist for the time being regardless of what the states do. And Mr. Kellner at Manufacturers Hanover said he thought that any turnaround in sales-tax revenues was unlikely for perhaps 18 months, not soon enough to help the state budgets that will become law over the next few months.
But Connecticut officials believe the rebound will come in time to save them.
''We do not believe 5 percent is an unrealistic goal,'' said Connecticut's chief budget officer, Anthony V. Milano, the secretary of the Office of Policy and Management.

HEADLINE: Noise Rules for New Nightclubs Approved

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
The Board of Estimate approved a mixed bag of rules yesterday that it said would strike a balance between New York's often noisy nightclubs and their neighbors who seek peace and quiet.
When the regulations were first proposed by the City Planning Commission last summer, it was thought that they might fundamentally change night life in New York City. But the rules adopted by the Board of Estimate are far less restrictive than the original offerings and apply only to new nightclubs, not existing ones.
Originally, the commission had proposed earlier closing times for new clubs in commercial and residential areas unless they obtained a special permit, but it dropped this after encountering strong objections. Clubs can now stay open until 4 A.M. Cabaret Group May Sue Still, the new regulations displeased the New York Cabaret Association, which said they would discourage the opening of new clubs and adversely affect the night life and economy in New York City. A lawyer for the association, Robert S. Bookman, said there would likely be a lawsuit challenging some provisions. 
Among the new regulations is one that will generally require new large clubs planned for certain areas, like TriBeCa, SoHo and the Flatiron district of Manhattan, to meet specified conditions, and to obtain a special city permit.
To grant a new club a special permit, the city's Board of Standards and Appeals would have to find, among other things, that the proposed club would not impair the character of the surrounding area and that it would not cause undue congestion in local streets.
Small jazz clubs and other establishments with musical entertainment, but no dancing, and with a capacity of no more than 200 patrons, will not be required to obtain special permits.
Other small clubs with non-musical entertainment - like comedy clubs or poetry clubs will need a permit to open in some areas, largely in boroughs other than Manhattan.
New dance clubs and certain other establishments with a capacity of more than 200 patrons will, for the most part, be required to locate their entrances at least 100 feet from the nearest residential district.
 
Insuring 'Good Neighbors'
They will also be required to provide at least four square feet of indoor waiting space for each patron they can accommodate - a provision intended to prevent, at least at new clubs, long lines of patrons waiting outside the establishments.
Sandy Hornick, zoning director of the Department of Planning, said those requirements would make sure that the new clubs ''will be good neighbors.''
Residents of some neighborhoods where there are highly popular discos have complained that the waiting crowds are often boisterous, cause vandalism, and generally adversely affect their areas.
Because a previous city law that set a limit of three musicians at a time on stage in many of the city's small clubs and cabarets was declared unconstitutional by a State Supreme Court justice in 1988, the new regulations specified no limits for such clubs. But it said those clubs cannot have a cover charge or have specified show times.
 
Opposed by Golden
Planning officials said that the regulations should encourage more small clubs to open.
The lone Board of Estimate member to vote against the regulations, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, said in a statement read by a representative, that the new zoning would have no effect on existing ''bad neighbor'' discos and clubs and ''are just too seriously flawed'' in other respects.
But Ruth W. Messinger, the Borough President of Manhattan, in voting for the amended zoning proposals, said the new regulations strike ''a proper balance between community concerns and a recognition of the importance of New York's dynamic night life.''
She said she was confident they would ''preserve both New York's worldwide reputation as an entertainment capital'' and the desire of many communities for ''peace and quiet.''

HEADLINE: 2 Gang Members Slain in Chinatown Restaurant

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
A clash between rival Vietnamese and Chinese gang members in Chinatown early yesterday left two young men dead and three people wounded, the authorities said.
The police identified the suspected assailants as members of the Canal Street Boys, which they said was the latest name adopted by a gang of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam.
The two youths who were killed were identified by the police as Peter Wng, 20 years old, and Dak Leong, 19. Both were said to be members of the Chinese gang known as the Ghost Shadows. 
 
A Heated Turf Feud
The authorities said the attack appeared to be the latest chapter in a turf feud between the relatively new gangs like the Canal Street Boys, and the older established Chinatown gangs, like the Ghost Shadows.
The police said the Canal Street Boys, who have been operating mostly on Canal Street for the last two years, have been involved in extortion, robberies and several homicides.
The latest incident began at 3:50 A.M., the police said, when a group entered Winnie's Bar and Restaurant, at 104 Bayard Street in Chinatown, and opened fire. Mr. Wong was pronounced dead at the scene, and Mr. Leong died on arrival at Bellevue Hospital Center.
A police spokesman, Det. Joseph McConville, said two people were wounded inside the restaurant. He identified them as Robert Shu, 27, shot in the groin, and Theresa Lau, 21, shot once in the left upper arm. Other police sources said that neither Mr. Shu nor Ms. Lau was known to be a gang member. Ms. Lau is a student at New York University.
A police officer parked in front of Police Headquarters heard the shots and chased a man with a gun who ran from the restaurant, the Chief of Detectives, Joseph R. Borrelli said. The officer, who was not identified, shot the suspect, Qui Tram, 23, in the left shoulder and arm, the police said. He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital and was listed in stable condition last night. The police had not charged Mr. Tram as of last night.
''I heard some people shooting and the noise woke me up,'' said Sebastian Rueda, a 41-year-old unemployed and homeless carpenter, who has been camping out in the pavilion at Columbus Park just opposite Winnie's. He said there were often loud late night brawls in the place, but ''this time was different.''

Bogosian Illuminates Life in the City

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
It's not news that Eric Bogosian is a great talent, a chameleon actor and penetrating social observer whose one-man shows have staked out their own mean streets in the crowded 1980's theatrical territory inhabited by Lily Tomlin, Spalding Gray, Whoopi Goldberg and so many others, from stand-up comedians to sit-down performance artists. Nor will it be news that ''Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll,'' Mr. Bogosian's new show at the Orpheum, follows the format of such preceding recitals as ''Fun House'' and ''Drinking in America.'' Once again the actor appears in black jeans, sneakers and white shirt to take the audience on a nonstop 90-minute tour through the mental states of men who live in these United States.
But there is news at ''Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll,'' and it is this: with this brilliant show, his funniest and scariest yet, Mr. Bogosian has crossed the line that separates an exciting artist from a culture hero. What Lenny Bruce was to the 1950's, Bob Dylan to the 1960's, Woody Allen to the 1970's - that's what Eric Bogosian is to this frightening moment of drift in our history. With the possible exception of Spike Lee, I know of no one else like him in pop culture right now. He knows which way the wind is blowing, and in ''Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll,'' those icy currents smack you right in the face. 
The show opens just as the day does for so many in the audience. A gimpy, insistent subway panhandler ''just released from Rikers Island'' announces to the captive straphangers: ''This is the situation - I need your money.'' What follows is a riotous amalgam of the familiar spiels, and Mr. Bogosian, his large green eyes glazed, leaves little doubt that the reformed junkie pleading for spare change is still on drugs. But should the beggar's needs be dismissed because he's lying? Not necessarily. As the man drones on, attempting to flatter his potential benefactors by recycling the jargon he's picked up in a lifetime of contact with the city's social and penal bureaucracies, Mr. Bogosian subtly but even more corrosively indicts the system that greases the skids and blights hope for those who need help. ''Underneath it all,'' says the subway beggar, ''we're exactly the same.''
Mr. Bogosian's next character - a fatuous, aging English rock star plugging his wares on a talk show -would seem to belie that statement. The musician is an anti-drug crusader who has joined forces with such other public moralists as Dan and Marilyn Quayle. (''She's hot - she's very hot!,'' the rocker assures his skeptical young fans about the Second Lady). But as he takes deep drags on his cigarette and glamorizes his own drug past in every show-biz reminiscence, it's clear that the rock star is as much of a con artist as the subway hustler; only the size of the stakes has changed.
By the time he gets around to pitching his favorite cause, the Amazonian Indians - a charity that seems to be inspired more by the rock star's egomania and unacknowledged racism than by the needs of the third world poor -Mr. Bogosian has come full circle. With only two characters, he has mapped out the entire international cycle of drug dependency, official hypocrisy and economic exploitation that leaves the homeless locked in subterranean hell and the coked-up rich in Hollywood heaven, with everyone else, especially the young, battling the fallout in between.
In the roughly one dozen bits that follow, Mr. Bogosian fills in more and more of the bleak Western landscape of 1990. A raving, phlegm-spewing old man delivers an obsessive but persuasive exegesis of the industrial age's death cycle, the pollution patterns that turn cities into ''human septic tanks'' and oceans into ''giant vats of oil and garbage and dead animals.'' Yet the monologue is not an environmentalist's boilerplate but rather a baroque fantasy, part Twain and part Ben Jonson, in which the narrative sweep takes in everyone from urinating outdoorsmen to well-heeled passengers vomiting caviar and pate on an ocean cruise.
Just as far-reaching is the chilling soliloquy that concludes the evening. An unreconstructed 1960's dropout sits cross-legged at stage edge to make the case that the United States is already an ''occupied country'' run by computers, whether fax machines or supermarket checkout stations, that plot against people all night by jabbering to one another in indecipherable languages. With the aid of television's power to deliver subliminal messages, the machines may already be in charge. How else, the man reasonably asks, can one explain the proliferation of microwave ovens - a superfluous, television-hawked appliance whose only logical use may be to fry the nation's households en masse when the computers stage their coup?
This is paranoia, of course, but like the paranoia in a Hitchcock movie, it's a little too close for comfort. And by inhabiting his characters instead of condescending to them, Mr. Bogosian doesn't allow anyone a safe distance from his less philosophical men, like the Mametesque entrepreneur who uses each of four phone lines (and an intercom) to betray a different business associate or loved one, or the self-made exponent of ''the good life'' showing off his new Olympic-size swimming pool with a pride inextricably bound to a fear of death, or the violent criminal who admiringly likens George Bush to Batman.
Mr. Bogosian's unflaggingly intense impersonations, directed by Jo Bonney on a simple but evocative set designed by John Arnone, are flawless; he doesn't need costume or makeup changes to give each character a distinct face, voice and posture. And as always, Mr. Bogosian is a hilarious wit: there is one line after another, not too many repeatable here, that you will quote to friends. He is also a born storyteller with perfect pitch for the voices of various ethnic, racial and economic backgrounds. A monologue in which an Italian-American hoodlum describes ''the best night I ever had in my life'' - a pornographic tale of urban mayhem in which he and his drugged pals lay waste to a McDonald's as well as to themselves - is too riveting to dismiss as revolting.
Yet Mr. Bogosian isn't a documentarian, an X-rated Studs Terkel running a tape recorder. And he isn't a public scold of either the left or right, setting political agendas. His sketches don't end with neat moral codas but trail off, like distant radio stations vanishing into the night on a dark highway. The highly original writing in ''Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll'' is realer than journalism - and more frightening - and its depth helps boost Mr. Bogosian to a new plateau.
This show is much more of a piece than ''Talk Radio,'' his one attempt to collaborate with other actors in a more conventional play. Though the characters don't share scenes, they do share a coherently depicted (if incoherent) civilization (if that's the word for it) where homelessness, guilt and an addictive desire to feel ''wonderful'' (a state attained with drugs, power, money or sex) are ubiquitous. The characters we don't see - the abused secretary, the obsequious talk-show host, the tense subway passengers - are often as vivid as the men who do parade across the stage.
The canvas is far broader than the title and quirky cast of characters suggest. Leaving the show, one is struck not so much by the uncanny resemblance between the real-life beggars outside the theater and the fictional ones of Mr. Bogosian's impersonations as by the way ''Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll'' as a whole forces the audience to examine its own roles in the larger drama that, however unwillingly, it shares daily with the dispossessed.
The last of Mr. Bogosian's characters argues that the homeless are threatening not just because they evoke suffering and guilt but also because they represent revolt and freedom. They are the people who have been ''thrown out of their cages,'' he says, because they refused to do ''what they're supposed to do.'' At this remarkable historical moment, people all over the world are being thrown out of their cages, and among American writers for the theater, Mr. Bogosian is the first to see his own society as part of the big picture. Using every powerful means available to a theater artist, he shakes the cages of a complacent country engulfed by homelessness to ask just exactly who, if anyone, is at home.
 
IS THAT ALL THERE IS? - SEX, DRUGS, ROCK & ROLL, written and performed by Eric Bogosian; directed by Jo Bonney; set design by John Arnone; lighting by Jan Kroeze; sound by Jan Nebozenko; production stage manager, Pat Sosnow; produced in association with Ethel Bayer and William Suter. Presented by Frederick Zollo and Robert Cole, in association with 126 Second Avenue Corporation and Sine/D'Addario Ltd. At the Orpheum Theater, 126 Second Avenue, at Eighth Street.

A Lesson in Love
''I tell you that Turgenev has written this book as a kind of warning to young people,'' Jerzy Skolimowski was saying.
The Polish-born film maker was explaining how he had become gripped years ago by the Russian author's novel ''Torrents of Spring'' and had, at last, been able to turn it into his latest film, opening today.
''I read it a very long time ago, when I was in school in Poland,'' said Mr. Skolimowski, who has been living for the last five years in Santa Monica, Calif. ''And that was a time when we had Stalinism blooming, in the early 50's; and our contact with real literature was limited. And what we had to read were Social Realism books of that period. Very few classics were allowed. Among them, fortunately, was Turgenev, whose works I read early and liked very much.'' 
''Not only this,'' Mr. Skolimowski said of ''Torrents of Spring,'' ''but 'Fathers and Sons.' Those were my favorite books at the time.''
After many years, Mr. Skolimowski happened to mention his interest to Jeremy Thomas, the producer of the Academy Award-winning ''Last Emperor,'' among other films, while the two were working on Mr. Skolimowski's memorable 1979 film, ''The Shout.''
About a year ago, Mr. Thomas heard that the Italian producer Angelo Rizzoli was planning a film of ''Torrents of Spring,'' and mentioned Mr. Skolimowski's interest. And that was how Mr. Skolimowski eventually found himself on location in Venice, Rome and Prague (the latter standing in for the central Germany of 150 years ago), with a cast led by Timothy Hutton, Valeria Golino (who played Tom Cruise's girlfriend in ''Rain Man'') and Nastassja Kinski.
Mr. Hutton portrays a young Russian aristocrat, who, during a brief stopover in a quiet German town during a journey home, falls in love with a pastry-shop owner's daughter, played by Miss Golino. But within a short time of declaring his love, he finds himself enraptured and seduced by the wanton Russian woman played by Miss Kinski, with devastating consequences.
''This,'' Mr. Skolimowski said, ''is the story of the very first love of a young man who kind of jumps into it, like an empty pool, and only 48 hours later realizes that there are other women and that he can easily be attracted to them as well.''
Mr. Skolimowski says he sees ''Torrents'' as a cautionary tale, adding, ''Be careful with the recognition of what love is and what it is not.''
In recent months, he has been a frequent visitor to Warsaw, applying his vote and prestige to the first open elections in 40 years and their rebuke to the Communist Government.
Mr. Skolimowski said it was difficult to predict what effect the liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe might have on Polish film making, ''because it's all in chaos.''
''But,'' he said, ''I believe there is a strong indication that people will have enough patience and good will to go through the difficult times. Probably this year will be the most difficult to get through. But once the whole country gets into the new economy, I believe everything will start to be different and will be blooming.
''Poles are rather talented and dedicated people, and I believe once they taste freedom - not only political but the freedom of the economy -I believe it's going to work.''
Referring to film making, he said: ''What is clear is that there won't be any political contributions anymore. Several of the creators under the Communist regime were just paying tribute to the authorities, and some of the stuff they were making was really rubbish. So that will never happen again.
''On the other hand, the healthy competition between talented artists may create a kind of stimulation. There won't be so much sponsorship from the Government. Everyone will have to be dealing with his own economic problems.
''I believe film production will become more Western.''
Mr. Skolimowski said that when the time arrives for production of his next film, perhaps he will seek some Polish participation. ''I'm willing to take a chance,'' he said. ''That would be another patriotic act.''
 
Berlin Film Festival
Oliver Stone's ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' starring Tom Cruise as the paraplegic Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, is to be screened on both sides of the Berlin wall during the Berlin Film Festival this month. The West German showing is scheduled for Feb. 17; the East German, the next day.
 
Costner, Revolutionary
Kevin Costner is to star for Orion Pictures in a film about the life of Michael Collins (1890-1922), the Irish revolutionary leader who led the battle for independence from British rule that resulted in the founding of the Irish Free State before he was assassinated by Sinn Fein irregulars. Filming is to begin in September.
 
A Retrospective
A retrospective devoted to Merchant Ivory Productions is to begin next Friday at the Angelika Film Center and run through March 2. Between start and finish, 15 films are to be shown, beginning with ''Shakespeare Wallah'' and including ''Maurice,'' ''The Europeans,'' ''A Room With a View'' and ''The Bostonians.''

Middle-Aged and Not Quite Middle Class

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
Stanley and Iris are not the sorts of characters one often meets in movies these days. They're not exactly high-profile types. There are no extraterrestrials in their lives, no vice cops and not much of anything that could pass for comedy of the thigh-slapping kind.
They may go to movies, but not with any regularity. If they have the time, they probably prefer watching television. Neither one yet owns a VCR. 
Stanley and Iris are both over 40. They are members of the working class in a society in which many blue-collar workers, though not Stanley and Iris, earn as much as if not more than people who call themselves middle class.
Stanley is a cook in the canteen of the Nevins & Davis Bakery, where Iris is a cake icer on the assembly line. He's a loner who lives with his old father and putters around inventing things.
Iris, a recent widow with two children, shares her already cluttered house with her sister and unemployed brother-in-law. Her money is hard earned, which is why she is so outraged when her purse is snatched on the bus as she's riding home from work.
Stanley comes to the rescue, but too late. The thief makes off with her paycheck. When Iris calms down, she thanks Stanley. ''Lucky you were on the bus.''
''I don't usually take the bus,'' says Stanley with nutty cheerfulness. ''My bike was stolen.''
In this way Stanley (Robert De Niro) and Iris (Jane Fonda) meet, beginning an uncommon love story about a pair of keenly observed, seemingly commonplace people.
Stanley and Iris inhabit a world so seldom acknowledged by movie makers that in Martin Ritt's ''Stanley and Iris,'' it seems as arcane as fin de siecle Paris. In fact, it's end-of-the-20th-century New England factory town.
The movie is going to be a hard sell for most of today's audiences. That will be too bad, though probably understandable. There's no easy way to describe ''Stanley and Iris'' without making it sound too noble and worthy to be much fun. Here is a ''good work'' in which two of our most high-powered film stars more or less pare down their public personalities to fit into a world that most Americans never see, even those who live out their lives in it.
Yet ''Stanley and Iris'' does not condescend. It's as honest and direct and entertaining as the considerable talents of everyone involved can make it. Not the least of these talents are Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, the writers whose eight collaborations with Mr. Ritt began with ''The Long, Hot Summer'' and include ''Hud'' and ''Norma Rae.''
Like ''Norma Rae,'' as well as ''The Molly Maguires'' and ''The Front,'' also directed by Mr. Ritt, ''Stanley and Iris'' represents a kind of committed film making that has been generally out of favor for some years. At least in part, this has been because the commitment is so often a substitute for content as well as style.
Now, in this era of music-video movie making, Mr. Ritt stands almost alone as an unembarrassed social realist and a movie maker of conscience.
''Stanley and Iris'' is not as shapely and smoothly turned as the Oscar-winning ''Norma Rae,'' which managed to celebrate unionism at a time when union busting was becoming as fashionable as conspicuous consumption. The focus of ''Stanley and Iris'' is much shorter and its concerns, to most movie audiences, even more esoteric.
Stanley, played by Mr. De Niro with great good humor and damaged feeling, is illiterate. He has somehow been able to get through life, so far, without learning how to read and write.
When he was growing up, he traveled around the country with his salesman father, never quite settling in one place long enough to receive a basic education. When, finally, they did settle, Stanley felt he was too old to go through the humiliation of first grade.
Until he meets Iris, Stanley has accommodated his disadvantage by limiting his contacts with the world, living in self-imposed isolation. ''You ask yourself,'' he says at one point, '' 'Do I have a name if I can't write it?' '' He has developed the wiliness of a thief in his stratagems to avoid exposure. Not until the practical, tough-skinned, frankly sexual Iris comes along does he find the nerve to face the facts.
''Stanley and Iris'' demands a certain effort to suspend disbelief. One might have thought that he could have learned how to sign a reasonable facsimile of his name in all these years. Yet Iris's education of Stanley Cox is both moving and funny. As long as the film sticks to this affirmative action (in which, of course, the teacher is also taught by her pupil), the movie works beautifully.
Miss Fonda's increasingly rich resources as an actress are evident in abundance here. They even overcome one's awareness that just beneath Iris's frumpy clothes, there is a firm, perfectly molded body that has become a multi-million-dollar industry. Her Iris is believable without being a type, or a census statistic. She's a singular woman of guts, common sense and freely acknowledged passion. She's idealized, but within acceptable limits.
The members of the supporting cast are equally good, including Swoosie Kurtz, as Iris's sister, Martha Plimpton and Harley Cross, as her children, and, in particular, Feodor Chaliapin, as Stanley's father, a very old man, who, while awaiting death with impassive dignity, allows his son to cut his hair.
Warning: The movie ends badly with a sequence that is so false that it almost gives the lie to all that has preceded it. It's not unlike a facelift that leaves the patient wearing a permanently unconvincing grin.
''Stanley and Iris,'' which has been rated PG-13 (''Special Parental Guidance Suggested for Those Younger Than 13''), has some vulgar language and scenes of family discord that could upset very young children.

Clothes From the Turn of a Different Century

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Clothes may make the man or the woman, but they can also make history tantalizingly real, telling tales of the social, economic and political milieus that produced them. At the moment, two exhibitions that focus on French attire of the late 18th and early 19th centuries allow clothes to do just this, although by quite different routes.
At the Fashion Institute of Technology - and organized in collaboration with the Kyoto Costume Institute of Kyoto, Japan - there is the exhibition ''Ancien Regime (Revolution in Fashion),'' a tautly beautiful show that casts an unfrivolous modernist eye on the frivolities of late Rococo dress. Moving forward in time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has ''The Age of Napoleon: Costume From Revolution to Empire, 1789-1815,'' an exhibition that opts for the sensory overload of the mise en scene, surrounding clothes with furniture, art, jewelry, weapons and even the Emperor's campaign tent.
Despite their differences, these shows go together like hand and glove or, more exactly, like cause and effect. The event they hinge on is the French Revolution, whose upheaval, among many other things, dramatically affected both contemporary dress and the fortunes of France's luxury industries, especially the textile fabriques or factories of Lyons. 
''Ancien Regime'' concentrates on the sumptuous gowns and three-piece suits of the Bourbon court, garments often made of silks, silk satins and brocades produced on the looms of Lyons. These costumes are in excellent condition: their subtle colors seem unfaded, their embroideries and laces might be brand new. At the Fashion Institute, these costumes are isolated, deservedly, like rare objets d'art, displayed on plain mannequins in plain white galleries with very little in the way of explanatory wall texts.
Nonetheless, as with a visit to Versailles, these garments speak volumes about the roots of the revolution. They also evoke a world of strict dress codes, highly skilled artisans, ordeal by undergarment and surface refinement that is nearly beyond the comprehension of the modern mind - even the minds of the most incorrigible fashion victims or ''Dangerous Liaisons'' fanatics.
On the walls, enlargements of engravings from Diderot's Encyclopedia, which catalogued the arts and industries of France for the first time, diagram the patterns, tools and techniques that produced lace, shoes, gloves, fans, wigs and buttons - in short, the vast repertory of essential accessories. Vitrines display shoes and stomachers, and hair-powdering carrots of turned wood. One display brings to light the corsets, boned bodices and hooped rattan paniers that turned women into unnaturally curved and billowing sculptures.
Best of all, of course, are the clothes themselves, illuminated by succinctly detailed labels that have an unexpected poetry of their own. Reading such descriptive phrases as ''Lyons silk cannele flower brocade decorated with blond lace and wire chenille and floss silk flowers'' or ''Spitalfields silk brocade with classically inspired ruins, vegetation and trophies,'' or ''silk painted in China'' provides pleasures similar to the passive reading of cooking recipes. Except that here the feasts are complete and delectably present.
''The Age of Napoleon'' picks up where the Fashion Institute exhibition leaves off, showing how, in the wake of the revolution, clothing became a way for citizens to express political allegiances. Parisians immediately began to dress more modestly to distance themselves from the reviled aristocracy. The boxy red carmagnole jacket and sans-culottes worn by revolutionaries in the early years of the revolution are here, as well as tricolor stockings and, yes, guillotine earrings, unexpected bits of pre-industrial kitsch. But classical antiquity, a political ideal, soon became a fashion trend. Men wore capes that resembled the togas of Rome. The loose, high-waisted Empire gown, which freed the female body from corset and panier, was also intended to suggest the Greek or Roman goddesses.
In place of esthetic focus and sense of clothes-for-art's-sake, this exhibition has a panoramic sweep, built upon constantly changing groups of artifacts and myriad details. It moves from everyday clothes of the bourgeoisie to court dress to ecclesiastical garments to military uniforms, presenting a blur of visual and historical information that the show's excellent catalogue helps to slow down, but does not entirely dispel.
Visually, one of the Napoleon show's most engaging aspects is the swift and extensively represented evolution of the simple Empire gown, from a garment made of printed cotton to a diaphanous flow of thin white muslin popularized by the Empress Josephine, to its apotheosis in the silk court dresses with their heavy bejeweled and embroidered trains. Like much else in this exhibition, the gowns offer proof of how Napoleon brought French life full circle as he proceeded from First Consul to Consul for Life to Emperor, instituting a code for court dress as sumptuous as the one that the revolution had overturned, and putting the Lyons fabriques back in business.
''Ancien Regime (Revolution in Fashion)'' can be seen at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, through Feb. 17. ''The Age of Napoleon: Costume From Revolution to Empire, 1789-1815'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through April 15.
 
Gerhard Richter: New Paintings
Marian Goodman Gallery
24 West 57th Street
Sperone Westwater
142 Greene Street
Both shows through Feb. 24
In his latest show of artistic strength, the West German Gerhard Richter continues to pit abstraction against representation, painting against photography, and pure physical paint against poetic emanation. More than ever, Mr. Richter is a brilliant tactician of the painted surface, a cool-handed mechanic whose work burns with a kind of heatless passion that is both seductive and off-putting. Like Jackson Pollock, he has evolved a no-hands, no-brush surface treatment, a method in which chance and consummate control seem to mingle effortlessly, forging an increasing visual density and power. Like the young Frank Stella, he taunts the viewer with the possibility that what you see is what you see, period.
In the past, Mr. Richter has specialized in a deep, illusionistic space and tilting diagonal brushstrokes, creating works that seemed to freeze-dry Abstract Expressionist flamboyance while also suggesting giant photographic details of a silent underwater world. Now the artist is sticking more and more to the flat of the canvas and favoring fewer colors, most prominently black and white, over the brighter, fuller spectrum of previous years.
But many of his characteristic dualities remain in place. Three small realist images - one at Goodman and two at Sperone - are on hand, signaling Mr. Richter's larger conceptual program, specifically his refusal to choose between styles. Without the realist asides, some of the smaller abstract paintings in both shows might simply look like the best lyrical abstraction ever made.
Still, the obsession with pure paint has its undeniable fascinations. The flat horizontal and vertical pulls of paint that dominate these luminous works, usually applied with big sheets of plastic, show the skin of paint stretched literally to the breaking point. And break it does, creating surfaces riddled with little gaps and fissures and enticing glimpses of earlier layers and other colors.
As usual, the effect is at once synthetic and surprisingly naturalistic. The blurred light and implied speed of these surfaces can suggest giant pieces of film passing before the eyes. Especially in two large works shown side by side at Sperone, this film seems to be burned around the edges. But these pocked, shimmering surfaces also suggest watery reflections, or surfaces of slowly melting ice - an association that presents itself even before one learns that several works are in fact titled ''Ice'' in German.
Some of the large paintings in these shows - especially a dark, looming trio of enormous double-canvas works at Goodman named after winter months - may be among the best paintings Mr. Richter has ever made. But it's hard to say. His paintings are always visually impressive, but they are also plagued by a certain sameness and a sense of nearly mass production.
At the same time, this kind of ambivalent response may be what the artist is after. Ultimately, he is a painter who refuses to commit himself absolutely to his medium, who pits the congested, eye-filling uniqueness of each canvas against its redundancy, just as he plays the continuation of painting against the possibility that painting is dead.
 
Lois Dodd
Fischbach Gallery
24 West 57th Street
Through Feb. 28
This small exhibition of small paintings by the realist Lois Dodd attests to a devotion to the nocturne that goes back some 15 years and that has served the artist well. Nighttime depiction of light, whether man-made or natural, is the constant here. Also constant is a dry, casually laid-on paint surface that conveys a distinct impression of images pinned down in a hurry, before the moon shifted behind a cloud, or the people in the house across the way turned off their living-room light. A patch of green lawn caught in lamplight, moonlight eking its way through leaves, the low-lying sparkle of a town on the horizon, the soft, slivery slope of a dirt road - these are among the best images of a good show.
 
'Shaker ''Gift'' Drawings From Hancock Shaker Village'
Hirschl & Adler Folk
851 Madison Avenue (near 70th Street)
Through Feb. 17
In this exhibition, all 24 ''gift'' drawings in the collection of the Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield, Mass., pay a rare visit to New York City. In most of them, schematic yet accurately detailed trees and gardens prevail, rendered in light watercolor tones and spreading across the paper in linear trellises. Made mostly by women as gifts to other Shakers, these drawings speak of heavenly visions while celebrating the beauty and order of nature. They also point out an unexpectedly decorative if consistently modest side to the famous Shaker austerity.
 
'Heads'
Coup de Grace Gallery
579 Broadway (near Prince Street)
Through tomorrow
This group show brings together the work of four relatively unknown artists whose primary image is the human face or head and whose primary desire seems to be a haunting, unsettling effect.
The faces in Mauro Altamura's photographs have a ghostly speed and immateriality, although their blurred grimaces rely too much on effects that Francis Bacon and Arnulf Rainer have already made familiar. Thomas Micchelli's small blue paintings of faces with bright red head wounds owe a similar debt to Leon Golub, although these works are not without impact.
Adam Simon's treatment of what might be called the ''have a good day'' face consists of two dots and a curved line on small monochrome canvases that are topped off with the phrase ''Missing.'' This image of empty-headedness is the show's one light note.
The exhibition's standouts are the small, eerie self-portraits of a photographer, John Brill, which present the artist's face and bald head in a range of scales and unfocused spaces, all vaguely aqueous, all of this world and not. In this manner, the artist minimizes his distinguishing characteristics, assuming the role of everyman while creating an atmosphere in which the pain and the comfort of self-knowledge seem equally present.

Lukewarm Ending for Auctions

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Investors gave the final portion of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions a tepid welcome yesterday, but even that was enough to push prices of notes and bonds higher.
At the auction, the Treasury sold $10 billion of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 8.50 percent, up from a yield of 7.87 percent at the last 30-year bond auction in November.
The size and range of the bids suggest that demand for the issue was not strong. A total of $18.4 billion worth of bids was received, about $2 billion less than had been bid at past auctions when the Treasury sold comparable amounts of bonds. 
 
Larger Bid Spread
The bids ranged from a low of 8.48 percent to a high of 8.53 percent. The difference between high and low bids at most Treasury auctions is seldom greater than one or two basis points, or hundredths of a point.
''By standard criteria, this was not a good auction,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides analysis on the credit and foreign exchange markets. ''But the fact that the bond came with a coupon of 8.50 percent is the key. If the yield had been a basis point lower, the coupon would have been 8 3/8 percent, and the market's reaction would have been much different.''
Prices, which moved higher before bids on the bonds were placed at 1 P.M., sagged just after the results were released. But recognition that the bond carries an 8.50 percent coupon, coupled with reports that the Bank of Japan would not raise interest rates following important legislative elections on Feb. 18, encouraged dealers to buy securities.
Fears of higher rates in Japan, which might siphon funds from the United States credit markets, have been widespread.
 
Some Bright Spots
The refunding auction, the last of three held this week, provided some bright spots, particularly the healthy demand from individual investors.
Non-competitive bids, a good gauge of private demand, amounted to $955.9 million, nearly three times as large as at the November sale. In such a bid, the bidder offers to take the issue at whatever price and interest rate the average bid produces.
''We saw a lot of customer business,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Goverment Securities. ''They were buying everything, including the 10-year notes auctioned on Wednesday, as well as the bonds. In some sense the auction was a professional bid, but it was to replace paper that went away earlier.''
Reflecting the post-auction demand, the new bonds were offered late yesterday on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.44 percent.
 
Healthy Japanese Buying
As expected, Japanese firms made healthy but not huge bids for the bonds. Market analysts estimated that the big four Japanese firms -Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura and Yamaichi - placed $3 billion worth of bids. Few of the bids were placed for clients in Japan, said analysts, who said the firms were seeking the bonds for their own trading accounts.
After the auction, prices of secondary Treasury issues pulled back, then moved higher. By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 96 1/8, up more than half a point on the day, to yield 8.48 percent.
Prices of the issues auctioned earlier this week by the Treasury also moved higher. In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes sold Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.42 percent. And the 8 3/8 percent three-year notes auctioned Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 8.32 percent in when-issued trading.
Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.79 percent late yesterday, up a basis point. Six-month bill rates dipped by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.72 percent.
 
A Shift in Focus
With the refunding auctions behind them, market participants are likely to shift their focus back to developments in the economy.
The return to more fundamental concerns will begin today, when the Government is expected to release its Producer Price Index for January.
The data, a measure of inflation, are expected to show that prices increased significantly in the month, almost entirely because of weather-related increases in food and energy prices.
Most analysts anticipate that the overall Producer Price Index rose by 1.2 percent last month. However, excluding food and energy, economists are forecasting that the index rose by a much more modest two-tenths of 1 percent.
''The producer price numbers are already reflected in the credit markets,'' said James Fralick, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''But if the market were to see the producer price numbers, excluding food and energy, go up by four-tenths of a percentage point or more, it would not behave very well.''
 
Help for Secondary Markets
The rise in Treasury prices helped the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Corporate traders said prices of most issues rose by about one-quarter of a point. Prices of actively traded municipal bonds improved three-eighths to half a point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Jan. 29. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC WATCH;
Monetary Union: Would It Help?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
For East and West Germany, monetary union would be a leap into the unknown, say Western economists who were caught off guard by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call to begin negotiations on monetary integration as early as next week. The cushion on landing would depend on the terms of the union, the adaptability of East German enterprises and the confidence of West German investors.
What does seem clear - and what apparently set off the rush to judgment - is that the East German economy is doomed to decline without monetary union.
Last month alone 58,000 East Germans crossed the border in search of a better life, hobbling East German production and straining West Germany's welfare services. Since Bonn is already bearing much of the burden of East Germany's collapse by accepting unlimited immigration, analysts argue, the added risk of assuming effective control of an integrated German economy is modest. Indeed, economic theory suggests that the marriage would be smooth and prosperous. 
 
Keeping the Shelves Stocked
Monetary union - the adoption of a common currency - is generally seen as the last stage of political and economic integration. But in the case of Germany, events seem to be forcing policy makers to put the economic cart before the political horse. East Germany, long the most prosperous of the centrally planned Eastern European economies, is reeling from the collapse of central authority and the flight of young workers.
''The question now,'' says Jan Vanous of the PlanEcon consulting firm in Washington, ''is whether East Germany can maintain enough stability to keep groceries on the shelves.''
And in the view of many West German officials, the only way to avert chaos - and subsequent mass migration westward - is to commit the two Germanys now to speedy economic unification.
Just how this union might be put together is fuzzy; there are no precedents for comparison. But Western economists, like Jeffrey Sachs at Harvard, believe the practical choices are limited.
East German individuals, enterprises and banks would trade their domestic currency and bank account balances to the West German Bundesbank for West German marks at an exchange rate fixed in advance. Restrictions on movements of capital across the border would be eliminated, making it possible for East Germans to bank freely in the West and for West Germans to invest freely in the East. All financial transactions would be denominated in West German marks.
''The catch to monetary union,'' Mr. Vanous says, ''is that you lose control over macromanagement.''
East Germany, the weaker partner, would effectively lose its economic sovereignty, retaining roughly the same authority over its economic destiny as, say, the state of Illinois.
The East German central bank would have to cede its power to issue currency or create bank balances to pay its bills; otherwise, the West German Bundesbank would be unable to control the total supply of money. And the East German Government would have to eliminate the subsidies that now hold the prices of consumer staples far below production cost. Otherwise, Mr. Sachs points out, ''all the food would disappear to the West.''
But there would be an immediate payoff. A formal commitment to economic integration would slow the brain drain from East Germany, and relieve the pressure on West Germany's housing and welfare budgets. And with money freely convertible into other currencies, foreigners could be confident that they could repatriate business profits. That, presumably, would attract desperately needed capital and technology from West Germany and the rest of the industrialized West.
A key to smooth transition, notes the Columbia University economist Jagdash Bhagwati, is the choice of the right exchange rate. If the East German currency is overvalued - if East German wages are set high when first translated into West German marks - East German goods will not be competitive. And while wages and prices would presumably adjust fairly quickly to more realistic levels, the initial effect would be more unemployment in East Germany and more emigration.
On the other hand, Mr. Vanous points out, if the exchange rate of East German currency is set very low - say, 5 East German marks or more for each West German mark -families will see their savings disappear. He estimates that East Germans hold roughly 180 billion East German marks in currency and bank accounts. Thus the choice of, say, a 4-to-1 exchange rate rather than a 3-to-1 exchange rate would cost East Germans about 15 billion West German marks, or about $9 billion - no small change for a nation of 16 million people living in what amounts to shabby gentility.
 
Luring Investors
The best approach, Mr. Vanous believes, would be to err on the side of undervaluation, initially making it immensely attractive for outsiders to invest in East Germany. East Germans with savings might be compensated with stock in public enterprises that the Government sells - or simply by the prospect of a freer, more prosperous life in a newly integrated German economy.
But according to the theory of ''optimal currency areas,'' pioneered by the Columbia University economist Robert Mundell in the 1960's, the long-term success of currency integration turns on more fundamental issues. Over time, differences in dozens of factors ranging from education to the environment to government regulation make some areas more attractive to business and some less attractive. If these economic regions are in different countries, changes in the currency exchange rate can compensate for changes in the competitiveness of business in each country. But in regions with the single currency, capital and labor must move from place to place in order to offset the changes and prevent the less competitive regions from becoming chronically depressed.
What will matter most 10 or 20 years from now, Mr. Sachs argues, is whether Germans have the right and inclination to move themselves and their capital to the regions of Germany that value them most. And by that measure, Mr. Sachs says, Germany with its one language and relatively uniform urban culture is far closer to an ''optimal currency area'' than, say, the United States or the Soviet Union.
Plainly, there are risks to monetary union. For East Germany, there is the risk it will cede control of its economy without sufficient return in jobs or income. For West Germany there is the risk that it will be forced to bear the costs of supporting a backward regional economy through a long and painful transition.
But as Mr. Bhagwati points out, ''there is no longer a negative side to economic integration.'' Even without monetary union, West Germany's open-border policy guarantees that it will bear much of the cost of East Germany's failure. With union, there is at least a reasonable chance that the flow of refugees will stop and that both parts of Germany will prosper.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Grew 6% in 1989

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Americans took out $4.91 billion more in consumer credit than they retired in December, pushing total consumer debt up 6 percent in 1989, the Federal Reserve said today.
The Fed said consumer credit in December advanced at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.3 percent, up from November's revised 7.8 percent increase. The November gain had initially been reported at 7.2 percent. 
But in both months, consumer debt rose to its highest level since February 1989, when it increased $5.38 billion. Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages.
 
Spending Is 'Not Collapsing'
While credit was up 6 percent for the year, it still was a modest increase, said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington. Debt rose 8.5 percent in 1988, and it increased 7.5 percent in 1987.
''It shows that consumer spending continues to grow modestly,'' she said. ''It's not collapsing,'' despite the sluggish economy.
The category of debt that includes credit cards jumped 24.5 percent in the month, which includes the bulk of holiday shopping. The increase was 17.5 percent in November.
Total credit card debt outstanding rose $4.06 billion at an annual rate in December, compared with a $2.86 billion increase in November.
Ms. Shaber said that while unit sales were good during the holiday season, profits for many retailers were off because of discounting.
Auto loans rose 1.1 percent, to $259 million at an annual rate, down from 1.9 percent in November. Auto loans posted a 4.1 percent increase in October, but sales tapered off at the end of the year.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate slowed to a 3.3 percent increase, to $557 million, in December, after rising 10 percent in November.
Mobile home debt outstanding rose 1.9 percent, to $35 million, in December. These debts had declined for seven consecutive months until a one-month gain in September.
The various changes left consumer debt at the end of December totaling $717.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Ford Settles A Mexican Walkout

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it had resolved some of its labor problems in Mexico by reaching a tentative contract agreement with workers at an engine plant in Chihuahua.
Separately, Ford said it was continuing to send termination notices to about 2,400 Mexican workers at its assembly plant in Cuautitlan, near Mexico City. And the No. 2 American auto maker said it was in negotiations with workers at its Hermosillo plant, where the labor contract expires on Feb. 28. 
A Ford spokesman, Al Chambers, said that the situations at the three plants were not related and that the company was confident that it could reach contract agreements.
 
Important Subcompacts
Ford's biggest worry may be the Hermosillo plant, where it is preparing to begin production in April of a redesigned line of subcompact cars, the Mercury Tracer and Ford Escort. The Tracer and Escort, which were developed with the Mazda Motor Corporation, are an important element of Ford's strategy for the 1990's.
Ford needs the highly fuel-efficient models to raise its overall corporate average fuel economy and meet higher Federal standards for 1990 models. Moreover, since the Tracer and Escort are new models, any interuption of production could have a devastating effect on their important introductory phase, when the company spends a great deal on promotion.
Still, Mr. Chambers said, ''we are quietly confident'' of reaching a successful conclusion to contract talks in Hermosillo.
Mr. Chambers declined to disclose the pay of Ford workers in Mexico.
In Cuautitlan, Mr. Chambers said, the company had begun to hire workers to replace those who were dismissed. Under Mexican law, any worker with more than three unexcused absences in a month can be legally discharged.
About two-thirds of the 3,700-member work force occupied the Cuautitlan plant last month after an intra-union dispute resulted in a shooting in which seven workers were injured and one killed. Mexican police peacefully removed the occupying workers on Jan. 22, Ford said, and many of those who had been in the plant did not return to work after that.
The Cuautitlan plant assembles six Ford car and truck models for the Mexican market.
Much of the labor unrest in Mexico stems from rapid inflation, Mr. Chambers said, adding that the value of the peso has dropped from about four pesos to the United States dollar in 1981 to about 2,700 currently.
The tentative labor agreement in Chihuahua resulted in a 27 percent increase in wages and benefits. In the last week of January, workers left their jobs because there was no contract, the spokesman said. The plant produces engines for Ford Tempo, which is sold in the United States and Mexico, and the Topaz, which is sold in Mexico.

HEADLINE: New York Times Company Reports 4th-Quarter Loss

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The New York Times Company yesterday reported a loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $50.4 million, or 64 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
Revenues in the quarter rose 4.5 percent, to $470.2 million, from $450 million a year earlier.
For all of 1989, net income rose 29.2 percent, to a record $266.6 million, or $3.39 a share, compared with $167.7 million, or $2.08 a share, in 1988. The earnings included an after-tax gain of $193.3 million, or $2.46 a share, from the sale of the company's cable television system in August. 
Revenues rose 4.1 percent, to $1.77 billion from $1.7 billion.
The company's continuing operations, which include newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and information services and forest products, produced a loss of $19 million in the fourth quarter, in contrast to a profit of $48.5 million a year earlier. For the year, income from these operations declined 57.6 percent, to $68.2 million, or 87 cents a share, from $161 million, or $2 a share, in 1988.
 
In Line With Expectations
That was in line with estimates by the company and industry analysts. Times stock closed yesterday at $24.375, unchanged, in trading on the American Stock Exchange.
The company said the decline in its operations for the quarter and the year was primarily attributable to the weakness of the New York region's economy, which affected advertising linage at The New York Times.
The company said income from continuing operations was also reduced by three factors:
* A charge of 57 cents a share in the fourth quarter that reflected the reduced value of the company's investment in the Forest Products Group, as well as for some costs associated with voluntary staff reductions at The New York Times.
* A reduction of 11 cents a share in the fourth quarter and 18 cents a share for the year resulting from organizatonal changes after the acquisitions of McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines.
* A charge of 3 cents a share in the fourth quarter resulting from a settlement of litigation involving home delivery dealers.
Were it not for those factors, the company said, earnings from continuing operations would have been 47 cents a share in the fourth quarter and $1.65 a share for 1989.
John Reidy, a media analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said: ''The earnings were in line with expectations. They promised us some write-offs in December. Like other papers in the Northeast, retail advertising remains in a slump, and now the help-wanted area of the classified part of the business is in trouble.''
 
Chairman's Outlook
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive, said earnings from continuing operations in 1990 were expected to exceed the 87 cents a share reported for 1989.
At the newspaper group, which includes The New York Times, 35 smaller newspapers and a one-third interest in The International Herald Tribune, operating profit in the fourth quarter fell 63 percent, to $25.1 million, from $68.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. Revenues rose 2.2 percent, to $375.2 million, from $367.3 million.
For the year, operating profit for the newspaper group fell 21 percent, to $182.9 million, from $231.5 million in 1988, as revenues rose 1.4 percent, to $1.4 billion, from $1.38 billion.

HEADLINE: Bearish Mood Is Overtaking Stock Investors, Study Says

BYLINE: By ANISE C. WALLACE

 BODY:
Investor sentiment has reached its most pessimistic level since June 1982, just before the start of the 1980's bull market, according to a weekly study that is closely watched by Wall Street.
This bleak outlook reflects a sharp reversal from the mood reported in mid-December, when the majority of professional investors were optimistic about stock prices.
The shift in investor mood came about because of the sudden, unexpected increase in interest rates in the United States and abroad, analysts said. ''The expectations were very high for lower interest rates,'' said Michael H. Sherman, chief investment strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
 
More Bad News Expected
In addition to the rise in rates, investors have been nervously waiting for more bad news, said Michael Burke, editor of Investors Intelligence, a New Rochelle, N.Y., advisory service that publishes the weekly survey of investor sentiment as culled from investment newsletters.
Mr. Burke's latest report, which covers the period ended last Friday, found that only 29.9 percent of the almost 130 investment newsletters it studied were bullish on the stock market, while 57.3 percent of them were bearish. By contrast, in December, 57 percent of the advisers were bullish about the market.
Such current widespread pessimism could explain the stock market rise of more than 38 points in the last two days, professional investors say. In the perverse ways of Wall Street, overwhelming bearishness is often viewed as good news, just as widespread optimism often accompanies market peaks.
This is true because when market prices are depressed and the mood is negative, often bargain hunters step in and push prices higher. On the other hand when prices are high some investors believe there are few buyers around and subsequently prices begin to fall.
Indeed, many money managers use the sentiment figures as a contrarian indicator for stock prices. And when the number of bullish advisers drops to its current level they say that stock prices generally bounce upward.
''When you get under 30 percent for the bullish side, you probably have a rally coming,'' said David N. Dreman, founder of Dreman Value Management, a New York money management firm.
 
Lack of Conviction
The extreme shift in the sentiment numbers over such a short period of time indicates a lack of conviction by investors, said Byron R. Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, who recently wrote a report entitled ''The Last Remaining Bull Speaks Out.''
Despite the abrupt change in sentiment, many money managers do not expect stock prices, which have fallen about 6 percent since the beginning of the year, to stage a broad rebound.
The increase in interest rates has made returns from fixed-income securities competitive with those available from stocks. Profits of many companies are expected to weaken this year. And with the weakness in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market, investors are re-evaluating the prices of securities in an environment that has fewer takeover battles.
In fact, many professionals believe that market averages like the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 could fall even lower this year.
 
'This Is a Sucker Rally'
As a result, some large institutional money managers are not yet spending their cash in the stock market. ''We think this is a sucker rally,'' said Timothy G. Dalton, president of Dillon, Read Capital Management.
Many money managers have also been despondent because most stocks are performing more poorly than the popular market averages. The performance of the large, blue-chip companies that make up the Dow has overshadowed weakness in the broader market since last August. ''The averages are not indicative of what's going on,'' said Harvey P. Eisen, president of Sun America Asset Management, the investment subsidiary of Broad Inc. ''It's been real, real hard to have stocks that go up.''

HEADLINE: Stock Prices End Mixed; Dow Up 4.28

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks turned in a narrowly mixed performance yesterday after a seesaw session in which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.28 points, to 2,644.37.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines, 768 to 696. Volume on the Big Board contracted to 176.2 million shares, from 186.7 million on Wednesday. 
Although the Dow finished slightly ahead, broader indicators faltered. The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.22 point, to 184.09, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged 0.79 point lower, to 332.9.
In early trading, the Dow had climbed 25 points, buoyed by investors' perceptions that the Treasury refunding auction, in which it was offering $10 billion of 30-year bonds, was going well.
But toward the end of the session, reports circulated that Japanese participation in the final day of the auction was not what had been expected. Traders said this talk precipitated a broad retreat that pushed the Dow to about a 7-point deficit.
 
Sign of Good Demand
By late in the day, however, the 30-year bond had an average yield of 8.45 percent, compared with a yield of 8.50 percent at the time of the auction. That reflected good investor demand and led to a late recovery for stocks. The 10-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were trading at a price yesterday to yield 8.42 percent.
''The concern that higher foreign interest rates would siphon money from the Treasury refunding abated,'' said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president of the Zurich-based Bank Julius Baer. ''Investors will now focus on the potential for softer economic data reports that may result in lower interest rates later this year.''
This morning, the Government will release the Producer Price Index for January, which is expected to show a sharp rise because of weather-related factors.
Among individual issues yesterday, Varity Corporation, a Toronto-based farm machinery and auto parts maker, was the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, dipping 1/8, to 3 1/4, on a volume of 2.4 million shares. The company said it knew of no developments to account for the activity.
Bank of New England dipped 5/8, to 5 1/4. It said that it had entered into a revised agreement to sell its leasing operations and $500 million of its lease portfolio to the Bank of Tokyo for a premium of $92.5 million.
 
Drop for Rykoff-Sexton
Rykoff-Sexton plunged 5 points, to 16 7/8. The distributor to the food service industry said it expected earnings for its third fiscal quarter ended Jan. 27 to be less than the 5 cents a share it had predicted. In the three months a year earlier, the company earned 38 cents a share.
Glamour issues that had an active day included A.T.& T., up 3/8, to 40 1/4, and Philip Morris, up 3/8, to 39 3/8.
Technology stocks were mixed after helping lift the market on Wednesday. I.B.M. slipped 3/8, to 102 3/4, in active trading, and Compaq Computer dropped 1, to 85 1/8. On the other hand, Motorola edged up 1/4, to 58 7/8, and Digital Equipment added 5/8, to 79 3/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.33 points, to 357.68, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index tacked on 0.53, to 427.32.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Some Gains As Rally in Mark Falters

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday as the soaring West German mark lost ground because of profit taking and concerns about the effects of a possible monetary union between the two German states.
Ronald H. Holzer, chief currency dealer for the Harris Trust Company in Chicago, said the dollar remained under the sway of the mark in foreign exchange because recent political changes in East Germany and the Soviet Union were expected to benefit the West German economy.
But profit taking and concerns about the implications of a proposal by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany to unify the two German monetary systems pushed the mark lower yesterday, dealers said. That, in turn, helped support the dollar, they said. 
Fear that taking over East Germany's nearly bankrupt system would endanger the West German economy also helped drive down prices of West German bonds yesterday for the third straight day.
The dollar traded at 1.6665 marks in New York, up from 1.6580 Wednesday, and at 1.68872 marks in Europe, up from 1.6545.
In New York, the dollar fell to 145.32 yen in New York, from 145.60 late Wednesday.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling cost $1.69435 in New York, down from $1.6960.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.4890 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6660 French francs, up from 5.6420; 1,240.25 Italian lire, up from 1,236.50, and 1.19465 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19455.
Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $418.60 an ounce, up 50 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of $418.70, up 60 cents.
Gold fell in London to $417.75, from $423, and in Zurich, to $417.75, from $422.25.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $418.15, down from $419.65.
Silver prices were mixed. On the Comex in New York, silver for current delivery settled at $5.324 an ounce, up from $5.311. Silver fell in London to $5.32, from $5.38.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Soviet Consumers Face Cutback In Meat as Feed Grain Runs Out

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Dispirited Soviet consumers face a cutback in meat production because the country has run out of grain to feed its cattle, the Government's chief food official says in remarks published today.
The prospect of reduced meat supplies threatens to add pressure on a Communist Party already weakened by internal dissent and public discontent.
Vladilen V. Nikitin, chairman of the State Commission for Food and Procurement, told the Communist Party Central Committee on Wednesday that the state had reduced feed allocations to all republics because grain deliveries had sharply fallen and the country could not afford to buy more abroad.
 
'There Is No Grain'
''This is the situation today: there is no grain,'' he said, according to a transcript printed today in Pravda. ''To act properly, I am left with only one decision: to cut deliveries of a certain amount of meat. There is no grain because there is no money.'' 
Other speakers at the party meeting said meat-producing regions were refusing to deliver their products to the central Government for distribution, hoarding meat instead to prevent local consumer revolts.
Yegor K. Ligachev, the Politburo member answerable for agriculture, disclosed that many industrial centers were suffering ''serious difficulties'' with meat supplies because producers had defied delivery orders.
 
A Blow to Gorbachev
Shortages of food and other consumer goods have been a major source of pessimism about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic program, and have fueled recent uprisings against local party leaders in several cities across Russia and the Ukraine.
The day that Mr. Nikitin delivered his report to the party, residents of the coal-mining city of Donetsk massed in the streets to demand removal of the entire local party leadership after local television reporters discovered a warehouse storing scarce imported food.
Over the last six weeks, party officials in Volgograd, Vladivostok, Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Ufa and other province centers have resigned at the demand of crowds angered by official privileges and consumer shortages.
To some extent the protests play into the hands of President Gorbachev, because they have led to the replacement of old-guard Communist officials with putative party reformers. But journalists in some of those cities said the protests sometimes included blanket condemnations of the Communist Party.
On Saturday an alliance of Communist Party insurgents, hoping to exploit popular unrest in support of more far-reaching political and economic changes, has scheduled a meeting to discuss breaking away from the party. While much of the world was enraptured by the Central Committee's decision this week to end the party's monopoly on power and to open the way for multiparty politics, critics said the moves did not go far enough in loosening the Communist grip.
Next week a broader group, including opposition members of the Soviet Parliament, leaders of coal mine strikes last summer and independent voters groups, has scheduled a meeting to demand a round-table dialogue with Communist Party leaders similar to the discussions that brought opposition figures into the governments of Eastern Europe.
Many Communist insurgents say a split of the Communist Party into two parts, one with an orientation comparable to European social democrats, was the most likely route to establishment of real political competition here.
The disclosures about the worsening meat situation came after party leaders from the Ukraine, the country's breadbasket, complained that their feed allotments for 1990 had been slashed by one fourth.
 
Meat Rationed in Some Places
Meat is already rationed in some parts of the country, and the availability of inexpensive meat is one of the Soviet Union's most sensitive economic indicators.
Although the country reported a good grain harvest of 211 million tons last year, the state procurements dropped to 59 million tons, the lowest since 1984 and a third below what was planned.
Deliveries of this grain, which Moscow distributes to the republics, was apparently hampered by fuel shortages and transportation problems, as well as by hoarding in localities.
The current shortage apparently also reflects a reluctance to spend scarce foreign currency on increased purchases of Western corn and feed grains, which are crucial to the Soviet livestock industry.
The country imported 36 million tons of grain last year, but has recently had trouble meeting its foreign payments.
 
Pig and Poultry Farms Hit
Vitaly A. Masol, the Prime Minister of the Ukraine, said the 25 percent cut in concentrated feed would hit hard at the republic's pig and poultry farms, which depend on state supplies.
''Tomorrow the country will be without eggs, because these are state enterprises, and without meat,'' he said.
''And we are approaching a congress,'' he added, suggesting that food shortages would stir public unrest going into the nationwide Communist Party congress this summer.
Vladimir A. Ivashko, the Ukrainian party leader, added that the economy as a whole had continued in a sharp decline.
''As far as I know, throughout the country in January there was no growth at all, but a big minus,'' he said, evidently referring to figures for industrial production.
Jan J. Vagris, the party leader in the Baltic republic of Latvia, said his republic's allotment had been slashed 40 percent, which he suggested was a deliberate warning in the face of Latvia's moves toward independence.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Can Be a Fate Worse Than Liquidation;
Rehabilitation the Goal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Bankruptcy Is Better in America'' (Business Day, Jan. 23) is a welcome addition to news media treatment of this important subject. I believe the public has been ill served by the tone of articles that state or at least suggest that financially distressed companies are in that condition because of mismanagement or worse and that those that seek the protection of the Bankruptcy Code too often improperly avoid or delay the payment of creditors' claims.
A recent article in a Bridgeport, Conn., newspaper, professing concern for employees and creditors, argued that a corporation should not be permitted to avail itself of the ''so-called reorganizaton procedures'' under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, unless there was an emergency, and in the absence of such, the bankruptcy should ''be recognized as a fraud.'' To protect against such abuse, it was suggested that ''Bankruptcy judges could demand that managements filing under Chapter 11 immediately show what the emergency is that justifies automatic stays of all their obligations. Unless such evidence comes with the filing or within days thereafter, the stay could be tossed out by the court.'' 
Of course, that prescription would more likely kill than protect the perceived victims of the assumed fraud.
As you point out, it is a principal goal of bankruptcy law to promote the rehabilitation of economically distressed companies. If a company had to wait until its financial condition was in a state of emergency, it is not likely that it would be able to borrow necessary funds to save itself and the jobs of its employees.
As you note, banks and other lenders are given a priority under the Bankruptcy Code to encourage them to inject new capital into the distressed company. They lend to the extent that they have confidence that rehabilitation has a reasonable prospect for success and believe that they will do better than if the company is forced to liquidate. To provide a statutory basis for lender confidence, the Bankruptcy Code requires adequate protection of secured creditors' interests.
At least initially, the law permits management to remain in control, so that during an exclusive period, which may be shortened or extended, a plan may be proposed for the payment of creditors' claims. As a counterbalance, the code also provides for the appointment of a trustee, conversion to Chapter 7 for liquidation or dismissal, if any of those changes are shown to be in the best interest of creditors and the bankruptcy estate.
Since a successful rehabilitation will often save jobs, preserve the company as a provider of goods and services and continue it on the tax rolls, an early push for liquidation is in most cases, but not all, inappropriate. It is to be hoped that your article will generate a higher level of understanding, especially in a time when record numbers of bankruptcy filings are predicted.

HEADLINE: RESIGNATION AT SAVINGS AGENCY

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The chief executive of the agency that oversees the Government's savings and loan bailout resigned today in what was seen as another sign that the multibillion-dollar White House program to clean up the industry is faltering.
In departing as president and chief executive of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, Daniel P. Kearney said he had not been given sufficient authority to do his job effectively.
The bailout program, signed by President Bush in August, authorized regulators to spend $159 billion over 10 years to shut or sell more than 500 insolvent savings institutions whose troubles - from lax regulation, excessive risk-taking and the collapse of the energy economy of the Southwest - created the costliest financial crisis since the Depression. The bailout also made sweeping changes in the regulation of the industry, including creating both the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Oversight Board to supervise the disposition of the troubled institutions and their assets.
 
Signs of Higher Costs
 Regulators and banking specialists pointed today, however, to serious problems with the bailout that are already increasing the ultimate cost of cleaning up the savings and loan industry. They cited bureaucratic infighting, a slow pace in the number of deals struck with would-be buyers, weak real estate markets in the Northeast and other areas and a serious lack of bidders for the hundreds of insolvent institutions throughout the country. 
As these insolvent and money-losing institutions continue to operate, losses are mounting at a rate of $6 million a day, regulators say. Because of delay, regulatory bickering and uncertainty, the total cost of the plan, some financial experts say may eventually pass the $200 billion mark.
 
Treasury Interference Cited
 ''Kearney's resignation underscores that the bailout legislation is not being implemented as people had hoped,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, adding that he understood that unnecessary interference by top members of the Treasury Department was principally responsible for the departure.
''I do think that George Bush better watch out,'' Mr. Guenther continued. ''The savings and loan problem is creeping closer and closer to his door again. Congress now can go on the offensive legitimately.''
Although Mr. Kearney did not specifically name the Treasury as the primary source of conflict, Government officials and regulators said that almost from his arrival he struggled with top Treasury officials over whether he would have any major say in the formation of policy.
In a hastily convened meeting this afternoon, the Oversight Board chose William Taylor as the acting president to take over the duties of Mr. Kearney, who is stepping down immediately. Mr. Taylor is now head of the Federal Reserve Board's division of bank supervision and one of the most respected bank regulators.
But banking experts said they doubted he would take the job permanently because he has reportedly already rejected an offer to become the next director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal agency that regulates the savings and loan industry. That job is now held by M. Danny Wall, who has resigned but is staying until a replacement is named.
 
Meeting With Brady
 Officials said that Mr. Kearney first made it known that he was about to resign at a luncheon meeting on Thursday with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, during which he complained of a requirement that he clear almost all of his public comments, press releases and other statements with the Treasury.
Government officials said Mr. Brady, who is chairman of the Oversight Board, did not strongly urge Mr. Kearney to stay, nor promise him more latitude. Other regulators, however, reportedly did encourage him to stay on, including both Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and a member of the Oversight Board, and L. William Seidman, chairman of both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which oversees the nation's banks, and Resolution Trust.
But Government officials said today that Mr. Kearney felt he lacked sufficient support from the Treasury to continue.
Treasury officials, while saying they regretted Mr. Kearney's departure, said they also felt it was important that the president of the Oversight Board realize he was acting on orders from the Administration, rather than as an independent banking regulator.
 
A List of Grievances
Mr. Kearney said in a statement that he felt both sides misunderstood each other on the scope of the powers vested with the Oversight Board chief executive. Regulators said Mr. Kearney complained that he was essentially being micromanaged by Treasury officials and felt he had no decision-making authority.
His departure will be a loss for the Government, regulators and bankers said. Mr. Kearney had been a mortgage finance specialist in Boston before coming to the Oversight Board but is more prominently known for his work as a partner at the investment house Salomon Brothers, where he helped develop the firm's mortgage-backed securities operation before he left in 1988. He is considered a first-rate manager by the financial community, with extensive experience in real estate and intimate knowledge of the nation's capital markets, which made him almost ideal for the huge job of watching over the bailout.
''People of his caliber in the financial arena are not often attracted to public service, and he was uniquely suited for the job,'' said Eric I. Hemel, a former official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and now a securities analyst for the First Boston Corporation.
Wall Street bankers and members of Congress said the departure of Mr. Kearney, while obviously delaying the bailout, manifests the structural problems of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which has day-to-day responsibility for managing the bailout, and its Oversight Board, which sets broad policies and approves spending plans.
Both the agency and its board are intended to give the White House ultimate control over how bailout money will be spent. Besides the Treasury Secretary, as chairman, and the Fed chairman, the board includes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and two other private-sector members appointed by the President.
''It shows that the problems in the regulatory structure are more severe than most people realized,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn. ''Everyone thought that initially there would be some infighting and then it would be straightened out, but that hasn't happened.''
What concerns experts most is that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is given management responsibilities for Resolution Trust but not ultimate decision-making authority. That rests with the Oversight Board.
 
Inefficient, Costly and Slow
 Mr. Seidman, as chairman of both the F.D.I.C. and Resolution Trust, has repeatedly said this bureaucratic structure is inefficient, costly and slow.
The Treasury has argued that since the bailout involves billions of dollars in taxpayer money, the White House, through the Treasury Department, needs to have ultimate authority over how the money is spent.
Representative Bruce Vento, Democrat from Minnesota, said the Kearney resignation ''only serves to confirm what I have said for the past six weeks - that the Oversight Board should be abolished.''
Members of Congress are also criticizing the White House for what they see as a lack of seriousness about the bailout. They note that the Administration has not filled the two seats on the Oversight Board to be appointed by the President, one vacant seat on the F.D.I.C. and a number of others.
 
10 Positions Vacant
 Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, listed 10 positions relating to the bailout that are vacant.
The White House did announce one trust corporation appointment today, saying it had chosen John J. Adair, now with the General Accounting Office, to be its inspector general.
Wall Street lawyers also say the bidding process for hundreds of troubled savings institutions under the control of Resolution Trust had become so inefficient and costly that clients with deep pockets, primarily commercial banks, are retreating.
''There are simply no buyers for the sick S.&L.'s,'' said Rodgin Cohen, a partner at the New York firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.
Mr. Cohen said that for the most part bankers are interested in weakened savings and loans that have not yet been taken over by the Government. He noted that when an institution is taken over, its value can drop by almost 20 percent overnight as the best corporate borrowers and many small depositors flee.
 
Little Value to Bankers
 What is left then, he said, are savings associations with bad assets, troubled borrowers and high-priced deposits that offer little value to bankers seeking to enlarge their branch networks through geographic diversification and increase the number of small, stable depositors.
But he said that the trust agency would not make any deals for institutions before they have been under its control for months, and that by that time there is little economic viability to most of these institutions.
He said that while banks were willing to pay a premium equal to 6 percent of deposits for a healthy branch network, the trust agency had only been able to get bids of less than 1 percent for its institutions.
Mr. Cohen added that he had one client who had offered to buy a large savings institution that was obviously headed for Government seizure, but the trust agency rejected the offer.
William Isaac, former chairman of the F.D.I.C. and now head of his own consulting firm, the Secura Group, agreed with Mr. Cohen, saying that the types of deals being offered by Resolution Trust are uneconomical for his clients.
 
Little Time to Assess Assets
 He said the Oversight Board had set policies that give bankers little time to assess the condition of real estate loans they acquire with an institution.
He added that much of the problem stemmed from the multiple layers of authority between Resolution Trust and its Oversight Board.
''The existence of the Oversight Board diffuses responsibility,'' he said. ''There is no one to blame because it is a committee. It allows the Treasury to blame the F.D.I.C. and the F.D.I.C. to blame the Treasury, the Fed to duck responsibility and all of them to blame the Congress.''

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Post 1.8% Jump

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Reflecting December's exceptionally harsh weather, producer prices soared 1.8 percent in January, the biggest rise in more than 15 years, the Labor Department reported today.
But while the increase was markedly more than most analysts anticipated, the categories responsible for practically all of the rise - energy and food - were no surprise at all. Indeed, economists were quick to point out that when energy and food are excluded, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent last month, the smallest increase since July.
''It looks a lot worse than it really is,'' Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said of today's figures. The numbers actually present ''a pretty good report,'' he concluded. 
 
Markets React Well
The markets took today's figures in stride, with interest rates moving down a bit. The credit market was buoyed, traders said, both by the sign of low underlying inflation and by the Treasury's success this week in attracting foreign buyers for its securities offerings. In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.83 points, to 2,648.20. [Page 41.] Both food and energy, displaying even more than their usual volatility, posted sharply higher prices as frigid weather in late December raised demand and prices for heating fuels and drastically reduced supplies of certain foods in January.
Like the finished-goods index, which tracks the prices received by producers for commodities sold to the final individual or business user, two related indexes showed similarly negligible increases when energy and food were excluded.
 
Two Small Increases
A rise of one-tenth of 1 percent was posted in the index covering prices received by producers at the intermediate stage of production, which includes semifinished items that require further processing or completed items used as parts of other products. The crude-goods index, which measures prices of items entering the production chain for the first time, was up two-tenths of 1 percent.
As an example of the types of goods in the indexes, wheat would be a crude good, flour an intermediate good and bread a finished product.
Analysts generally characterized the January price burst as a temporary phenomenon that might have some lingering effects but is not a sign of a general acceleration in prices.
''Over all, the numbers suggest that inflationary pressures in the United States continue to be moderate,'' said Brian S. Wesbury of Stotler Economics in Chicago. There's clearly no imminent risk of an inflationary surge, he said, and the Federal Reserve is most unlikely to read the January results as requiring tighter credit.
 
Energy Costs Surge
The rise in the finished-goods index, the most widely followed of the three producer indexes, was dominated by a 13.6 percent jump in energy. The price of home heating oil climbed 25.3 percent, natural gas rose 3.2 percent and gasoline - reflecting the refiners' emphasis on producing more heating oil and less gasoline from each barrel - jumped 16.7 percent.
The rise in food prices, 2.1 percent, was less severe, but included a huge 58 percent leap for fresh and dried vegetables. There was a 12.5 percent jump in the price of eggs, bringing the increase for eggs since January 1989 to 45.2 percent. Prices about doubled last month for tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, snap beans and dried beans.
The 13.6 percent jump in energy last month was the biggest since the department started that series in 1974. Fresh and dried vegetables had never risen as much as 58 percent in a month since tabulation began in 1967. Over all, the rise in food was the steepest in six years, the department said.
Prices also rose for fish, soft drinks, fresh and processed fruits and bakery products, but there were declines for chicken, turkey, pasta and coffee.
 
Some Prices Fell
Partly offsetting the increases in food and energy were lower prices for cars and light trucks - reflecting fresh incentive programs. Price declines accelerated for tires and tubes. Tobacco prices, as expected, turned down after a sharp year-end increase.
Although it is widely agreed that the January price surge will be reversed, not all of the change is expected to occur quickly. ''The wild card,'' observed Richard B. Berner, a top economist at Salomon Brothers, ''is how fast they come down.''
The price of fresh tomatoes, for example, could tumble as new crops reach the market, but for processed tomatoes the January price jump could be working through the distribution channels for months. And, as with some foods, last month's surge in energy prices has been built into the cost structure of innumerable products.
Analysts expect that the increase in the Consumer Price Index for January will approach 1 percent when it is reported on Feb. 21. The consumer index, unlike the producer index, includes imported goods and a broad array of services. Prices at the various producer price levels eventually influence retail prices but with widely varying degrees and time lags.
 
Offsetting Factors
At the intermediate stage of production, where prices last month jumped 1.2 percent, there was no change when energy was excluded. Energy rose 8.8 percent, including a nearly 50 percent jump for liquefied petroleum gas. Sharp drops for several nondurable manufacturing materials, like industrial chemicals, plastic resins and paperboard, were balanced by increases for various manufacturing and construction components. Among the latter showing big increases were aircraft engines and auxiliary equipment, motor vehicle parts, bearings and engines.
Among crude goods, the overall increase was 2.4 percent, with energy up 5 percent and foods and feeds up 1 percent, the report said.
The finished-goods index now stands 17.5 percent above its 1982 base of 100, and 5.8 percent above the January 1989 level.
The January report also updated seasonal factors for the various indexes, which resulted in relatively small changes from earlier published calculations. In finished goods, for example, the increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent that was initially reported for December was revised to a six-tenths increase and November's one-tenth decline was changed to a one-tenth increase.

HEADLINE: Fed Decision Is Disclosed On Easing Interest Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided at their December meeting on a further easing of their high-interest-rate policies because of the sluggish economy, according to minutes released today.
Two days after the Dec. 18-19 meeting, the Federal funds rate dropped from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent, the sixth decline of one-quarter of a percentage point since the rate peaked at 9.75 percent in June.
Federal funds, the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses to control short-term interest rates. It has not been adjusted since Dec. 21. 
 
Attacking Inflation
The central bank had kept interest rates relatively high for more than a year as it sought to decrease inflation by slowing the economy.
The gross national product, the total output of goods and services, declined from third-quarter growth of 3 percent to just five-tenths of 1 percent in the last three months of 1989. Some Government officials and business leaders have urged the Fed to loosen its grip further to stimulate economic activity.
The Federal Open Market Committee, as the policy-making body is known, met again Tuesday and Wednesday to review monetary policy. The minutes of that meeting will be released next month. The committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed.
It is made up of the 7 Federal Reserve Board members and 5 of the 12 presidents of the Fed district banks.
 
Risk Called High
The minutes of the December meeting said, ''A majority indicated that on balance they viewed the risks of a shortfall in economic activity as sufficiently high to justify an immediate move to slightly easier reserve conditions, and one member expressed a preference for somewhat greater easing.''
Members who wanted policy to remain unchanged ''were concerned that further easing might overcompensate for current weaknesses in the economy at the cost of delaying progress toward price stability,'' the minutes said.
In the end, the vote to ease was 9 to 2. Dissenting were Wayne D. Angell and Thomas C. Melzer. One board governorship is vacant.
 
Manufacturing Sluggish
In arriving at their decision, committee members reviewed information suggesting that economic activity was expanding slowly in the fourth quarter, with sluggishness ''especially evident in the manufacturing sector,'' the minutes said. ''By contrast, growth of the service sector appeared to be well sustained and overall construction activity seemed relatively firm.''
A Fed staff projection, however, suggested that the economy would continue to slow over the next several quarters, although it would rebound in the first quarter from the effects of fourth-quarter strikes and natural disasters.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed While Mark Eases a Bit and Gold Falls

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed yesterday against other leading currencies in light trading. The West German mark lost some of its value.
Gold prices fell in domestic and overseas dealing. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $416.10 an ounce, down $2.60 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce of gold at $415.75 as of 4 P.M., Eastern standard time, compared with a late bid of $418.70 on Thursday. 
Currency dealers said the dollar traded within a narrow range for most of day as trading grew light with the approach of the weekend.
Like most other financial markets, the foreign exchange markets seemed to take in stride a 1.8 percent increase in the Producer Price Index for January. Economists noted that a severe cold snap in December raised the wholesale inflation reading. Excluding food and energy, the index rose just one-tenth of a percent.
Enthusiasm to invest heavily in marks has been tempered in recent days by news that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany favors uniting the two Germanys with a common currency.
Dealers who had been buying marks aggressively, assuming that the West German economy would benefit from the reforms in Eastern Europe, adopted a more cautious approach amid uncertainty about the results of a possible merging of East and West Germany's currencies.
Still, trading of dollars continued to be secondary to that of marks, British pounds, Japanese yen and Swiss francs.
The dollar traded at 1.6680 marks late in New York, up from 1.6665 on Thursday and above the 1.6750 marks at the close of European trading.
In London, a British pound cost $1.6930 late yesterday, more expensive than the late bid of $1.6885 on Thursday. The pound also strengthened in New York, where a pound was quoted at $1.6955 late in the day, compared with $1.69435 on Thursday.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 144.72 yen, from 145.50 late Thursday. Later, in London, the dollar traded higher at 145.20 yen, but it ran out of momentum in New York and closed at 144.725 yen, down from 145.315 yen Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's, included: 1.4915 Swiss francs, up from 1.4890; 5.672 French francs, up from 5.6660; 1,241.25 Italian lire, up from 1,240.25, and 1.20025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19465.

HEADLINE: TRACK AND FIELD;
Melinte Gains a Mile Record and $100,000

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Feb. 9

 BODY:
The people who staged the Vitalis/Meadowlands Invitational track meet tonight offered a total of $250,000 in bonuses for runners breaking world indoor records in three races.
They paid $100,000 to Doina Melinte of Romania for setting a record of 4 minutes 17.13 seconds in the women's mile. They saved $100,000 in the men's mile, although Peter Elliott's winning time of 3:52.02 was the seventh fastest in indoor history. They saved the $50,000 they offered in the men's 600 yards when the race turned into a bumping and falling fiasco. 
For the 12,161 spectators at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the best performance was Melinte's. The willowy 33-year-old Romanian won the 800-meter gold medal in the 1984 Olympics. She set a world indoor record of 4:18.86 for the mile in this meet last year.
 
Quick Early Pace
This time, for the first half-mile, she followed a good pace by Brit McRoberts Lind-Peterson. She pulled away from there and beat second-place Alisa Harvey by 90 yards, a little more than a half-lap of the 176-yard banked-board track.
Melinte passed the 1,500-meter mark in 4:00.27, breaking the 10-year-old world indoor record of 4:00.8 set by Mary Decker Slaney.
Melinte left the arena clutching her oversized check.
''I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the money,'' she said through a translator. ''But I'm not worried about it.'' Elliott said he was not worried about the money, either, although in his case he did not win any.
''I didn't come here to win a $100,000 purse,'' he said. ''I came here to break the record.'' #40-Yard Margin The 27-year-old Englishman gave it a good shot. He followed Ray Brown's crisp pace of 55.3 seconds for the quarter-mile and 1:53 for the half-mile.
When Brown dropped out with four laps left in the 10-lap race, Elliott was on his own. He slowed to 2:53 for three-quarters of a mile and beat Marcus O'Sullivan, the 1988 and 1898 winner, by 40 yards.
So Eamonn Coghlan's 1983 time here of 3:49.78 survived as the world indoor record. Elliott said he might have run faster if Mike Stahr had not got between Brown and Elliott for the first two laps.
''I thought everyone knew what we were trying to do,'' Elliott said sharply.
 
Strong Field in the 600
One of the enduring records in indoor track is Martin McGrady's 1970 time of 1:07.6 for 600 yards. In Butch Reynolds, Danny Harris, Antonio McKay and Ian Morris, the 600 here had four runners capable of winning the race and perhaps threatening the record.
As it turned out, all they threatened was one another. As they entered the first turn of the last lap, McKay was leading on the inside and Morris was moving up alongside him on the outside.
McKay was running perhaps a foot out from the inside of the track. Harris tried to get through that narrow hole. He bumped McKay, who lost his balance and fell. As McKay fell, he bumped Morris, who also fell.
That left only Harris and Reynolds. Harris finished 8 feet ahead of Reynolds in 1:09.98, far from the record. It was also far from a victory. The officials disqualified Harris for the bumping incident, so Reynolds (1:10.36) became the winner and the only finisher.
''I was pretty mad at Danny,'' McKay said. ''But then I went up to him at the end and said, 'Those things happen indoors.' ''
''Antonio was upset the way the race turned out, and so was I,'' Harris said. ''I don't want the best guys laid out on the floor. The only question was whether four big guys like us could stay out of each other's way. We couldn't.''
Doug Padilla was hoping to break the 17-year-old world indoor record of 7:39.2 in the men's 3,000 meters. But he hung back until the last two laps and settled for a 35-meter victory in 7:43.69, his best clocking ever indoors. He said economics might have made him run faster.
''There were too many good people in the race to try to go for a good time,'' he said. ''If there had been $100,000 at stake, maybe I would have run differently.''
 
Repeaters Add Titles
Padilla won his race here for the fifth time in eight years. Diane Dixon (53.59 seconds) captured the women's 400 meters for the fifth successive year and the seventh time in eight years. Joetta Clark (2:03.44) took the women's 800 meters for the fifth time in 12 years, going back to her high school days in Maplewood, N.J.
There were world indoor records for masters (age 40 or older) by 42-year-old Dave Stewart of Ottawa and 40-year-old Jim King of San Diego. Stewart won the masters mile in 4:15.47, and King the masters 400 meters in 50.64 seconds.
Roger Kingdom, the world's best high hurdler, won for the first time ever in a major New York metropolitan-area meet indoors, taking the men's 55-meter hurdles in 7.00 seconds.
Tony Dees finished second to Kingdom, and 10 minutes later, Dees won the 55-yard dash by inches in 6.16 seconds. LaVonna Martin won the women's 55-meter hurdles in 7.45 seconds, beating Jackie Joyner-Kersee for the third time in eight days.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
In Today's Housing Market, Is It Better to Buy or Rent?

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The decision to own or to rent a home has traditionally been based on three elements: cost, personal preference and investment. But the recent decline in house and apartment prices has made a such an investment less of a sure thing and has helped to convert many potential buyers into renters, if only temporarily.
In addition, buyers in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area face a problem that those in many other parts of the country do not confront: the median family income is far less than the income needed to buy a median-priced home.
For example, the median income in the New York metropolitan area is about $30,000, while the income needed to buy a median-priced house is around $63,000. The median price of an existing single-family house in New York last year was $183,400, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
A similar situation exists in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the median price is $260,600, and the Los Angeles area, where the median is $215,500. In contrast, the Midwest has the most affordable housing markets in the nation: the median family income in cities like Cleveland and Detroit is more than adequate to acquire a median-priced home - $75,300 in Cleveland and $73,700 in Detroit. The national median price for a house in 1989 was $93,100.
The general guideline for calculating housing affordability is that families should plan on spending at least two-and-a-half times their annual gross incomes. Thus, a family with an income of $75,000 can afford a house costing about $190,000.
The inability of many people to pay the high home prices now required shows no signs of easing any time soon, particularly in the Northeast. Neither does the current soft housing market, which, in many areas, is offering a static or negative return. As a result, this is likely to be a year in which the number of rentals exceeds their normal pattern and sales fall below the levels reached in the 1980's.
''There's not going to be any appreciation this year,'' said Harve Kevenides, a consultant at the Metropolitan Analysis and Forecasting Corporation in Red Bank, N.J. ''The real rate of appreciation will be negative or stable in 1990.''
 
 In the Near Term
 ''If one considers the purchase as purely an investment, any property purchased from 1986 or 1987 onward does not receive a sufficient return to cover the cash outlay,'' said Nancy Packes, the president of the Feathered Nest, a Manhattan real-estate brokerage firm. ''The perception is that there is no more appreciation to be gotten from residential real estate in the near term.''
Other real-estate experts have a different view of housing as an investment. ''We expect that homes will at least hold value and probably increase more rapidly than general price inflation over the next 10 years,'' said H. James Brown, the director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''And rents will steadily rise over the next decade.''
Lomas Mortgage U.S.A., a Dallas financial-services company that studies the cost of housing, reports that the average American household lacks the necessary income for a mortgage. This is true across the country, even though many lenders now allow borrowers to spend about a third of their income on housing, up from a quarter in earlier years.
''Housing costs are rising faster than incomes,'' said Paul M. Low, the company's president. He said that the average home with a conventional mortgage cost 8.4 percent more in 1989 than in '88, while household income rose by only 4.8 percent.
''On a cash-flow basis, forgetting taxes, you can rent for about half the cost of buying,'' said Kenneth Rosen, the director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley. ''And the tax benefits of owning have been reduced by tax reform.'' But homeowners still can deduct mortgage interest and most property taxes, a considerable savings in regions where property taxes are high.
One important determination in deciding whether to buy or rent: Would you be better off investing your money in a house over a period of time or investing the down payment and saving any difference?
''The markets today may lead you to rent,'' said Susan Wachter, an economist at the Wharton Real Estate Center of the University of Pennsylvania. ''But your costs tend to be stable when you own, and that's a main motivator to home ownership.''
 
 
 FIGURING OUT THE DIFFERENCE
 The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that consumers make these calculations to help them decide whether to buy or rent housing.
 1. Write down the purchase price and financing terms for the house or apartment. Include the down payment, closing costs and points.
 2. Estimate your gross monthly shelter costs as a homeowner, including utilities, maintenance and repairs.
 3. Figure out your net monthly outlay, computing the tax savings by deducting mortgage interest and property taxes.
 4. Project what the proceeds would be from selling the property after, say, 5, 10 or 20 years. Some experts say a 4.5 percent annual gain should be projected for the next 10 years.
 5. What will your total rent be for the same period? And if you invested the money you would spend on a down payment, closing costs and points, what would your return be? Today an investor might reasonably expect to get a return of about 8 percent on Treasury bonds, 6 percent on municipal bonds and 6 to 8 percent on stocks.
 6. Compare the two sets of figures.

HEADLINE: Iran Reaffirms Rushdie Death Threat

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Iran's supreme religious leader said today that a decree calling for the death of the British author Salman Rushdie, issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini a year ago, remained in force.
In a sermon marking the 11th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, the religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, ''Imam Khomeini's decree about the author of the blasphemous book 'The Satanic Verses' remains in force and must be carried out.'' Ayatollah Khamenei's remarks were reported by the Teheran radio and monitored by Reuters. 
Ayatollah Khomeini, who died last June, issued a religious decree early last year ruling that the Indian-born Mr. Rushdie blasphemed Islam in his novel and should die for it. He called on faithful Muslims to carry out the death sentence as a religious duty.
Mr. Rushdie, who maintains that his novel is merely a whimsical tale that in no way attacks Islam, has been in hiding and under police protection in Britain for a year.
While the book was widely condemned by Muslim countries and religious authorities as an insult to Islam, many influential Muslim authorities differed with this opinion, saying there was nothing in Islam that sanctions a death sentence in such a case.
 
Contradictory Signals
But Ayatollah Khamenei, who served two terms as Iran's President before taking his position as spiritual guide, renewed this appeal today, saying, ''Mercenary hands which try to diminish Islam by cultural plots like writing blasphemous books must know that they are wrong and these plots will hurt only themselves.''
The Iranian leader's assertions came at a time of contradictory signals about Iran's attitude on American hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese militants in Beirut and its desire to improve Iranian political and economic relations with the West.
On Thursday the United States renewed a warning that terrorist actions inspired by Iran may be planned against American interests and denied that any high-level talks about the release of American hostages are being held with Iran, as reported by French and Kuwaiti newspapers.
 
Warning on Terrorism
A State Department official, Richard A. Boucher, said on Thursday that a high level of activity by operatives of the pro-Iranian Party of God, which began in December, continued to present a clear danger to American citizens and installations, adding that ''terrorists may now be planning an operation against U.S. interests in Western Europe, which may be timed for on or about Feb. 11.''
That is the day in 1979 when the Iranian Army surrendered to the revolutionary forces led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and it is celebrated as the day of the triumph of the Iranian revolution against the rule of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, who died in 1980.
 
SUPPORT FOR RUSHDIE
LONDON, Feb. 9 (Special to The New York Times) Prominent writers are to issue a statement on Sunday in newspapers around the world pledging support for Salman Rushdie, the Press Association reported today.
Britain's domestic news agency said the International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and His Publishers succeeded in having more than 160 authors sign the statement, including Arthur Miller, Harold Pinter, William Golding, Allen Ginsberg, Catherine Cookson and Edna O'Brien.
Their support was reportedly gained in less than a week, and more names were added as outrage over the latest announcement in Teheran spread through the literary world.

HEADLINE: Drug-Shooting Casualty Inspires a City to Resist

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 5

 BODY:
Last weekend, volunteers from a local drug rehabilitation program patched and painted the 35 bullet holes in a pink and white stucco bungalow on Westminister Avenue here, where 60-year-old C. W. Roddy was wounded slightly by gunfire on New Year's Eve.
While the painters worked at Mrs. Roddy's house, two deputies and a sergeant on loan from the county sheriff's department helped patrol this crime-ridden city, which cannot afford enough police officers to contain the spread of drugs on its streets.
Meanwhile, county and city officials set aside their jurisdictional squabbles and carried a $5.1 million grant proposal to Washington, seeking money for law enforcement, drug rehabilitation and educational programs for this largely black community of 18,500 residents, 40 miles south of San Francisco, where one in five are unemployed and one in 10 are in prison.
In these and other ways, things have changed in East Palo Alto since Mrs. Roddy's shooting, presumed by the police to be a result of her hectoring the drug dealers on her block. The attack on her home and her refusal to be bullied into silence have outraged and inspired the community as never before, and sparked new government action. 
 
Sense of Optimism Voiced
''I've seen so much negativism in this city,'' said Mrs. Roddy, a retired telephone company service representative. ''Maybe what happened to me has given people the strength to speak out. I know God spared me for some reason and maybe it's to bring unity to East Palo Alto.''
Only by the loosest definition is Mrs. Roddy a ''drug crusader,'' as she has been called in local news accounts of the shooting. Like many of the older people who have lived in East Palo Alto for decades, she has seen her community deteriorate. Angry and frustrated, she harangued the dealers, noted the license numbers of cars cruising the street to buy or sell drugs and begged city officials for more police protection.
''She wanted something simple and basic,'' said Sgt. Ron Sibley of the East Palo Alto police department, which handles more complaints per officer than any force in the Bay Area. ''She wanted to come in and out of her driveway without being harassed. She wanted to sleep at night without hearing gunfire.''
Perhaps it is Mrs. Roddy's very ordinariness that has prompted all the attention. ''Here's an average citizen, in her own home, within inches of being killed,'' said Tom Nolan of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. ''People have the sense that things are totally out of control if this can happen.''
 
City Drive for Outside Help
Mr. Nolan is a leader in the recent effort to bring outside assistance to this troubled city. The city voted to incorporate in 1983, despite warnings that the paltry tax base would not support services. That bitterly contested incorporation vote was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1987, but the long legal battle cost the city money it could ill afford.
Just as the city was going broke, crack exploded on its grimy streets, just a few blocks from the million-dollar mansions of Palo Alto and the lush campus of Stanford University. More than half the city's $5 million budget now goes for police services, but it is not nearly enough. In 1989, there were 17 homicides, for a rate of 101 per 100,000 people, more than 10 times the national rate.
Among the homicides in 1988 was the slaying of a 26-year-old police officer, just six weeks out of the academy. In the wake of that slaying, several nearby cities and the California Highway Patrol lent officers to East Palo Alto for a few months. The results were impressive, with police calls down 50 percent and no homicides or shootings. But the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Redwood City, whose residents come here to buy drugs, could not send their officers here indefinitely.
The county, on the other hand, had resources to spare, but was at loggerheads with the city of East Palo Alto, which was wary of outsiders who might challenge the newfound autonomy. ''When you're trying to become an independent entity, it's difficult to accept help because it feels like failure,'' said State Senator Rebecca Morgan, a Republican from nearby Los Altos Hills. $500,000 From the County Senator Morgan was instrumental in bringing the two governments together. As a result, San Mateo County will give the city $500,000, which must be used for five more officers in East Palo Alto over the next two years. While the new officers are being recruited and trained, the county has lent the city several deputy sheriffs and sergeants, three each shift, nearly doubling the uniformed presence.
There is also a new neighborhood organization on Mrs. Roddy's block, Citizens United Against Drugs. The group's president, Jody Lee, is the mother of two dealers, among those at odds with Mrs. Roddy. Mrs. Lee said she hopes her sons ''will see me doing this and try to get their lives together.''
Mrs. Roddy seems particularly moved by Mrs. Lee's militancy. ''The day she came over to our side was a joyous day for me,'' Mrs. Roddy said. ''It's the beginning of unity.'' The outside of Mrs. Roddy's house no longer bears the scars of the shooting, but other marks endure, like the gash in a wooden coffee table in the living room and a shattered quilting frame in the garage. Her 1970 Pontiac is still in the shop, rammed while parked on the driveway in a separate attack on Jan. 10. In a third attack on Jan. 11, two makeshift Molotov cocktails were hurled at the house, but did not explode.
Mrs. Roddy's 37-year-old son, Darnell, remains jumpy, rushing every few minutes to look out the picture window, with its new glass panes.
''Darnell, what is the matter?'' Mrs. Roddy asked, blandly.
''It's too noisy out there,'' he snapped.
Mrs. Roddy maintains she is not nervous. ''I've never really been frightened,'' she said. ''I've been angry, livid, upset with the apathy of the people of East Palo Alto. But, I'm not afraid to die. I try to live my life daily like it was my last. When it's time to go, it's time to go.''

HEADLINE: Florida Airport in Race With Growth

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla.

 BODY:
The ponds, palm trees and other oasis-like amenities of Orlando International Airport are under siege. Thousands of construction workers, hundreds of trucks with tons of dirt and concrete, and 45,000 passengers pour in and out of the airport every day.
The airport in central Florida has been praised in the travel industry for successfully handling a huge increase in traffic since the airline industry was deregulated in 1979. Others, like those serving New York City and Chicago, have suffered a form of gridlock. 
Now Orlando continues to shatter all projections. When it was designated an international airport in 1981, it had about 6 million passengers. Last year it handled more than 17.2 million, an increase of 187 percent, making it the fastest-growing major airport in the country.
A third terminal is to open in June, increasing the number of gates to 74 from 50. Airport officials expect to break ground for a fourth terminal soon. Orlando has opened a third runway and is almost doubling the size of its central terminal, adding a 450-room hotel and more ticket counters and baggage-claim areas.
 
A New Surge Lies Ahead
Orlando is expecting a surge of new passengers, once all the construction is done. ''Our domestic growth has been held back because we have no more space, no more places to park aircraft,'' said John Wyckoff, executive director of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority, which runs the airport.
Mr. Wyckoff says international and cargo flights will have the greatest growth. Orlando is being watched by the travel industry and by other airport operators for its aggressive and successful campaign to attract international carriers - a goal of many mid-sized airports.
''Orlando has succeeded in getting more of its share,'' said Terry P. Parent, the marketing director at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. ''They have been quite aggressive; they have done a good job of promoting their assets and defining their market.''
 
Lure of the Theme Parks
Last year Orlando reported that it handled 1.5 million international passengers, up 102 percent from 742,786 in 1988. In the last year, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started nonstop service twice a week between Orlando and Amsterdam and Delta began flying five times a week between Orlando and Frankfurt.
A big lure is Orlando's theme parks and attractions, primarily the three Disney theme parks on 6,600 acres.
''We planned our trip for six months,'' said Hidao Masumoto, an economist from Sao Paulo, Brazil, who spent two weeks and about $8,000 touring Disney World and nearby attractions with his wife, Rosa, and two children, Renato, 17, and Cinthia, 15. ''The children wanted to come.''
Pat and Carol Brennan from Peterborough, Ontario, spent nine days at Disney World, primarily at the Epcot theme park, with their daughters Amy, 13, and Angie, 10. ''We wanted to see Disney again before the kids got too old for it,'' Mrs. Brennan said. ''We love it.''
 
At Mercy of Money Managers
Disney officials report a dramatic increase in foreign tourists, and they attribute much of the rise to relative weakness of the dollar. ''We've stepped up our marketing efforts and we'll take some of the credit,'' said Thomas Elrod, senior vice president of marketing of Walt Disney Attractions. ''But in many ways we are at the mercy of the money managers of the world.''
One sign of the increase in long-distance visitors: the Disney organization says that when it opened in 1971, 20 percent of its visitors arrived by air; today, 50 percent fly.
For the last few years, more overseas tourists have been flying directly into Orlando. ''For the longest time, route maps showed Miami-Disney World,'' said Carolyn M. Fennell, director of community relations at the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. ''We fought to have that changed, and now we are rightly getting what was our niche.''
Since scheduled international service began in 1984, five international carriers started nonstop service into Orlando from South America, Iceland, Europe and the United Kingdom. Additional charter service links Canada and Brazil.
 
The Change for the City
When Walt Disney World opened in 1971, the City of Orlando transformed itself from an agricultural community to a worldwide tourist stop. Orlando now has more hotel rooms - 68,000 last year - than Los Angeles, with 67,500 rooms, Chicago, with 64,300 or, New York, with 62,500.
Today, Orlando is said to be outpacing other Florida communities and the nation in economic growth. Business leaders here see a symbiotic relationship between the economy and the airport.
Rick Tesch, president of the Economic Development Commission of Mid-Florida, compared the relationship to the age-old question of the chicken and the egg. ''In our case there is no question,'' he said. ''The tourism industry was the egg, It has been the catalyst for the development of the transportation infrastructure that business needs.''
The airport, originally a small corner of an old Air Force base, with two Quonset huts serving as terminals, was started mostly to serve tourists, who made up 90 percent of its passengers. Today, tourists are close to 50 percent of the passengers.
 
The Problem of Parking Cars
Business travelers, especially those headed for the Kennedy Space Center, quickly forced the airport to make some changes. It had very little parking space because tourists then generally took cabs, buses or rented cars to their hotels. Now the airport has two new six-story parking garages with 10,000 spaces.
The growth of the business market is expected to continue, especially as Disney and Universal promote and expand their nearby movie studios and theme parks. The Disney-M.G.M. studio opened last year, while Universal Studios Florida is scheduled to open its attractions in May.
''People throughout the world love the movie business,'' said Randy A. Garfield, executive vice president of marketing at Universal Studios Florida. ''The international travelers just crave this.''

HEADLINE: AIDS and the Fashion World: Industry Fears for Its Health

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
Like an advancing shadow, AIDS has touched the lives of nearly everyone in the fashion industry.
Beyond the designers who have died, the visual display departments that have been decimated and the sample rooms that have been disrupted, there is the loss of countless unseen people who are the pulse of New York's second-largest industry: the stylists, illustrators, showroom assistants, makeup artists and hairdressers who not only capture the spirit of fashion but sometimes lead it.
''Health has become the most important thing in fashion, more important than the cut of the clothes,'' said Virginia Estrada, the sister of Angel Estrada, a New York designer who died of AIDS last year.
 
Investors Are Wary
Fashion executives find it difficult to quantify the costs of the crisis, which has caused designer labels to falter and smaller houses to die, absenteeism and insurance premiums to rise, and venture capitalists to shy away. In an already risky business, ''key man'' insurance policies are being sought with a new rigor, and there are even intimations that investors think female designers represent one less risk. 
But many said the greatest casualty has been creativity. At a time when the apparel business needs new direction to bolster the flagging retail sector, important young designers have died. Future stars who might replace them have found it difficult to find backers, especially if they are young and male.
Successful fashions, especially women's fashions, are a key element in the profit margins of retailers. For this reason, AIDS, which has well-documented medical and social implications, could also have business effects that will be felt throughout the economy.
''It ends up being a part of everybody, one way or another,'' said Patricia Pastor, a former Perry Ellis assistant who assumed his design responsibilities for two seasons after he died. ''We all dress. If this entire industry is being weakened by something, it's going to filter down to all of us.''
An estimate of the number of AIDS cases in the fashion industry is difficult to obtain - partly out of concern about obtaining health insurance. But it is more difficult to find anyone in the fashion industry who has not been affected by the disease.
''How are your T cells?'' has become part of the daily discourse, like the weather and what styles are selling. T-4 lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, are one marker for the degree of infection by AIDS.
''In this industry, it surrounds you,'' said a fashion executive. ''It creates a kind of claustrophobic feeling.''
Recently, a group of Japanese investors asked the designer Carmelo Pomodoro for a list of five designers he thought would have a significant impact in the 1990's.
''I gave them a list with three women and two men,'' Mr. Pomodoro said. ''When they got back to me, they said they were not interested in the men, because of the AIDS factor.''
 
'Decade of the Woman Designer'
Rebecca Moses, a New York designer, said she had been approached by many investors - Japanese, European and American - since she restarted her fashion business last year. A few considered it a plus that she was a woman.
''They're really interested in investing in women,'' Ms. Moses said. ''It's absurd, but it's a phenomenon of the business.''
The long-term consequences of such a shift in investment are uncertain. Fashion, a highly entrepreneurial enterprise, depends on the odd and the new.
''It will have an enormous impact,'' said Alan Millstein, an analyst and publisher of a fashion industry newsletter. ''The actual AIDS numbers may not be very large, but the industry doesn't have that many design firms. The 90's could be the decade of the woman designer.''
 
The Investors Ask: Is a Designer Insurable?
 The prevailing problem in the fashion world today is insurability, said Andrew Jassin, a director of the Marketing Management Group, a garment center company that consults with investors about financing apparel companies.
''They will ask if a designer is insurable if they're going to make a deal,'' Mr. Jassin said. Industry executives expressed concern that such insurance policies, known as ''key man'' policies, a form of life insurance in which the beneficiaries are the investors or partners instead of spouses or family, may lead to discriminatory screening of designers and executives.
Joseph Abboud, a men's wear designer, said he was tested for AIDS 18 months ago when he applied for key-man insurance. It was part of the process in concluding a 20-year contract with Gruppo GFT, the manufacturer and financial backer of his clothing line. The arrangement, like many top management contracts, was contingent on the insurance policy.
''I had to take extensive medical tests and sign a release to be tested for AIDS,'' Mr. Abboud said.
Todd Oldham, a designer of women's wear, said he was tested before concluding negotiations with various potential investors. He now designs for Onward Kashiyama, a Japanese company.
''Before we landed Kashiyama, we had negotiations with other backers,'' Mr. Oldham said. ''I've taken the AIDS test four times now. They say it's for insurance, but they don't want their money to drop dead in 10 years. It's heartless, but business is business.''
Insurance executives said it is common practice in New York State for anyone, male or female, to be tested for AIDS when applying for life insurance worth more than $50,000. But Gerald Shaw, president of Oscar de la Renta, said that in his experience a medical examination before a garment center arrangement is concluded is highly unusual.
''I'm amazed to hear of it,'' said Mr. Shaw, whose father, Ben Shaw, financed many fashion houses. ''Key-man policies have been around forever. But I can't imagine someone taking a test as part of a preliminary negotiation.''
At the least, the insurance risks in fashion companies have made it more difficult and costly to be insured. Since in New York State companies with fewer than 10 employees can be required to submit to individual examinations to obtain group health policies, small concerns may not be able to get insurance at all.
Ron Cohen, an insurance broker specializing in garment center companies, said these were among the businesses that health insurers were shunning. ''What's happened now is the insurance industry has sufficient statistical information to prove to themselves that certain businesses have higher claims activity,'' Mr. Cohen said.
Mark Scherzer, a partner in the New York law firm of Scherzer & Palella, which specializes in insurance cases on the behalf of the insured, said: ''A fair number of my clients with AIDS have been in the fashion industry. Some have been told by their health insurance companies that their AIDS was a pre-existing condition. I've also consulted with people who thought they were going into business deals, but decided not to go ahead with them because they knew they would test HIV positive. It seems likely that's a very frequent occurrence.''
 
When a Designer Dies: Talent Isn't Replaceable
 Companies that have lost their head designers have met with varying degrees of success. Tracy Mills Couture, basically a one-man show, folded immediately after the death of its designer, Mr. Mills.
The outlook for the company founded by Mr. Estrada is better. When he died, his sister, Virginia, a sculptor and jewelry designer who had played a designing role in several of his collections, assumed the design responsibilities. But the business had to be changed.
''Everything had to be rethought when Angel died,'' Ms. Estrada said. The company, which had focused on custom-made evening dresses, will produce a sportswear line for this fall. It has also entered a licensing arrangement with a Japanese company, Kindwear, to make clothing in Japan.
''Talent is not replaceable,'' said Laurie Mallet, the president of WilliWear Limited, a company she founded with the designer Willi Smith, who died of AIDS in 1987. Without a designer to make news, Ms. Mallet opened a WilliWear retail store on Fifth Avenue at 19th Street to keep the name visible. Wholesale volume of the women's clothing plummeted. Sales of the men's wear continued to grow.
''It has taken me two years to find a designer with the energy and spirit that Willi had,'' Ms. Mallet said. She recently hired Andre Walker to design WilliWear for women. His first collection will be shown in New York in April.
At Perry Ellis International, first the president, Laughlin Barker, died of AIDS. Then Mr. Ellis himself died.
Despite the turmoil, some Perry Ellis licenses have had strong sales. ''From a business standpoint life goes on and it flourishes,'' said Claudia Thomas, the president of the company. ''We've been devastated by AIDS, savaged by it. On the other hand, we've had increases of 35 percent per annum for the last two years in our licensing income.''
The company hired Marc Jacobs, a resourceful young designer, and Robert Duffy, president of Perry Ellis Sportswear, to rejuvenate the business.
 
For Retailers, Too, It's a Major Problem
 High-fashion retailers have also been affected.
Ira Neimark, chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, said the store had lost at least five employees to the disease in the last five years. Bergdorf's employs about 1,000 people.
''The impact is significant,'' Mr. Neimark said.
Marvin S. Traub, the chairman of Bloomingdale's, has said that employees with AIDS have jobs as long as they are able to work. Lester Gribetz, the store's vice chairman, said, ''In Bloomingdale's we have business people who have tested positive for the disease, and that's a major problem.'' Among them are least two executives in his division, he said.
Visual merchandising, which includes window dressing and displays at stores, has been particularly hard hit.
''For a time last year, it seemed like we were going to funerals every week,'' said Richard L. Stolls, the president of Trimco, a supplier of display materials. ''In the beginning, it was hitting the lower echelon, and it was kind of hush-hush. Then we lost some major contributors to the industry.''
He cited Colin Birch, senior vice president for visual display at Bloomingdale's, and Robert Benzio, vice president for visual presentation at Saks Fifth Avenue.
''They were innovators, creators, extremely talented people,'' Mr. Stolls said. ''From an emotional standpoint it's difficult. You have customers you start relationships with, and then you have to start all over again.''
Mr. Stolls said his company's group insurance rates have soared. ''They've gone up tremendously,'' he said. ''We've changed companies several times in the last few years.''
 
'I Live With It. I Work With It.'
 AIDS is antithetical to everything the image-conscious fashion business stands for: beauty, youth, fitness, vitality, success and well being. And it undercuts one of the eternal lures of beautiful clothes: sex.
In the beginning, AIDS was shrouded in secrecy and denial. Now, coping with its sinister presence has become a fact of daily life in the fashion world.
''We're used to our grandparents or elderly people dying,'' said Ms. Pastor, the former Perry Ellis designer. ''All of a sudden, we've been faced with the death of our contemporaries, our co-workers. The effect in the workplace when someone has AIDS is psychologically very devastating.''
On the job it can mean looking and feeling great one day, and being in the hospital the next.
''I spend an inordinate amount of time and effort staying well,'' said a fashion publicist who has AIDS. He preferred to be identified, but his supervisors insisted that he not be.
''I live with it,'' the publicist said. ''I work with it. I arrange to have less stress. I feel guilty when I'm not pulling my weight.''
Arthur Fitting, the co-founder of New York Sport, a sportswear company, closed his business last year, partly because his partner had contracted AIDS. Mr. Fitting, who is a registered nurse, now works for Unity Health Care, a company that provides ambulatory AIDS treatment.
''The stress of starting a new company had a tremendous impact on my partner's health,'' Mr. Fitting said. ''Start-up costs, cash flow, the pace of the seasons - you can't be fighting for your life and have all that on your shoulders.''

HEADLINE: As Jerusalem Labors to Settle Soviet Jews, Native Israelis Slip Quietly Away

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLON, Israel, Feb. 7

 BODY:
At times it seemed a futile exercise. But for weeks on end Mordechai Glick and a few other volunteers showed up outside the United States Embassy each morning at dawn and handed leaflets to Israelis waiting in long lines outside the visa office.
''This Is Home!'' said the boldface headline. The text went on to add, ''You know deep in your hearts that only in Israel do you have a future as Jews.'' At the bottom, the leaflet was signed, ''The Organization to Stop Emigration From Israel.''
Mr. Glick said that as he handed the little blue papers to each of the visa applicants, ''all of them read it.'' 
''They were interested,'' he said, adding that ''some of them folded the papers into their passports'' but that not one person stepped out of line.
That was last summer. And in the months since then, most of the association's volunteers have stopped their work for the cause, trying to stop the steady stream of Israeli citizens who give up on their country, pack their belongings and move abroad, most often to the United States.
 
Outward Flow Ignored
As Mr. Glick and the others tell it, the huge wave of Soviet immigrants now pouring into Israel has so captured the Government's interest that it pays no attention to what the critics see as the larger problem of emigration, or, as it is called here, ''yerida,'' a Hebrew word meaning ''to go down.''
''No one's interested anymore,'' said Sipi Kichler, a teacher still active in the cause. ''Now the whole story is aliyah,'' or going up, as in moving to Israel.
But as Israel grows wholly preoccupied with absorbing a mass of Soviet immigrants - teaching them Hebrew, retraining them for jobs, finding them homes and settling them into Israeli society, all at great cost - far more Israelis who already have job skills, homes and deep familiarity with all aspects of life here are leaving.
''How can we as a country invest so much in these people, our citizens, and let them go?'' Mr. Glick asked. ''How can we survive if we do that? The state of Israel should be dealing with the yordim, those who flee, not just aliyah.'' #15,000 Moved Away Government statistics show that 12,923 Soviet Jews moved to Israel in 1989. But at the same time a Government estimate shows that about 15,000 Israelis packed their belongings and moved away. That figure does not count the many others who left the country on tourist visas with a vague intention to return one day. Many thousands of those people are not expected ever to come back.
For Israelis, the problem is not just the loss of skilled workers and Jewish citizens, already far outnumbered by Arabs in the region. The problem of yerida touches Israel's soul.
This state was founded to be the home for all the world's Jews, and Israelis find it troubling enough that most Jews choose not to move here. If thousands of Jews already here give up and move away, to many Israelis that is an an even more eloquent statement that the state has failed to be a successful Jewish homeland.
It may be that because of the psychological problem, as much as anything else, the Government chooses to ignore the problem. Thinking about the yerida problem makes Israelis uncomfortable. And to slow or stop emigration, Israel would have to lower inflation, lessen unemployment, provide more and cheaper housing, reduce military service and generally improve the quality of life, tasks not easily accomplished.
 
Office Closed Last Year
Until last year, the Absorption Ministry did have an office whose employees worked to discourage emigration. But it was closed last year, as the ministry and the rest of the Government struggled to cope with the heavy weight of Soviet immigration.
''We don't have the time to deal with it, we don't have the money to deal with it anymore,'' said Ida Ben Shitrit, the Absorption Ministry spokesman.
Large-scale emigration has plagued the people of the region for many thousands of years. Living here has always been difficult; the word yordim is derived from the flight of Jews who ''went down'' to Egypt for food and work several thousand years ago.
In the late 19th and early 20th century many of the European Jews who set up religious settlements in Palestine gave up after a few months and returned home, often hungry and diseased.
 
Beginning in the mid-1970's
Emigration abated in the state's first years. But since the mid-1970's, after repeated wars, economic problems and political strife took the luster off Israel's robust, pionering spirit, thousands of Israel's citizens began to leave.
The emigration association estimates that 650,000 Jewish citizens have left since the state was founded, an enormous number considering that Israel's Jewish population is about 3.7 million.
The Absorption Ministry says that estimate is exaggerated; really, only about 365,000 Jews have left, Yitzhak Peretz, the Absorption Minister, said. But in truth no one knows for sure because at any given time tens of thousands of Israelis are abroad for extended periods studying, working or visiting relatives who have already left. No one knows how many of those people will come back.
But Mr. Glick said the anecdotal evidence of emigration is staggering. 'Packing to Move' to the U.S. ''I'm a locksmith, and I'm in a hundred homes a week,'' he said. ''I can't even tell you how many people I see who are packing to move to the United States.''
He and Mrs. Kichler are Holocaust survivors. And it is this experience that makes them and thousands of others in the nation's older generation committed Zionists. They suffered in other countries and now cannot conceive of living anywhere else.
''The Holocaust tells us this is the only country for the Jews,'' Mrs. Kichler said.
Most of the people who are leaving, on the other hand, are younger native-born Israelis, or sabras, who know little of anti-Semitism or life as a minority in another state. They see themselves merely as Israelis, not Zionists.
''The new generation says, 'The fact that I was born here doesn't mean I have to die here,' '' said Rina Bar Tal, the longtime head of the emigration association.
 
Not Usually Impressed
Typically, all these sabras know of life in the West is that the people who live there appear to be wealthier, less troubled. As a result, Mr. Glick says he often lectures groups of young soldiers who are about to be discharged from the army, explaining to them ''what life was like for me abroad.'' But the young men and women usually are not impressed.
''The problem with the sabras,'' he said, ''is that they are naive. They don't know what can happen to them when they go abroad. They don't understand that there are people out there who hate the Jews.
''I explain this to them, but they tell me: 'Fine, but no one here is taking care of us. There are no jobs for us, no places to live. No places for us in the universities. And now all the new immigrants are coming, and they are going to get all the jobs.' ''
What Mr. Glick, Mrs. Kichler and the others want is Government programs to help Israeli young people find jobs and housing before they throw up their hands in despair and leave.
 
'An Israeli G.I. Bill'
''What we need is an Israeli G.I. bill,'' Mrs. Bar Tal said. ''Something to help them with jobs, education, housing.''
Michael Kleiner, chairman of the Parliament's immigration and absortion committee, shakes his head at that idea.
He said: ''We hear that sentiment all the time: 'My boy is leaving the army; he has served his country. Why can't he get some of these benefits the new immigrants are getting?' That kind of reasoning comes from a lack of economic understanding.''
But Uri Gordon, head of the absorption committee for the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental agency deeply involved in immigration issues, tends to agree with Mr. Glick and the others. ''My Government has to do everything it can so the young generation does not continue running from the country,'' he said. ''This has become a crucial subject, and we are not doing enough to fight it.''
Sadness and resignation in his voice, Mr. Glick acknowledged: ''We have lots of problems in this country. Very difficult problems. This particular issue makes people uncomfortable. So it just gets left aside.''

HEADLINE: KENYA WILL ALTER PLANNED HIGH-RISE

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Under pressure from the World Bank and from the United States and Japan, the Kenyan Government has decided to scale back plans for a $200 million 60-story tower that would have been the tallest commercial structure in Africa.
The Government, which had also been criticized by environmentalists for planning the building for the site of a popular downtown park, told a World Bank meeting in London last month that the tower would be modified, probably to 30 stories.
The office building and an accompanying hotel and conference center would be subject to further feasibility studies and would go ahead only in phases and in consultation with donor countries, Kenyan officials said. 
The tower, which was to feature a larger-than-life statue of President Daniel arap Moi, was to be financed by publicly guaranteed loans. Western donors complained that Kenya could not afford such loans because its economy, while stronger than many in Africa, was still strained, particularly given the dramatic fall in coffee prices.
 
Violation of Debt Agreement
Donors pointed out that the loan for the building, together with loans Kenya was seeking for an oil pipeline, a sugar project and equipment for Kenya Airways, would leave the country with more than $400 million in external debt.
Such a level would break an understanding with the International Monetary Fund that the Government would limit such debt to $100 million.
The Kenyan Government was also informed by Western diplomats, particularly from the United States and Japan, that the breaking of the I.M.F. agreement could lead Western donors to cut economic aid to Kenya. When the United States announced last month that it was forgiving part of Kenya's debt to Washington, the new United States Ambassador here, Smith Hempstone, said the entire debt would be written off only if Kenya kept its economic house in order.
Charles Mbinyo, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, who informed the World Bank meeting of Kenya's decision to modify the project, was quoted in a local paper here as saying the Government had never made a firm decision to go ahead with the tower. His remarks seemed to indicate that the Government was trying to find a diplomatic way of putting the project, which dominated the news here for several months, on the back burner.
Kenya until recently was considered a model in Africa for keeping its commercial loans to a manageable level, diplomats said.
 
Many Complaints in Kenya
The tower drew an unusual stream of criticism from Kenyans, who are often reluctant to publicly question officially sanctioned projects, especially ones so identified with the sole political party, the Kenya African National Union. The building was to be the headquarters of the party and its newspaper and television station.
Letters to newspapers deplored losing the park for lunchtime leisure. Kenyan architects advertised in one newspaper against the project's location. One architect estimated that shadows cast by the tall building would start falling over sunny streets by 2 P.M.
The dissent was led by Prof. Wangari Maathai, the leader of an environmental group called the Green Belt Movement, who came under attack from leading politicians, including President Moi, for suggesting that the building could be located elsewhere.
The attacks on Professor Maathai seemed to show the limits of allowable opposition in this one-party nation.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
American Visas for Scientists From the East Are Said to Be Lagging

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Despite the crumbling of cold war barriers, the granting of American visas to Soviet and East European scientists remains mired in red tape, depriving the nation of sorely needed talent, American scientists contend.
Many scientists and Government officials say United States visa policies affecting scientific exchanges are at least as restrictive, and in some cases more so, than they were before the political liberalization begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
The complaints are being made even though State Department figures show that the number of Soviet scientists being granted J-class visas, the type usually given to those coming to conduct research or teach at American institutions, increased from 104 in 1985 to more than 1,000 in 1989.
 
Proportion Said to Be Unchanged
The critics of the policy say the increase resulted not from any easing of American regulations but because Soviet travel restrictions have been greatly liberalized and far more Soviet scientists are applying for United States visas. The proportion being admitted is basically unchanged, they said, and should be far higher. 
A spokesman for the State Department said it does not maintain records of how many Soviet scientists apply for visas each year, but only the number who actually receive them. Nor could the department give overall figures on visas sought by or issued to Eastern European scientists.
Experts on American immigration agreed in interviews that the lack of change in visa policies stems more from inertia than any intentional continuation of an anti-Soviet policy.
Several officials of the State Department and intelligence agencies said in interviews that the legal regulations governing visas for Soviet and East European scientists need to be overhauled.
''Believe me, a lot of us in government sympathize with the complaints by scientists,'' one said. ''The problem is that things have moved so fast in Moscow and the other former Soviet-bloc capitals that all governments, including our own, were caught by surprise. We're playing catchup.''
Critics of the situation said an initiative by Congress was essential to changing what they regard as an overly restrictive system.
 
More Dependent on Foreigners
American science, particularly physics and mathematics, is increasingly dependent on the participation of foreign scientists and graduate students.
''Roughly half of America's graduate physics students are foreign, and a large proportion of them in recent years have been Chinese,'' said Dr. Robert L. Park, director of the Washington office of the American Physical Society. But the flow of Chinese students and scientists to this country virtually halted after Peking's violent repression of a drive for political change last year.
''A lot of those students end up staying in the United States for long periods of time, or even permanently,'' Dr. Park said. ''Without the flow from China we have to get physicists elsewhere, and the Soviet Union, which has a superb system of scientific education, is a logical alternative.''
Under the current regulations, an intelligence board called the Committee on Exchanges, or Comex, a branch of the Technology Transfer Intelligence Committee, examines visa applications from Soviet-bloc scientists and makes recommendations. Members of Comex include representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce.
The main criterion for Comex's recommendations is national security. In general, the object is to prevent secret and ''sensitive'' technology, which is not always classified as secret, from becoming available to Moscow and its allies. But American immigration policies also play a role, especially in excluding visa applicants whose motives are deemed to be purely economic.
That is why 50 percent of the applications from Poland are rejected, said a State Department official, who requested that his name be withheld. Calamitous economic conditions in Poland are prompting a large flow of ''economic refugees'' seeking to enter the United States, not all of whom are authentic scientists, he said.
 
Applicants Are Discouraged
This has discouraged and angered many applicants. In a letter in the January issue of Physics Today, a magazine published by the American Institute of Physics, five Polish physicists complained of ''a strange contradiction between the words of the present American administration and its deeds in handling visa applications for Polish scientists invited to visit American universities.''
The scientists, representing Poland's Institute for Theoretical Physics and the Polish Academy of Sciences, said long delays in the granting of American visas were making it impossible to plan trips, and that visas ''were a lot easier to get five or ten years ago, when Poland could have been treated with much more suspicion than now.''
One case that has sharply focused scientists' attention on United States visa policies involves Dr. Sergei Esipov, a Soviet physicist who was invited to teach at Syracuse University only to have his application denied in December because of an unfavorable recommendation by Comex.
Goodwin Cooke, vice president of Syracuse, said the visa was denied because some technologically ''sensitive'' research is conducted there, to which Comex suspected Dr. Esipov might have access. Mr. Cooke, a former United States career diplomat, said, ''It is preposterous that American universities and American industry should be denied opportunities which others will exploit because of this cold- war process.''
James Dearlove, executive secretary of Comex, referred a telephone request for comment to the Central Intelligence Agency, which said the deliberations of Comex were classified.
In the view of Dr. Glenn Schweitzer, director of Soviet and East European affairs of the National Academy of Sciences, the problem is not that Soviet scientists as a class are unwelcome, but that the administrative screening system is overloaded and lags badly in processing visa applications.
 
'Clogging' of System Is Blamed
''The United States is now issuing about 100,000 visas to Soviet business and professional visitors each year, and the number of Soviet scientists applying for visas is increasing rapidly,'' he said. ''Cases like that of Esipov at Syracuse are not terribly common. The bulk of the problem is the clogging of the administrative system. We're concerned that worries over the transfer of technology to the Soviets should not unnecessarily inhibit scientific communication between us. The need for such communication has become greater than ever.''
Dr. Grayson Sher, manager of the Soviet exchange program at the National Science Foundation, agreed. ''The number of Soviet scientists who want to travel is increasing, and despite change in international relations brought about by glasnost, the granting of American visas has not eased,'' Dr. Shjer said.
''Reviewing each of these cases is time-consuming,'' an intelligence official said, speaking on condition that his name and affiliation be witheld. ''But the present Comex procedure, in which representatives of the intelligence community and other concerned agencies sit down together to talk things out and reach a collective decision, is far better than the way things were done in the past.''
Another official said that a problem Comex often has to confront is a lack of information. When Comex deems a visa applicant a potential conduit of sensitive technology to Moscow, the committee needs extra background information about the applicant to reach a decision, an informant said. When such information is lacking, the committee is more likely to reject the application.
But this explanation does not satisfy critics of the system.
''Simply stated, the old rules are depriving us of scientific brains and commercial advantages,'' Mr. Cooke said. ''Things there have changed, and it's high time Congress got around to changing our own rules. We are living in a new world.''

HEADLINE: Southeast Asia Is Now No. 1 Source of U.S. Heroin

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia, whose flow of drugs the United States has been trying to control for 25 years, is once again the single-largest source of heroin coming into America, with production levels rising sharply.
In 1987, only 18 percent of the heroin in the United States originated in Southeast Asia; today the figure is at least 45 percent. Six years ago, 5 percent of the heroin in New York City was Southeast Asian; today, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the figure is 80 percent.
The increase is a result of many factors, Western diplomats and law-enforcement officials say, ranging from unrest in Myanmar, formerly Burma, to a decision by some drug smugglers to bypass Latin America, which has gotten increasing attention from governmental authorities, and seek safer routes.
The changing patterns of heroin supply have brought new and unwanted attention to Thailand as the main smuggling and shipment center for heroin from the Golden Triangle, where Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet. 
 
Thai Economy Booms
Although Thailand is praised by Western diplomats for having sharply reduced the amount of opium-poppy cultivation on its territory, the rapidly developing communications and transport systems of it booming economy are also being used for shipping the increasing amounts of heroin being produced in Laos and Myanmar to Europe and America. The large growth in Thai exports and in tourism here provides more options for smuggling, ranging from individual couriers to large shipments hidden deep in legitimate exports moving through containerized ports.
The amount of money at stake, Western diplomats and Thai officials say, makes the problem of corruption among Thai police, army and customs officials, none of whom are paid very well, a growing concern even for a well-intentioned Thai Government that cooperates with Western law-enforcement authorities.
Thai sensitivity to public suggestions of corruption and complicity is very high, but the tone of even private discussions about drugs between American and Thai officials is becoming more ''forthright'' and ''even, at times, angry,'' Western diplomats say, despite extensive cooperation between the two Governments.
''We're trying to get across to the Thais that drugs are an international problem and that Thailand is a target, too,'' a diplomat said. $3 Million in Anti-Drug Aid Despite the increased flow of heroin from the region, the United States provides only $3 million a year in anti-drug aid to Thailand, down from $3.5 million in the 1989 fiscal year. The request for the 1991 fiscal year is $4 million. The money is used to help Thailand install computerized immigration checks, support raids on opium refineries and opium-crop eradication, help a crop-substitution program and finance some drug-treatment centers.
Given that less than 2 percent of the region's opium is grown in Thailand but that most of it is shipped from here, the aid is being focused more on improving customs checks and police training.
The major increase in opium cultivation is taking place in Myanmar and Laos, two of the world's most isolated countries. The Laotian Government, which the United States has in the past accused of involvement in drug production, agreed only last month to start a crop-substitution program, with an initial American commitment of some $200,000 in aid.
A $6 million- to $8 million-a-year program to aid Myanmar's military Government in crop eradication was suspended along with all other American aid and loans in September 1988, after a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. That aid was in part siphoned to other military uses and only held down the rate of increase in opium production.
But some members of Congress, like Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, argue that with opium cultivation in Myanmar ''out of control,'' the aid should now be renewed, despite objections to the regime on human-rights grounds and some evidence that the Burmese Government is itself involved in the drug trade to boost its tiny foreign-currency reserves.
 
Productions Rising Sharply
Western experts say that depending on the growing season, which runs through March, at least 2,600 metric tons of raw opium will be produced in the Golden Triangle and perhaps as much as 3,000 tons, producing 300 tons of heroin. Even the lower figure represents an increase of 44 percent over two years ago, much of it coming from Myanmar.
Western experts estimate that about 2,200 to 2,600 tons of opium will be produced this year in Myanmar, compared with 2,000 tons last year and about 1,600 in 1988. Thailand will produce about 50 tons, about the same as the last two years, but only a third of the 150 tons produced in 1970.
The estimated figure this year for Laos is between 300 and 400 tons. Last year, the estimate was between 200 and 300 tons, and the year before that, between 100 and 200 tons. But Western experts say no one really knows for sure.
With the increase in heroin production, Thailand's role of regional entrepot is drawing more criticism.
 
Concern in Congress
Last month, a delegation of congressmen led by Representative Rangel, chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said here that Congress was ''concerned about the explosion of opium and heroin coming through Thailand.'' He said, ''We are losing the war on heroin, and we are losing this war in Southeast Asia.''
Representative James F. Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, said Thailand risked becoming ''stigmatized'' internationally as a major drug center, like Colombia. Like Colombia, too, he said, Thailand also risked becoming a further focus for well-armed and well-financed drug syndicates that might threaten the stability of the state.
The reaction from a Government spokesman, Likhit Hongladarom, was both sharp and defensive. Members of Congress would do better advising the American Government on how to cut demand for drugs than seeking to discredit Thailand, Mr. Likhit said.
''To avoid disrupting bilateral cooperation on narcotics,'' he said, ''we hope the U.S. Government will come up with a more friendly and constructive way to enhance our joint efforts in controlling the drug situation.''
 
U.S. Indicts Thai General
While the Thais will act swiftly when presented with a case against an official built by a foreign government, diplomats say, few prosecutions are developed domestically.
Last July, an American grand jury indicted Maj. Gen. Vech Pechborom of the Thai police on four counts of heroin trafficking, alleging that he allowed heroin to move through Don Muang Airport here. General Vech has been suspended while the Thai police investigate, a process that is nearing completion, officials say.
''The Thais have been very cooperative on this one,'' a Western diplomat said, adding that they had rejected opportunities to drop the case or to reassign investigators challenged by General Vech.
But officials from Singapore and Malaysia, which have harsh laws against drug trafficking and use, complain that the Thais will not extradite any Thai national. Nor does the American-Thai extradition treaty allow the extradition of Thais.
Thailand also lacks a narcotics conspiracy law, making prosecutions difficult against anyone higher than a courier actually caught with drugs, and does not allow the seizure of assets garned from drug trafficking, two prime complaints made by American and other Western officials.
Lieut. Gen. Chavalit Yodmani, director of Thailand's Office of Narcotics Control Board, says such laws are coming after a draft receives a proper interdepartmental and Cabinet review. He stresses the new efforts being made to disrupt international trafficking, with a significant increase in the amount of heroin seized in 1988, the continued replacement of opium poppies by more profitable crops in Thailand, and a new drug rehabilitation program.
 
Arrests Called Ineffective
But according to the United States Government's ''International Narcotics and Controlled Substances Review,'' the amount of heroin production and refining in Thailand itself has been increasing, unmatched by ''corresponding interdiction success'' by the Thais, with the largest part of narcotics arrests made for possession and consumption. From January to May of 1989, the percentage of those arrested for production, trafficking or export of narcotics was less than 8 percent. In addition, the review says, ''corruption and lack of a conspiracy law hinder effective enforcement.''
In addition to the heroin from Southeast Asia, the illegal drug market in the United States imports heroin from Southwest Asia, mainly from production areas in Iran, Iraq and Afganistan, and from Mexico.
Federal studies indicate that there are nearly a half million heroin users in the United States and about six million cocaine users.
The sharp increase in the supply of heroin, combined with excellent quality, has meant both a small drop in price and a large increase in the purity of the drug bought on American streets, resulting in more deaths from overdoses. Western experts also say a combination of heroin with crack cocaine is becoming increasingly popular among American drug users, easing the depression that normally follows a crack cocaine high. Drug users are also combining heroin with amphetamines.
''The focus in America is on cocaine,'' a senior Western diplomat said. ''But more heroin is coming in, and it's killing people, too.''

HEADLINE: No Perrier? A Status Bubble Bursts

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
Page Lee, a 27-year-old aerobics instructor at the Body Bank in Washington, felt this way: ''I am really bummed!''
On the other hand, George Tyson, a shopper at Rice Food Market in Houston, felt this way: ''Anything with a name I can't pronounce, I don't drink.''
Restaurants and stores all across America packed up their Perrier yesterday after 72 million bottles of the fashionable water were recalled when benzene was discovered in some samples. And the country seemed to divide into two sorts of people: those who mourned and those who gloated.
There was much discussion of how America would survive the great Perrier drought, which a company official in Connecticut said would last two to three months. 
 
Tony Little Green Bottles
''An entire class of people have just had their weekends ruined,'' said John Buckley, a Republican consultant in Washington, who was interviewed while grumpily clearing six pear-shaped green bottles from his refrigerator.
Wendy Wasserstein, the New York playwright, exclaimed upon hearing the news: ''Oh, this is terrible! It's the end of an era. We'll all have to go back to Scotch.''
The news hit with a shock because Perrier has become more than a mere product in the American marketplace. The tony little green bottles of French sparkling water, which sell for up to $3.50 in restaurants, have become the most vivid symbol of the status-minded and health-conscious lifestyle of the baby boom generation.
 
End 'With a Bubble'
It was not exactly the end of history for the yuppie set, who had helped turn ''nature's soft drink'' into a multimillion dollar fad, but it was close.
''Whoever thought the yuppie era would end not with a bang but with a bubble?'' marveled Christopher Buckley, a magazine editor and John Buckley's cousin.
Those who were not mourning included Scott Brannon, the manager of Buck's Underground restaurant in Atlanta who proudly counted himself and his customers in the column of Americans who would not suffer pangs of Perrier withdrawal.
''Frankly,'' he said, ''our clientele is more the beer-in-a-long-necked-bottle type.''
Bo Petersen, a resident of Dallas, N.C., echoed many others interviewed when he said he had been suspicious all along of a product that looked and tasted like water but cost as much as a drink of alcohol. ''You might have known this would happen when it started bubbling,'' he said. ''I wouldn't drink the stuff myself.''
In California, there was also gloating, with many of the trend-setting residents of Los Angeles explaining that they had long since given up on Perrier, since it was considered too common.
''It hasn't been hip for a while,'' said Daniel Huntoon, the manager of Hugo's Restaurant, where celebrities can often be seen sipping bottled water. ''We serve Ramlosa instead because it's a smaller bottle with less water for the same price, so we make even more money than with Perrier.''
 
Capping a Series of Indignities
In Washington, young professionals complained that the recall capped a series of indignities they have suffered over the past few years. It seemed that every trend they adopted turned into a cliche and every attempt to live pure, healthy lives was sabotaged by some new health scare.
Fred Khedouri, an investment banker in the capital, agreed, ''I have a vision of hands reaching out for a cocktail but frozen at mid-grasp, seized with a new fear.''
Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, said he had been worried about fluoride in tap water and had just decided to start consuming Perrier but now was nervously waiting to see what would happen with the bottled water. ''Personally, I am not going to be satisfied until thousands of rats have consumed millions of bottles of Perrier and survived.''
As yuppies poured their Perrier down the drain and debated the merits of Pellegrino water versus Ramlosa, they wondered whether the recall might be a defining moment. Would they finally learn that life, despite all attempts to control it, can never be risk-free? Would image and status cease to be of such overriding importance in their lives?
''Those who live by the image perish by the image,'' warned Michael Kinsley, the columnist and television commentator. ''At this rate, in another month, we'll be back to burgers, fries and a Coke.''
Those who were mourning the news of the possible contamination of Perrier included Sally Quinn, the journalist and novelist who was planning a Saturday night Valentine's party at her Georgetown home. ''I am sitting here staring at a case of Perrier and wondering if I lie and tell the guests that it's Saratoga water,'' she mused, before the party started. ''I think the answer is yes.''
Not everyone credited the new health threat. For instance, Bruce Ames, a professor of biochemistry at the University of California at Berkeley who is an expert in toxins, argued that ''we have to stop getting completely hysterical about all these hypothetical risks.''
But for many people in a generation that has focused on fitness and health, the news was discouraging and reminiscent of a scene in the Woody Allen movie, ''Sleeper.'' When Mr. Allen's character suddenly finds himself 200 years in the future, scientists explain to him that they have learned that life-preserving properties are not found in wheat germ, organic honey and tiger's milk, as previously thought, but in deep fat, steak, cream pies and hot fudge.
 
What Are We Supposed to Do?'
''First they tell us mother's milk causes cancer,'' fretted Jonathan Pizer, a resident of Chicago's north side. ''Then they tell us oat bran really doesn't reduce cholesterol. Now they tell us Perrier contains benzene. What are we supposed to do?
''It's Reagan's fault,'' Mr. Pizer added. ''I don't know how, but it is.''
Aside from any possible health risks, however, some people took the recall as a sign that, as Gertrude Stein once observed, affectations can be dangerous.
Fritz Streiff, the maitre d'hotel at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, said he was going to begin to rid his restaurant of Levissima, Evian, Crystal Geyser and Perrier. ''We've been looking forward to eliminating imported bottle water from our menu for some time because of its pretention,'' he said. ''It seems to me that moving water from one continent to another is one of the sillier things we do. Nothing's safe. We're better off having local water.''
If the French brand was already considered passe on the West Coast, superseded by Swedish and Italian rivals, it was had still been reigning supreme in the East.
Damien Palladino, the manager of the Palm Restaurant in Washington, where bottles of Perrier are kept on every table, was shocked to hear the recall news this afternoon from a reporter. ''Oh, gosh, maybe I should give Perrier a call,'' he said, as he went to retrieve the outstanding bottles from lunch tables.
Bruce Snyder, the vice president of Manhattan's 21 Club, called it ''by far'' the most popular bottled water with his customers, who like to mix it with bourbon or Scotch.
''They'll probably drink another bottled water now, but I'll drink good old New York water as I always have,'' the 21 executive said proudly.
At Tavern on the Green, Arthur Greenan, the restaurant director, said customers who insisted would continue to be served Perrier. ''But the staff,'' he said, ''has been instructed to suggest an alternative.''

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Legacy From Photography's Mount Olympus

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg

 BODY:
Of the score or more museum exhibitions organized in ob-servance of 150 years of photography, none has been more eagerly awaited than ''Photography Until Now,'' which opens next Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. The anticipation is partly a matter of timing, since ''Photography Until Now'' is the last of the sesquicentennial shows to make an appearance. But it is also a reflection of the stature of the show's curator, John Szarkowski.
Mr. Szarkowski has been the director of the museum's department of photography for the last 28 years, and his influence on postwar American photography has been so profound as to be incalculable. His exhibitions, of photographers as diverse as Eugene Atget and Diane Arbus, have revised the photographic canon. His books, notably ''The Photographer's Eye'' (1966) and ''Looking at Photographs'' (1973), have enabled an ever expanding audience to see photographs as objects of delectation and wonder. Because of his refined eye and polished writing style, the Museum of Modern Art has been the Mount Olympus of the art of photography for most of his tenure. 
Today, at the age of 64, he is the most senior of the museum's department directors and one of the few on the staff to have worked under Alfred Barr, the museum's founding director. It is widely expected that he will retire soon, although he will not comment on the subject. But there is little doubt that his long career is now winding down, and the scope and conviction of ''Photography Until Now'' suggest that it may well be the crowning jewel of his legacy.
Unlike the most heralded photography surveys that appeared in American museums in 1989, ''Photography Until Now'' did not issue from a committee of curators. It is clearly the product of a single intelligence, one that has spent decades mulling over ways to best organize and explicate the photographic tradition.
The exhibition and the 343-page book that accompanies it were organized around one basic premise: that technology has been a motivating force in the development of the pictorial possibilities of photography. Mr. Szarkowski does not go so far as to suggest that technology determines the difference between, say, Edouard-Denis Baldus's view of the Pont du Gard in mid-19th-century France, taken with a glass negative, and William Wegman's diptych of his dog Man Ray, made with a 20-by-24-inch Polaroid camera in 1982. (Both works appear in the show.) But he does say, in the book's introduction, that he has ''attempted . . . to sketch out a history of photographic pictures, organized according to patterns of technological change.
''The word technology here refers not only to the chemical and optical issues often thought of as constituting photographic craft,'' he continues, ''but to methods of distribution of photographic imagery, economic constraints, and professional structures.''
In an interview conducted in his office early this month, he said that the notion of doing a history of photography first occurred to him 15 to 20 years ago, as a result of conversations he had with the art historian Beaumont Newhall. Mr. Newhall, who was the museum's first photography curator, wrote what has become the standard English-language history of photography, ''The History of Photography From 1839 to the Present.''
In Mr. Szarkowski's eyes, the Newhall history and all subsequent histories that have been modeled on it lack a consistent underlying theory that would account for the medium's development. He notes that Mr. Newhall's pioneering work is ''one of the great achievements in 20th-century art history,'' but adds, ''If you took me to a torture room, I'd have to say it has too many chapters, and they are too discrete. His chapter 'Documentary Photography' doesn't really touch on the one called 'Straight Photography.' ''
While there are 16 chapters in the fifth edition of Mr. Newhall's book, Mr. Szarkowski has been content with seven. They range from ''Before Photography,'' which recounts the invention of the camera obscura and Renaissance perspective, to ''After the Magazines,'' which contains the curator's views on photography as recent as Nicholas Nixon's 1988 portrait of a man with AIDS.
The common thread that connects Mr. Nixon's picture with an 1850 daguerreotype, Mr. Szarkowski argues, is their dependence on technology. ''The one thing everybody is affected by is the nature of the mechanical conditions,'' he said. Even self-consciously artistic photographers like Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand, he believes, did not ignore the technology of their time. They rebelled against the growing domain of photomechanical reproduction, he says, by producing pictures that defied the halftone processes then available.
''I'm not trying to tell the history of photographic technology,'' he added. ''I'm trying to tell the story of photographic pictures. But as an organizing principle it allows you to talk about all photographers at once.'' The show's 275-odd pictures include anonymous portraits, advertising images and scientific documents as well as canonical works by well-known art photographers. To the curator, ''it's all one piece of cloth.''
To those acquainted with Mr. Szarkowski's exhibition record, his organizing principle may seem to be merely a confirmation of his lifelong conviction that the art of photography is fundamentally different from other means of making images. (Indeed, he once wrote an article for this newspaper titled ''A Different Kind of Art.'') His thesis, one could say, is a restatement in historical terms of his belief that photography's status as an art rests with its distinct formal qualities.
This belief was first spelled out in his 1966 book ''The Photographer's Eye,'' which has proved to be immensely useful as a primer for appreciating photographs. In words that still ring with conviction, Mr. Szarkowski enunciated his belief that photography is ontologically distinct: ''The invention of photography provided a radically new picture-making process - a process based not on synthesis but on selection. The difference was a basic one. Paintings were made . . . but photographs, as the man on the street put it, were taken.''
The rest of ''The Photographer's Eye'' is divided into sections called ''The Thing Itself,'' ''The Detail,'' ''The Frame,'' ''Time'' and ''Vantage Point'' - precisely those aspects of photography that, in Mr. Szarkowski's view, make it unique.
During the last 10 years, this view has come under increasing attack. Photographers who have sought to connect their work to issues of concern to painters and sculptors, and artists who have come to photography from outside its historical traditions, disavow Mr. Szarkowski's insistence on photography's individuality. Many young scholars and critics argue that photography's real importance is a matter of its social functions and representations, not of any inherent qualities individual photographs may possess.
The conflict between these views and Mr. Szarkowski's is fundamental, and it no doubt explains why the curator remains lukewarm at best toward much recent vanguard art that employs photography. He even admits to being baffled by the term post-modernism; in an interview with Carol Squiers in the February issue of Elle, he remarks that it ''must mean a great deal more than what I understand it to mean.''
Mr. Szarkowski's understanding of post-modernist uses of photography may be greater than he lets on. ''Photography Until Now'' includes the work of Robert Cumming, Cindy Sherman and William Wegman, but his ambivolence has made the Museum of Modern Art less of a force in photography today than it was in the 1960's and course; critics of the museum have complained for years that the institution has lost touch with the vanguard of painting and sculpture as well.
Unlike Mr. Newhall's history, ''Photography Until Now'' does not seem to culminate in the present, and there is little sense of progress in its closing chapter. ''I think there is a lot of uncertainty and angst in photography today,'' Mr. Szarkowski said, noting that he sometimes wishes he could have been a photographer in the late 19th century. ''But there is also a lot of vitality and talent.''
He does not believe that television has altered late-20th-century photography in the same way that halftone printing did in the late 19th century. ''What's good in television relates to movies, to theater. It relates to a different series of precedents, not to what we think of as picture making,'' he said. This puts him squarely at odds with critics who believe that television and photography have worked together to create a ''simulacrum,'' or hollow model of reality - a view that is expressed in ''Image World: Art and Media Culture,'' the Whitney Museum of American Art's somewhat jaundiced tribute to photography, which closes next Sunday.
In the final analysis, however, curators are mainly measured by their exhibition records, and by this standard Mr. Szarkowski must be accorded a place alongside Alfred Barr. Among his most important and best-known shows are ''New Documents'' (1967), which introduced Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand; the Arbus retrospective of 1972; ''From the Picture Press'' (1973); ''William Eggleston'' (1976), and ''The Work of Atget,'' which appeared in four parts from 1981 to 1985. A few of his efforts have falled short of their ambitions, notably the 1978 show ''Mirrors and Windows: American Photography Since 1960,'' but on balance his exhibitions have been conceived and executed with uncommon skill.
Mr. Szarkowski was a 35-year-old photographer with two Guggenheim fellowships under his belt when he was hired to take Edward Steichen's place at the Modern in 1962. Today, he looks back fondly at his early days at the museum. ''It was fun then,'' he said. ''You could do two one-man shows a year, and most of them had never been done before.'' Now, he remarked, almost all major photographers have had at least one museum exhibition devoted to their work, so the challenges are different.
Observers inside and outside the museum speculate that the person most likely to succeed Mr. Szarkowski is Peter Galassi, a curator in the photography department. (According to museum procedures, Mr. Szarkowski's successor will be chosen by a search committee to be named when he retires.) Mr. Galassi, 38, has the proper credentials: he studied art history at Columbia under Kirk Varnedoe, now the director of the museum's department of painting and sculpture, and he has organized two exhibitions with provocative art-historical implications: ''Before Photography'' and ''Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Early Work.'' In ''Before Photography,'' Mr. Galassi argued that the visual appearance of 19th-century photographs was anticipated by paintings; in the Cartier-Bresson show he contended that the French photographer's best work had its roots in Surrealism, not photojournalism.
If Mr. Galassi's ideas about the medium's nature and its past do not precisely coincide with Mr. Szarkowski's, his ambitious curatorial style may. What remains to been seen is whether any inheritor of the photography world's most prestigious post can match Mr. Szarkowski's eye for pictures and his instinct for spotting young talents like Arbus, Eggleston, Friedlander and Winogrand.
 
 
THINKING IN NUANCES
 John Szarkowski's influence as a curator has been considerably enhanced by his writing talents. His cadenced, mellifluous prose complements the nuanced, metaphoric quality of his thinking, as these excerpts from ''Photography Until Now'' suggest. On the medium's origins: ''It would be simple enough . . . to trace the long line of optical and chemical observations and experiments that provided the technical basis on which the inventors of photography depended. The more difficult question is: from where, and how, did the idea evolve that one might catch a picture in a net, as one might catch not only the butterfly but the piece of sky in which it flew?'' On the multiplicity of photography's inventors: ''There were other inventors and possible inventors and would-be inventors whose names at least we know, and sometimes more. And the experimenters whose names we do not know might make an even longer list, and they also may have undermined their health, squandered their fortunes, neglected their families, and compromised their ethical principles to bring into existence this interesting new tool, even though it now seems unlikely that anyone could have held it back.''
On the state of photography today:
'' . . . only a generation earlier photographers still thought they had a privileged access to truth and thus to power. Not many years ago this perception was proven false, but perhaps it was false before it was proven so. Perhaps nothing of consequence was lost - only an illusion.''

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
The Lure of Fordism, Jazz and 'Americanismus'

BYLINE: by Michael Kimmelman

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
''Envisioning America'' at Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum may be the latest foray into the subject of art and American popular culture, but the works of Barbara Kruger, Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Anderson are nowhere to be found. Andy Warhol's name is never evoked.
This is a show about art and American politics but Hans Haacke isn't here, and neither, for that matter, are the Guerrilla Girls or Gran Fury. It is a show that deals with such issues as capitalist expansionism, racism and jingoistic fears of being overrun by a foreign economic and technological power, but Japan certainly never crossed the minds of the artists whose drawings, prints and photographs are on view. 
''Envisioning America'' is, in fact, about the art of Germany between 1915 and 1933, but it may be difficult for some visitors to pass through this perceptive and well-selected show without at least briefly musing on how strong are some of the ties between the works here and the works of such contemporary artists as Ms. Kruger, Mr. Haacke and Ms. Sherman.
This was hardly the exhibition's goal, of course. Beeke Sell Tower of the Goethe-Institut in Boston, with the assistance of Peter Nisbet, curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard, has assembled from public and private collections throughout Europe and the United States some 65 works by artists like George Grosz, Otto Dix, Max Beckmann and Josef Albers. She has chosen to focus on four themes that were of particular concern to these artists - the Wild West, the metropolis, politics and popular culture.
Evidently, America was not a country that German artists of the early 20th century had experienced first hand (Grosz moved to the United States only after the period covered by this show) but one they imagined from afar, a culture filtered through movies, magazines and books. America became for them a symbol of opportunity and modernity but also of greed, a country that could produce Chaplin, James Fenimore Cooper and Henry Ford as well as lynch mobs and gangsters. It was, in other words, a myth of shifting and contradictory dimensions.
Grosz and his Dadaist colleagues drew particular inspiration from advertisements and the mass media, and they conceived of their appropriations from American popular culture as assaults on so-called high art and on the bourgeois society that supported it.
They published Neue Jugend, a short-lived journal that appeared in 1917 and extolled the virtues of ''Americanismus'' by borrowing from American newspaper and magazine designs. They devoured Cooper's novels about the Wild West and attended every western that made its way into Berlin's movie houses. The images in these films of a vast and still untamed country appealed so strongly to Grosz, Rudolf Schlichter and several of their colleagues that they even took to dressing up in the guises of gold prospectors, cowboys and Indians. Germany represented a cramped and decaying civilization. The America they saw on the screen seemed to hold out endless possibility.
Which is not to say that they admired America unconditionally. Long before the invention of MTV, the tempo of American life was recognized and depicted by German artists as frantic and fragmentary. When Hannah Hoch constructed a collage in 1920 entitled ''Cut With a Kitchen Knife Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Epoch of Germany,'' she mixed German and American images in a furious, helter-skelter fashion that approximated a ragtime beat. When Grosz designed his lithograph ''Self-Portrait (for Charlie Chaplin)'' in 1919 he imagined an Americanized world that was a claustrophic jumble of strippers, boxers, cigar stands and smokestacks.
Particularly after World War I and with the role played by American businesses in the process of German restructuring, artists divided strongly on the issue of Americanism. To artists on the Left, especially, the United States embodied capitalism and mechanization in all its lowest manifestations. John Heartfield's dustjacket design of Upton Sinclair's book ''100 Percent,'' for instance, juxtaposed magazine photographs of the Ku Klux Klan with an image of a policeman hauling a worker to jail. Gerd Arntz focused on life in the American factory, where he imagined men were made to approximate machines. His ''Things American'' of 1924 featured a faceless chorus line near a hanged black man and what may be a speeding automobile. Grosz, for his part, moved from mixed admiration to occasionally outright hostility in his attitude toward America, as is suggested by a satirical depiction from around 1924 of a smug businessman before an American flag, entitled ''Soon Europe Will Be a Suburb of New York.'' News of the executions in 1927 of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti stirred Grosz to produce what may be his most melodramatic drawing, in which a bloodstained Statue of Liberty holds aloft an electric chair in place of the torch.
German artists, it must be said, were by no means above making racist asides in their works toward black musicians and minstrel singers. And there was, in their equation of Americanism with exoticism, a sense that the United States was a country of primitive peoples.
Yet even during the 20's and early 30's, aspects of American life continued to hold for German artists of all political persuasions an unmistakable allure. America may have been considered the cause of what came to be known derogatorily as Fordism, but it was also home to jazz. Perhaps no object symbolized contemporaneity more than the saxophone. Grosz and Dix and Paul Klee all saw in nightclubs and ragtime bands the most perfect embodiment of what Ms. Tower calls America's ''otherness.''
''Jazz,'' she concludes in the catalogue, ''was metaphorically burdened with all the ills of an America that seemed too fast, too mechanized, too uncultured, too alien to European minds. Conversely, it served as a manifesto of modernity and progress, especially among the young members of the postwar avant-garde.''
This point was obviously not lost on the Nazis, who chose to illustrate the cover of a 1938 catalogue of what they considered degenerate music with an image of a black saxophonist wearing a Star of David on his chest. Debates today over the influence of popular culture on art seem tame by comparison. In any case, as ''Envisioning America'' makes clear, they are nothing new.
The exhibition remains at Harvard through March 18. It will be at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies from April 19 to June 24.

HEADLINE: Bill Simon's Audacious S. & L. Gamble

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
William E. Simon has a problem, and true to the former Treasury Secretary's reputation, he has a rather audacious solution.
Honfed Bank of Honolulu, one of the savings and loans owned by the investment group Mr. Simon leads, needs a big injection of capital to meet the Government's strict new financial standards.
Mr. Simon's plan for dealing with the shortfall is one that no other institution in Honfed's condition could hope to pull off. He wants to raise the money from public investors willing to trade the considerable risks of the savings business for the chance to get in on a deal with him.
''Never before has the individual investor had the opportunity to invest alongside William E. Simon in a widely distributed public transaction,'' trumpets a promotional brochure prepared for the Honfed deal by the Wall Street firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. 
That Mr. Simon would even attempt a public offering astounds many analysts. Honfed, while profitable, is technically insolvent under the Government's new rules, although Mr. Simon's associates prefer the phrase ''capital deficient.'' And this being an era in which savings and loan failures and taxpayer bailouts dominate the headlines, Wall Street of late has not been willing to invest in any but the handful of most profitable savings institutions.
''The Simon name aside, the capital markets have been closed to marginal savings and loans, and my sense is that the Street is not going to be wildly enthusiastic about this,'' said Bert Ely, a savings and loan consultant based in Alexandria, Va.
Still, there is an undeniable appeal to the offer. Mr. Simon's investment record, extending back to the leveraged buyout of Gibson Greeting Cards, in which he turned $330,000 of his own money into a $70 million profit in 1984, is the stuff of legend.
Just last week, Mr. Simon agreed to sell First Interstate Bank of Hawaii, another piece of his nascent financial-services empire, in a deal that should allow him to pocket a profit of more than $20 million on a one-year investment of $15 million. Moreover, there are preliminary signs that Honfed could reap some big profits on its real estate holdings, helping its financial condition and allowing it to scale back the size of the public offering.
Mr. Simon declined to discuss Honfed while its offering is being reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But, not surprisingly for a man who has never lacked confidence in his decisions, he expressed satisfaction with his investments in the savings and loan business, reiterated his faith in the industry's long-term prospects and dismissed the criticisms of those who do not look beyond the industry's current travails.
 
Raising Eyebrows
 ''People are slow in coming around to this kind of thinking,'' Mr. Simon said. ''It's the fellow at the head of the pack that people always raise their eyebrows about.''
People have always raised their eyebrows about Bill Simon. Despite the protests of friends and colleagues who admire his wit, charm and generosity, he has long been tagged as arrogant, impatient and ruthless, whether in exercising power in Washington or in adding to a fortune that Forbes magazine estimated last year at $300 million. His success over the last decade has brought carping, some of it no doubt the product of jealousy, that he gets too much credit for deals engineered by others or that his deals minimize his own risk while putting it squarely on others.
If nothing else, the Honfed situation may be the stiffest test yet of the Simon mystique. Mr. Simon's strategy for dealing with Honfed provides a look at how his current ventures operate and how he and his partners are trying to cope with the rapidly changing regulatory environment.
As one of a number of troubled savings institutions acquired in recent years with direct or indirect Government assistance by some of the nation's most sophisticated financiers, including Ronald O. Perelman and Robert M. Bass, Honfed also could eventually be another test of whether Federal regulators gave away too much to lure well-heeled owners into the industry.
That question was raised with new intensity earlier this month when the California-based American Savings Bank, acquired by the Bass Group with well over $1 billion in Government aid, reported record earnings of $214 million for 1989.
For now, it is far too early to speak of Mr. Simon cashing in with Honfed, Hawaii's largest savings and loan company. Indeed, his plans to wean Honfed back to health have been complicated by the sweeping legislation to reform the savings and loan industry passed by Congress last summer.
The Government, for example, has effectively rescinded an earlier agreement that exempted the institution from having to meet its capital requirements for several more years. The bottom line: the turnaround that the group hoped to accomplish over a 10-year period following its acquisition of Honfed in 1986 now must be completed in about half that time.
Meanwhile, Honfed's core earnings - those derived from the basic business of taking deposits and making home loans - remain weak.
Honfed was the first acquisition in Mr. Simon's plan to build a network of savings institutions, banks and other investment ventures around his grand if somewhat hazy notion of the Pacific Rim as the next great economic opportunity.
Along with outside investors, Mr. Simon's group is developing $800 million of commercial, residential and industrial property around the country. It has also set up small ''junk bond'' and venture capital funds and considered a host of corporate acquisitions outside banking.
 
Other Properties
 The group also owns a second small commercial bank, World Trade Bank of Los Angeles, in addition to First Interstate of Hawaii, which in the deal announced last week will be sold to the parent of the First Hawaiian Bank for at least $119 million.
And it owns two savings and loan companies besides Honfed. Two years ago it acquired Western Federal Savings and Loan, a healthy institution based in Los Angeles. At the same time, it accepted Government assistance to acquire Bell Savings, an insolvent institution in California, and then merged Bell into Western Federal. The group also acquired Southern California Savings and Loan, another formerly insolvent institution that is slowly returning to health.
The 62-year-old Mr. Simon, who has always prided himself on staying ahead of the investment pack, was one of the first to view insolvent savings institutions, acquired with some form of direct or indirect Government aid, as an appealing investment.
Mr. Simon got out of the leveraged buyout game in 1985 when he became convinced that the market was overheated and that the deals being offered to him no longer made economic sense. Spurred by friends and business contacts throughout Asia and Australia, he decided to develop a pipeline for Pacific Rim capital to flow into a variety of investments.
Working with Gerald L. Parsky, a Los Angeles lawyer who had been a top aide throughout Mr. Simon's years in Washington, he concluded that there were considerable values to be found in real estate and financial institutions. With Mr. Parsky as an equal partner, Mr. Simon formed WSGP International, an investment vehicle for them and a few close associates.
Mr. Simon plays the role of master strategist, puts up his own money for deals and opens doors to outside investors. Mr. Parsky is in charge of day-to-day operations and is the team's primary dealmaker and negotiator. To provide added clout and experience in the savings and loan business, the group brought in Preston Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and one-time chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, then the primary regulator of the savings industry.
When the group bought Honfed, called Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan at the time, they got an institution that had hit on hard times in the mid-1980's because of troubled real estate investments and loans.
As part of its acquisition deal with Mr. Simon's group, the Government agreed to write down the value of Honfed's real estate holdings by $107 million, effectively insuring that the new owners would not have to suffer losses when they eventually sold the real estate. In fact, the concession gave the investors a good chance of profiting if the market came back.
In addition, the Government agreed that Honfed could operate for 10 years without meeting the requirements for capital strength in effect at the time as long as it met certain other thresholds for stability. (That agreement, however, is no longer being honored by regulators.) In return, Mr. Simon's group injected $17.7 million of its own money as new capital and arranged for a $40 million junk bond offering to bolster the institution's capital even further.
Mr. Simon and Mr. Parsky believed that members of their group could offer expertise to the institution as well as capital. For example, Larry B. Thrall, a longtime real estate developer, was put in charge of selling Honfed's property, disposing of most of the holdings at significant profits.
To a certain degree, the Simon group's efforts have paid off. Honfed has posted profits each year since the acquisition - $15.5 million in 1987, $9.5 million in 1988 and $4.2 million through nine months of last year. But nearly all of the profits so far have come from real estate sales rather than sustainable core earnings.
The company's efforts so far to remedy that shortcoming have moved slowly. Honfed is making more mortgage loans, and has grown in size from $2.1 billion in assets at the end of 1987 to $3.1 billion last year. But because of the negative publicity surrounding the savings industry in general and the lingering questions among customers about Honfed's health in particular, the institution has had trouble attracting and keeping low-cost retail deposits. As a result, the company has started offering higher rates to attract ''jumbo'' deposits of $100,000 or more.
Honfed wants to reduce its reliance on expensive deposits by acquiring the 18 Hawaiian branches of First Nationwide Bank, the savings and loan company owned by the Ford Motor Company, for $11 million.
But, in another indication of how the Government's strict new rules have complicated Honfed's plans, Federal regulators will not allow Honfed to go ahead with the First Nationwide deal until it brings itself into compliance with the new capital requirements. As of Sept. 30, the most recent date for which figures are available, Honfed needed $73 million in new capital to reach the requirement for the most basic level of capital, known as tangible capital.
 
Question of Trust
 The public offering of preferred stock, should it succeed, would take care of the capital shortfall. Honfed is seeking to raise at least $90 million.
Whether the offering flies with investors will depend partly on the interest rate offered on the preferred stock, which has not yet been set. But it will also depend to a large extent on whether investors trust that Mr. Simon and his team can manage the risks of running even a well-capitalized savings institution.
Mr. Simon has some persuasive arguments in his favor. A recent appraisal of Honfed's real estate valued it at $68 million more than the value on the institution's books, suggesting that significant profits can still be reaped from property sales. Moreover, Honfed has actually received offers on two pieces of property for prices that would yield gains $30 million higher than the appraisals. If things go just right on the real estate deals, Honfed could conceivably even drop the public offering and raise a smaller pool of money from private investors who have backed some of the group's past deals.
Perhaps more important for investors, there are signs that Honfed, if it can be recapitalized and made consistently profitable, would become a logical takeover candidate, raising the possibility of big profits from any sale.
 
Period of Consolidation
 Indeed, the financial services industry in Hawaii is going through a period of consolidation. The proposed sale of Mr. Simon's First Interstate Bank to the First Hawaii Bank is not the only evidence of that. The state's largest bank, the Bank of Hawaii, agreed recently to acquire the state's second-largest savings institution, First Federal Savings, for a sizable premium over its book value.
Mr. Simon's other savings institutions, meanwhile, are in somewhat better shape. Western Federal is profitable, and while slightly undercapitalized, should soon be able to meet the Government's requirements. Southern California Savings needs $30 million in additional capital. But the institution is steadily becoming more profitable.
For his part, Mr. Simon keeps spreading the word that savings and loans are not the sinkhole that the conventional wisdom holds them to be, and he has gained some converts. His group has already persuaded one pension fund, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, to commit $150 million to a fund that will make acquisitions of small, healthy institutions.
''Core earnings have to be raised in several of our institutions, but basically they're fine,'' Mr. Simon said. ''As of right now I'm pleased with everything we own and I'm confident that significant profits will be made from owning them.''
 
 
MR. SIMON'S EQUAL PARTNER
The headlines say Bill Simon. But Mr. Simon has always worked closely with others who deserve at least equal credit for his successes. And in his current endeavor, his primary partner is Gerald L. Parsky, a longtime friend and associate who is largely responsible for running the operation.
Mr. Parsky is an equal partner with Mr. Simon in WSGP International, the merchant bank that serves as the parent company for all of their ventures. An energetic, affable 47-year-old whom Mr. Simon describes as his best friend, Mr. Parsky oversees their farflung investments from WSGP's headquarters in Los Angeles while Mr. Simon works primarily in New Jersey, where he lives.
''He and I have a complete understanding of each other,'' Mr. Parsky said. ''That's the reason he can be on his boat or on safari in Africa and know that things are being taken care of.''
Mr. Parsky graduated from Princeton University and the University of Virginia Law School. He went to the Treasury Department in 1971. By 1974, at the age of 30, Mr. Parsky found himself serving Mr. Simon, who was then the Treasury Secretary, as an Assistant Secretary, the youngest person ever to hold that post.
When the Ford Administration ended, Mr. Parsky considered going into business with Mr. Simon, but decided that he wanted to make a mark for himself on his own. So he joined the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where by the mid-1980's he had risen to senior partner.
In 1985, when Mr. Simon again proposed going into business together, Mr. Parsky agreed. Today, he somehow manages to juggle his responsibilities at the law firm with running WSGP.
''Bill has a wonderful ability to sense markets and opportunities,'' Mr. Parsky said. ''But he would be the first to admit that there are times when he is impatient getting from point A to point B. I'm a little more patient.''
 

SAFARIS AND SAILING
At age 62, Bill Simon says he still feels young, and he is certainly enjoying life. He recently returned from a safari in Africa, he spends considerable time sailing his yacht and he combines his frenetic business life with a welter of charitable and social obligations.
He gives his time and money to such diverse organizations as the University of Rochester, which renamed its business school after him several years ago in return for a large contribution, and Covenant House, the shelter for runaway children in New York that is enduring an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by its founder.
While he never shirks the limelight, he has always been mystified by the attention and criticism his business activities and his volatile personality have drawn. He says he has never believed in the legend of his own investment prowess, preferring to think of himself as a canny businessman blessed with smart partners.
''It's as if making money had become pejorative,'' he once said. ''Big is bad and all that. But I am what I am and I'm not ashamed of it.''
 
 
SIMON'S BUDDING EMPIRE
 
WSGP INTERNATIONAL
 
 Merchant bank founded by William E. Simon and Gerald l. Parsky is the parent company for all their ventures. Some are listed below.
 
 HONFED BANK
 
Hawaii's largest saviings and loan institution, acquired by the group in 1986 for $17.7 million plus the issuance of $40 million in junk bonds. With $3.1 billion in assets, Honfed is profitable but does not meet Government requirements for financial strength.
 
 FIRST INTERSTATE BANK OF HAWAII
 
Fourth-largest commercial bank in Hawiaa, Mr. Simon's investment group agreed last week to sell the bank to First Hawaiian Bank for at least $119 million, doubling its investment in less than a year.
 
REAL ESTATE GROUP
 
Developing $800 million worth of commericial, industrial and residential properties.
 
JUNK BOND FUND
 
Managing $250 million from institutional investors. Also has small venture capital fund.
 
WESTERN FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN
 
A healthy California savings and loan, it was acquired by the group in 1988 for $145 million. At the same time, the group acquried an insolvent institution, Bell Savings and Loan of San Mateo, Calif., with $565 million in Government aid, and merged Bell into Western Federal. The combined institutions, with $4.5 billion in assets, are slightly below the Government's new capital standards, but should be able to meet them soon by retaining earnings.
 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAVINGS AND LOAN
 
Insolvent institution acquired by the group in 1987 for $40 million in new capital plus $217 million in cash assistance from the Government. Needs an additional $30 million to meet new capital standards, but appears to be on the verge of posting consistent core earnings.

HEADLINE: Why Foreign Presence at Treasury Auctions Is Overrated

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Four times a year, the Treasury Department sells billions of dollars in notes and bonds to raise money to finance the budget deficit. Before each auction, the cry goes out that the securities could be hard to sell because the Japanese may be reluctant buyers, either because they are annoyed with Americans or are attracted to better investments elsewhere. And four times a year, the handwringing turns out to be unwarranted.
That was very evident last week at the Treasury Department's auction of $30 billion in long-term securities. The four major Japanese brokerage houses - Daiwa, Nomura, Yamaichi and Nikko - offered to buy their usual 30 percent and, just in case they faltered, cash-rich American investors turned out in strength as eager buyers. The Treasury's auctions, in fact, often run counter to the prevailing view that Americans have wastefully spent more money than they possess and therefore must rely on foreigners to help cover the shortfall. The budget deficit has become the symbol of that shortfall. 
Despite the handwringing over the Japanese, many economists say foreigners have no choice but to participate in the Treasury auctions. If they did not, they would end up hurting themselves more than the United States. And even if foreign lenders - and in particular the Japanese, who are the biggest outside buyers of Treasury securities - didn't show up, Americans have enough idle cash in their bank accounts to have purchased all $30 billion in 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities auctioned last week. The only question, just before the auction, was how high interest rates might have to go to get Americans to do all the buying, without Japanese help. The answer from many experts was that the pre-auction rates of 8.5 percent or so on 10-year notes and 30-year bonds were high enough. Indeed, the American interest made the bidding at last week unusually heavy, experts say. Between $1.80 and $3 was offered for each dollar of securities auctioned.
Such strong interest in buying Treasury securities reflected the fact that Americans are flush with lending power, in large part because a weak economy has reduced demand for loans to finance commercial investment. Data assembled by Salomon Brothers and by Henry Kaufman, an economic consultant, show that business borrowing - corporate bonds, high-risk ''junk bonds,'' bank loans and commercial paper sales - have fallen to $9 billion in January, from $20 billion a month on average in 1989. Consumer borrowing is also softening.
''The demand for credit in the United States is clearly slowing,'' Mr. Kaufman said. Still, even if Americans did not have the wherewithal to finance their own spending, the Japanese - and the Europeans, for that matter - would have found themselves constrained to purchase Treasuries. They have accumulated billions of surplus dollars from the sale of their exports to Americans.
Their only alternative to investing the surplus money within the United States is to convert it into Japanese yen or West German marks. But that would drive down the value of the dollar and, in turn, the value of their growing American assets.
Suddenly, a German-owned company such as Hoechst Celanese would be forced to reduce the value in marks of its textile fiber factories in the American South. And Rockefeller Center, purchased by Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Company, would be worth fewer yen. The landmark was recently acquired for $840 million, or 119 billion yen, when the dollar was worth about 142 yen, but would be worth only 100.8 billion yen if the dollar fell to, say, 120 yen.
''To say that the rest of the world may stop lending to us is to misdescribe that situation,'' Francis M. Bator, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, wrote recently in Foreign Affairs. ''Literally, it cannot. As long as it sells to us more than it buys from us, it is stuck with lending back to us the excess dollars.''
So why all the fuss by Wall Street analysts and the media over Japanese intentions? Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate in economics, says they are simply perpetuating a myth. David R. Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond brokerage house, says the reasons are mostly psychological and political. ''I guess in some sense there is this perception that this Japanese money can't stay here forever, and the next auction is the one where we are going to lose it,'' he said. ''It is a real fear.''
That concern was greater than usual before last week's three-day auction, which concluded on Thursday. Interest rates on Japanese and West German bonds, which compete for the same pool of capital as American securities, have risen sharply. While the 10-year United States Treasury note, for example, now yields 8.3 percent, the similar German security has risen more than one percentage point since Christmas, to 7.9 percent. The Japanese 10-year bond is up a similar amount, to 6.3 percent.
Such sharp increases raised concern that the worldwide pool of savings - European, Japanese and American - might be drawn away from this country. That prospect helped push up the interest rates on United States Treasury securities. The 10-year Treasury note, for example, rose from less than 8 percent at Christmas. ''A big factor in this sharp rise was fear that the Japanese would not participate in the Treasury auction,'' said Sam Nakagama, of Nakagama & Wallace, a Wall Street investment firm.
But other factors besides comparative interest rates affect investment decisions. A major one is whether inflation will eat away at interest payments. Wall Street's views change constantly, but some current thinking maintains that inflation may be peaking in America while it rises in Germany and in Japan, making United States securities even more attractive.
If that weren't enough to ease the fears over Japanese intentions, the mechanics of the auction itself should have been. Neither the Japanese nor the American brokerage houses bidding at these auctions retain much of what they buy. Seeking quick profits, they resell most of their new holdings as fast as possible to all comers, regardless of nationality. Daiwa Securities America Inc., for example, purchased $900 million worth of 10-year notes on Wednesday and quickly resold between $300 million and $400 million of them to Americans, according to William Brachfeld, Daiwa's executive vice president.
The goal of this trading is not to preserve for Japanese investors the 30 percent share of the Treasury securities purchased by the four Japanese trading houses, but to resell, say, a $100 bond purchased at a discount of perhaps $99, for $99.12 or $99.24. Strong demand last week made such profits possible.
Because of this trading, it is difficult to assess the participation of the Japanese or any other investors. For instance, Salomon Brothers, a major American bidder at the Treasury auction, resells securities to the Japanese. And those Treasury securities that are resold to Japanese back home often end up in the hands of Tokyo bond dealers who resell them internationally, said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa.
''I think there is a lot of malarkey out there about what is going on and what is not going on,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities Inc. ''At any one moment, we simply never know how much of the securities we acquire are in Japanese hands or in foreign hands.''
Notwithstanding all the shuffling, some foreigners do end up holding Treasury securities over the long term. Mr. Brachfeld estimates that about $1.2 billion of the $10 billion in 10-year notes auctioned Wednesday will find a home with a Japanese household or corporation. (The 10-year note is the most popular Treasury issue among Japanese.) That pattern roughly mirrors the percent of all United States Treasury securities held by foreigners, which has remained almost unchanged through the 1980's despite the concern over foreign participation in the quarterly auctions. Of the $3.47 trillion in outstanding Government securities at the end of last year's third quarter, foreigners held $384.6 billion, or 11.1 percent, the Federal Reserve reports. That is up only slightly from 10 percent in 1983. The British were the big foreign investors at Treasury auctions in the early 1980's, but the Japanese have been since 1985.
Rather than worry about whether the Japanese, the British, the Germans or any other foreign buyers will continue to purchase Treasury securities, helping to finance the budget deficit, the real issue is actually whether the United States is becoming too dependent on foreign holdings of all its financial assets - stocks, corporate bonds, Government securities, corporate commercial paper, some bank deposits and the like.
The nation's pool of these assets totaled $9.7 trillion as of last September, with foreign holdings accounting for $748.1 billion, or 7.7 percent. That is almost double the 4.3 percent in 1983, but still a small enough sum to disappear without much notice if these foreign holdings were liquidated slowly, over a period of several years, said Russell Scholl, a Commerce Department economist.
''If foreigners tried to pull out their money quickly, they would have no trouble creating a disaster,'' Mr. Scholl said. ''The motive might be to hurt the United States, but the Japanese and the Europeans would end up also shooting themselves in the foot.''
 
 
GAUGING THE EFFECT OF A JAPANESE 'STRIKE'
 
Once, in 1987, the Japanese almost did pull out of American Treasury securities. The Reagan and Nakasone Administrations were feuding over Fujitsu Ltd.'s attempt to purchase the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, and the American Government had accused Japan of dumping computer chips in the United States at unfairly low prices.
The reaction came in the spring, when many private Japanese investors halted new purchases of Treasury notes and bonds, funneling money instead into Japan.
But the Japanese Government stepped in at the auctions. The Bank of Japan purchased dollars from its reluctant citizens and invested them in Treasury securities, almost offsetting the shortfall created by the private sector, which stayed mostly on the sidelines until fall. As a result, foreign holdings of all Treasuries fell to 9.7 percent in 1987, the lowest level of the past seven years, but still only slightly below the annual average of 10.1 percent for that period.
Nicholas Sargen, vice president for bond research at Salomon Brothers, believes the ''strike'' added perhaps one percentage point to long-term rates; others say perhaps 2 percentage points. But a couple of factors complicated the measuring process. While private Japanese investors prefer long-term securities, the Bank of Japan purchased mostly short-term Treasury bills, which should have dampened short-term rates.
But a counterforce was at work: the Federal Reserve, led by Paul Volcker, was raising American interest rates to curb inflation - and both short- and long-term rates responded to the Fed's efforts.
Whatever the pressures, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.81 percent in late March of 1987, from 7.45 percent early in the month, and then rose steadily to a 10.2 percent on Oct. 16, the eve of the stock market crash. ''The 1987 experience would certainly say that there could be upward pressure on interest rates if the Japanese pulled back,'' said David R. Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston, a bond brokerage house. ''But the magnitudes are hard to pin down.''

The Camden Zero-Coupon Quandary

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Underwriters and lawyers agree that the Camden County Municipal Utility Authority bond issue now being marketed to investors across the country is one of the most unusual refinancing deals the tax-exempt market has seen in years.
But they agree on little else about the New Jersey county's offering, which is being sold at a time when the interest-rate climate has made refinancing issues of any sort relatively rare . Is the Camden issue, as its defenders say, an ingenious innovation that can help hard-pressed communities ease their debt-service costs? Or is it, as some critics charge, a deal that creeps so close to the edge of Federal tax rules that it will bring a backlash of new regulations from Washington?
The legal debate comes down to this: How much interest income is the Camden authority permitted to earn on the revenues that it will free up as a result of having refinanced its pre-existing debt? 
Just as homeowners may take advantage of lower interest rates to refinance their mortgages and cut their monthly payments, the authority is trying to reduce its debt service costs by selling $115.8 million in new bonds, called the 1990A Series, and setting the money aside to pay debt service on older, more expensive bonds sold in 1987. (In addition, it has raised $121.7 million in 1990B Series bonds to replace some short-term notes, a straightforward transaction of little interest to bond lawyers.) There is no dispute over how much interest the authority can earn on the money it is setting aside to service its earlier debt. Washington has stringent rules to prevent municipalities from reaping arbitrage profits by raising money at low tax-exempt rates and investing it at higher rates. Under these anti-arbitrage rules, an agency that sells 7 percent municipal bonds today cannot earn more than 7 percent interest on those escrowed funds. Doing otherwise could endanger the bonds' tax-exempt status.
But in the Camden issue, designed by investment bankers at Butcher & Singer in Philadelphia and First Fidelity Bank in Newark the authority has sold zero-coupon bonds that require no debt service at all until 1998. (Zero-coupon bonds pay no annual interest, but are sold at prices substantially below their face value, so that the investor profits from the difference between the purchase price and the final maturity value.) As required, the authority will invest the 1990A Series proceeds in an escrow account - let's call it Account A - with a yield matching that on the newly sold bonds. It will use that fund to pay the debt service on the old 1987 bonds for the next seven years.
But - and this is the ''but'' that worries some lawyers - the authority also plans to deposit all the general sewer-system revenues it otherwise would have spent to pay debt service on the 1987 bonds into a new investment fund - call it Account B. And the money in Account B is invested at a yield higher than that on the 1990A bonds.
Come 1997, the first date on which the old 1987 bonds can be redeemed, the authority has the option of using Account B to pay off those bonds or to build part of its still-incomplete sewer system. Is the arrangement a good one? George Tuttle, the First Fidelity investment banker who worked with Butcher & Singer on the deal, defends it as ''an efficient structure that saves the authority $9 million. The way you handle the tax issues is to make sure you have the highest quality legal advice, and that's what we did.''
But the normally polite bond counsel community, the lawyers who review municipal bonds to insure that they qualify as tax-exempt investments, is deeply divided on the question. ''We have put in enough controls to satisfy us and, I think, to satisfy others,'' said Matthew Lewin, a partner at Chapman & Cutler, in Chicago, which has reviewed and approved the Camden structure. ''But, yes, there are a significant number who would not share our opinion.''
Underwriters at a few large Wall Street firms report privately that their own bond lawyers have doubts about the approach, , which Mr. Lewin attributed to their unfamiliarity with the specifics of the deal.
The complex refinancing approach and the exclusive reliance on zero-coupon bonds make the Camden issue ''the kind of deal that investment bankers will put into their files for future reference,'' said Kurt van Kuller, a managing director of Lebenthal & Company in New York. But his own impressions? ''Well, frankly,'' he said, ''it seems very squirrely to me.''
In his view, the authority's Account B bears a strong resemblance to invested sinking funds, a once-popular bond financing technique that fell into disuse when the Federal rules against excess arbitrage were strengthened in 1978.
''The lawyer says that this does not have the 'excess arbitrage' features of invested sinking funds,'' said Mr. van Kuller. ''But if I were a large institutional investor, I'd have a legal staff on retainer working with me to check into these issues. . . . and that's expensive.''
But the real cost of this financial innovation goes far beyond legal fees, warned Sam Katz, the co-chief executive at Public Financial Management in Philadelphia, a large public finance advisory firm. ''We're entering a period when the Congress and the Internal Revenue Service seem inclined to correct some of the public finance problems caused by their past overzealousness,'' Mr. Katz said. ''When people push the envelope to the very limit, it portrays our industry as one that is unprepared to live within the rules.'' And that, he said, ultimately could saddle all public borrowers with new rules that would make it more cumbersome and expensive for everyone to finance essential public projects.
Despite these worries, the Camden deal has come to market at a time when zero-coupon bonds are both extremely scarce and increasingly popular among people planning for retirement, say, or college tuition bills.
But Mr. van Kuller said he would not be surprised if, given the questions surrounding the structure, the price on the bonds dropped a bit to produce a higher yield for buyers. ''The market doesn't always solve these problems,'' he said. ''But it always adjusts to them.''
 
DESPITE CORPORATE PROGRESS, A STOCK STILL SLEEPS
 
The stock market, jittery about the ''junk bond'' market and all the companies that borrow there, paid little attention last week when the Kroger Company announced that it had ended 1989 with less debt and lower interest rates. Kroger's stock closed the week up just a few cents, at $13.50.
At that price, the stock looks like a bargain to some analysts. Charles E. Cerankosky of Prescott Ball & Turben in Cleveland notes that the company's improved financial prospects are already reflected in the prices of its junk bonds. ''Obviously the bond market sees an excellent investment here,'' he said.
Edward Comeau, a food industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said the stock's problem is probably rooted in the market's current intolerance for debt. Given that mood, and tighter food industry margins this year, he is not recommending the shares right now. But, he said, patient investors could find that the shares have ''good upside potential.''

The Rush Toward a Single Mark
 
East and West Germany are hurtling toward monetary union. Not even the opposition of West Germany's central Bundesbank or East Germany's elections March 18 appear likely to block a speedy agreement. On Tuesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany called for immediate talks; the very next day, his Cabinet set up a unity committee. Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, said the rush to a single currency would wound the West German economy without substantially aiding East Germany. The central bank usually has final say on monetary matters. But East Germany's economic decline has been so rapid, with such a vast exodus to the West, said Norbert Walter, senior economist for Deutsche Bank A.G., that ''this time, the bank will lose.
 
*
 
Setting the exchange rate would be the most crucial decision for East and West German officials if they try to unify the currencies. The official rate is one to one, the unofficial rate is six West German marks to one East German mark. Valuing the West German mark too high would destroy the worth of East German savings. But over-pricing the East German mark would keep the country's wages and goods from being competitive. East German unemployment and emigration would continue, and a lack of investment from the West would result. 
 
 
The Communist Fairy Tale
 
Soviet Communist Party leaders agreed on Wednesday to surrender their monopoly of power and acknowledged that the nation and its economy had been grievously mismanaged. The Communists had constantly invoked Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to justify their rule. But Marx and Engels themselves wrote that Russia was one of the last places where they expected a revolution to lead straight to successful socialism. They did root for revolutionaries everywhere, and predicted a peasant revolt in Russia. But Engels in particular attacked ''the illusion that it will be possible to guide this revolution into a smooth, constitutional channel.'' When Pyotr Tkachov, a Russian revolutionary, said the Russians were ''the chosen people of socialism,'' Engels ridiculed his claim as a ''fairy tale'' and ''sheer bounce.''
 
 
No Trade Deficit in Tourists
 
The United States has found one import that actually eases the trade deficit: foreign travelers. Last year, for the first time, foreign visitors spent more in the United States than Americans spent abroad. The Commerce Department expects the surplus to grow from $450 million last year to $1.5 billion this year and more in the future. Don Wynegar, the Department's research director for tourism and travel, said the weak dollar and strengthening economies abroad allow more foreigners to vist the United States.
 
 
ressure on Panama
 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega may be out of Panama, but its new Government is resisting United States pressure to tighten banking laws that have made it a drug-profit haven. Many senior Panamanian officials, though never accused of laundering money themselves, have had strong ties to corrupt banks. One-Way Soviet Trade United States trade with the Soviet Union is likely to increase dramatically. But most of the traffic will be one-way, with United States exports rising much more than imports. An Administration official said last week that he expected trade to increase from $2 billion or $3 billion annually to at least $10 billion in about three years. Talks to end American discrimination against Soviet imports begin Monday. But imports are unlikely to rise because Soviet oil and platinum already come in with normal tariffs. The Soviet Union is likely to increase imports of United States consumer items, food-processing equipnment and medical supplies. Lower trade barriers will bring United States consumers one payoff: $1.25 less for a bottle of vodka.
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
 Relief Over 'High' Inflation
 
Seldom has such a huge jump in the Producer Price Index left the economists so relieved. January's 1.8 percent jump was the largest in 15 years. But the core inflation rate, without food and fuel, rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, the best performance since July. A cold December resulted in a record 13.6 percent increase in energy prices, and food rose 2.1 percent. ''It's clear we have a seasonal problem, and that's likely to subside after a month or two,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. He said the Federal Reserve Board has achieved its goal of lowering wholesale inflation and might ease credit during the second quarter.
 
 
$30 Billion Success Story
 
The success of the Treasury Department's quarterly auctions last week aroused investors to bid up prices for Government securities on Friday. Yields had risen in anticipation that investors would be reluctant to bid during the three-day, $30 billion sales. On Friday, investors rushed to lock in yields, driving the rate on the 8.5 percent 30-year bond auctioned the day before to 8.33 percent.
 
 
Bailing Out of the Bailout
 
The head of the agency overseeing the savings and loan bailout resigned Friday. Daniel P. Kearney said he was leaving as president of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Company because he had not won enough authority to carry out his duties. His departure raised doubts about the progress of the Bush plan to clean up the industry.

Notre Dame's football team aims to score as much off the field as on come 1991. The university said Monday it had cut a five-year deal for NBC to broadcast all its home games for at least $1 million each. Now, several other schools say they also might seek their fortunes by breaking with the College Football Association, which recently signed a $210 million, five-year contract with ABC.

Fourth-quarter operating income, reported last week, was up only 1.4 percent to $817.7 million. Net income rose more than fivefold to $602.1 million, primarily because Sears had taken a $712.4 million charge in the fourth quarter of 1988 for the new pricing policy.

To Sea World visitors, Shamu looks like a killer whale. To Anheuser-Busch accountants, she looks like a depreciable asset. Busch acquired about 15 whales when it bought five Sea World aquarium parks from Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch Inc. last year. Harcourt's accountants considered Shamu and her companions long-lived if not immortal; they were was going to stay on Harcourt's books at the same value year after year. The Busch accountants, however, figured out a whale's lifespan, and as the years dwindle, so will a killer's value.

HEADLINE: All About/The Tire Industry;
Decreasing Demand and Global Competition Propel Consolidation

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio

 BODY:
A decade ago, a dozen major tire manufacturers, half of them American, vied for world leadership. Today, just six giant companies, one in the process of formation, are dominant. The only one based in America is the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.
Consolidation has come about because of slackening demand and global competition. With long-lasting radials accounting for 93 percent of new tires, motorists buy fewer replacements. Weak demand has forced companies to invade one another's territories. And as the auto industry becomes more global, auto makers favor huge tire companies that can fill their needs anywhere. 
In the last five years, foreign companies have bought out most of the best-known American labels, including Firestone and Armstrong. The agreement five months ago by Groupe Michelin of France to buy the Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company will create the world's largest tire maker - if, as expected, American antitrust regulators approve. In the United States, aside from Goodyear, only the smaller Cooper Tire Company remains independent.
Goodyear, the leader for decades, is contending for second place with the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, which two years ago bought Firestone. Next come West German Continental A.G., which bought General Tire; Pirelli S.p.A. of Italy (Armstrong), and the Sumitomo Tire and Rubber Company of Japan (Dunlop). Two smaller Japanese makers, the Yokohama Rubber Company and the Toyo Tire and Rubber Company, are both concentrated in the Far East.
Consolidation has intensified competition to cut production costs and increase quality. The industry has become surprisingly high-tech, spending more than $1 billion on research and development last year, up by one-third from five years ago.

 
The Research
 
Now It's Microchips Instead of Road Tests
At Goodyear's vast research and development center in Akron, the rubber meets the microchip before it meets the road. Rows of technicians at computer work stations design tires. They test them with programs that seem like video games. On screen, cars whip through courses with potholes, ice slicks and hairpin turns. A decade ago, designing a tire for a new automobile model required testing 200 to 300 tires. Today, it takes about 65. ''In the last few years, tire designing has moved from an empirical art to a science, because of the computer,'' said F. Vincent Prus, Goodyear's executive vice president for research and development.
The major tire companies are spending freely on research and development. They are buying computers to test tire durability, traction, fuel efficiency, compatibility with new car designs and even noise. Analysts consider Goodyear the research leader. The company spent $300 million on research and development last year, or 3.5 percent of revenues - up from 2.5 percent five years ago.
Companies are also using research to cut costs, especially for original equipment, the tires that auto makers buy for new cars. Although original equipment sales account for just a quarter of production, nearly 70 percent of consumers replace their tires with the brand that came with the car. Since auto companies want a distinctive tire design for each new model, tire makers are striving to develop lines more quickly. Goodyear says computer-aided design helped cut development time from 117 weeks in 1980 to 65 weeks last year. The goal: 20 to 25 weeks by 1995.
 
 
The Chemistry
 
Exotic Synthetics Mean More Mileage
 Tire company executives say the public believes their jobs are no more complicated than pouring molten rubber into molds. ''Outside of the industry, I don't think anyone really understands how much effort goes into making a tire,'' said Frederic J. Kovac, Goodyear's vice president for technology. Tires are actually built, not molded, from a combination of natural and synthetic rubber wrapped around polyester and steel.
Rubber chemistry has become much more complex since the day 151 years ago when Charles Goodyear invented strong, vulcanized rubber by accidentally dropping sulfur and crude rubber onto his stove. Tire company chemists now stir up exotic synthetic rubbers to improve traction on wet streets without sacrificing fuel efficiency.
Steel belts - actually steel and polyester woven into a tough fabric - have been improved as well. The average radial tire lasts 50,000 miles; the average bias tire of 20 years ago lasted 18,000 to 20,000 miles. James A. Thiese, director of passenger and light truck tire development for Firestone, credits the work of the chemists: ''That's what now allows a tire to perform with the same efficiency in 20 degree-below-zero weather as it does in 95-degree heat.''
 
 
The Auction Block
 
Pirelli Looks Like The Next Takeover
 As huge as the world's six major tire makers may be - each with billions in sales - further consolidation could be coming. ''I fully expect that there will be what we call marriages of the elephants in the industry,'' said Wilhelm Borgmann, vice chairman of Continental. The companies face increasing pressure to raise research spending and spread their factories and sales forces across several continents.
Analysts say the most vulnerable major company might be Pirelli, one of the best-known names in Italian industry. Despite its purchase of Armstrong, Pirelli, with revenues of $3.3 billion last year, is only a third the size of Michelin. Pirelli has no significantpresence in Japan and ranks no better than second in any European country except Italy.
Acquiring Pirelli would would require the blessings of both the Pirelli family, which holds a 5.3 percent stake, and the leading Italian industrialists who control 57 percent. But matchmakers abound.
''A Goodyear-Pirelli merger would make sense in many ways, especially from Pirelli's viewpoint,'' said Dennis M. Byrne, a professor of economics at the University of Akron.
Harry W. Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Company in Cleveland, matches Pirelli, which is strongest in southern Europe, and Continental, stronger in the north. And he plans to maintain his merger watch. ''It's not certain who will acquire whom, but it's pretty clear that the consolidation is not over yet,'' Mr. Millis said.
 
 
RUNNING DESPITE A FLAT
For years, the ''run-flat'' tire promised to be one of the industry's greatest innovations: a tire that could run firmly on its rim after the air had leaked out. But by the time Continental A.G. of West Germany announced last year that it had developed the first one, the industry yawned. Analysts explain that consumers are less concerned about driving on flat tires since improved steel reinforcement has made flats less likely. Auto makers - who once wanted to cut weight and increase fuel mileage by eliminating the spare - appear less conservation-minded. ''No one among the auto companies seems to be all that concerned about sqeezing out a little bit more weight right now, at least in that form,'' said Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald & Company.
The Continental run-flat tire can ride 200 miles after losing air. The tires are mounted on rims that have broad steel wheels sitting inside the rubber. A set of run-flats is slightly heavier than normal tires, but lighter than four tires and a spare.
No other tire maker is about to market run-flats. But Continental expects strong demand, starting with the makers of luxury cars. ''We're working with original equipment manufacturers to get the project going,'' said Wilhelm Borgmann, the company's vice chairman, pausing for effect. ''Mercedes will be first.''

Cool Judgment, Hot Results

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Ken Oberman, manager of Oppenheimer & Company's Global Fund, keeps several cartoons taped near the computer in his crowded New York City office. One depicts the late Andrei Sakharhov as a diminutive figure on one end of a seesaw upending a massive stone monument of Stalin. Another shows Lech Walesa and asks: How many Poles does it take to change the world? (Answer: One.) But the shifting international scene provides more than just wry humor for the 59-year-old Mr. Oberman. The lessons he draws from it have paid off handsomely over the years.
His growth-oriented fund was last year's big winner among global funds. It was up 35 percent, against a 17 percent gain in Morgan Stanley's Capital International World Index, which measures equity performance of companies in Europe, the Far East, Australia and New Zealand. Over five years, it beat the index, too, and in the last 10 years, ''Oppenheimer Global has been the No. 1 global fund,'' in performance, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. In that period, Mr. Oberman matched the Morgan Stanley index and beat all equity growth and global funds. 
''Most money managers don't beat the market averages most of the time,'' said Spero L. Kripotos, vice chairman of CDA Investment Technologies Inc., a financial services firm in Rockville, Md. Added Mr. Lipper Mr. Oberman ''is one of the most thoughtful managers in the mutual fund business.''
A former student of economic history, Mr. Oberman is a self-proclaimed ''oddball'' among international money managers. He reads Abraham Lincoln, not ''Liar's Poker.'' He doesn't travel much for business, nor does he try to go after the hottest international markets or the trendiest stocks.
''Making the first money is easy,'' said Mr. Oberman, who has been picking stocks or managing money for the last 27 years and managing Oppenheimer Global since the early 1980's. ''The real question is picking companies with long-term potential. That takes time.'' ''There aren't any secrets,'' he added. But there are strategies. He seeks out undervalued issues around the world, and then tries to double or triple his money over three to five years. To limit the differences in accounting and tax policies among nations, he evaluates stocks by looking at cash flow from current operations after accounting for taxes.
Most international money managers look at the world on a country-by-country basis, and now, of course, they are hot on Eastern Europe. But Mr. Oberman hasn't bought a ticket to Budapest. He invested in West Germany long before the Berlin Wall crumbled. And with one-third of his portfolio in Scandinavian stocks, his fund, in jest, has been called the ''Fjord Fund.'' His theory: There is little payoff in chasing new markets. ''Change is constant,'' he says.
Rather, he looks for stocks that fit what he calls his ''themes.'' While those themes keep shifting to account for new developments, some - like health care - have been on his list since the early 1960's. His favorite stocks, of course, overlap categories.
Besides health care, the themes that he thinks will yield superior growth in this decade are energy, Europe 1992, perestroika, specialized communications, capital goods and the environment. ''It's easy to talk about technologies but that can be changed overnight,'' he says. ''But the question of ecology is a question we'll be dealing with until we kill or save ourselves.''
He has one more category, called ''hobgoblin,'' from the Ralph Waldo Emerson line that reads, ''A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.'' The hobgoblin sector enables Mr. Oberman to maneuver in case he sees a company he likes that doesn't fit into one of his themes.
His current hobgoblin holding is Bombardier Inc., the Canadian transportation company. He says he likes it because it is diversified within the transportation industry and because its two aircraft manufacturing companies are performing well.
What was his biggest triumph? Buying into D.D.L., the Danish holding company that owns more than a quarter of the Scandinavian Airline System. In 1982, Mr. Oberman read the earnings forecast of S.A.S.'s president and realized that D.D.L.'s stock was selling at one-half of projected earnings instead of what he thought should have been five times earnings. He sold the stock six years later at 22 times his investment. And that, he said, was also his biggest mistake: D.D.L.'s price has almost tripled since then.
The fund's largest holding is a Swiss company, Brown Boveri, which joined forces with ASEA, of Sweden, to become the world's largest electric equipment manufacturer. The company touches on four Oberman themes: capital goods; Europe 1992 (it builds locomotives for European railways), energy (it produces hydroelectric systems) and perestroika (it owns a majority stake in a big Polish electrical equipment company).
Looking forward, he believes the hottest market of the 1990's will be West Germany, where he likes Mannesmann, a tool and heavy-equipment company; M.A.N., a truck maker, and Schiess, a machine tool company.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Funds Should Flex Their Muscle

BYLINE: By JAY W. LORSCH; Jay W. Lorsch, a professor at the Harvard Business School, is co-author of ''Pawns or Potentates: The Reality of America's Corporate Boards.''

 BODY:
Last month, two of the nation's largest pension funds took the unprecedented step of trying to confront the corporate lion in his den. Worried about the long decline in the fortunes of the General Motors Corporation, the heads of the California and New York public employees' pension funds wrote to G.M.'s directors and asked how a successor would be selected when Roger Smith, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, retires this year. These two pension funds, which have major investments in G.M., urged the directors to mount a broad search and asked to be consulted as goals were formulated for the new chairman and chief executive. 
G.M.'s first response to the requests was a polite rebuff. This is not surprising in view of our recent study of outside directors in America's largest public companies, which indicated that the real king of the corporate jungle is the chairman and chief executive - the same person in 83 percent of the companies studied. If the G.M. directors are like their peers on other boards - and I suspect they are - they lack real power, compared with management, to implement major changes. This power imbalance has created an unwritten code of conduct that undermines directors in wielding their influence, which stems in large measure from their numerical superiority. Despite the fact that they outnumber the chairman/chief executive, directors who criticize or openly challenge the ideas of this officer do so at the risk of being expelled from the group, as Ross Perot was at G.M. three years ago. Furthermore, discussing important issues in the absence of the chairman/chief executive is considered bad form, as is any attempt of a director to assume a leadership role. These good manners, however, often lead to bad management, since they hamper directors in assessing the performance of the company and the chairman/chief executive. Unable to unite as a group, outside directors do not challenge management or initiate changes in corporate direction in an effective and timely manner.
Another taboo for directors is open discussion of their objectives. And many of them are confused about the changing laws governing their responsibilities. They feel a conflict between their understanding of their legal obligation to maximize shareholder value and their personal concern for the company's long-term welfare.
The confusion is heightened by the fact that in most companies a majority of shares is owned by institutions. Directors believe that unlike the New York and California pension funds that wrote to G.M., many institutional investors are playing financial games - buying shares one day and selling them the next - with no interest in a company's long-term prospects. This, and the stock market's casino mentality, makes it hard for directors to define shareholder interest.
The status quo must change - and can change - so boards have the power to govern. One action, which has so far been unpalatable to many business leaders, is to separate the positions of chief executive and chairman of the board. Such a step would give boards the independent leadership to act quickly and decisively (especially when the chairman/chief executive is part of the problem), to deal better with sudden crises, and to address festering issues before they become serious. When then-chief executive Ross Johnson attempted a leveraged buyout at RJR Nabisco Inc. in the fall of 1988, for example, the chairman of the company, Charles Hugel, quickly organized the board, which rejected the bid.
A more modest step, and one that the chairman/chief executive might find more palatable, would be for outside directors to elect a ''principal director'' from their group, who would step forward only if the chairman/chief executive were incapacitated or if the directors thought the chairman/chief executive were incapable of providing the necessary leadership.
Responsibility for improved corporate governance also lies with state and Federal policy makers, who need to recognize that further thought and action is needed to provide a constructive framework for the 1990's. Unless markets and laws consistently encourage managers and directors to focus on long-term corporate health, rather than just short-term profits, American companies are doomed to a diminished position in the world economy.
Institutional investors, like the pension funds in California and New York, are correct to be concerned about the fate of America's great companies. The answer, however, is not for them to become directly involved in governance, but to join in creating stronger boards.

The Dollar Slips a Little More

 BODY:
The dollar lost more ground last week as the West German mark rose because of euphoria over the sudden acceleration of negotiations for a common currency for East and West Germany. The current wor ries about higher interest rates and a slumping bond market in West Germany should only weaken the mark temporarily. The Canadian dollar continued to tumble, finishing the week at 83.2 cents against the American dollar, its lowest level since the summer. The Bank of Canada, which set off the decline by signaling a month ago that it would ease interest rates because inflation had come down, stepped in to give the dollar a boost by lifting its key interest rate to 12.79 percent, the highest level since 1984.

How Latin America's Economies Look After a Decade's Decline

 BODY:
AFTER a decade in which average incomes fell while foreign debt and inflation soared, Latin America remains in deep economic crisis. The future of its new democracies may well rest on the ability of civilian leaders to improve living standards in the 1990's as they try to modernize their economies in the face of enormous obstacles.
The crisis, which began in the 1980's when interest rates shot up and prices for export commodities fell, is continuing even though some countries in recent months have managed to earn more from exports and thus improve their trade balances. Forces working against advancement include high inflation, which forces some countries to take steps that limit growth, and high debt burdens, which cut into the amount of money that might be available for new investment. Hopes that the United States would deliver substantial relief from the debt burden through a plan announced last year by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have dimmed. Even though interest payments may be eased and some principal may be reduced, new banking regulations have made it less attractive for international banks to extend new loans.
Here is a look at the economies of some important Latin American countries. 
 
MEXICO
Swapping Debt for Hope
Under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office on Dec. 1, 1988, the country has begun a turnaround from the stagnation and contraction that began in 1981, when Mexico's oil boom collapsed. Last year inflation, which reached 160 percent in 1987, was brought down to just under 20 percent, and for the first time in 10 years the economy expanded more rapidly - at 3 percent -than did the population.
Mexico has also been reducing its foreign debt. From a 1987 high of $107 billion, the total declined by about 10 percent even before a debt reduction agreement was signed on Feb. 4 with the country's commercial bank creditors. Finance Minister Pedro Aspe has estimated that the agreement has cut the debt to $80 billion.
Still, Mr. Salinas faces difficulties in his efforts to modernize the Mexican economy with such measures as trying to sell state-owned airlines, utilities and food companies - steps intended to reduce the national budget deficit and make the enterprises more competitive. One problem is that tariff reductions, also supposed to force domestic producers to become more competitive, have for the moment helped to push up imports instead; this has worsened Mexico's foreign trade balance and eaten into reserves. In addition, a hoped-for boom in foreign investment has not materialized. Some analysts say that if such trends continue, Mexico could be forced back to the negotiating table with its bank creditors.
 
ARGENTINA
Big Promises
Argentina is battling inflation, which totaled nearly 3,700 percent in 1989, while struggling to reorganize an economy marked by low productivity, corruption, a bloated public payroll, the flight of capital, large deficits and endemic tax evasion. President Carlos Saul Menem took office in July having promised an ambitious modernization. But his plans to privatize state companies, reform the tax code and bring order to the financial system carry with them the discipline of a strict austerity that is only beginning. Efforts to keep wages in check are threatened by resistance from labor unions, and efforts to control inflation by swapping short-term savings certificates for long-term bonds have eliminated the public's willingness to lend money to the Government.
In a departure from Argentine tradition, two television channels were sold to private interests. But privatization and deregulation in other areas, such as the selling of an unprofitable telephone company and railroads, will be tougher and slower. Argentina is trying to attract more foreign investors, but without much success. The outlook for the major export, grain, seems good, but the prospects for diversifying exports are mixed. While Argentina has a promising future as a wood, cellulose and paper producer, its chances with other manufactured goods are hampered because most industry is accustomed to producing overpriced second-rate goods for a protected internal market.
The foreign debt of about $65 billion is the third highest in the region; Argentina has paid no interest on the long-term portion for nearly two years and has no immediate prospects of doing so. Instead, it is desperately seeking new loans and credits from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the United States to stabilize the foreign exchange rate.
 
CHILE
Austerity's Payoff
Chile is reaping the benefits of tough austerity and free-market changes imposed in the mid-1970's by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is to cede power in March to an elected President, Patricio Aylwin. Mr. Aylwin will inherit a deficit-free Government and an economy that has had five years of strong growth. Exports are surging as a result of diversification into fruit, fishing and forestry, and of relatively high prices for copper, Chile's most lucrative product.
The foreign debt, which in 1987 approached $21 billion, has been cut to about $17 billion; reserves bought back some of the principal at discount, and interest payments are on schedule. Chile expects to return to voluntary credit markets next year.
There is evidence that the poor and lower middle class have not benefited as much from the growth as the rich. A challenge for Mr. Aylwin will be narrowing that difference without hurting the economy.
 
BRAZIL
Enormous Debt
With Latin America's largest economy, Brazil is beginning the 1990's with elephantine problems - an inflation rate of 1,765 percent for 1989, economic growth that barely keeps up with population growth and a foreign debt of $110 billion, the largest in the third world. The Government stopped paying interest on the debt last July, and, as one result, received only half of expected foreign credit. The United States Export-Import Bank has demoted Brazil to the bank's riskiest loan category.
Fernando Collor de Mello, who takes office on March 15 as Brazil's first popularly elected President since the early 1960's, won on a platform of support for free markets, privatization, foreign investment, antitrust legislation, prison terms for tax cheats and generous debt relief. Business leaders are enthusiastic.
 
VENEZUELA
The Price of Change
Venezuela, Latin America's largest oil exporter after Mexico, is struggling to recover from deep recession; in 1989, the gross domestic product plunged 8 percent. President Carlos Andres Perez largely created the recession with a drive to reshape the state-dominated economy along free-market lines. He has cut subsidies and tariffs, encouraged foreign investment, put state companies up for sale and started talks on debt relief with foreign bankers. One goal is to lure back an estimated $60 billion in capital that has been sent abroad.
The austerity required to carry out the changes set off riots in Caracas a year ago in which about 300 people died. An inflation rate of 80 percent also contributed to a poor showing of Mr. Perez's party in 1989 elections. Mr. Perez has sought to soften the blow by creating public works programs and unemployment insurance. A recent rise in oil prices has provided some relief.
 
ANDEAN NATIONS
Terror Raids the Markets
Terrorism and investor nervousness hobbled growth in 1989 in Colombia and Peru, the two largest economies of the Andes.
Colombia, where inflation has traditionally been low and the foreign debt manageable, is suffering from a war by cocaine traffickers against the Government. The violence has provoked flights of capital and professionals. While the world focused on the country's cocaine exports, Colombians complained that their legitimate exports -coffee, flowers and bananas - were being hurt by higher tariffs and lower prices. In addition, leftist groups have been attacking coal mines and oil pipelines.
Peru rivaled Argentina for the continent's worst economic indicators of 1989: 2,775 percent inflation and a 10 percent drop in growth. Investors have been frightened off as Peru struggles against leftist guerrillas. As in Brazil, many people are betting on a free-market advocate: Mario Vargas Llosa, who leads all opinion polls as the April presidential election approaches. He proposes radical changes and has vowed to reduce inflation in his first year in office to 10 percent by cutting public spending and by selling off state enterprises.
Avoiding the wild swings of their neighbors, Ecuador and Bolivia experienced social peace, and modest growth and inflation in 1989. They have joined, to differing degrees, in Latin America's drive for private enterprise. But for both, real growth will continue to depend largely on prices for mineral exports - tin in Bolivia and oil in Ecuador. Bolivia, where consumer prices rose 8,170 percent in 1985, has tamed inflation - it was 16 percent last year - but at a huge cost. Public spending was drastically cut and government services reduced, and most state-run tin mines, which had been operating at a loss, were closed. Private mines were allowed to remain open.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
On Drugs, Bush Aims for a Meeting of the Minds, at Least

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF all goes according to plan, President Bush will fly to Colombia this week and join the leaders of that country, Peru and Bolivia in forming an alliance to wage the war on drugs. But the session is unlikely to resolve deep-seated differences between the United States and the Latin countries.
The United States, a huge consumer of illicit drugs, emphasizes law enforcement: the destruction of coca and marijuana crops and the interdiction of narcotics before they enter this country.
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru will emphasize their need for economic assistance not only to combat drug traffickers, but also to provide alternative employment for the many people who depend on the cocaine economy. 
The basic elements of the agreement to be signed this week in Cartagena, the Colombian resort city, were worked out last month in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, by officials from the four countries.
Mr. Bush and the three other Presidents - Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan Garcia Perez of Peru - will agree to exchange information and cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of narcotics cases. But Bush Administration officials say the spirit of cooperation will be more important than the text of any agreement.
The draft agreement addresses many of the Andean countries' concerns by promising increased aid for crop substitution and job creation. But it remains for Mr. Bush to overcome the bitterness that lingers over the United States invasion of Panama in December.
Colombian protests have already forced the Administration to put off plans to deploy an aircraft carrier near the coast of Colombia to intercept drug shipments. In addition, Mr. Garcia originally threatened to stay away from the meeting to protest the invasion. Now he plans to go, having been reassured by Mr. Bush's promise last month that the invasion force would be withdrawn from Panama ''well before the end of February.'' So even as he offers to lead an international war on drugs, Mr. Bush will try to avoid doing anything in Colombia that might stir nationalist resentment.
The conference itself will last less than six hours. American officials say it symbolizes the Bush Administration's commitment to work closely with the three Andean countries, which produce the raw materials for most cocaine smuggled into the United States.
Whatever that commitment, the Andean countries have deep concerns of their own that they intend to raise.
 
Harvesters and Gunmen
Patricia Ardila of the Panos Institute, a private group in Europe and the United States that studies third world environmental and economic issues, estimates that 1.5 million people in Peru, Bolivia and Colombia benefit from the cocaine economy as farmers, hired hands, harvesters, refiners, middlemen, transporters, buyers and gunmen.
''Countries such as Bolivia must receive substantial development assistance,'' said Carlos E. Delius, who served as the Bolivian Ambassador to the United States in 1988 and 1989. ''It is foolish to expect any government to win this war if its only mission is to rip up coca bushes.''
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which oversees government operations, said in a report last week that the United States has often failed to coordinate antidrug efforts and economic policy in the Andean region. ''As eradication and interdiction efforts succeed,'' it said, ''hundreds of thousands of subsistence-level peasants will have to find another way of earning their living. If there is nothing in place to assist them, they are likely to become prime candidates for insurgent groups.''
In Peru, that has been happening for some time. ''Eradication efforts have driven the coca growers into the arms'' of Maoist guerrillas ''who have adeptly exploited the fact that this U.S.-inspired program threatens the peasants' existence in a time of extreme economic hardship,'' the report said. Peru's Ambassador to the United States, Cesar G. Atala, said it might make sense for the United States and Western Europe to establish a fund to buy up and destroy coca produced in the Andean nations.
American officials say President Barco of Colombia will appeal to Mr. Bush to support negotiations on a new agreement to regulate the prices of coffee, a vital legitimate crop for Colombia. Bogota's Ambassador to Washington, Victor Mosquera Chaux, said the breakdown last year of an international agreement that regulated coffee prices caused those prices to plummet, costing Colombia $500 million a year.
The Andean countries may also ask Mr. Bush to support debt relief. Bolivia and Colombia paid the United States more in interest and principal on their debt than they received in antidrug assistance in 1988. Since then, Washington has increased aid for military equipment and training to fight drug traffic. State Department officials say the United States will provide a total of $2 billion in military, economic and law-enforcement assistance in the next five years.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Taxes Give the Democrats One More Identity Problem

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan proposed cutting the Social Security tax, some party consultants seized on the idea as a brilliant political weapon. Here was a Democratic tax cut for the 1990's that was fairer than the Republican tax cuts of the 1980's. At the same time, the proposal revealed two facts of Republican fiscal policy: that cuts in the progressive income tax had effectively been paid for by increases in the regressive payroll tax, and that the proceeds were being spent like any other revenues rather than being socked away.
Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill got together last week to consider how to handle this political opportunity Mr. Moynihan had handed them. But soon they were devoured by concerns. They worried about the loss of revenue and the deficit. They feared that Republicans would use the plan to paint Democrats as a threat to Social Security - exactly as Democrats did to Republicans during the Reagan years. 
Senator George S. Mitchell, the majority leader, closed the strategy session by saying there was agreement on two points. ''One, we ought to act in concert,'' he said. ''Two, we can't agree on what we should do.''
The Democrats are indeed more united than they have been in a long time behind the idea that they must pull together to define who they are. There is general agreement that the Democrats must re-establish themselves as the party of working people, which can responsibly manage the economy while improving the quality of life. Then they must get the message across to voters.
Oddly enough, part of the party's problem is its firm hold on Congress. A decade ago, when Republicans were out of power in Washington, they were really out of power. The voices of Republicanism, exemplified by Ronald Reagan, spoke without worrying that their view would be muddled by a confusing message from Capitol Hill or challenged by realities.
The Democrats are trying to use their stronghold on Capitol Hill to broadcast a message to the nation. So far, the results are at best mixed, as the intra-party struggles over cutting both Social Security and capital gains taxes make clear.
So far, no prominent Democrat on Capitol Hill has joined Mr. Moynihan's call for a reduction in Social Security taxes. They agree the tax is regressive. They agree it is being used to conceal the deficit. But the Democratic leaders say only that they are thinking about the situation. Two Democratic barons of Congress, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, announced their opposition to the Moynihan plan.
 
Defections in the House
The capital gains issue was a mirror image of this debate. The leadership, after some confusion, came out firmly against a cut in the capital gains tax. But enough rank-and-file Democrats defected to push the cut through the House last year. Some reduction will probably pass both houses this year.
The Democratic Congress cutting capital gains taxes, a cut which would benefit the wealthy? The Democratic Congress brushing off a plan to cut Social Security taxes, a cut which would benefit working Americans?
What is a Democrat, anyway? Once perceived as the party of compassion and progress, Democrats are now considered by many Americans as a fragmented bunch whose policies are likely to produce (if they produce anything at all) too much spending on the poor and too many burdens on working people.
To understand and do something about their image problem, the Democrats have conducted opinion polls and started meetings to discuss the problems.
''For the first time that I am aware of, there is an aggressive, real, genuine get-in-a-room-and-let's-talk-and-let's-plan-and-let's-research effort on their part to work their way out of it,'' said an interested observer, Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant.
Indeed, after nearly a generation of trying to blur the differences they have with the Republicans, the Democrats are looking for ways to highlight them.
In 1989, they found one: a woman's right to abortion. Their support of it helped Democratic candidates substantially. But now the Democrats need more. Their experts see economics and domestic problems like drugs and the environment as their big ticket.
 
'You Can't Use the Hill'
Some experts say efforts to advertise a party line from Congress are doomed. ''You can't use the Hill,'' said Curtis Gans, an election expert in Washington. ''A Hill-generated program will be subjected to the difficulties of the committee system.'' That can elevate regional over national interests and personal over party politics.
Mr. Gans says the Democratic Party's best approach would be to work outside Congress. Writing recently in Social Policy magazine, he said the party should follow the example of two former chairmen, Stephen A. Mitchell and Paul Butler, who led the way for a Democratic resurgence in 1958 and 1960. Their strategy, Mr. Gans said, was to establish a council of prominent Democrats ''to hone and define a party message.'' Former President Harry S. Truman, several governors, Senators and House members took part. They called for a higher minimum wage, stronger civil rights legislation, Federal scholarships for college students and more liberal immigration laws.
The Democrats won 61 seats in Congress in 1958. In 1960, they won back the White House.

The Charms of the U.S.A. Are Selling Well

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS

 BODY:
THE host of Walt Disney World's Super Star Television attraction recently wandered through the crowd of visitors to the Florida theme park, asking the standard question: ''Where are you from?''
The responses - Brazil, Sweden, Canada, Great Britain - provided a good example of what is happening in the country's $350 billion travel industry: tourism in the United States has an increasingly foreign flavor.
The trend was further demonstrated in Washington last week at an international conference sponsored by the United States Travel and Tourism Administration, an arm of the Commerce Department. Representatives of 31 states, 39 cities and dozens of travel companies and attractions gathered to discuss how to attract more foreign visitors. 
''We have to find a way to make the United States more user friendly,'' said Rockwell A. Schnabel, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism. ''We can be very intimidating, we are a huge country, and we speak English and not much more.''
Fueled by the weak dollar, international tourism hit record levels in 1989, when 38.3 million people - up from 1988's 34.2 million in 1988 -came to the United States. About 70 percent of those visits were for leisure and vacation.
Even in New York City, which suffered a decline in tourism last year, the number of people arriving on international flights rose slightly.
The foreign visitors spent $43 billion, compared with the $42.6 billion spent by Americans traveling overseas. The difference was in the United States' favor for the first time, and the surplus is expected to triple this year, the Commerce Department said, to $1.48 billion.
Tourism, in fact, became the nation's largest export industry last year, the department said. Furthermore, according to the department's economic projections, the number of travelers from abroad will increase 75 percent by the end of the decade.
With that prospect, states and cities are trying to sell themselves overseas. For some - New York, California, Florida, for example - the task is relatively easy. But increasingly, many travelers are bypassing large cities, including New York, for other parts of the country.
When South Carolina started its overseas marketing efforts 11 years ago, ''many people thought we were insane,'' said Robert G. Liming, director of the division of tourism of the state's Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism. ''But now,'' he said, ''with the increased competition, we've had a real competitive advantage.''
South Carolina promotes its warm weather and its beaches to German and British companies that arrange package tours.
''We know we are not going to get 500,000 West Germans to come to South Carolina when they don't even know where it is,'' Mr. Liming said. ''We are after the fourth- and fifth-time visitor who is looking for something different.''
It is a realistic strategy. Frans W. de Ridder, managing director of Meier's Weltreisen, a large West German tour operator, said his customers generally want to see what they have heard of the most.
''It is very difficult for us to put a museum in Oklahoma in one of our brochures,'' he said. ''For the not-so-popular destinations, I only see a chance if they get involved in the promotion and marketing of their areas.''
 
Other countries, such as the
Eastern European nations, are likely to be increasingly popular destinations. But some tourism officials said the opening of Eastern Europe should also mean new visitors for the United States. Antonio Enriquez Savignac, the secretary general of the World Tourism Organization, representing many national governments, said at the tourism conference that only 2 percent of the 400 million people in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union left their countries last year.
 
The Top States
The Commerce Department said that in 1989 six states and the District of Columbia captured more than half the international visitors. California, New York, Florida, Hawaii, Texas and Nevada attracted 17 million people last year.
But seven other states had the greatest increases in foreign visitors from 1985 to 1989: the rise in New Mexico was 266 percent; South Dakota, 266 percent; Utah, 254 percent; Arizona, 205 percent; Tennessee, 190 percent, and Alabama and Iowa, 175 percent.
In Iowa, the increase - to 100,000 visitors last year - has not gone unnoticed. David K. Reynolds, administrator of the Iowa division of tourism, said the state's recent decision to legalize gambling on old-style riverboats ''is going to help every program that we have.''
Whether the increases continue, in Iowa or the rest of the country, depends in part on the strength of the dollar. But that is not the only factor.
''The growth in tourism to the United States is closely related to the overcapacity of airline seats,'' said Mr. de Ridder. Since 1988, a spurt in growth of international service by both domestic and foreign airlines has left some flights with empty seats, he said, giving airlines increased incentive to offer tour operators discounted fares.

It's Connecticut's Turn to Find Out About Hard Times

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
THROUGH the roaring 1980's, as Connecticut caught up with and then surpassed Alaska as the richest state in the nation in personal income, it began to seem to many people both inside and outside the state that things here had somehow turned to gold. There was virtually no unemployment, taxes were more likely to go down than up, and growth outstripped the national average for years.
But now the perceptions and expectations are coming in for a jarring test. The growth has stalled and the buoyant confidence of years past has been replaced by concerns about a housing glut, a government budget crisis and business bankruptcy. The implications of the change - both economic and psychological - are now working themselves out. 
''If you're driving 75 miles an hour and suddenly you slow to 45 miles an hour, the transition is a rattling one,'' said Nicholas S. Perna, the chief economist for Connecticut National Bank, the state's largest bank. ''You don't know whether you're coming to a dead stop or not. That's what's going on in Connecticut.''
Some economists, including Mr. Perna, believe the state will avoid the ravages of widespread unemployment, which would represent a true recession. Connecticut has a 3.8 percent unemployment rate, more than a percentage point below the national average. But few economists or public officials anticipate any return to the gold-rush days. Most said that residents will simply have to adjust to an era of much slower economic growth that could extend well into the 1990's.
And with the elections this November for every state office from Governor to the General Assembly, many politicians believe the stage has been set for an expression of just how voters feel about the adjustment they have been asked to make. For incumbents like Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat who began his re-election campaign last week in the face of polls showing his popularity at the lowest ebb of his nine years in office, the tidings seem grim. On Wednesday, Mr. O'Neill asked the General Assembly for $600 million in spending cuts to achieve a $7.2 billion budget and for the elimination of more than 2,000 state jobs by the middle of next year. He said that half of all the state agencies would receive the same or less money in the fiscal year that begins July 1 than they received this year, and that nearly $300 million would have to be taken from special state savings accounts or raised by additional borrowing to keep services as they are now.
 
No Pointing With Pride
Only a few programs, notably those of the Department of Correction, which is responsible for Connecticut's huge prison expansion, would get significantly more money. For legislators concerned about their own re-election chances, little in the budget could be taken back to voters and trumpeted as good news.
The political director of Mr. O'Neill's own party, State Representative Jonathan Pelto, has said he believes that the voters are in the mood to throw out incumbents, and that Democrats who have dominated state politics here for most of the last 30 years could take the greater fall simply because they are in power and the Republicans are not.
The municipal elections last fall were a portent, Mr. Pelto said. More incumbent mayors and other top officials were voted out of office -about equally from both parties -than in any local election in modern times.
Some experts say that Connecticut residents are in fact already expressing their pessimism about the future by spending less money and putting off major purchases. Declines in spending have wide repercussions in Connecticut because the government relies so heavily on sales taxes for its funds.
Unlike New Jersey or New York, for example, which have also seen declines in sales taxes and other revenues over the last several years, Connecticut has no personal income tax. It has to support nearly 40 percent of its budget from an 8 percent sales tax, the highest state rate in the nation. New York, by contrast, receives only about 20 percent of its budget from its 4 percent sales tax, and allows municipalities to add on local sales taxes; New York City, for instance, has a combined 8.25 percent sales tax.
In Connecticut, lower sales tax collections have in turn hurt the state budget and made the overall economic picture appear even more grim than it really is, some economists say. Tax revenues are down $45 million from the expected amount this year even with an increase in the tax rate last July from 7.5 percent to 8 percent.
And when the news about the state budget is bad, officials say, the vicious circle is completed when residents decide to put off purchases of cars and other big-ticket items in case things get even worse. For politicians and budget planners, it is an environment that leaves little room for error.
''The nice thing about rapid growth is that it covers all your mistakes,'' Mr. Perna said. ''You don't have to worry too much and things turn out fine. We're going from a period of extremely rapid growth where everything turned to gold, to slow growth where it will not be as easy.''

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
A Rash of Thoughtful Best Sellers Has Made Publishers Think, Too

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
HARPER & ROW almost seemed to be asking to lose money last year when it published ''The Other Path'' by Hernando de Soto, and it would seem to have been asking to lose even more when it recently reprinted the book in paperback. Written by a Peruvian businessman, the book is a detailed examination of the black market in Lima, with lessons about wealth and poverty in Latin America.
As far as many people in publishing are concerned, there could be no more certain prescription for disaster than a book combining economics and third world affairs. Though it sold well in Latin America, publishers have learned that discussions of regional issues rarely do well in the United States market. 
But with a number of serious books on subjects ranging from educational reform to the nature of consciousness riding the best-seller lists week after week, publishers once again seem willing to take chances on what might be called idea books, hoping to discover the writer who will become the next Allan Bloom.
''I had a deep-seated hunch that what Mr. de Soto said was so new and so fresh, a lot of people would want to know about it,'' said Hugh Van Dusen, the editor who bought the book at an auction for what he described as ''more money than you would think.''
As it turned out, ''The Other Path'' was not a big hit, but it has sold a respectable 10,000 or more copies in hardcover. And now that it is on reading lists at several American universities, it is likely to have a long paperback life. Mr. Van Dusen said he still thinks Harper & Row can make money from it in the long run.
In recent years, critics have predicted that the wave of mergers and acquisitions in the book industry would turn distinguished names in publishing into little more than corporate profit centers, catering to the mass markets as they kept a sharper eye on the bottom line. By now, books like Mr. de Soto's weren't supposed to stand a chance.
In the past, publishers often printed books they considered deserving, whether or not they seemed profitable. They considered it their obligation as publishers. But now a perception is growing that books that once would have stagnated on what is euphemistically called the ''mid list'' might have a chance of making money.
Throughout history there have been surprise best sellers. But in the last few years, a steady stream of books by academics have competed with the likes of Stephen King: Mr. Bloom's 1987 book, ''The Closing of the American Mind,'' followed by ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' by Paul Kennedy, ''Cultural Literacy'' by E. D. Hirsch Jr. and ''Innumeracy'' by John Allen Paulos.
 
Scholarly Advances
Hoping to compete with their colleagues, professors who once turned automatically to a university press to publish their latest musings are now likely to send their proposals to Simon & Schuster, for example, and Random House. Mr. Paulos, a Temple University mathematics professor, sold ''Innumeracy'' through an agent to Hill & Wang, a division of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, for a $27,500 advance. After a first printing of 10,000, it sold more than 100,000 hardcover copies.
For publishers, these books can be a bargain. While it might take an advance of six or seven figures to attract a well-known author, books by unknown academics still generally come cheap. Advances of $10,000 to $15,000 are typical.
University presses continue to publish the bulk of monographs and scholarly books. Some like ''Battle Cry of Freedom'' by James H. McPherson and ''The Emperor's New Mind'' by Roger Penrose, both by Oxford University Press, have become best sellers.
And, as in the past, mainstream publishers maintain at least a minor commitment to serious nonfiction books that, at best, will make money over the long haul. Several commercial publishers maintain divisions like Hill & Wang whose fare often competes with university presses: at Macmillan, it is The Free Press, Harper & Row has Basic Books, and Random House's division is Pantheon.
''There continues to be a significant market for serious and enduring books,'' said Steve Wasserman, the executive editor of Doubleday, who was recently hired by Random House to run Times Books, which specializes in nonfiction. Before coming to Doubleday, Mr. Wasserman was publisher of Hill & Wang.
What is often overlooked, Mr. Wasserman said, is that the best-seller lists only chart how quickly current titles are moving from the stores. ''They do not record the steady sale of books, and many distinguished books over time far outsell the current best sellers,'' he said.
Who knows which unknown authors might join that distinguished club? The catalogues for this spring tell of hundreds of books that don't fall into the categories of commercial fiction or fad diets - the kind of fare that pulls readers into shopping mall bookstores.
The titles include ''Galileo's Children: Scientific Discovery vs. the Power of the State'' by George Bailey (Little, Brown & Company), ''Rudeness and Civility: Manners in Nineteenth-Century Urban America'' by John F. Kasson (Hill & Wang) and ''A Passion For Justice: Emotions and the Origins of the Social Contract'' by Robert C. Solomon (Addison Wesley).
Whatever the fate of such books, unlike so many other spring titles, they are not being published because they offer a quick, easy read.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Bush Would Wait For a Weatherman

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
IN predicting the future, much of what is proclaimed as science must ultimately be taken as a matter of faith. A problem that continues to confront the Bush Administration is how fervently it should believe in the dangers of the greenhouse effect - and how high a price the country should pay to forestall them.
Last week, British scientists reported that 1989 was the fifth-warmest year in the nearly 100 years that reliable records have been kept. Coming after a decade of record-breaking years - including 1988, the hottest recorded - the report will be taken by some as more evidence that an accumulation of carbon dioxide and other byproducts of civilization is making the earth steadily warmer, harkening disruptive changes in weather and calamities like melting polar ice caps. 
But proving a link between the recent warming and atmospheric pollution has been impossible. In the long term, meteorological models are no better than econometric ones. While no one disputes that carbon dioxide buildup causes global warming, the questions of how much and when are as uncertain as 1999's interest rates.
Last week, when President Bush addressed a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body formed to study the problem, he disappointed environmentalists with his cautious stance. Though he renewed his call for some kind of international action, he avoided specifics and made it clear that economic interests would have to be taken as seriously as environmental ones. What is needed, he said, is an ''international bargain, a convergence between global environmental policy and global economic policy, where both perspectives benefit and neither is compromised.''
According to computer simulations, the greenhouse effect could raise the earth's temperature by several degrees during the next century. But complex systems like weather defy science's attempts to simulate them. With the skein of causes and effects so hard to untangle, the question of what to do about global warming comes down to politics.
Mr. Bush's speech last week was edited by John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. Last Sunday on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Sununu said he was trying to counter ''a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucrats on the environmental side to try and create a policy in this country that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas.''
Not all the bureaucrats are faceless by choice. William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, wanted the United States to take a strong stand at a meeting on global warming last fall in the Netherlands. But he was reined in by Mr. Sununu and others. Ultimately, the United States, joined by Japan and the Soviet Union, quashed a proposal by Western European countries that would cut carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent by 2005. The wording that was finally substituted called for reductions ''as soon as possible.''
 
Political Tradeoffs
The political side of the problem promises to become even more pronounced in August when the group that met last week in Washington issues a final report, which is expected to form the basis for international negotiations. The biggest emitters of carbon dioxide - the United States is the worst offender -also have the most to lose economically from stricter pollution controls. Costs would also be high for third world countries, whose leaders continue to argue that they should be compensated for the costs of developing along cleaner paths than their richer predecessors had to follow.
Figuring out how to balance all these countervailing forces could be as difficult a task as sorting out the maddeningly complex interactions in the climatic models.

HEADLINE: What Homeless Beggars Must Keep Telling Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Riders' Rights, Beggars' Rights'' (editorial, Jan. 31), your criticism of Judge Leonard Sand's decision recognizing that begging in the New York City subway system is constitutionally protected speech, you have succumbed to the same dangerous tendencies to generalization and fuzzy thinking that characterize most public reactions against the ruling.
To reduce the public hysteria on this issue, everyone needs to know that begging in the subway system is still strictly regulated. Solidly in place and ready to be enforced, even after the Federal court's decision, are rules prohibiting begging on a subway car, within 25 feet of a token booth, at any site that interferes with the flow of passengers (entrances to, exits from stairways, escalators, elevators), in a manner that might cause harm or injury to anyone, in a way that is likely to annoy, alarm or inconvenience another person and in a host of other circumstances and situations. 
These rules, which the homeless plaintiffs never sought to challenge, can easily be enforced by the transit police. It is inappropriate to blame the beggars if the rules are not enforced.
Given the economic and political landscape of New York today, begging cannot be understood as anything but vital political speech. Every time a destitute person asks for change or extends a cup, he or she conveys the uncomfortable, disturbing idea that in the midst of staggering wealth there live people who lack the means to live. If we silence the beggar by pushing him off the subways, we cut off one of his most effective channels of communication.
Your lament on behalf of subway riders about the role this ruling will play in hindering the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's campaign to increase ridership and safety ignores that begging and the homeless apparently are not major concerns of those who use the subway. In a recent marketing survey the M.T.A. asked 996 riders to identify the three most important problems in the subways. They ranked presence of the homeless sixth of six categories, trailing reliability and frequency of trains, crime and safety, dirt, crowding and miscellaneous. Only 19 percent cited the homeless as one of the top three problems, only 5 percent as the most important problem.
Finally, you deflect attention from the real public policy issue here, which is that poor people beg because of inadequate alternatives. Why has the government (Federal, state or city) not created incentives to recapture the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs this country has lost in the last 10 years? Why doesn't the Federal Government restore the $25 billion cut from the annual low-income housing budget in the last eight years? Why do we accept a state public assistance grant for the homeless living in shelters of $1.50 a day (for which each recipient must work 20 hours a week)?
Those who try to help the destitute in their struggle to survive would rather spend time, energy and money working to end homelessness and hunger than fighting legal battles to protect their clients' right to humiliate themselves by asking for spare change.

HEADLINE: You Don't Move American Landmarks Like Yankee Stadium;
Bad Idea for the Bronx

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The plan by Fernando Ferrer, Bronx Borough President, to build a new stadium for the Yankees is unfortunate for residents of the Bronx and all New Yorkers.
In the last 15 years, the Bronx has become an international symbol of urban decay. Entire neighborhoods, once considered very desirable places to live, have been abandoned and in many cases burned to the ground. The downtown area around Yankee Stadium and the Grand Concourse is a mere shadow of what it was.
This area, marred by years of neglect, remains the urban core of this once great borough. Increasingly, urban renewal projects are bringing the area back. The rows of Art Deco apartment houses along the truly grand Grand Concourse, the Supreme Court building and Yankee Stadium combine to create a neighborhood full of vitality and beauty.
Moving Yankee Stadium to the proposed new site would increase automobile access and decrease accessibility by public transportation. More important, however, it would be a serious blow to urban renewal in the downtown area. The crowds drawn by the Yankees help support a host of merchants dependent on them.
Yankee Stadium could be renovated and enclosed, and better parking facilities could be developed. These improvements would benefit the Yankees, as well as Yankee fans, while continuing urban renewal.
If Mr. Ferrer is interested in bringing the Bronx back to the glorious position it once enjoyed, he would be well advised to abandon his plan to move the stadium.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
How Americans Can Help

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev stood at the chasm and carefully took a historic step back from destruction.
After four years of refusal, Mr. Gorbachev joined the tide against the monopoly power of the Soviet Communist Party. He decided that to keep swimming against it would soon drown him, the party and the nation, so wretched is the rule of the party he leads and so total its failure.
But the chasm remains. Respect for the decision to move toward life, the sign of a strong and healthy mind, does not change the plain fact that it must be crossed. 
Should Americans try to help build a bridge across it? The question has taken on a new political and moral importance after Mr. Gorbachev's pronouncements, which could give political choice to the Soviet people but at the same time make his own power greater than ever.
To say it fast: The Soviet Union is as near collapse as a country can be without exploding into total revolution.
Economically, this huge continental nation becomes hungrier, shabbier and colder week by week. It is barely third world.
Politically, the colonial empire that czars and commissars called a single nation is moving rapidly toward its destiny - fragmentation. That would be a blessing, if the national and ethnic hatreds and bigotries accumulated under colonialism allowed it to happen without pogrom and massacre.
What's more, the coming collapse of the entire Soviet Communist system leaves the people without any plan for a government of the future. Mr. Gorbachev's hodgepodge, halfway-house perestroika is already another synonym for failure.
Yes, Americans can help build the bridge across chaos to tomorrow but only in special American ways, quite other than soda and hamburgers.
Here is one way: Broaden and take part in the kind of work American human rights groups have been doing for a long, difficult time.
Day after dark day, these groups kept in touch with Soviet freedom fighters and spread the word of the struggle. They gave those imprisoned the only gift of value - the ceaseless struggle for their liberation.
These American groups helped the dissidents create an essential for freedom: the international awareness of the Communist tyranny and the fact that the fight against it was going on behind the homeland walls.
With the goal of Soviet freedom coming closer, it would be a tragedy if Americans now walked away from the Soviet citizens and movements that have been fighting for years and concentrated exclusively on Soviet officialdom.
The longtime freedom fighters need attention and help - and not simply for moral or emotional reasons, which are important enough.
The struggle for Soviet freedom is still in its early stages. The veteran dissidents, not the officials, are the least likely to give up. And they are the most likely to warn against dangers, including accretions of power by Mr. Gorbachev or anyone else.
Many American groups are helping the Soviet democracy movement. In doing so they help all Soviet people. I list the following four as thanks for their help in keeping me informed:
Helsinki Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York 10017; Freedom House, 48 East 21st Street, New York 10010; International League for Human Rights, 432 Park Avenue South, New York 10016, and the Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R., 358 West 30th Street, New York 10001.
They do a lot more for the cause of Soviet freedom than oceans of Pepsi and mountains of Big Macs. So do Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, accurate, trusted, invaluable. Another bridge builder: Hugely expanded contacts between American groups and the Soviet ''informals,'' the scores of thousands of Soviet clubs, unions and cultural organizations that sprouted in the soil of hope.
Some will blossom into local parties if democracy is allowed to grow in the Soviet Union. Thousands of others will turn into the cultural, political or special-interest associations that grow roots for political parties.
From American unions, political and religious groups, universities and professional societies they need fax machines, computers, copiers - and the fresh air of foreign contact. That has been a crime under Communism.
The degree to which it is allowed now by Mr. Gorbachev and demanded by the West will have a lot to do with speeding the inevitable end of the entire Communist system.
That, of course, is the only guarantee that the promise of choice becomes the reality of choice, which is the single bridge across the chasm.

HEADLINE: Seeing the Shuttle Up Close

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ; JEFFREY SCHMALZ is the deputy national editor of The Times.

 BODY:
WHATEVER the event, from a football game to a Presidential inauguration, the ideal vantage point is often television. Americans have grown accustomed to thinking of it as the best seat in the house, preferable to actually being there.
But there are some events that television does not even come close to capturing, and one of them is at Cape Canaveral, Fla.: the launching of a space shuttle. For each blastoff, at least 15,000 people - and occasionally more than 500,000 - cram the beaches and roadways around the Kennedy Space Center, some standing on the hoods of their automobiles, most usually not cheering but reverentially silent.
And many are taken aback at how different a launching is in reality, compared with television. Nothing has prepared them for the deep, crackling rumble; for the waves of vibration; for the intensity of the white light of flame that lifts the rocket skyward; for the thrill of being there. 
As the shuttle program completes its recovery from the January 1986 Challenger disaster, the launch schedule is growing, and with it the opportunity for spectators to come and see a bit of history. For the rest of this year, eight launchings are scheduled. Eight are planned for 1991, 12 for 1992, 13 for 1993, 11 for 1994, 11 for 1995 and 10 for 1996.
Planning a trip to the east coast of Florida to view a launch is a bit tricky: as a result of inclement weather or technical malfunctions, delays of a few days are common. To be safe, visitors should plan to be in the area for at least two days beyond the scheduled launch date.
But a family on a week's vacation that is willing to be a bit flexible and listen to news reports on launch status can work out a fairly smooth trip. If visitors hear that a launch is put off 24 hours or so, for example, they can spend the day instead touring the Kennedy Space Center exhibitions or one of the nearby beaches or attractions that make up what economic developers and tourism officials now like to call the Space Coast.
For most tourists, a trip to view a launch begins with arrival at Orlando International Airport, which is about 50 miles, or an hour's drive, west of Cape Canaveral. The Orlando area, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, is home to Disney World and Sea World.
Orlando, where virtually all the major hotel and motel chains offer accommodations, could serve as the base for a visit. It's an easy drive on a superhighway, passing through miles and miles of orange groves.
On a launch day, visitors who have written ahead to NASA and obtained a pass may drive onto the causeways of the Kennedy Space Center. The roadways offer a direct view of the rocket and shuttle across about six to eight miles of water and wetland.
But only 1,000 passes are issued, so most visitors have to content themselves with watching from outside the center's compound. The center sits on a peninsula that runs north to south, parallel to the mainland and separated from it by the Indian River. U.S. Route 1 runs along the river, on the mainland, and it is along that highway that some of the best viewing is available for those without special passes.
Especially good spots are in Titusville, directly across the Indian River from the shuttle launch sites. Route 1 there offers an unobstructed view of the shuttle and its rocket from about 10 miles away. The Titusville police allow launch spectators to park along Route 1 while they walk to the river's edge. Other good viewing points are slightly to the south, in Jetty Park at Port Canaveral and on Route A1A along the beach in Cocoa Beach or Cape Canaveral.
Wherever visitors go to watch, a portable radio (for updates on launch time) and binoculars are musts.
A perfect complement to a launch viewing is a visit to the Kennedy Space Center's Spaceport USA. The Spaceport - a mix of museums, movies and bus tours of actual launch sites and rockets - is open, with a few exceptions, every day from 9 A.M. to dusk. It is closed on the days of some launchings, so visitors in town to watch a launch sometimes have to plan on visiting the center the day before or after.
Information on the Spaceport's hours of operation and on launchings can be obtained by calling 407-452-2121. Admission to the Spaceport is free; there are fees for the bus tour and the Imax movie. The center has free kennels and will provide free cameras (not film) for the day to visitors.
A must-see at the Spaceport is a 37-minute movie, shown on a 5 1/2-story Imax screen, that takes the audience along on a shuttle mission. The images are nothing short of spectacular, and viewers feel as if they're actually floating in space. The movie (cost is $2.75 for an adult, $1.75 for a child) offers all kinds of insights into aspects of life aboard the shuttle that most viewers probably never even thought about. (One of the best images: astronauts sleeping, strapped in their bunks, arms floating at their sides in the weightlessness.) There's also a 20-minute free film called ''Boy From Mars.''
Exhibits at the Spaceport are a mix of technology and space-flight memorabilia. Here is the actual Apollo capsule that docked with a Russian Soyuz capsule in July 1975. Here is the space suit worn by James Lovell on Apollo 13 in April 1970. Here is a moon rock collected from the Taurus-Littrow Valley on Dec. 12, 1972. Here is a replica of the lunar vehicle that carried astronauts across the moon's surface at a speed of 10 miles an hour. (The real one was left on the moon.) A new exhibit is a walk-through simulated space station.
But perhaps the most exciting part of the Spaceport is a two-hour bus tour of the 140,000-acre Kennedy Space Center. (Cost: $4 per adult; $1.75 per child.) This is called the Red Tour and runs every 20 minutes. The tour winds through marshland and citrus groves, moving from shuttle launch site to launch site and offering an opportunity to inspect a giant Saturn 5 rocket (281 feet tall; 363 feet with an Apollo spacecraft attached), which is placed on its side so it can be viewed more closely.
Often, the tour seems to take place in a surreal land of giants where the size of everything is exaggerated, from the huge building where assembly of the space shuttles is completed to the crawler transporters, the 131-feet-long, 114-feet-wide tractors that haul the rockets to the launch site at 1 mile an hour.
The Blue Tour runs just once a day and goes to the historic sites on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, such as Complex 19, where the Gemini flights blasted off in 1965 and 1966, and Complex 34, where three Apollo astronauts died in a flash fire in their capsule on Jan. 27, 1967. It also includes a look at some of the early rockets.
For those who get hungry during their tour of the Spaceport, it has restaurants and an inexpensive cafeteria (where a hamburger costs $1.15; a chef's salad, $2.95).
The Spaceport is by far the most popular attraction on Florida's mid-Atlantic coast. But there are other things to do in the area besides watch shuttle launchings. It boasts some of the best surfing on the Atlantic Coast, particularly off Cocoa Beach. And even for nonsurfers, it's worth a visit to Ron Jon's Surf Shop on Route A1A in Cocoa Beach for a look at the surfing crowd and the latest in such musts for the well-got-up surfer as zinc oxide in Day-Glo colors.
In towns up and down the coast, boats are available for tours or rental. SeaEscape Cruises offers a day at sea, from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M., aboard a cruise ship, sailing from Port Canaveral. (Cost: from $79 per adult, with some discounts for the elderly; $39 per child. Call 800-432-0900 in Florida or 800-327-7400.) The Little River Queen, a paddle-wheeler, makes two-hour sightseeing trips along the Banana River (call 407-783-2380).
For shoppers, Olde Cocoa Village is an Americana shopping district that offers jewelry and crafts along cobblestone streets.
The Space Coast also offers a wide array of outdoor sports, from golfing to windsurfing, Jet Skiing and airboat rides. Many vistors to Disney World prefer staying in this area because, unlike Disney's home near Orlando, it has the ocean and the beaches. For a detailed list of activities, hotels and restaurants, call 407-452-4390.
 
WHEN AND WHERE TO VIEW A LAUNCH
 
Scheduled Flights
The United States plans eight more space shuttle flights this year.
People planning a visit to the cape to view a launch should keep in mind that flights can be delayed for days because of technical malfunctions or bad weather. Here is the shuttle schedule for the remainder of 1990:
Feb. 22, Atlantis, with a Defense Department payload that reportedly is an advanced reconnaissance satellite.
April 18, Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope.
May 9, Columbia, with an astronomy laboratory.
July 9, Atlantis, with a Defense Department payload.
Aug. 29, Columbia, with a Space Life Sciences Laboratory.
Oct. 5, Discovery, with the Ulysses spacecraft to study the sun.
Nov. 1, Atlantis, with the Gamma Ray Observatory to study deep space.
Dec. 12, Columbia, with the International Microgravity Laboratory.
 
Getting Passes
For most of the launches, the Kennedy Space Center issues a limited number of car passes - 1,000 - that give a vehicle access to the causeway leading to the center. Cars with the passes may park on the causeway, and they enjoy a direct view across the Banana River to the launch pad six to eight miles away.
Passes can be obtained by writing a postcard well in advance to NASA Public Affairs, Kennedy Space Center, Fla. 32899. Write PA-PASS under the address. The passes are sent out three to four weeks before the launch date and should be displayed on the car's dashboard. Visitors with car passes should arrive two to three hours before launch time.
Car passes are not issued for launches - two this year - involving secret defense payloads. - J. S.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, It's Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO is a journalist who has traveled throughout Europe.

 BODY:
AS Americans start planning their summer vacations, travel agents are predicting the season's hot new destinations: Warsaw, Budapest, East Berlin and Prague.
Once viewed as some of the grimmest, grayest citadels of the Soviet empire, eastern Europe's biggest capitals are currently the toast of the Western travel industry.
The new appeal of these old cities started to surface last autumn, when many of the old-style Coummunist governments in Eastern Europe began to unravel. Tour operators, airline officials and travel agents now expect record numbers of Americans to visit the region this summer.
''The interest is just phenomenal, both from travel agents and consumers,'' said Bhavani Chandramouli, marketing manager for General Tours, one of the main package tour operators to the region. Last year 200 visitors took the company's 16-day ''Highlights of Eastern Europe'' tour, stopping in East and West Berlin, Prague, Budapest and Warsaw. The company expects twice as many this year for the tour, which will cost $3,399 from June to September, $3,299 in April and May and $3,349 from May 25 to June 9. 
In recent weeks, Americans have snapped up travel brochures, package tours and airline reservations for destinations in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria.
Some travel organizations that did not have such itineraries are setting up tours. Club Med, for example, best known for sun-and-fun vacations, took 140 Westerners last month on a seven-day, $2,000-a-person tour from Paris with stops in Prague, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, Budapest, Bucharest and Sofia - its first in Eastern Europe. The tour was arranged specifically to let visitors see the changes there, said Serge Trigano, Club Med's chief executive officer.
''It's clear everyone wants to be there today to see what's happening, to walk on the streets and see the people, to have a meal in a restaurant,'' he said. ''I think it's a new kind of way to visit a country.'' Club Med says it will repeat the tour in March.
How many western tourists these countries can comfortably handle, however, is a question. For years their history-rich cities and seaside spas have been supported by tourists from Eastern-bloc countries. While Americans, with their hard currency and democratic ideals, are being warmly welcomed, few Eastern European countries have enough hotel space and travel amenities to accommodate spur-of-the-moment visitors, particularly those wishing to stay in up-to-date Western-style hotels.
Package tour operators have already reserved large blocks of hotel space this summer, cutting the number of rooms available for independent travelers.
''Between mid-August and mid-September, it is impossible to get bookings in some countries,'' said Francis Goranin, who heads Vega International Travel Service, a Chicago agency that specializes in Eastern Europe. ''The U.S.S.R. and Hungary are extremely popular, though space is available if you go with a group.''
But calls to several large hotel chains indicated that rooms in late summer are still available in Warsaw and Sofia. A chance to visit a once shadowy part of the world as it changes is appealing to many Westerners. ''I'm thrilled to go,'' said John Caulkins, a senior at Vassar College who is traveling on his own to Prague this spring. ''I'm fascinated with the experiment there. It's something I want to experience first hand for myself.''
Irene Rawlings, a freelance arts writer from Denver, plans to visit Warsaw, Cracow and several small Polish mountain villages in March. Fluent in Polish, she last visited the country in the autumn. ''I am very much interested to see what the changes are like as Poland lurches to capitalism,'' she said. The wall has become something of a shrine to the changes throughout Eastern Europe, and visitors come to chip away a piece for themselves, take photographs and marvel at the swiftness of the revolution.
''We came because history was being made, and we wanted to be the first to see it,'' said Linda Benaroya of Englewood, N.J. She and her family cut short their visit to Paris over the New Year's holiday to make an impromptu visit to Berlin. ''It's a lot more educational for the kids than Disney World.''
ONLY Romania and Albania are not attracting visitors. A State Department advisory remains in effect for Romania, warning that travelers there should exercise extreme caution, and Albania has long been closed to American tourists.
For years, American travel to Eastern Europe was modest, limited mainly to people who had relatives there, and a few inveterate travelers. The region's appeal began growing in the mid-1980's, due largely to its relatively low cost and, at a time when terrorism gripped much of Western Europe, its safety.
More Americans visited Eastern Europe last year than ever before, though the numbers were still small. Hungary, with 150,000 visitors, was the region's biggest draw, topping even the Soviet Union, which had 135,000. Poland was host to 86,000 Americans in 1989, up from 40,000 in 1986. Czechoslovakia had 70,000 and Bulgaria 20,000. In comparison, Britain had about 2.8 million American visitors last year.
Already, business travel to Eastern Europe has increased sharply, particularly to Hungary and Poland. Pam American World Airways reported a 25 percent increase in the number of passengers for the autumn of 1989 over the previous autumn, largely because of business travel. And at the end of the year, Czechoslovak Airlines, which for years carried Americans to Prague on Soviet-made IL-62 planes, will switch to the European-made Airbus 310, adding a business-class section on trans-Atlantic flights.
Business travelers were the first to discover the difficulties of finding a hotel room, even though most big Eastern European cities have at least one Western-style hotel. At the Palace Hotel in Prague, for example, it is necessary to reserve at least a month in advance now for a $142 double room; or in summer, when rooms cost $247, six weeks ahead.
The hotel problem is particularly acute in Budapest. Over 20,000 rooms are available at the city's big international hotels, which include a Hilton, an Inter-Continental and a Hyatt. But because Budapest lacks office space, Western companies routinely rent hotel rooms as offices, keeping them even when their representatives are not in the city.
''Sometimes three to four weeks' notice is enough to book a room, sometimes six months is not enough,'' said Miklos Walko, general manager of Ibusz, the Hungarian National Travel Bureau. ''There's already a period in August this summer where there are no rooms.''
The Hungarian Government is seeking foreign investors to build new hotels and has set aside 10 prime Budapest sites. The first, a 220-room hotel set in the newly restored Gresham Palace, is a joint venture between Hunger Hotels, the large state-owned hotel group currently in the process of being sold, and Oberoi, a hotel group based in India. It is expected to open in three years.
Poland, which expects a 20 percent increase in visitors from the United States this year, already has a hotel that is not state-owned and operated. The $65 million Warsaw Marriott, which opened in October, is the first such hotel in Eastern Europe. A joint venture between Lot, the Polish airline, an Austrian construction company and Marriott Hotels and Resorts, the 520-room hotel is managed by Westerners and staffed by Poles trained by Marriott. To insure Western standards, Marriott chefs brought seeds from the Netherlands to raise fruit and vegetables, and the hotel supplies a local brewery with yeast for its beer. As at most luxury hotels in the region, prices are comparable to those in New York or Chicago, with double rooms priced at $185, payable only in Western currency ($165 through March).
Frequent visitors say Eastern Europe, though still cheaper than the West, has become more costly and is expected to grow even more expensive. ''To increase the living standard, they will need to increase wages, and then you can expect inflation,'' said Mr. Goranin.
ONE of the remaining bargains is food, which can be very good, according to George Lang, the Hungarian-born owner of the New York restaurant Cafe des Artistes. Vegetables may be overcooked, but each country has at least one national dish, like Hungary's traditional goulash, that is almost uniformly excellent.
''If anybody expects the elegance of a Four Seasons, he or she will be very disappointed in all of Eastern Europe,'' said Mr. Lang. ''If however somebody is looking for delicious home-style foods, in a casual and hospitable surrounding, often with live gypsy music, he will have a great time.''
A great deal of Eastern Europe still remains shabby and worn. Joran Kagan, vice president of Unitours, specializing in Jewish heritage tours, said, ''Americans are pretty spoiled. We try to prepare them for what to expect, but then they get there, and they're disappointed.''
But though buildings may be drab and cities gray, the people this year are different, according to George J. Nagorski, an aviation and travel consultant who often visits his native Poland. ''''A miracle has happened, and the people now have hope. Even though economically things are tough, the people look less somber and feel better.''
 
A SAMPLING OF EAST-BLOC TOURS

HEADLINE: OPPOSING ORTEGA

BYLINE: By Mark A. Uhlig: Mark A. Uhlig is chief of the Managua bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
BY THE TIME THE CANDIDATE ARRIVES, THE crowd in Granada, Nicaragua, is thousands strong. Ragged street vendors are making a month's pay in hours, and small boys, climbing up for the best view, cling to high shade trees like giant fruit.
In the multitude of blue flags, white banners and waving arms, the demonstrators can scarcely see their candidate's pickup truck as it makes its way to the front of the square. But as it reaches the stage, a silver-haired woman in a wheelchair is carefully lifted into view. Helped to her place beside a bust of her slain husband, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro thrusts up her hands in a victory salute. And the crowd explodes. ''Violeta! Violeta! Throw them out! Throw them out!'' Surrounded by outstretched hands, Mrs. Chamorro hugs everyone in reach. Then Nicaragua's most famous widow goes straight to her message. This is the town where my husband was born, she tells them. This is where he learned the values of freedom that cost him his life. This is where he would tell us to make a stand against the Sandinista regime.
''I never thought that I would return to Granada as a candidate, raising the banner steeped in the blood of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, to ask his people once again to put themselves in the front lines,'' she says. ''But Nicaragua must win its freedom once again. 
''All across the world,'' she continues, her voice rising, ''people like you are burying Communism and proclaiming democracy. So set your watches! Set them to the same hour as Poland, as Bulgaria, as Czechoslovakia, as Chile! Because this is the hour of democracy and freedom - this is the hour of the people!''
Coming from any (Continued on Page 62) other politician, the words would amount to little upon the vast polemical battlefield of Nicaraguan politics. But as the cheers swell around her, it is clear that the 60-year-old widow enjoys a special kind of authority.
It has been 12 years since Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, a crusading newspaper editor, was shot dead on a Managua street by unidentified assassins, sparking an uprising that toppled the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle and swept the Sandinista Front to power.
Since then, hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans, Mrs. Chamorro among them, have broken with the Sandinista regime. An entire rebel army has been raised and financed with American support. And the millions who mourned her husband have now buried 30,000 of their own dead on opposing sides in a bitter civil war.
But throughout, the martyrdom of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro has remained an almost sacred symbol of unity and sacrifice in Nicaragua's national memory. And as opposition parties prepare for national elections, that prestige has been enlisted to try to accomplish what war and counterrevolution could not. On Feb. 25, Mrs. Chamorro will lead the National Opposition Union, or U.N.O., a coalition of 14 parties, against the Sandinista Government of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra. The result, U.N.O leaders hope, will be a decisive referendum on Sandinista rule.
By thrusting her husband's name into the heart of political battles he never fought, Mrs. Chamorro has been obliged to reclaim his legacy even from the couple's own children, two of whom are high Sandinista officials. She has also made it a political imperative for her enemies to discredit the bond she cherished with her spouse. Sandinista leaders, portraying Mrs. Chamorro as a gullible widow, ridicule her candidacy as a stalking horse for American militarists and the Nicaraguan right wing. Unofficial characterizations are still more direct.
''What pain, Pedro,'' reads dripping red graffiti in Granada, not far from where the crowd has gathered, ''to know that your own wife has sold out to those who killed you.''
More important, Mrs. Chamorro's reliance on her husband's fame has reinforced the impression that, as president, she would have little else to offer. While opposition intellectuals labored over her coalition's platform, Mrs. Chamorro read none of the secret drafts, to say nothing of writing one. Even strong U.N.O. supporters have questioned whether she has the capacity to be anything more than a docile, if distinguished, creature of her advisers.
Yet on the stage in Granada, the cheers rain down on Pedro Joaquin Chamorro's widow. And to the officials who stand near her, sharing in the moment, all of those issues miss the point.
''She is a symbol, and that is enough,'' says one U.N.O. official. ''Not of the past, or the present, or even the future. She is a symbol of what might have been.''
VIOLETA CHAMORRO WAS at home, listening to the radio, when she learned she had been chosen to run for president of Nicaragua.
In a sweltering former restaurant a few blocks away, leaders from more than a dozen anti-Sandinista political parties had bargained, schemed and fumed for several days straight, trying to decide who would lead them in the elections. After 10 years of revolution and war, driven by Soviet arms and the near-fatal obsession of an American administration, a regional peace treaty had given exhausted Nicaraguans the chance to decide their future in a closely watched election. Amid a deep economic crisis and growing popular discontent, the timing for an anti-Government campaign seemed ideal.
But even as they grappled for position, the politicians, in the wilted, open-collar shirts that pass for business dress in Nicaragua's heat, knew that the very stakes of the vote put it beyond the reach of anyone in the room.
Back and forth, they debated names of peers who might find acceptance from the unwieldy coalition, which reached from Communists to conservatives. But from the start, the absent figure of Violeta Chamorro dominated the sessions. On Sept. 2, with journalists pressing close around them in Managua's sticky evening air, the leaders announced that they had reached a decision. The news crackled over the airwaves, and Mrs. Chamorro heard a spokesman read her name.
''I am not a politician, as I have said many times,'' she says, sitting in the study of her house. ''But I believe that this is a patriotic duty - that as a Nicaraguan I have to do this for my country.''
With her grandmother's smile - and her wheelchair, made necessary by a recently broken knee - Mrs. Chamorro could be the mathematical inverse of a traditional party boss. But in the study, a cool, dark sanctuary filled with photos, diplomas and family treasures, she is surrounded by reminders of the lifetime that made the nomination possible, even inevitable.
When she first met her future husband, 19-year-old Violeta Barrios could hardly have been further removed from the politics that addicted him. A sheltered upper-class girl from Rivas, near the Costa Rican border, Miss Barrios, at the insistence of her father, had attended women's colleges in Texas and Virginia to learn English. ''It was his obsession,'' she says, with a smile, of her father, a wealthy cattleman who had attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But in classes filled with other young, aristocratic Latin American women, she found little time or need to progress beyond the lazy consonants and dropped endings of her rural Nicaraguan Spanish.
Returning to Rivas, Violeta had settled into a life of parties and privilege when her brother introduced her to a heavyset college friend whose parents owned a newspaper in Managua. Pedro Joaquin Chamorro fell in love at first sight. A year later, Violeta gave in to his repeated proposals of marriage, beginning a close, if one-sided, life of politics, centered on resistance to the Somoza dictatorship.
In the small, personal world of Nicaraguan politics, the Somozas held power, having exploited the American-founded National Guard to form a personal military dynasty. But the Chamorros held claim to a longer and far loftier family history that included several presidents and a sense of self-worth undimmed by even the formidable solipsism of the last Somoza ruler, Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
When Pedro Joaquin Chamorro's brother met then-President Somoza at a Managua swimming party in the 1960's, the family resemblance apparently rang a bell with the dictator, who asked, with regal curiosity, ''Do I know you?''
''I don't know,'' answered the brother, in a withering retort that quickly became famous. ''I'm Jaime Chamorro. Who are you?''
After his father, also an editor, died in 1952, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro focused his energies on La Prensa, the newspaper his family had acquired in the early 1930's. But his time was also consumed with politics, carrying his wife along on a wave of dramatic and often quixotic challenges to the Somoza regime. Accused of rebellion in 1956, Chamorro was imprisoned, then banished to an isolated village. He escaped to Costa Rica, where Violeta joined him for several years in exile.
Through it all, she says, ''my work was to be his wife - to take care of my children, take care of the house, accompany him on his trips, take food to him in prison - going to drop off the food, there and back, nothing more.'' But it was on just such a domestic errand that her life, and that of her country, would change abruptly.
On Jan. 10, 1978, Mrs. Chamorro was shopping for her daughter's wedding dress at a mall in downtown Miami when her brother-in-law rushed in with a message. The family, he said, would have to return at once to Nicaragua. There had been an accident.
''I knew at that moment that there wasn't an accident,'' she says. ''I knew they had killed him. I could see it all so clearly.'' To this day, Violeta Chamorro says, she does not know who ordered the assassination. ''I do not believe in the justice of Somoza or the justice of the Sandinistas,'' she says. But for the crowds that filled Managua's streets, the killing unleashed decades of frustration and anger, and for Mrs. Chamorro it was the fulfillment of a fate that she says she knew and understood.
''Pedro and I talked a lot about sadnesses and joys, and one of those sadnesses was death,'' she said. ''One day, when we had already said the rosary, he said to me, 'They're going to kill me, and you are going to have to take over the responsibilities.' And I told him, 'Oh no, Papacito, I want to go first, before you, because I don't want the responsibility. It's something that we can't know. It's the will of God.' ''
ON JULY 19, 1979, THE news photos riveted the world: triumphant Sandinista guerrillas rode into Managua on a vast, surging tide of supporters, claiming victory over a shattered, corrupt regime. Picture editors puzzled over the unfamiliar young man at the head of the five-member revolutionary junta, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, a scruffy, intense guerrilla commander with thick-frame glasses. But beside him rode a dark-haired woman whose name and face had already been made famous by tragedy.
In the chaotic months that followed her husband's murder, Violeta Chamorro and her family had become almost inevitably intertwined with the Sandinista guerrillas, who had no direct connection with Pedro Joaquin Chamorro but whose 18-year struggle was pushed to a denouement by his death. Mrs. Chamorro's eldest daughter, Claudia, and youngest son, Carlos Fernando, worked actively for the revolution. The Chamorro family pitched in with a $50,000 loan, never to be repaid. And Mrs. Chamorro agreed to lend her prestige to the cause.
''They told me that they needed me, they needed the name of my husband, and the name of La Prensa,'' she says. ''It wouldn't have been patriotic to refuse.''
But in the bare-knuckle politics of the revolutionary regime's first months in office, Mrs. Chamorro was soon relegated to an outsider's role. After nine months of bitter isolation, she left the Government, citing health problems, but privately accusing the Sandinistas of betrayal.
''It was going to be democratic, it was going to be pluralistic, but it turned out to be just the opposite,'' she says, in the broad strokes that are the trademark of her political conversation. ''It is a Marxist, Communist Government that has betrayed the Nicaraguan people.''
She objected to the Sandinistas' insistence on expanding their victorious army and their efforts to seize a dominant role in the emerging Council of State. But more than that, she rejected the new regime's entire approach to government. ''I remember when I was in the junta,'' she said, ''they were telling me, 'You have to cut coffee and take classes in Marxism.' But it would make more sense to pick up a book and study. Why cut coffee - just to put on a show?''
At the same time that Mrs. Chamorro resigned from the junta, disputes over coverage of Sandinista policy led to an open split at La Prensa. Outvoted by other members of the Chamorro family, Pedro Joaquin's brother, Xavier Chamorro Cardenal, and much of the paper's staff broke away to form an unabashedly pro-Government newspaper, El Nuevo Diario. Mrs. Chamorro became publisher of La Prensa, making her almost overnight the most visible and influential voice of opposition to the Government she had just left. ''I had never been a journalist,'' she says. ''But I had watched my husband for 27 years, and you learn through doing. We kept it going, holding on by our fingernails.''
La Prensa became an immediate target for Sandinista harassment and censorship, and amid growing tension between Nicaragua and the United States, the newspaper's battle to publish soon took on a far broader significance. Never more than a modest, tabloid-quality publication, La Prensa began receiving donations from a wide variety of foreign sources - though not, Mrs. Chamorro pointedly asserts, from the C.I.A. - and quickly became a cause celebre for Americans who charted each move against it as a barometer of Sandinista repression.
Yet the very prominence of Mrs. Chamorro's battle against the Sandinistas further divided her own family. Two of her children followed her into the opposition camp - her eldest son, Pedro Joaquin, who became editor of La Prensa, a position he eventually gave up to go into exile as a director of the American-backed contra rebels; and her daughter, Cristiana, perhaps fiercest of all the Chamorros in her opposition to Sandinista rule. But Mrs. Chamorro's two other children, Carlos Fernando and Claudia, remain firmly committed to the revolution they joined after their father's death.
Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a soft-spoken, cerebral man, has been one of the Sandinista Front's most respected voices since its first days in power. At age 23, he became head of the Department of Agitation and Propaganda and editor of the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada. Claudia joined him, serving first as the new Government's Ambassador to Costa Rica, then as a ranking diplomat alongside her husband, who is now Nicaragua's Ambassador to Spain.
Before the opposition named its candidate, there was speculation within Government circles that Carlos Fernando would be asked to step down as editor of Barricada if his mother were chosen. But he has silenced any criticism, overseeing an unflinching campaign of words against his mother's party. His uncle, Xavier, has done the same at El Nuevo Diario. Claudia, meanwhile, recently wrote an open letter in both papers denouncing her mother's political coalition.
''The U.N.O. brings together all of the political enemies of my father,'' she wrote. ''Those who have found refuge in it include the followers of the Somoza Government; the former members of the official and collaborationist opposition of the regime; the ex-members of the National Guard; the members of the pseudo-opposition who always opposed the libertarian ideas of my father and the integration of the united anti-Somoza opposition for which he fought so hard.''
Family members say that such pointed attacks have taken a profound toll on Mrs. Chamorro, who spent 27 years of her life knitting together the family that has now been unraveled by political factionalism. But the injury is felt equally by her pro-Sandinista children, who see her as playing a humiliating role in an American-engineered drama.
''I respect my mother as my mother,'' says Carlos Fernando, sipping coffee at the warehouselike offices of Barricada. ''But I think at this point she is being used as an instrument of American policy. My attitude would be very different if U.N.O. were an expression of a genuine national sentiment. But the U.N.O. campaign is financed and made possible by the United States.''
Accusations that Mrs. Chamorro's coalition is a puppet of the old Somoza dictatorship, the United States and the American-backed contra rebels have been the dominant theme of Sandinista press attacks against U.N.O. In the pages of Barricada, La Prensa is almost never called by name, but described as ''the newspaper of the National Guard,'' the Somoza dictatorship's army. ''U.N.O.'' is used interchangeably with ''contra,'' producing headlines such as ''U.N.O. Kills Four.''
The allegations have been reinforced by the fact that several leaders of the U.N.O. campaign, including Mrs. Chamorro's younger son, Pedro Joaquin, are former contra leaders. Such claims are also strengthened by the United States' own actions, including the involvement of the American Embassy in advising U.N.O. leaders, admissions by United States State Department officials that contra troops have reinfiltrated Nicaragua to dramatize their presence during the campaign, and the decision by Congress to appropriate $9 million for the Nicaraguan elections.
But even Sandinista supporters admit the picture can be overdrawn. The return of contra leaders to participate in a peaceful electoral campaign, they note, has long been advocated by the Sandinistas themselves as an alternative to the contra war. And as Mrs. Chamorro's campaign has come to overshadow contra activities, rebel leaders who remain outside the country have repeatedly discounted her importance, suggesting that the election is a Sandinista-created diversion to discredit that war.
Diplomats note that the American aid cannot be used for direct campaigning, and must be split among several purposes, including largely neutral functions of poll watching and the verification of registration lists. Moreover, under Nicaraguan law, money destined for U.N.O. must be split with the Government commission administering the vote, a provision that leaves only $1.8 million for Mrs. Chamorro's coalition.
The denunciations clearly irritate Mrs. Chamorro. ''I call it 'barricuda,' '' she says, referring to her son's newspaper. Yet, though they no longer talk politics, the mother and son still see each other regularly. Mrs. Chamorro invites Carlos Fernando to come home for lunch ''whenever his stomach starts growling.''
Among the children, too, private relationships have been preserved. When young Pedro Joaquin, as part of a contra delegation, traveled to Managua in the spring of 1988 for peace talks with the Government, he was allowed to cross the heavy cordon of Sandinista security police surrounding his hotel to spend an evening alone with his brother. And when Sandinista and contra leaders converged on Caracas last year to attend the inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, the Chamorros took the opportunity to hold their first family reunion in many years.
''The Sandinistas have tried to split families, to divide them psychologically, mentally, in their ideology,'' says Mrs. Chamorro. ''But I think that, deep inside, it is very difficult for those divisions to last. For that to happen, you would have to have hearts of stone.''
IN A GLASS-FACED CABINET in Mrs. Chamorro's study lies the cream-colored pullover her husband was wearing when three gunmen pulled alongside his car on a Managua street. A grieving maid washed out some of the blood, but jagged bullet holes left the garment little more than a pile of shreads. Next to it in the case are his sunglasses and billfold. And at the back of the house, restored and carefully covered with canvas, is the tan Saab Pedro Joaquin Chamorro was driving that morning 12 years ago.
In the worst years of the civil war that followed, with her children grown and on opposite sides of the country's deep political divide, Mrs. Chamorro's four-bedroom house was a portrait of a widow's loneliness. But the silence has now given way to the frenzy of a candidate's life. The once-quiet living room now springs alive in the drama and glare of televised news conferences, and the backyard fence gleams with coils of razor wire for security. A house next door has been rented as extra office space for Mrs. Chamorro, (Continued on Page 72) who since her knee injury in early January must let much of the campaign come to her. Day after day, a small parade of politicians, advisers, businessmen and journalists arrives to confer with the candidate, filing past a blue- and-white sidewalk wall that declares, in chest-high letters: ''Vote - Violeta - Victory.''
Before she was nominated, many opposition politicians and even family members doubted that Mrs. Chamorro could bear up well under the strain and exposure of a presidential campaign. But she has only seemed to flourish.
''She is a person with no political experience, and some thought this would be very difficult for her,'' says Virgilio Godoy Reyes, who lost the nomination to Mrs. Chamorro, then became her vice presidential candidate. ''But she is very effective at speaking with the people; she loves to be out in the crowds. Her enthusiasm has really surprised us.''
Even within her own campaign, few people are willing to predict how Mrs. Chamorro and the opposition will fare on Feb. 25. Although the economic situation is severe, the Sandinista Front retains a strong base of support, particularly among young people, and has benefited from public outrage over the American invasion of Panama. Opinion polls have produced uneven results, giving Mrs. Chamorro anywhere from a 20-point lead to a 40-point deficit. Many foreign experts believe the Nicaraguan people's reservations about expressing their true political views to outsiders may make even the most sophisticated election polls irrelevant.
But opposition and Sandinista officials agree that much of U.N.O's performance at the voting booth will hinge on Mrs. Chamorro alone. ''I keep marveling at how right they were to pick her,'' says one Western diplomat. ''No one knows how they will do with her. But everyone knows how they would do without her.''
In her transition to political life, Mrs. Chamorro has benefited greatly from the work of other anti-Sandinista politicians and intellectuals, who spent nearly two years developing the campaign platform. Among other measures, the plan calls for abolition of the military draft; an end to most Government economic controls; encouragement of private enterprise, and a program to give poor farmers full title to the Government-owned lands they now cultivate as state or cooperative farms.
The ready-made set of detailed propositions - worked out in dozens of drafts that circulated first clandestinely, then openly as the election process got under way - has helped Mrs. Chamorro deflect charges that she is unfamiliar with complex issues. But the fact that she played no part in formulating the party platform reinforces criticism that she is simply a mouthpiece for others - an image she finds irksome.
''It's not like the Sandinista Front goes around saying it is,'' she protests, bringing the subject up herself, ''with someone who is telling me 'say this, say that.' ''
Friends and opponents agree that Mrs. Chamorro is best at discussing broad themes, such as the country's exhaustion with war and a Sandinista ideology that she says is forced upon Nicaraguan children ''before they have even left the womb.''
''The people have been betrayed,'' she says. ''They want a change, and how can you blame them? It is because of this Government that we have this war, Nicaraguans against Nicaraguans, the exodus of our professionals, of journalists, of farmers, of everyone, because no one can bear to live here.'' ''The first thing I'm going to do,'' she says at another time, ''is abolish compulsory military service. Then, so that not even Mr. Gorbachev can get his hands on them, I'm going to send all of the weapons to the bottom of the sea.''
Mrs. Chamorro also frequently raises the issue opposition leaders consider their strongest: the country's economic crisis. Although Sandinista officials blame the decline on the war and the American trade embargo, U.N.O. hopes voters will reject the regime that has seen the Nicaraguan economy shrink by more than half since the revolution, cutting real wages to less than 10 percent of their former value and reducing private consumption by 70 percent.
But in interviews, the candidate shies away from most substantive questions, referring them to her advisers or saying that precise answers must wait until after an opposition victory. Asked about her policy on agrarian reform, a central concern in the Nicaraguan countryside, she says only that she will study the problem case by case and that she has a ''grupito de abogados,'' or little group of lawyers, working on it.
Even on crucial issues such as how to handle the contra army - which still maintains more than 3,000 guerrillas inside the country and 7,000 more in Honduran base camps - Mrs. Chamorro avoids direct comment. ''As far as I'm concerned, the contras have been stopped for a long time now,'' she says. ''I can't tell you anything about them because I don't know their leaders, but I understand that they are finished.'' Among the politicians, diplomats and reporters who deal with her frequently, Mrs. Chamorro is widely admired for her casual, motherly style of conversation, which quickly abandons the pretense of formal Spanish for the ''vos'' form, an intimate, antiquated form of address used only in Nicaragua and a handful of other Latin American countries. But she is also famous for slips of memory and language that sometimes leave her listeners agape.
''When they closed La Prensa,'' she says, ''they told us it was because we were supporting the war - when the President, the old one, what was his name? The one I've forgotten now, from the United States. . . .'' ''Reagan,'' an aide tells her. ''Reagan,'' she repeats, regaining her stride. ''When Reagan approved $100 million for the war. . . .''
Like Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, her campaign manager and son-in-law, many of Mrs. Chamorro's personal advisers are close friends or family members. The group also includes her son, Pedro Joaquin, and is led by Alfredo Cesar Aguirre, the former contra leader who is married to Lacayo's sister. But the members of the group have little direct connection with the elaborate 14-party coalition leadership that sponsored Mrs. Chamorro's candidacy. And many foreign diplomats and even U.N.O. officials believe that the combination of an inexperienced candidate and two powerful sets of competing advisers could create an explosive conflict of authority.
Sandinista leaders have publicly committed themselves to turning over the reins of government if they lose. But a victorious U.N.O. would still have to contend with the Sandinista's almost undisputed control over Nicaragua's large army and security apparatus.
The problems of finding a modus vivendi with a defeated Sandinista Front would only be compounded, the officials argue, by the continued existence of the contra army. Contra leaders have repeatedly said they will oppose any government in which the Sandinistas retain military power. The resulting collision of forces - the Sandinistas, the contras and the perpetual specter of a United States invasion - could tear a Chamorro regime apart.
For some of her supporters, the complexities of such a scenario argue for the very qualities that Mrs. Chamorro would bring to the job.
''This is precisely why Violeta became the candidate,'' says Francisco Mayorga Balladares, Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser and a respected opposition theorist. ''If you had a strong leader who represented very strongly a certain point of view, it would be a disaster, because this is a very fragmented society.''
But others in Mrs. Chamorro's campaign do not try to project beyond election day. ''Violeta wasn't chosen for her abilities as president,'' another opposition strategist says bluntly. ''Violeta was chosen to win.''
NOT FAR FROM MRS. epitaph: ''He never gave up.''
The cemetery is a riot of fallen stones and tangled weeds, held in check only by a work detail of convicts trucked in once a year from a prison on the edge of town. But a dozen years after her husband's death, Mrs. Chamorro still visits twice a week.
''She is very dedicated to him,'' says a watchman who has witnessed her ritual for years. ''You can't work here and not know her.''
In the election fever that has gripped Nicaragua, the cemetery is one of the few significant expanses of urban land not festooned with campaign flags, banners or slogans. But for Mrs. Chamorro - and for the opposition that supports her - the memories it holds will be decisive.
Under regional peace accords, there will be a massive international effort to supervise the fairness of the vote. By election day, some 450 observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States will be in place to oversee balloting. A distinguished group organized by former President Jimmy Carter has already visited three times to help resolve conflicts over the voting rules.
Politicians on all sides say that the Sandinistas' ability to deliver their supporters to the voting booths could be offset by an exceptionally high overall turnout of voters - perhaps reaching the level of voter registration last fall, when 90 percent of eligible Nicaraguans signed up to cast their ballots. But opposition leaders know that, finally, ballots must be cast for a candidate. And on election day, Mrs. Chamorro's strength will be decided not by the structure of her campaign, or even the fairness of the vote, but by the power of memory.
At the cemetery, the watchman, a middle-aged man whose skin has turned to leather from years in the sun, walks a visitor back to his waiting car.
''Pedro Joaquin Chamorro has been dead for many years,'' he says. ''But in times like these, people don't forget.'' As the visitor pulls away, the watchman turns back toward the thin iron cross. Then, with a gentle, almost reverent motion, he stoops to straighten the flowers on Mr. Chamorro's grave.

HEADLINE: SATURDAY NIGHT

BYLINE: By Susan Orlean: Susan Orlean is the author of ''Saturday Night in America,'' from which this article is adapted. The book will be published by Alfred A. Knopf in May.

 BODY:
SATURDAY NIGHT IS different from any other night. On Saturday night, people get together, go dancing, bowling, drinking, out to dinner, get drunk, get killed, kill other people, go out on dates, visit friends, go to parties, listen to music, sleep, gamble, watch television, go cruising, and sometimes fall in love - just as they do every other night of the week. But on Saturday night they do all these things more often and with more passion and intent. Even having nothing to do on Saturday night is different from having nothing to do on, say, Thursday afternoon, and being alone on Saturday night is different from being alone on any other night of the week. 
For most people Saturday is the one night that neither follows nor precedes work, when they expect to have a nice time, when they want to be with their friends and lovers and not with their bosses, employees, teachers, landlords, or relatives - unless those categories happen to include friends or lovers. Saturday night is when you want to do what you want to do and not what you have to do. In the extreme, this leads to what I think of as the Fun Imperative: the sensation that a Saturday night not devoted to having a good time is a major human failure and evidence of a possible character flaw. The particularly acute loneliness you can feel only on Saturday night is the Fun Imperative unrequited. But most of the time Saturday night is a medium of enjoyment.
For the last few years, I have traveled around the country and spent Saturday nights with a variety of people in a variety of situations, with the intention not to define Saturday night but to illustrate it. What I wanted to know about Saturday night was not so much what is fun to do with your spare time as what, given some spare time and no directives or obligations, people do.
DISTINGUISHING SATURDAY NIGHT FROM the rest of the week began around 700 B.C. with the introduction in Assyria of once-a-week ''evil days,'' and it has remained constant throughout human history, including but not ending with ''Saturday Night Fever.'' I don't know of anything else that has social significance spanning ancient Babylonia and Babylon, L.I.
The origin of Saturday night's distinctiveness was religious - one day each week set aside as sacred, to contrast with the six others that were profane - and over time became economic (a day of rest versus a day of labor). Before this century, days of rest were permitted mainly so that laborers could restore - ''recreate,'' in Victorian terms - their strength and then return to another six days of hard work.
Eventually, as affluence and easy credit spread through the American middle class after World War II, weekend ''recreation'' became an end in itself. Fun was viewed as an entitlement of the middle class rather than an exclusive right of the rich and elite. The satisfying life, after the war, included an imperative to have fun, and Saturday night was the center of it.
How is Saturday night different now from the past? There is no doubt that AIDS has quashed some of the abandon that Saturday night both symbolized and contained - not just in gay nightclubs, but in all bars and clubs and parties. There are other ways social behavior and Saturday night have changed in tandem. A sex researcher told me he believed many people used to have sex only on Saturday nights, in some cases because it was their only chance, and in others because an unconscious sense of guilt made them feel it was improper on ''regular'' nights of the week. He also ventured that having sex on Saturday night was titillating for some people because it was only hours before they would go to church. Sexual liberation, that researcher concluded, has probably changed that. Then there's the effect of indoor plumbing on Saturday night: when baths were once-a-week events at the neighborhood bath-house, Saturday had the distinction of being bath night for most people.
Saturday night happens to be when most people take part in whatever is the current entertainment trend. They might watch a break-dance contest one month, and a lip-synching contest the next, and a lambada-dance (Continued on Page 82) demonstration the one after that. I began to think of this aspect of Saturday night culture as the Palace of Social Meteors. Every city I've ever visited seems to have a bar or nightclub called the Palace, the local showcase for whatever the current public diversion happens to be. I made a practice of avoiding the Palaces and all study of Social Meteors. Bar life is certainly a constant of the American Saturday night, but the ancillary activities that take place in them, I'm convinced, are mostly new ways to get people to spend money on drinks, and their evanescence proves only that people get bored with the ways they keep busy in bars.
It's hard to think about Saturday night without realizing that chronological time itself is something of an anachronism these days. Schedules are less rigid now than in the past. When I was a kid, grocery stores closed at 6 and were never open on Sundays. I still remember the first time I went to a 24-hour grocery at 4 in the morning, thinking that something fundamental had changed forever. You used to be out of luck for money on the weekend if you didn't get to the bank by 3 on Friday. Now most people I know don't even know when banks are open because they use 24-hour automatic-teller machines. Most stores are now open every day, since blue laws were repealed.
The way we perceive time changed when the American economy shifted from agriculture to industry. On a farm, the significant unit of time is a season. On an assembly line, though, you're inside all the time and you work all year round and you have no interaction with the natural physical world, so seasons no longer matter. What matters is the week, and you know that if you're annoyed to be back at work, it's probably Monday, and if you just got paid and feel more cheerful, it's Friday, and if you're happy, it's the weekend.
Now, as manufacturing, with its regular hours and rigid schedules, is displaced by a service and high-tech economy that runs incessantly, night and day, the convention of the five-day work week and the two-day weekend is coming apart. Many workers have unusual schedules - swing shifts, night work, three-day weekends. They also have their pay deposited electronically, bank by phone, shop at midnight, and tape ''The Tonight Show'' and watch it at breakfast. The idea of having to get to a bank by 3 on Friday or to watch Johnny Carson at midnight seems, in the 1990's, nostalgic.
Murray Melbin, a sociologist at Boston University, recently wrote that we have run out of land to colonize, so we are now colonizing nighttime, operating businesses 24 hours a day and setting up services to obviate the importance of time. Many people work from their homes via computer work stations and modem hookups and don't have work schedules. Soon, the week as we know it won't mean anything. Some people see this as liberation. Other people - I'm inclined to include myself in this camp - think it sounds awful. Maybe it would eliminate the problems of getting to work on time, but that's only because it means you're at work all the time. And the more the structure of the week disappears, the less extraordinary and special Saturday night will be.
I am not an enthusiast of the seamless week. I think the Assyrians had it right when they decided it was comforting to divide infinity into comprehensible, repeating units of time with distinct qualities. In particular, I would consider losing the singular nature of Saturday night - one night set aside to be off-limits to obligations - kind of a shame.
NOT LONG AGO, I SPENT AN interesting Saturday night in Elkhart, Ind. I had gone there to write about a local imbroglio that pitted the mayor, a young man with conservative tastes, against a group of people who liked to spend their Saturday evenings cruising in fancy cars through downtown. The Mayor saw the issue as a traffic problem; the cruisers saw his efforts as an infringement on their inalienable right to have fun on weekends. I saw it as a chance to see how seriously people take Saturday night.
I arranged to meet the cruisers at 9 o'clock, so I could ride with them on Main Street. At 7, I went to an Italian restaurant someone had recommended. I hoped the restaurant would be a quiet hole-in-the-wall. It was not. It was the sort of place that attracts every birthday celebration, first date, last date, prom date, anniversary party, engagement celebration and stag party within a 200-mile radius. I am not unaccustomed to being alone in a crowd, but this was the first time in my life I had dined alone at a restaurant - let alone a restaurant preferred by big, ostentatiously convivial groups of people - on a Saturday night. It was a largely disagreeable sensation.
I noticed that I was being noticed by the people seated near me. I decided that the best defense was to look busy, but reading the label on the aspirin bottle in my purse took only a minute. Next, I read the menu. Then I turned to the place mat, which had only a photograph of a beach - I never thought I would see the day when I would miss place mats with puzzles on them. I wondered whether I could leave without being too obvious, and if I left, whether I could get a more secluded dinner somewhere else.
My musing was interrupted by my waitress, a tall woman with curly brown hair, a high forehead and a voice that could cut through dry wall. Her nametag said MARIAN. She greeted me and asked if I was meeting someone. I said I wasn't. ''Here on vacation?'' she asked. When I said I was in town doing work, she gave me a long look full of pity. At that point, all I wanted was to get a quick dinner and get out. Marian, however, dawdled. After she took my order, she tidied my place setting and filled my water glass. She checked my salt and pepper shakers. I began to suspect that in her eyes I was a statistical freak - in the area of customers, a Fourth of July snowstorm. Finally, she grabbed a waitress passing by, turned her so she could get a good look at me, and said in a loud, clear voice, ''Just look at her! My God! All by herself and working on Saturday night!''
After that dinner, and after I had gone cruising, I set out to see how Americans spend Saturday night. Is it regional? Is it a matter of age and marital status? Relative wealth? Urban versus suburban versus rural? Is there such a thing as a typical Southern Saturday night, or a middle-aged Saturday night, or a working-class Saturday night? Is there some place that has sprung up to replace the vanished town squares and bars and bowling alleys where people used to gather when they wanted to get together and had no particular place to go?
This task had a few challenges. For one thing, many people, including me, often spend Saturday night at home. For a reporter, this is a tough world to infiltrate. And judging by many of the Saturday nights I've spent this way, their pleasures are too self-referential to bear description. It is also true that in the era of disaster news, people have come to expect to be written about only when something exceptional takes place in their lives. Quite often, people would ask me to come back when the town was having its jazz festival or mariachi festival or rodeo. That wasn't what I was after. I had this notion that Saturday night itself was a good enough subject. I liked the contrariness of examining leisure in an era that is career-crazy, and average citizens in an era that celebrates celebrity.
There were a few things about Saturday night I wanted to figure out. For instance, even though Saturday night is itself a democratic occasion, I wondered if most people choose to spend it undemocratically - that is, to spend it around people just like themselves. Some Saturday night situations don't appear to have any social parameters. One Saturday night, I hung around the emergency room of a large veterinary hospital in New York City. I'd heard there were certain animal accidents (cats falling out of windows, especially) that seemed to happen mostly on Saturday nights, and I wanted to find out why. I also wondered whether there was any similarity to the people who ended up at such a place on Saturday night when they didn't have an emergency. Some flattened cats did come in (it was a hot night, and a lot of people had probably left their windows open) but there were also a lot of people who just chose that night to have their dogs' teeth cleaned or their sick parakeets put to sleep. Except for sharing a somewhat unconventional notion of pet care, these people apparently had nothing in common. The animal emergency center aside, I saw some white people at a black church social I went to, and some black kids and a few upper-middle class white kids hanging around the white, blue-collar cruising crowd in Elkhart. But generally, it seems that Saturday night acts as a subset intensifier.
THE POSSIBILITY OF A dateless, hourless, calendarless future notwithstanding, I was happy to discover that Saturday night still does have a distinct personality and effect on most people. People still act differently on Saturday night for no reason other than it's Saturday night. For instance, there are fewer long-distance calls made Saturday night than any other night of the week. What is it about Saturday night that inhibits the urge to make calls? Is it that so many people are out, or that those who happen to be at home assume that anyone they want to call is out? Or does it just feel weird?
On Saturday night, there are the fewest airplane flights, the most murders, most taped radio shows, fewest television viewers, most visits to the emergency room, fewest suicides, most scheduled showings of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' most people breaking their diets, most liquor sold by the glass, the fewest number of calls to businesses offering products on television, and the highest number of reported incidents of cow-toppling in rural Pennsylvania. These might at first seem like weird specifics - informational dead ends, like knowing that 75 percent of all Iowans think Scotch tape is the best modern invention - but they really add up to a picture of what Saturday night in America is like.
It is a time when people listen to prerecorded radio shows, are too busy to watch television, have accidents, don't feel like killing themselves, go out for the evening and forget to close their windows and own curious cats with bad depth perception, feel like seeing campy movies, are in the mood to eat with abandon, drink in bars, aren't in the mood to order the five-volume set of Slim Whitman's greatest hits or aren't home to fall victim to the ad, see cows sleeping in pastures and are inspired to tip them over just for fun. It's in keeping with what the Assyrians had in mind when they first established the seven-day week.
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS , while considering the nature of Saturday night, I have kept a clipping from The Chicago Tribune wire service over my desk, headlined: ''Leisure Time Shrinks By 32 Percent.'' The article says: ''Since 1973, the median number of hours worked by Americans has increased by 20 percent, while the amount of leisure time available to the average person has dropped by 32 percent. The difference between the rise in working hours and the drop in leisure time has been the time that people spend on work around the house and other responsibilities that do not qualify as work. The trend toward less and less leisure time has been steady and inexorable, according to a Harris Survey.''
If the law of supply and demand is universally true, the shrinking of leisure time could only serve to make Saturday night more valuable. In a world with 32 percent less leisure time, wouldn't a night imbued with pleasure and abandon remain an important and welcome tonic, no matter how irrelevant the conventional notion of time may come to be?
That equation seemed especially evident to me in Elkhart. It is a classic working-class town - more than half of its residents are employed at building, servicing, selling or outfitting recreational vehicles and customized vans - and the people I met there are probably among those Americans whose leisure time is shrinking the fastest. Accordingly, they considered Saturday night a matter of enormous consequence. ''The week is just something I get through until Saturday night,'' one man told me.
When Mayor James Perron banned cruising on Main Street, it set off three years of furious public debate. The superficial concern was traffic flow. What really got everyone roiled up was the idea that the city was legislating their leisure time. ''I'm a working man and I pay my taxes,'' the same man said, ''but no one's going to tell me how to spend my weekend. That's all mine.''
I also have posted over my desk something I found buried in a survey about leisure-time activity. It says: ''Fifty-four percent of those surveyed have sex at least once a week but ranked it below gardening and visiting relatives as regular activities.''
For a year or so, I didn't really know why I was so taken with this piece of arcane data except for its innate comic value. I went to spend Saturday night in a few dozen different places around the country. Time and time again I saw that Saturday night was indeed something special -a time when people are most at ease with themselves. Surveys and statistics of any sort began to seem less important once I realized that Saturday night is mostly mythic: larger than life, more meaningful the less closely it is examined, romantic in the purest way, more an idea than an event.
At last I figured out why that survey seemed to have a particular connection to my interest in Saturday night. According to the survey, most people have sex less often than they garden or visit their relatives, but I'm positive that they still consider sex the larger, more mystical, more mythic, more important, more noteworthy experience. That is how I finally feel about Saturday night. It is a matter of quality over quantity. If you add them up, there are many more weekdays in our lives than there are Saturday nights, but Saturday night is the one worth living for.

PUERTO RICANS
Born in the U.S.A.
By Clara E. Rodriguez.
218 pp. Boston: Unwin Hyman.
Cloth, $44.95. Paper, $14.95.
In ''Puerto Ricans,'' Clara E. Rodriguez, an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, calls for more studies of the Puerto Rican community, and answers her own call with this profile of Puerto Ricans living in the United States since the end of World War II. Her book is concerned primarily with New York City, until recently the home of the majority of Puerto Ricans on the mainland, and it generally presents a useful assemblage of information in a format readily accessible to a wide readership. 
Ms. Rodriguez concentrates on four topics - race, education, housing and work - treating these topics in the context of both Puerto Rican history (particularly the island's distinctive relationship to the United States) and the American economic and social structure. Her characterization of Puerto Ricans as a unicultural, multiracial, integrated group entering a multiethnic, biracial, segregated society is intriguing, and she draws helpful examples of this contrast from both literature and personal experience. She notes, for instance, that ''nearly every Puerto Rican has heard, at least once in his or her life, 'You don't look Puerto Rican.' The implication is that there is a Puerto Rican 'look' - although, given the racial diversity of Puerto Ricans, it is hard to tell what this would be.''
Embedded in the basic description of the Puerto Rican community are nuggets of information and distinctive perspectives that many readers are likely to find quite thought provoking. Puerto Rican family income is less than half that of white families, and about 70 percent of black family income, Ms. Rodriguez tells us. Moreover, she says, Puerto Rican workers are more heavily concentrated than either whites or blacks in the rapidly declining manufacturing sector. Even some native New Yorkers may not know that at the time of its decline, the South Bronx housed the city's largest Puerto Rican community.
The limitations of the book stem primarily from its introductory, essentially descriptive, character. Ms. Rodriguez does not provide the reader with much insight into the implications of the points she raises. For example, she suggests that ''Puerto Ricans see themselves as racially different from the way they are seen by others'' because of differing attitudes toward race in Puerto Rico and in the United States. The implications of this discrepancy for census and other data are considered at some length, but its possible effects on Puerto Rican individuals, families or communities are not explored. Similarly, the reader gets no help in thinking through the implications of these cultural differences for the persistence of residential segregation or for policies intended to reduce discrimination.
In fairness to the author, it must be recognized that some omissions can undoubtedly be attributed to the paucity of work on Puerto Ricans that Ms. Rodriguez has urged scholars to address. In light of the increasing importance of the Puerto Rican population in New York and of the Hispanic population nationally, this lack is striking. For this reason, Ms. Rodriguez's book makes a real contribution.

BUREAUCRACY
What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It.
By James Q. Wilson.
433 pp. New York: Basic Books. $24.95.
James Q. Wilson, always an innovator, has done it again. Most academics hope that their students and colleagues will someday honor them through a Festschrift - a collection of articles or essays contributed by a number of authors in honor of a colleague or teacher. Mr. Wilson, now a professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles, has turned the practice on its head. This study of the behavior of government agencies draws on the work of his students over a quarter-century. Mr. Wilson honors them by writing a volume that rests on the books, articles, doctoral dissertations and seminar papers completed by his graduate students, mostly at Harvard. 
As he notes in the preface, his is ''a book filled with details about police departments, school systems, the CIA, the military, the State Department, regulatory commissions, the Postal Service, the Social Security Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest Service, and many others.'' It is dense - weaving a mountain of findings from empirical work around a classic set of organizing themes: the purposes of organizations, the individuals who staff them (whom he calls operators, managers and executives) and the contexts in which they work.
Mr. Wilson uses the findings to show bureaucracy as a complex and varied set of institutions, not the monolith it seems in the classic work of the German sociologist Max Weber. It is the complexity, Mr. Wilson argues, that helps to explain the behavior of bureaucrats. They are not individuals who are uncontrolled or gone awry. Rather, they are people who are behaving in response to the incentives, punishments, rules, laws and organizational structures that make up our public agencies.
''Only two groups of people deny that organization matters'' according to Mr. Wilson, ''economists and everybody else.'' Economists believe that organizations are black boxes that convert inputs into outputs; noneconomists argue that only people in organizations - not the organizations themselves - matter. Indeed, organizations transform the individuals within them. The tendency of bureaucrats to become averse to risk is not accidental. ''All organizations by design are the enemies of change . . . government organizations are especially risk averse because they are caught up in a web of constraints so complex that any change is likely to rouse the ire of some important constituency.''
While many of these arguments are not new, Mr. Wilson presents them economically. He writes that three key constraints affect public bureaucracies: inability to keep the earnings of the organization; inability to allocate the resources in accord with the preferences of the organization; and lack of control over the choice of goals. These constraints in turn limit efficiency; as a society we value political equity, accountability and authority, and have been unwilling to cede them to anyone, let alone unelected bureaucrats.
Mr. Wilson reminds us that legislators judge government programs differently from the way they judge government bureaucracies (an observation that helps to understand the Congressional propensity for ''micromanagement''). He identifies four kinds of agencies (he calls them production, procedural, craft and coping organizations) and uses this typology to comment on differences among their activities.
Despite this clear conceptual framework, at times ''Bureaucracy'' raises more questions than it answers. Problems are created by Mr. Wilson's determination to integrate so many diverse sources of information. Much of the research work that is the basis for the book focuses on one organization at a time and does not lend itself to an aggregate approach. It does not provide the basis for a real understanding of why this agency seems to work well and that one does not.
Further, Mr. Wilson's reliance on his own earlier work on regulation appears to contradict other findings included here. His discussion of the arbitrary and rigid use of rules sometimes seems to be overdrawn; he does not differentiate between types of rules (between substantive and procedural rules, for example) but, rather, he is critical of rules per se. He seems to believe that government in the United States has reached its maximum size, commenting that ''almost every agency one can imagine already has been created.'' This fixed view of American society is not credible, particularly in light of Mr. Wilson's own analysis of the relationship between bureaucracy and political culture.
In an interesting chapter called ''National Differences,'' he argues that politics and culture explain the differences between bureaucracies administering similar policies in the United States and several European countries. Although his discussion of the distinctive character of the American bureaucracy is convincing as far as it goes, it fails to relate these observations to the special demands on public agencies that are created by the heterogeneity, size and diversity of the American population itself. Large federal systems - such as those found in Canada or India - might serve as a more useful point of comparison.
The book concludes with a defense of bureaucracy. Mr. Wilson comments that we live in a country where Social Security checks arrive on time, where institutions operate, letters get delivered, passports are obtained in a week. He notes that ''there are not many places where all this happens. It is astonishing it can be made to happen at all.''
But missing from ''Bureaucracy'' is an analysis that helps the reader to understand why the ''bash the bureaucracy'' movement has reached epidemic proportions around the world. The National Commission on the Public Service, headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, reported last spring that despite the enormously important work to be done, the public sector has ''been clouded by a sense of frustration inside government and a lack of public trust outside.'' The 1988 Presidential political campaign had already indicated a willingness by both candidates to address these perceptions. One wishes that Mr. Wilson had focused more directly on them as well.

No Joy, but Also No Panic in Florida

BYLINE: By DAVID PITT

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 10

 BODY:
There is no joy in Port St. Lucie, 109 miles north of here.
Nor, for that matter, is there much to speak of in Kissimmee, Yuma, Plant City, Mesa, Dunedin or any of the 25 communities in Florida and Arizona that would normally be awaiting the arrival of the 26 major league baseball teams for spring training, that magical solstice that revitalizes local economies and winter-benumbed fans alike.
On the other hand, there is no widespread panic either, despite Friday's reaffirmation by the baseball owners that they still planned to keep camps closed until a new labor agreement is reached with the players.
For one thing, a settlement was still theoretically possible in advance of the officially scheduled opening of the training camps next Friday.
For another, many businessmen and officials in some spring training communities -there are 17 in Florida (with two teams in West Palm Beach) and eight in Arizona - remained cautiously optimistic this week that they could weather the losses, even if the whole exhibition season was lost. 
But in a handful of smaller towns, such as those in Florida that lack beaches, dog tracks, jai alai emporiums, alligator farms, parrot jungles and other alternative attractions, spring baseball provides almost exclusively for their tourist-season dollars, and the mood this week was gloomy.
In Winter Haven, the inland Florida bastion of the Boston Red Sox, 218 miles north of Miami, most residents' yearly earnings mainly come out of two things: the citrus industry and spring baseball, neither of which look particularly prosperous enterprises at the moment.
Last month, a record cold snap froze much of the county's fruit and vegetable crop, a disaster that caused an estimated $600 million in losses statewide and hurt hundreds of people among Winter Haven's 25,000 residents.
''A lot of our local employees were already reeling because of the freeze, and it'll just be terrible if spring training is canceled,'' said Henry Philpot, general manager of the 325-unit Holiday Inn, which has set aside 75 rooms for the regular Red Sox players and almost as many for the minor leaguers.
The hotel is also counting heavily on two Boston-area travel agencies, which traditionally fly in scores of dyed-in-the-wool Red Sox fans.
''This is the time of year that a waitress who makes $2.01 an hour is going to be getting extra tips for six or eight weeks, money she really needs this year, especially if her husband works in the groves,'' Philpot said. ''Plus we hire extra people and give out overtime, and all of that is money that folks here have come to depend on year after year.''
''We did a definitive study a few years back showing the economic impact of having the Red Sox here, and it was $8 million to $10 million a year,'' said Joyce B. Davis, executive vice president of Winter Haven's Chamber of Commerce. ''We have not assessed what the impact would be this year if they didn't come, but certainly it will be significant.''
In Dunedin, Fla. (population 35,000), the Gulf Coast winter home of the Toronto Blue Jays, apprehension is also beginning to grow, especially since the town just spent $2.2 million on a new stadium and was counting on income from this season's exhibition games to start paying off the bonds.
Officials say the town stands to lose $300,000 in the event of a six-week lockout, although their contract with the Blue Jays includes guarantees that would eventually allow Dunedin to recover direct losses. But that won't help the groceries, hardware stores and other small businesses that will lose income they have come to rely on during the winter.
 
Reduction in Revenue Seen
Moreover, Pat McGarr, executive vice president of the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce, predicted that local hotels and motels, most of which remain totally booked for now, face at least a 50 percent reduction of income if a lockout sparks a wave of cancellations.
It could mean devastation for Dunedin's season, McGarr said.
But in large cities like Miami (Baltimore Orioles territory), Phoenix (Oakland Athletics), West Palm Beach (Montreal Expos and Atlanta Braves), many business people, especially hotel and restaurant operators, say that while die-hard fans will be emotionally devastated by a spring-training lockout, they fully expect that throngs of Northerners will still find reasons to leave the snow and slush.
Even in some smaller places, like Port St. Lucie, home to the Mets and more than 16,000 year-round residents, many people saw little reason for despair.
''It probably won't hurt us much at all economically, after all, it's Florida and it's wintertime,'' said Joanne Bovee, sales director of the Radisson Hotel in Port St. Lucie, an Atlantic Coast community where the Mets have been working out their preseason kinks since 1987, when they moved from St. Petersburg.
''The fans will be disappointed, of course, and some of the smaller businesses here will be hurt,'' she said. ''But this is the height of the season, so we would fill up anyway. There's always the beach, you know.''
 
A Matter of Big Business
Florida's Department of Commerce estimates that spring training is worth about $330 million a year, much of that in money spent by the teams, as well as in ticket sales, hot dogs, beer, souvenirs, pregame and postgame bar receipts, hotel and restaurant costs, rental cars and everything else under the sun that goes with baseball's annual rebirth. Others argue that if they could add in all the incalculable losses, such as free baseball-related publicity for tourism, the figure would be far higher.
But the $330 million generated by spring training, Florida officials are quick to note, is a drop in the ocean compared to the nearly $30 billion that tourists spend in the state each year.
On top of that, lockout or no lockout, the minor league teams are still coming to places like Port St. Lucie, and their money is just as good. While the Radisson, the team hotel for the Mets, has set aside 30 rooms for the regular players, it is holding 80 rooms for the minor leaguers.
''And they eat breakfast and dinner here, too, so that's quite a good revenue for us,'' a spokeswoman said.
 
Less Effect in Fort Lauderdale
In Fort Lauderdale, where the Yankees have been loosening up every winter since 1963, the effects of a lockout are likely to be even more negligible, said James Vance, an official of the city's Chamber of Commerce.
''It's not going to have quite the economic impact here that it might have in other parts of the state,'' Vance said, noting that Fort Lauderdale, like many parts of Florida, still has plenty of tourist appeal even without spring baseball. And the traditional spring-break invasion of college students is looming.
According to a Florida study two years ago, of the nearly $300 million generated by spring training in 1986, the 18 teams that winter in Florida spent $11.9 million for food, housing and transportation.
Fans, on the other hand, spent $282.6 million, plus $3.4 million buying tickets, peanuts, hot dogs and so forth at the 17 stadiums around the state.
Officials say most of the 1.3 million people who watched Grapefruit League games last year were either Florida residents or out-of-state people who planned their vacations around baseball.
 
Canadians Expected Anyway
Many Florida businessmen and officials say that while many people may cancel their vacations in the event of a lockout - large numbers of St. Louis Cardinal fans, for example, may decide not to make the yearly drive from Missouri to St. Petersburg - there is one group of visitors that is virtually certain to show up in Florida, no matter what: Montreal Expos fanatics from snow-bound Quebec.
Between the Quebecois rooters and the Atlanta Braves fans, who share the same stadium, officials in the Expos' headquarters of West Palm Beach think that spring training generates at least $30 million a year, but that if it is canceled, the Canadians, at least, will still be in town.
''If you live in Quebec, and you've been coming here for 30 days a year for six years to watch the Expos and get away from that weather, would you seriously consider canceling your trip?'' asked Dennis Grady, executive director of the West Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce. ''No way. You're going to look outside at the snow, and say, 'Well, I may not get to see any baseball, but I'm going to be at the beach and I'm going to play a lot more golf.' ''
''But what's a guy going to do sitting in Lakeland waiting for the Detroit Tigers?'' Grady added. ''Go to the corner, watch the light change? There's no beach to go to there.'' He paused.
''Sorry, I've got nothing against Lakeland,'' he said. ''Maybe I said that because I'm a Cleveland Indians fan getting in a shot at the Tigers.''

Facing Spawning Challenges

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant

 BODY:
The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans faces a double challenge created by dwindling stocks of Atlantic cod and severely depleted spawning runs of Atlantic salmon in many of Newfoundland's rivers.
As early as last September, the Canadian-American Atlantic Salmon Federation, which is the largest salmon conservation organization in North America, and its regional affiliate, the Salmonid Council of Newfoundland and Labrador, were asking the department for a five-year closing of Newfoundland's commercial net fishery for salmon. At the same time, another organization, the Salmon Preservation Association for the Water of Newfoundland, asserted that the federal government's inadequate management plan for the commercial harvest of salmon had resulted in ''nothing less than a total rape of the resource at the expense of our salmon rivers and this province's economy.''
The federation has long been asking for a reduction in Newfoundland's commercial harvest of salmon, maintaining, among other things, that many of the nets are set in locations that result in interception of significant numbers of salmon bound for the rivers of other provinces and New England. 
Last year, natural causes erased most of that problem. Lack of rain in Newfoundland resulted in large numbers of salmon milling about in river estuaries waiting for enough water to begin their upstream spawning runs. The netters focused on those stalled legions of Newfoundland fish, and in many locations, particularly along the province's south coast, only a few salmon escaped the nets and moved upriver to spawn. This also devastated the sport fishery in those streams.
Canada has an Atlantic Salmon Advisory Board appointed by the minister of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The board's membership embraces three user groups, commercial and sport fishermen and native (Indian) bands.
In January 1989, the first year after the termination of Canada's five-year management plan for Atlantic salmon, the advisory board met in Montreal to discuss a second five-year plan. Of that meeting, said David Clark, who is president of the Atlantic Salmon Federation and that organization's representative on the board, ''the debate between the user groups was less acrimonious than it had been in the past.'' He added that the commercial fishermen seemed somewhat resigned to a reduction of their salmon harvest in Newfoundland.
''We felt, after private discussions with senior public servants and politicians, that we were going to succeed in getting quotas imposed on the commercial salmon fishery and all that was left for debate was the level of those quotas,'' he said of the sport fishing interests.
A few weeks later, Clark said, the Canadian Government announced that it was reducing the commercial take of cod in an effort to rebuild depleted stocks. This move created a furor, he added, with commercial fishermen blaming the Government for overstating the health of those stocks through the 70's and early 80's and for allowing the fishery to expand during that period.
Having been obliged, Clark said, to further restrict the cod fishery, ''the Government didn't have the stomach to give the commercial fishermen a double dose of bad medicine and did virtually nothing about salmon.''
Fishing, whether for cod or salmon, is vitally important to Newfoundland's depressed economy.
The government did set an allowance of 1,400 metric tons for the Newfoundland commercial salmon fishery. This was not an enforceable quota, but that proved academic because the actual take was only 930 metric tons. Over the last decade, the production of salmon in the rivers of Labrador and Newfoundland has been in decline, and for the last three years that decline has accelerated. This has taken place even though the goal of the first five-year plan was to stabilize, or even increase, Atlantic salmon populations throughout the Atlantic provinces.
The salmon shortage, said Clark, ''has resulted in Newfoundland's sport fishing interests coalescing under the leadership of Tom Humphrey of Grand Falls.'' Humphrey is president of the Salmonid Council.
There are 26,000 domestic salmon anglers in Newfoundland and 3,500 commercial fishermen with salmon licenses. It is estimated, said Clark, that the latter are taking more than 90 percent of the annual harvest.
Late last November, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans convened a workshop under the chairmanship of Wayne Shinners, one of its deputy ministers, in Newfoundland to hear what residents had to say about the condition and management of its salmon resource. A one-year moratorium on salmon fishing was discussed. Clark said that Indian groups indicated that they would support whatever was necessary to restore the salmon stocks. The commercial fishermen said that if they were not allowed to fish, anglers should be similarly restricted.
Shinners's department has announced another reduction in the cod quota for this year, and, he said, there will probably be additional cuts in 1991 and 1992. The smaller quotas have already created hardships for commercial fishermen, he says, and adds that major fish processing plants employing thousands of workers are scheduled to be closed.
Commercial fishermen have long been aware that cod stocks are dwindling, Shinners said, adding that their immediate concern is how the harvest will be allocated between the inshore small boat fleet and the big blue water trawlers. The reduced cod quotas have, Shinners said, made dealing with the salmon problem doubly difficult, in part because many commercial cod fishermen also hold licenses to net salmon.
Nonetheless, Skinner added that he has every expectation that additional steps will be taken this year to protect the salmon, whether river-by-river or river zone harvesting, enforceable quotas, or even, perhaps, a one-year moratorium on commercial salmon fishing with the netters being compensated for loss of income.

BASEBALL FINANCE SETS A GALL STANDARD

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
In international finance, gold was always the standard. But in baseball finance, gold and glory always combined to set the standard. Once upon a time, Babe Ruth signed an $80,000 contract with the Yankees in 1930, right after the Wall Street crash. As the President of the United States that year, Herbert Hoover was being paid $75,000. And when the Babe was asked if he thought he deserved to be making more money than the President, he supposedly replied:
''Why not? I had a better year than he did.''
But now baseball finance has a new standard. Call it the gall standard. The gall of the club owners. By proposing revenue sharing, a pay-for-performance scale and a salary cap in the current labor negotiations with the players, the club owners have the gall to try to bank even more profits by restructuring the system in which they are prospering as never before. 
Don't fret that the season is in jeopardy. Even if the spring training camps don't open on time, the season will. The owners might be stubborn, but they're not that stupid.
Not that the players aren't part of the problem. In creating labor unions in this nation more than a century ago, Samuel Gompers did not have multimillion-dollar baseball players in mind. But there's too much money in baseball now for either side to be too rigid in its demands. The players aren't struggling for a living wage. The club owners won't go out of business if the current system is retained.
After all, the current system has produced the symbol of baseball's gall standard: Pascual Perez, a 32-year-old right-handed pitcher who has a three-year, $5.7 million contract with the Yankees.
But the club owners, after having knighted nine players with annual salaries of more than $3 million in the last few months, want to negotiate an economic structure that will protect them from themselves. They want a system that will prevent them from guaranteeing somebody like Pascual Perez $5.7 million for three years, especially when Perez doesn't guarantee anybody anything but a jar of headache tablets.
Perez has emerged as the gall standard's classic example of extravagance without excellence. Here is a pitcher with a history of drug and alcohol problems who had a 9-13 record with the Montreal Expos last season. Considering his past, a 9-13 record might jeopardize his career. Instead, George Steinbrenner bestowed $5.7 million upon him.
Don't blame Perez. If the Yankees and their principal owner were dumb enough to offer him that much money, he was smart enough to accept it. As he has explained, ''The reason I jump to New York is simple: they pay.'' And now he can afford to pay for a chauffeur. When he pitched for the Atlanta Braves, he once drove around the interstate highways circling the stadium there for an hour before stopping to ask directions.
Perez's contract has been the measure of just about every player's new contract, or at least every pitcher's. If a 9-13 pitcher is worth a three-year, $5.7 million contract, what's a good pitcher worth? Even crazier, what's an even worse pitcher worth?
Not that the Yankees have been the only team signing players for more than they are worth. Much more. But the club owners can't spend so much money on so many journeymen players and expect the players union to allow them suddenly to decide to be thrifty.
Not when total revenue for the 26 major league clubs was at least $1 billion in 1988, the last year for which figures are available. Not when television rights and ticket prices keep rising. And not when the club owners twice were found guilty by arbitrators of collusion in ignoring the availability after the 1985 and 1986 seasons of such outstanding free agents as Tim Raines and Jack Morris, to name two. A charge of collusion after the 1987 season has yet to be ruled upon.
Ever since salaries began soaring in the free-agent era after the 1976 season, the feeling here has been that players and pitchers who produced were not only worth whatever salary they could command but also were a financial bargain to their club owners.
In the beginning, Reggie Jackson and Rich (Goose) Gossage, among other free agents, were not the only reason the 1977-78 Yankees were the last franchise to win the World Series in two consecutive seasons, but they also contributed to Yankee Stadium attendance records. Since then, the Mets won the 1986 World Series with such high-salaried attractions as Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez. Because of Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield, the Yankees continued to attract two million spectators. And now Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics and Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants are selling tickets in the Bay Area.
But in the process, somehow the salaries of journeymen ballplayers rose as proportionately as those of the best players.
In other areas of entertainment, that has never been true. At a Frank Sinatra concert, he gets the big money but the violinists don't. In a Jack Nicholson motion picture, he gets the big money but other actors don't. In baseball, however, most of the violinists and the other actors, alias a light-hitting second baseman or a useful middle-inning relief pitcher or a 9-13 starter such as Pascual Perez, are millionaires, too.
That's where the club owners never held the line on salaries. The union and the agents outsmarted them. Now the club owners want a system that will minimize the value of agents. The club owners have only themselves to blame, but they're trying to blame the union.
Of all the sports in America, baseball has a reputation as the most romantic. But a labor dispute is a reminder that, for its fans, baseball is a romance of unrequited love. And undetermined expense. When baseball's new collective-bargaining agreement is finally signed, the fans will eventually pay for all the increases in costs and salaries.
That too is part of baseball's new gall standard.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Security Guards: New Position at Camps

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
On page 3 of the memorandum telling the clubs not to open spring training camps until otherwise notified, the heads of the owners' negotiating team wrote: ''Major league training camps shall remain closed during the duration of any labor dispute and the P.R.C. will arrange for a security service to guard all spring training camps 24 hours a day during the labor dispute.''
On first reading, that statement could be taken to mean that the Player Relations Committee wants to make sure that players don't sneak into spring stadiums in Florida and Arizona on their own during a lockout and use the clubs' facilities. The P.R.C., however, wants to make sure that the clubs don't sneak players in.
Scott Sanderson understands the purpose of the guards, but he wonders if their presence would make a symbolic statement.
''Does it suggest that the owners don't trust each other?'' asked Sanderson, the Oakland pitcher who is also a member of the players' negotiating committee. ''Does it mean they're concerned about getting a jump on each other by conducting illegal workouts?'' 
After posing the questions, Sanderson linked the thought to the players' mistrust of the owners based on their labor experiences in the 1980's.
''If that is the case,'' he said, ''that suggests to me that one team can't trust another about starting practice and they're asking us to trust them. It adds a little more skepticism.''
The guards will very likely take up their positions Thursday. No spring workouts are scheduled until Friday, but Thursday is the technical reporting date for pitchers and catchers. The P.R.C. has said that any players who have been working out on their own at their teams' facilities in Florida and Arizona will not be permitted in the parks beginning Thursday if the owners and players don't have a new collective-bargaining agreement.
Sanderson has raised his views about the security guards with Charles O'Connor, P.R.C. general counsel. O'Connor doesn't deny the reason for the guards, but he thinks Sanderson takes it too far in assessing ''trust.''
''We want to assure everybody that everybody is playing by the same rules,'' the owners' chief negotiator said. ''It's the competitive side of baseball. I told him to take it to its logical conclusion. It's like the N.C.A.A. or a high school athletic association would do. It's de rigueur.''
O'Connor alluded to college and high school rules about such matters as beginning preseason practice.
''He thinks it's making a point,'' the lawyer added, ''but it only has to do with when you can open training, when you can bring players in. That's what it's about.''
 
Owner Strategy Puzzles Miller
 Marvin Miller sits on the sidelines and wonders what it's about - the lockout, that is. Miller, during whose union tenure salary arbitration and free agency were created, is puzzled by the owners' bargaining strategy and wonders what is really behind it.
On one hand, he speculated that the owners, despite their stated intention of improving labor relations, are out to break the union. (Of the idea of improving relations, Miller recalled his first meeting with Ray Grebey, the negotiator whom the owners dismissed after the 50-day strike in 1981. ''He said his primary aim was to improve the relationship,'' Miller related of the man the players came to view as a would-be union-buster.) But as he continued thinking out loud, Miller offered another, more intriguing speculative view of the P.R.C. motives.
''Maybe the lockout is aimed at the 'have' owners,'' Miller said.
He meant the ones whose revenue is significantly greater than that of most of the clubs and who spend much more lavishly, the Yankees and the Angels, for example. The Yankees, the epitome of a ''have'' team, have a local television deal that will pay them $485 million over 12 years. George Steinbrenner, however, is firmly opposed to a greater degree of revenue sharing among owners than already exists.
Miller offered this possible reasoning by the owners: ''We can't get you to agree to share local television. You threaten to sue if we take it by legislation. Since we can't get it from you, we have to use the players.''
A lockout, Miller noted, would affect the ''have'' teams first and most. If they lost games that were to be televised, they would lose significant local television revenue. If those owners, on the other hand, were to offer to share that local revenue with the ''have-nots,'' the owners wouldn't have to go to the players with their revenue-sharing plan and they would have no need of a lockout.
 
A Peculiar Relationship
 As the American League player representative, Paul Molitor, the Milwaukee Brewers' third baseman, is an important member of the players' labor negotiating team. As chairman of the Player Relations Committee, Bud Selig, the Brewers' owner, is an important member of the owners' bargaining team.
''It's made it somewhat peculiar, to say the least,'' Molitor said. ''There's enough respect there that I don't think it would cross the border of friendships that have been established. Yes, we are on different courses in that room, but once we're out of the room, we can continue our relationship. I'm not concerned for our relationship. It just makes it somewhat strange.
''When you have a problem, whether it's about a player or your organization, you call Bud. He's a good sounding board.''
Molitor related that after a negotiating session in Tampa, ''we hopped on a plane together and flew back. We had a chance to review what happened. We had a chance to exchange ideas on revenue sharing.''
 
Relief Pitchers' Bonanzas
 Relief pitchers, as a group, have fared remarkably well in personal negotiations this winter. Mark Davis, a free agent, led the economic parade out of the bullpen with a four-year, $13 million contract from Kansas City. Then came the three-year deals: John Franco of the Mets, $7.6 million; Jeff Reardon of Boston, $6.8 million; Dan Plesac of Milwaukee, $6.5 million; Tim Burke of Montreal and Jeff Russell of Texas, $6.3 million each, and Roger McDowell of Philadelphia, $6 million.
Dennis Eckersley of Oakland is entering the last year of a three-year contract worth $2,387,500 in salaries (he has earned $350,000 more in bonuses). His salary for 1990 is $787,500. Eckersley has been the best of the relief pitchers for the last three years.
Ed Keating, Eckersley's agent, took seven categories and 16 relievers and determined that Eckersley's average rank based on three-year statistics is 2.43. Closest to him is Plesac at 3.71.
Eckersley ranks first in four categories: baserunners per inning (0.87), opponents' batting average (.204), strikeouts-to-walks ratio (7.7 to 1) and total walks (31). The right-hander, who walked only three batters in 57 innings last season, is third in saves (94), fourth in strikeouts per inning (.97) and sixth in earned run average (2.49).
It sounds as if Keating is preparing a salary arbitration case, but the statistics are aimed at the contract extension Eckersley will soon have from the Athletics.
''They said they are going to do something,'' Keating said. ''They have already agreed to do so. I haven't sent them any numbers. I'm waiting until everyone is done. They said they would do something in spring training. We said we don't want to start the season without it. We're not saying it in a threatening way. Sandy Alderson is good people. We just want Dennis to be protected.''
Alderson, the Athletics' general manager, was in a similar position with an underpaid Dave Stewart and gave him a two-year extension for $7 million earlier this winter. As Stewart did, Eckersley will most likely receive a large signing bonus to take care of his relatively low 1990 salary and will get hefty salaries for two more years.
 
Applying Lockout Language
 Tom Henke would like to join that parade of relief pitchers, but the Toronto Blue Jays seem to be heading toward arbitration with him Wednesday rather than signing him to a three-year contract. Actually, Henke had agreed to a $7.3 million contract, but the deal fell apart over lockout language.
Henke wanted protection against a possible lockout in 1991, just in case this year's labor dispute somehow became next year's. But the Blue Jays declined to accept one of three proposals made by the pitcher's agent, Craig Fenech: apply the lockout language only to this year, flip-flop the 1990 and 1991 salaries if there were no lockout this year but one next year or, if there were a lockout next year, take $1.9 million of his proposed 1991 salary of $2.6 million and pay it out as a deferred signing bonus.
Henke has told the Blue Jays he will leave as a free agent after the coming season if they do not sign him to a three-year contract. If he leaves, perhaps he can lead a whole new parade next winter.
 
1-13 Good for $660,000
 Pitching for Atlanta and Montreal, Zane Smith went through last season with only one victory. He lost 13 games. Last week the Expos signed him for $660,000 for the coming season. That's a raise of $135,000, or 25.7 percent, just a little more than the cost-of-living increase.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Two-Families in Bushwick;
Widening the Paths to For-Sale Housing

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, where other news lately has been grim, something of a home-building resurgence is under way. It has demonstrated that even in one of the poorest sections of the city there are people of moderate means willing and able to invest thousands of their own dollars in a new house.
That, in turn, calls attention to the entire for-sale component of the city's 10-year housing plan, which began in 1985. What started as a program to build one- or two-family homes for buyers typically with incomes from about $25,000 to $50,000 has widened into an effort to achieve impressive figures on housing production. That can only be done with multifamily construction.
The shift raises two key questions: Will city government will be able to assist middle-income production while holding the subsidy-per-unit within reasonable bounds? And are the undoubted benefits worth the significantly greater risks of multifamily development? 
Various models have been considered, all with attendant difficulties. The administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins will no doubt find itself wrestling with the issues.
An example of the two-family option is the completed development called Bushwick Estates - 49 two-family houses on George Street, off the commercialized Wilson Avenue. The location was a dreary pocket of little-used territory not far from Bushwick's substantial industrial buildings, many of them nearly vacant. It is also close to the Morgan Avenue station on the L subway line.
Four blocks away Maria Hernandez was killed by a gunshot through the window of her house last August, apparently in reprisal for the vigorous campaign she and her husband had been waging against drug dealers. In the same neighborhood, 14-year-old Jose Luis Lebron was killed on Jan. 31 by a police officer who was investigating a robbery and mistakenly thought the boy was armed. Five days before that, another teen-ager, Louis Liranso, was also shot and killed by a police officer.
BUT an affordable new house exercises a powerful appeal, notwithstanding the community's considerable concern, in particular, over drug traffic.
Bushwick Estates brought forth buyers such as Alfredo Mora, a welder who was born in Ecuador, and his wife, Buenaventura, a nurse and graduate of Hunter College. They have an infant son, and Mr. Mora's mother and sister have moved into the apartment on the first floor. Half the other owners on George Street also rented to relatives. ''We saved for four years,'' said Mrs. Mora. They put $13,000 of their savings into their house at contract time and about $6,000 more a year later, in November, for closing costs. The rent they receive helps offset their $1,140 monthly housing cost. The price of the house was $132,000.
The cost to build the houses averaged $173,400, figuring a zero land cost. The average public subsidy was $40,000 a house, or $20,000 a unit.
The Ridgewood-Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, the marketing agent for the houses, had 200 qualified applicants from Bushwick for the houses. Those who had to be turned away are on the list for future Bushwick developments. The developer was the New York City Partnership, which spent five years - from 1983 to 1988 - getting the city-owned land into construction, mainly because it was difficult to find bank financing and a builder in that location.
The Beechwood Organization of Williston Park, L.I., which did the job, was the only eligible respondent when the Partnership's invited builders to take it on. The architect of the buff-brick houses, trimmed with white aluminum siding, is the firm of Fakler & Eliason of Fresh Meadows, Queens.
Beechwood is a partnership of Lesie Lerner, an architect, and Michael Dubb, a landscape architect. They have built houses in East Meadow, North Hills, Great Neck and New Hyde Park on Long Island, but they found it good business to take on steady work in Bushwick with an assured market and a profit, when they hold within budget, of 10 percent on each house.
FOR security, they fenced in their entire construction site before they began, with spiral razor wire above the eight-foot barrier. ''The last thing that happened is that we took the fence down,'' said Mr. Lerner.
Beechwood provided touches not always seen in assisted housing: a canopy over the separate entrance doors to the two units. Owners can enclose them for added security and privacy if they wish. There are also small balconies, mansard roofs and an attempt to provide stylistic variety in the facades.
The Partnership had to presell all the houses before construction could begin. As a rule, about half the houses are presold in a new-market area before builders and banks are prepared to accept the risk of new construction in an untested market. The amount of underused industrial land in the vicinity made it even harder for banks and builders to envision it as a residential neighborhood.
THERE is more to come in Bushwick now that the market is better established. This year Beechwood will build 51 more two-family houses, El Rosario Partnership Homes, near Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompei Church, between Bushwick Avenue and White Street, on Siegel and McKibben Streets. And 120 other two-family houses are to be developed by Beechwood elsewhere in Bushwick, 70 of them on scattered sites.
But two-family houses, in which the Partnership has specialized, is only one form of for-sale housing. Under the 10-year plan of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the goal was to produce 23,000 housing units for the moderate- to middle-income market through the Partnership. The plan also envisioned 5,000 one-family houses produced under the Nehemiah Plan, following the pattern established under that name by the East Brooklyn Churches in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn.
Beyond that there were to be 9,000 units in combination developments - with condominiums selling at market prices and presumably generating profits that would be used to lower rents for new rental buildings.
Names like Spring Creek in eastern Brooklyn and Melrose Common in the southern part of the Bronx would come to the fore as centers of large-scale new development. With the proceeds generated from land sales for the market-rate effort in the Arverne section of Queens on the Rockaway Peninsula, a large-scale infill development would be produced in nearby Edgemere.
For the Partnership, starts of 2,000 units are scheduled this year. That figure would double next year if the projected multifamily developments go forward, said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership's housing affiliate, and state and city provide the necessary subsidies. Some would be in three-family houses - an owner with two tenants. Others would be in midrise buildings, typically of 8 to 12 stories.
But midrises pose a problem, as the Tibbett Gardens development of 750 units in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx is demonstrating. First there is the question of community acceptance. Though approved by the Board of Estimate, Tibbett Gardens has been opposed by community leaders and Borough President Fernando Ferrer. Beyond that, there is the issue of public cost: City officials estimate the required subsidy at $45,000 an apartment, including the value of the land, assuming all apartments are sold within a year.
But additional loans are required to hold down the interest expenses built up during the construction period, and the extent to which they are repaid depends on the speed of sales. According to city officials, if it took six years to sell the full development, the subsidy requirement would rise to $60,000 an apartment; if all escrowed money were used, the subsidy could be as high as $90,000 an apartment.
The Tibbett Gardens plan, proposed by the Real Estate Board of New York, has been criticized by the office of State Comptroller Edward V. Regan as one in which the public benefit does not justify the public costs or risk. It has written of its concern to the Financial Control Board.
There are other possible forms for assisted multifamily middle-income development. One is a limited-dividend cooperative: the city would provide land and subsidies up to $40,000 an apartment; a nonprofit sponsor would enter the picture; tax-exempt financing would be available; buyer income would be limited to a maximum of about $42,000 in most locations (or more in a poorer, or targeted, area). The underlying mortgage on the building would help hold initial purchase prices down.
Another model is the condominium-renter approach launched by the Koch administration with the Lefrak Organization and the Milstein Organization on two sites. Success there depends on the strength of the market when condominiums are sold. Profits from market-rate sales would subsidize the rents for lower-income buyers.
But midrise and high-rise construction is expensive and risky. Even the costs of pure construction are at least 30 percent higher than they are for small houses, and the development risks are far greater. In the end, the Dinkins administration may find it extremely difficult to meet the production goals laid out by its predecessor.

HEADLINE: IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester;
Waterfront Plunge Is Paying Dividends

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
WHEN Michael DiScala and James Gardella bought the Lock Building near the waterfront of the South Norwalk neighborhood 17 years ago, they knew that the city was at its nadir. The partially rented, 125,000-square-foot factory was losing $60,000 a year and was surrounded by derelict industrial buildings in an area that attracted street people.
Confident that someday development then swirling around Norwalk would revive the city, they paid $200,000 for the two-acre property. Today, the building is at the hub of a spreading, multimillion-dollar restoration wedged between the new $30 million Maritime Center - a waterfront aquarium complex converted from a 19th-century factory - and the old City Hall, to be expanded into a the 96-room Maritime Inn by Robert Katz, a local developer.
Around the corner on Washington Street, the Collins Development Corporation of Stamford turned abandoned factories and ship chandleries into an enclave of antiques shops, clothing boutiques, restaurants, art galleries and condominiums that on weekends and holidays draws droves of tourists. 
Recognizing the DiScala building as the link securing a two-square-block historic district, Norwalk officials are expected to grant final approvals this month to tear it down and, in its place, allow construction of a $70 million, 552,000-square-foot complex of apartments, offices, shops, restaurants and parking for 900 cars.
The project, to be called Maritime Square, was designed by the Norwalk architectural firm of Beinfeld Wagner & Associates. Mr. DiScala, president of M. F. DiScala & Company, a local real estate concern, is the developer, with Mr. Gardella a passive owner-investor.
''It represents critical mass - the more the better for the overall success of South Norwalk,'' observed Sal Buono, senior vice- president in the Stamford office of Grubb & Ellis, a nationwide realty company. ''More businesses, hotels and other tourist attractions are needed, but in the short haul, continuing growth in that area will depend upon lenders. Local banks are having problems, so alternate sources must be sought.''
Mr. DiScala said he is not worried about financing. ''We have been approached by banks and pension funds from Japan, Germany and the Netherlands,'' he said, ''although we have never used foreign financing before. The Japanese have taken a liking to Fairfield County and to big, self-contained, mixed-use projects like this, where diversification takes some of the gamble away.''
He has also talked to Chase Manhattan, but says American lenders are interested only in short-term construction financing while foreign lenders have a long view and will do the permanent financing required to pay off the construction loans.
''MONEY from foreign lenders is not only available but cheaper,'' he said, ''by about a half a percentage point.''
Owning the property helped tremendously in developing it. ''You never sell the land,'' he said. ''No matter how long it takes, you hold it and wait. My father came to this country when he was 21. He liked Norwalk and he kept buying property here. We still have a European attitude. Syndicates out for a fast buck are not our style.''
Once the project is approved, he anticipates an eight-month period for working drawings, bidding and financing. Demolition and construction would then begin early next fall, with an opening in 1993.
His company will oversee the selection of retail tenants to complement those on Washington Street and along West Avenue, where the Gap, a Clark's of England shoe store and other retailers have recently opened, and will remain on the premises as manager.
Some 200 apartments, mostly one-bedroom units of about 750 square feet, and six two- and three-bedroom penthouses with views of the Norwalk River and harbor, will occupy the upper four floors of the six-story building. The remaining space will contain 45,000 square feet of offices, 35,000 square feet of retail space lining the entire length of the ground floor, and 10,000 square feet of restaurants. Seven elevators and a concierge will serve residential and office tenants.
No decision has been made on whether to rent or sell the apartments as condominiums, although Mr. DiScala believes the glut of condos now on the market will have been absorbed by the time he is ready to open.
Edward Leary, director of the city's planning and zoning department, said: ''Norwalk has 441 unsold condominiums on the market, 321 units approved for construction, 676 units under construction, and applications pending for another 540 units, including those at Maritime Square and 300 units to be built by the Starrett Corporation in their redevelopment of the South Norwalk railroad station.''
Late this month, the city is expected to enact a one-year moratorium on multifamily housing of 12 units or more, followed by new regulations limiting the number and location of such housing. Maritime Square is in one of the few districts that will be exempt.
Coordinating with the city's plans for more parking at the Maritime Center, DiScala will buy the municipal parking lot opposite the center, incorporating it into its project, and assigning 400 parking spaces to center visitors. ''The city saves about $4 million by not having to build the garage,'' said Mr. Leary.
MARITIME SQUARE will achieve its length of 630 feet by building over part of Marshall Street just east of the Maritime Inn and extending to Water Street. A landscaped cul-de-sac will mark the new end of Marshall Street, from which pedestrians can go through an areaway to the Maritime Square Plaza entrance on Water Street, and cars may enter the garage. A second garage access will be on Ann Street at the project's north end. Residential tenants will have reserved spaces; the rest will be open to the public.
Additional tourist attractions under consideration include Mayor Frank J. Esposito's plans for transient docking facilities on the river enabling visitors to arrive by boat, and for a city-owned building next to the Maritime Center to be sold to accommodate the Museum of Cartoon Art, founded by Mort Walker, originator of the ''Beetle Bailey'' cartoons, and now in Rye Brook, N.Y. A planned extension of Water Street north to I-95 would alleviate traffic congestion.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: South Street Seaport;
Delays in Redevelopment Imperil Historic Properties

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
COLLAPSE and construction. The signals are as contradictory as any area can send and they are found within a few yards of one another in the South Street Seaport Historic District in lower Manhattan, symbolizing both the tenuous redevelopment and continued abandonment of that 19th-century quarter.
What is under construction is the headquarters of the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey, on Water Street, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip. Meanwhile, two doors north, a large chunk of brick wall has fallen off the top of a 153-year-old coppersmith shop and warehouse.
Speaking generally about the 11-block district along the East River, David F. M. Todd, chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said: ''I'm disappointed that things haven't moved faster. The longer this drifts, the more the deterioration.'' 
''Projects within the district are now viewed as highly risky,'' said Dana C. Rowan, vice president of N. M. Palermo, a real estate concern headed by Douglas E. Palermo that has several holdings in the area. ''Risky projects typically demand higher yields from lending institutions and investors, translating into fewer dollars left over to pay for the high-quality restoration work these buildings deserve.
''The Seaport is at a critical point, where it can either build momentum toward finishing the restoration and redevelopment work or it can continue to suffer from failed or half-hearted attempts,'' Mr. Rowan said.
In that context, attention has turned to a parking lot on the west side of Water Street, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip, that Paul and Seymour Milstein have been trying to redevelop for seven years. Five of their proposals for 250 Water Street - including a 43-story apartment tower - have either been rejected by the landmarks agency as inappropriately large or withdrawn.
The landmarks commission voted Tuesday on the Milsteins' latest proposal, for a 12-story office building with 407,000 square feet, designed by Platt & Byard Architects. But there were not enough members either for or against the application to produce the six-vote majority needed to dispose of the matter. Another vote may come Feb. 20.
Opponents and supporters of the project agree on one thing: it may represent a crucial turning point. Critics said it would be a troubling precedent, an oversized building in a small-scale historic district.
Advocates said its size had been reduced acceptably and that the project would spur economic activity, and much-needed rehabilitation, in the district.
''Commencement with 250 Water Street, in its current design, will do much toward re-establishing confidence in the future of the Seaport,'' Mr. Rowan said, adding that it might determine whether Palermo went ahead with a redevelopment project of its own at Water and Beekman Streets.
David Feinberg, who owns property on Peck Slip and Water Street, also urged the commission to approve the Milstein building. ''If we don't do this,'' he said, ''you won't have to worry about future meetings, because there won't be a Seaport.''
His description is not completely hyperbolic. Take the case of the four-story Samuel Thompson coppersmith shop and warehouse, 247 Water Street, which was built in 1837. It is an elegant study in contrasts, with massive granite piers on the ground floor and delicate, 24-pane window frames in the top floor.
BUT a passerby does not need an engineering degree to see that it is in distress. The facade sags at either end, without a right angle anywhere, and the piers lean perceptibly. Last month, after a snowfall and windstorm, a whole section of the upper facade fell to the street, leaving a yawning hole.
Gerry Bakirtjy, an architect in the neighborhood who testified in favor of the Milstein proposal, said, ''If the economic vitality of the district is not restored soon, there won't be any original fabric left to save.''
Opponents of the project see an equal threat to the district posed by a building as large as the Milsteins'. They urged the commission to keep 250 Water Street within the height of two other major projects.
One is the Seamen's Church Institute headquarters, designed by James Stewart Polshek and Partners. It will have seven floors and 32,000 square feet and include a rebuilt version of the 191-year-old Schermerhorn ship chandlery, 243 Water Street, which has been reduced to its brick facade. The first four floors of the new building will be red brick, to match the chandlery, and the upper stories, set back from the street line, will be white steel and glass.
This project has been approved by the commission and foundations are in place.
The other major project is a 242-room hotel, combining three new buildings with 10 existing structures on both sides of Front Street, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip. It is being developed by the Metropolis Group, whose principals include Robert Reveley and James Fusco, and designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects. The hotel has about 170,000 square feet and its highest portion has eight floors.
Most of the project has been approved and the developer expects to begin foundation work in the spring.
AFTER changing size and shape considerably, the Milstein proposal emerged last fall as a 15-story office building with about 480,000 square feet, clad in brick and granite at its base, with cast stone and glass in the upper stories, which are stepped back.
''We came away with the impression that the design was acceptable except in terms of size,'' one of the architects, Charles A. Platt, told the landmarks commission. ''What was done - this was much to the horror of our client because these are the most valuable floors - was that floors were taken out of the middle of the building. By taking the floors out, the whole thing shrinks.''
But it has clearly not shrunk enough to satisfy many preservation and neighborhood groups, Community Board 1, the South Street Seaport Museum, and Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, among other elected officials.
''The latest proposal, despite the eloquent presentation, is a rogue elephant masquerading as a butterfly,'' said Lloyd N. Merrill, chairman of the Southbridge Towers co-operative and a committee chairman on the community board.
''If you approve this latest incarnation, you're only rewarding the Milsteins' persistence,'' said Rita Grolitzer, a resident of Southbridge.
In testimony read by an aide, Ms. Messinger said: ''This latest attempt comes closest to being acceptable. But the issue is not whether this proposal is more reasonable than those which have preceded it.
''At 148 feet,'' Ms. Messinger said, ''it would tower over existing buildings within the district, which average four to five stories, as an imposing and intrusive presence.''
About the existing structures, Christabel Gough of the Society for the Architecture of the City, said: ''They housed small businesses. Their smallness speaks to us of a period of our history which should not be forgotten.''
But the architect Hugh Hardy, who wrote on behalf of the Milstein proposal, argued that ''we are no longer a society of small-shop keepers living above the store and the requirements of modern development therefore demand buildings larger in scale.''
Other supporters of the project in its current form include the New York Landmarks Conservancy, whose executive director, Laurie Beckelman, has been named by Mayor David N. Dinkins to succeed Mr. Todd as head of the landmarks panel.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Still Homesick After All These Years

BYLINE: By ERIC J. ADAMS; Eric J. Adams' first book, ''Loss of Innocence: A True Story of Juvenile Murder and Justice in America,'' will be published next summer by Avon Books.

 BODY:
During the turbulent mid-70's, several friends and I just out of high school bought a used van and traveled west.
We were young and restless refugees from suburbia, angry at society, our parents, our upbringing, out environs. We undertook the journey with no destination, traveling west only because that was guaranteed to take us farthest from the Island.
I remember rigging a pole in the center of our van to support all our belongings strapped precariously on the roof. We were determined never to return. With our eight-track recorder playing, we drove the interstate highway through New Jersey, Ohio, Missouri and the prairies of Kansas until we came to rest within a valley deep in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. 
Fifteen years have passed since then. Though a few of my traveling companions have returned to settle permanently in New York, I never have. After remaining in Colorado for a decade, I moved farther west to San Francisco. I have a career now, a wife, a son. I think I've grown wiser. I certainly view life differently.
Lately I have been asking myself with more frequency than I'm comfortable with if the time has finally come to move back to Long Island. I shudder at the idea, but oddly, I am drawn to it as well.
Once, when my hair was long and I lived in a log cabin in a town with a population smaller than my graduating class, I could not conceive of returning to the purgatory of suburbia. It was the worst of all possible worlds for an idealistic teen-ager searching for the meaning of existence. With its housing developments, shopping malls, highways and Cadillacs, suburbia lacked the grit of the city and the reality of the country. Long Island was a limbo-hell without a soul. What meaning could be discovered in a place whose geographical and spiritual center was Fortunoffs? For me and many others my age, Long Island was no place to live in, it was a place to flee from.
Somehow I made it through college, cut my hair, learned that you're obliged to pay some dues, jump through some hoops. I moved to a city. My values changed. The times have changed, too. The 70's, which formed my identity, were rife with political and social upheavals. The Vietnam War was ending. Feminism rising. Corporate America justly losing a degree of sanctity in the public mind. And social justice was earning the recognition it deserved. It was an era of change and hope, of idealists readily swapping what was for what could be.
With the 80's we learned how quickly idealism can tarnish. War was a state of mind. The ring of the cash registers drowned out accusations of corporate greed. And in a world saturated with child abuse and crack, how does one measure social justice anyway?
The country took a shift toward the conservative, the materialistic. Though I hate to admit it, I guess I did, too. The change in me and the change in times have made living on Long Island an option again. Suddenly Long Island wasn't the living hell I had imagined. There are obvious reasons to return. Though I haven't lived in striking distance of Roosevelt Field for quite some time, by a quirk of fate I married a woman who grew up just around the corner from me in Roslyn Heights. We moved to San Francisco independently.
One day, based on our acquaintance as children, we stepped out for a drink. Then we began dating. We surprised ourselves more than our parents when we announced our engagement. ''You travel halfway around the world,'' a relative told me at our engagement party, ''only to marry the girl next door.'' He said it as if his astute perception implied a greater cosmic message, that I had erred in moving away in the first place.
It would have been different had I married a spouse from San Diego or Minnesota. Mine is a big Jewish family and Kathy's a big Catholic family, and if anyone is looking for a double-whammy of guilt to return home they are invited to move in with us. Our families are good enough to keep the direct pressure to a minimum, but their intentions are always clear.
But what's so wrong with living close to the relatives? My mother is growing older. I see it in the way she walks and talks. My father in no longer around to help her, and my sister moved her family to Vermont when the Long Island economy became too much to bear.
Suddenly, I feel both the obligation and the desire to take care of my mother, to let her know her grandson, and for him to know her before it's too late. She is a vibrant woman who never lost the mysteries and ebullience of the old country, a wonderful storyteller and the quintessential grandmother. She still lives in the house where I grew up and though she is blessed with friends and relatives, she values her children above life itself. That will never change. With my sister and I gone, no parade of friends and relatives can make her feel anything but alone. Meanwhile, the years tick by.
Kathy's family is huge and effervescent and welcoming with an embrace that is almost smothering. They exude vitality and warmth. They moved recently to a co-op on the ocean in Long Beach and they spend summers at a country home in upstate New York. They are continually planning family gatherings and outings and showering each other with gifts and surprise parties.
I kind of like the idea of our son, Jesse, growing up knowing his families. They have so much to give and are so willing to give it. San Francisco is a wonderful city and we have lots of friends there, including many couples like us with babies. Invariably, however, we lose touch with them or they move away. Our friendships run wide but rarely do they run deep.
Maybe we could put up with tract housing and Fortunoffs if the deal came complete with grandparents and aunts and uncles. Maybe we could stand to bear the Long Island Expressway congestion if we were on our way to visit people who loved us and our son, unconditionally and forever. Family is family, and if ever there was a concept endemic to New York, it is this.
For me, perhaps more than Kathy, there is also the desire to come to terms with the past. I left Long Island an angry young man. On my visits back in subsequent years, I always viewed it with a certain distaste. I saw it as corrosive and gray. It was how I imagined Moscow to be, dreary and oppressive. The accents were thick and the attitudes inhospitable.
By comparison, San Francisco and most major cities west of the Mississippi seemed undeniably more livable. But New York is my city. I grew up there. It shaped me. Just as one has to come to terms with one's parents, I feel compelled to come to terms with my city. Some circle within me would never be completed if I failed to stare Long Island in the face, forgive its trespasses and asked it to forgive mine.
That process has already started. Now that I know how difficult it is to save money to buy a home, those small houses with little backyards don't appear as ridiculous as they did. Now that I have a son who will be attending school, I can understand the desire to live in a good school district. Establishing a family is more work than I ever expected and so I have had to lower my ideals slightly. Long Island and I are not so far apart anymore.
So, after late-night phone calls with our families, Kathy and I invariably discuss the merits of moving back to Long Island. It's a hard decision. We are both very independent by nature and we know that by moving back we would be forced to endure the unconscious domination of our families.
Our interfaith marriage complicates the matter. In San Francisco, it's easy to strike a balance between our religions. In New York, we would have to deal with the pressures of family every Friday night or every Sunday morning, not to mention every Passover and Easter.
Away from Long Island we have created a comfortable sense of family by incorporating attitudes and lifestyle decisions that don't make much sense to our families (What do you mean you don't eat meat?). We've come to enjoy the freedom and the responsibility to be whatever we choose. In New York, there are so many roles we would be expected to fill.
When we visit we are welcomed guests. The distance makes us celebrities and we enjoy that status. When we are apprised of those little family spats that consume families and pit relative against relative, we thank our stars that we are long-distance observers to the drama and not players on the crowded stage.
We also love the West. There is a great spirit of optimism and faith in humanity in San Francisco, a city of unfathomable tolerance. Just as we have embraced San Francisco, San Francisco has embraced us. Even the earthquake couldn't shake us out of town. Only Long Island could. Long Island and our families.
Will we move back? We don't know. It seems that when one of us becomes resigned to returning, the other can't bear the thought of leaving.
Moving away from Long Island was so easy. Why is it so hard to think about moving back?

HEADLINE: Budget Plan Puts Pressure On the Towns

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
WHETHER the $7.2 billion budget that Gov. William A. O'Neill proposed last week is a masterwork of hard-nosed cost-cutting, as many Democrats contend, or a magician's trick full of trap doors, as the Republicans see it, one thing is almost certain as the debate over it goes on: aid to towns and cities, although up from last year, will not be enough. And while the Governor's budget would not raise taxes, municipalities probably will.
Municipal officials say that with demands surging for services from education to garbage disposal, state aid has not kept up in many communities - even during the boom years of the mid-1980's, when grant totals from the state were rising by double-digit amounts. Generous increases in funds are a fond memory in the current era of budget austerity. 
In the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, aid to towns from state operating funds has risen 7.5 percent from last year, and total grants have gone up 6.2 percent, to $2.2 billion. But 127 of Connecticut's 169 communities had to raise property taxes again for the current year, according to the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, the group that represents towns' interests before the General Assembly. The increases pushed the average per capita property tax burden over $1,000 for the first time, the group said.
Mr. O'Neill's budget, which he presented to the General Assembly on Wednesday, would increase the operating-fund aid to the towns by 2.9 percent; total municipal grants would grow by 5.8 percent, to $2.36 billion, mostly through the sale of bonds.
Those are across-the-board figures from the proposed budget. Some towns would not even fare that well. In Stratford, for example, the total amount of ''formula grants'' from the state - the single largest category of direct aid - would rise only 1.88 percent, to $11.4 million, in the year that begins July 1.
''The state has once again not kept pace,'' said Stratford's Town Manager, Ronald W. Owens.
Mr. Owens said Stratford was forced to raise its property taxes by 6 percent this year. Last year, the increase was 8 percent. Even with such increases, the town has been running deficits in its budgets, according to figures from the state's Office of Policy and Management.
Even more troubling to Stratford, a town of 51,000 people, are the state-aid totals for education, which is the largest and fastest-growing budget category, accounting for nearly 50 percent of the total $78 million town budget.
State budget documents show that the single largest direct education grant for Stratford, the education cost-sharing funds, would rise by 3.9 percent, to $6.6 million, under the Governor's budget. The second-largest grant, to help Stratford meet special-education costs like the state-mandated programs for disabled children, would remain unchanged at $2.18 million.
Unfortunately, Mr. Owens said, the special-education costs are growing fastest. ''Our special-education costs are increasing by leaps and bounds every year,'' he said.
 
Growth in Local Aid
What promises to add further consternation as the budget talks unfold at the Capitol are the means by which Mr. O'Neill's budget officers arrived at the local-aid totals.
With a $90.1 million deficit projected for the year that ends June 30 - and, according to the Assembly's budget office, a gap of $417 million for the next year - Mr. O'Neill said he had slashed spending by $600 million from the amounts requested by the state agencies and had arrived at an overall spending increase of just 4.5 percent for the coming year - the lowest rate of state spending growth in 15 years.
In his speech before the combined House and Senate, in which he outlined the budget and opened the legislative session, Mr. O'Neill pointed with pride to the fact that local aid - up 5.8 percent - had been maintained as well as it had in the face of such austerity.
Within hours of the address, however, the Republicans, who make up the minority in both chambers of the Assembly, were charging that the growth figure was deceptive and that the local-aid funds were at the heart of it all.
Their argument, which promises to echo through the remaining three months of the session, is that Mr. O'Neill propped up the local-aid totals by improperly depleting a $215 million property-tax-relief fund. Under current law, they said, the fund was only supposed to be distributed in installments of $42 million a year until the money was gone.
 
'There's No Magic'
Under Mr. O'Neill's spending plan, which budget officials defended as the only way to keep local aid intact, about $180 million of the relief fund would be drained over the next year, with the money going either into the state's main spending account, the General Fund, or directly into grants for municipalities. The remaining $35 million would be enough for one regular disbursement in the following year.
''There's no magic,'' said Anthony V. Milano, who heads the Office of Policy and Management. ''The budget would have been cut had we not had the resources of that fund.''
Mr. Milano said that about $300 million in state expenses that would ordinarily be paid from the General Fund were shifted onto other accounts, like the relief fund, or taken off the budget altogether.
For example, if Mr. O'Neill's budget is passed intact by the Assembly, the Hospitals and Health Care Commission, the Liquor Control Department and the Workers' Compensation Commission - all of which regulate segments of the Connecticut economy - would have their operations funded by ''assessments'' levied upon the businesses that the agencies oversee. Their combined $8 million budgets would simply be removed from state accounts.
''When you start taking things off the budget, that's deceptive,'' said Richard Foley, the state Republican Party chairman. ''It's a dishonest budget.''
Mr. O'Neill, who has said he will seek a third term in November, swept aside such criticisms in his speech to the Assembly, in which he called on lawmakers to restore their spirits and ''stand up for Connecticut.'' The techniques within the budget itself, he seemed to be saying, were evidence that Connecticut would survive its troubles and thrive again.
''This budget says that government will get leaner, but it also says we will get more efficient,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''As resources dwindle, innovations spread. Threatened with stagnation, we respond with change.''

HEADLINE: RINGWOOD JOURNAL;
Residents Angered by Plan to Develop Part of Sterling Forest

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: RINGWOOD

 BODY:
AFTER the rains, this Passaic County borough takes on the appearance of a picture postcard: reservoirs glisten and mist hangs over macadam roadways with a serene beauty.
But a proposal to develop a vast tract of the privately owned Sterling Forest just across the New York State border has angered many longtime residents and environmentalists. They contend that such construction would wreak havoc on existing water tables, endanger water quality and threaten roadway infrastructure built decades ago to accommodate local traffic. A way of life also is at stake, they say. 
''I don't think that it's a question of perceiving a threat; I think that the threat is there,'' said Peter Cannici, the Mayor of Ringwood. ''But if they start building all that up, what happens to one of the last areas of natural beauty where people from all over have come to get away from the cities?''
Any development would be environment-conscious and well studied, say representatives of the Sterling Forest Corporation, based in Tuxedo, N.Y., which has maintained the 18,000-acre tract for some 40 years. The land, which includes miles of hiking trails and a ski center and is the site of the annual Renaissance Fair, had been a major producer of iron ore used in both the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Many descendants of the original miners still live in the area.
The corporation has pledged that no more than 25 percent of the tract, or 4,500 acres, would be developed as either condominiums or single-family houses. It says the development would not detract from the rural setting.
''There are no set plans yet in terms of what might be constructed,'' said David A. McDermott, a corporation spokesman, stressing that studies had been commissioned to examine the effect the proposed development would have on the environment in surrounding communities in both Passaic and New York's Orange and Rockland Counties. The investment group has retained the services of 13 scientists and environmental experts to research the plan.
Mr. McDermott said that in the last two years the corporation had given assurances to neighbors that the tract would be enhanced, not depleted, by limited construction.
''It would make absolutely no sense for us to hurt the environment here, from both an economic and preservational standpoint,'' he said.
But Jerome Wyckoff of Ringwood, a retired book editor who was born and raised in the area, says that any development, limited or not, threatens the land, which, as an avid hiker, he has come to know and respect.
''All you have to do is look around here and smell the air and drink from the water to know that what we have is precious,'' he said. ''Over the years, development in the area has elevated the flood table and no matter what any one person or group says, if you increase the development, you heighten the problem.''
Mr. Wyckoff, the founder and a former chairman of the borough's Environmental Commission, of which he is still a member, feels that recent flooding in the area is due to development and that wildlife will also suffer if the corporation is allowed to develop the land.
''New Jersey is one of the most populated and industrialized states in the union,'' he said, ''and the importance of open space and a preserved natural environment have to outweigh what we've become.''
While some residents are strictly opposed to any type of housing developments, others say a more realistic approach or compromise might be in order.
''What we have now is something that we really don't want to see changed because we are surrounded by a greenbelt effect,'' said Charles E. DeDeyn, Ringwood's Borough Manager, explaining that about 63 percent of the area is made up of state parkland, reservoirs and watershed property.
Two years ago, Passaic County officials condemned about 2,000 acres of Sterling Forest property to protect it from development. The county and the corporation are in litigation to establish a fair market price for that land, which the county wants to buy.
''Many of us have a problem with high-density development such as town houses or condominiums because waste, no matter what precautions are taken, will eventually find its way into feeder streams that supply our reservoirs,'' Mr. DeDeyn said. One solution, he says, might be construction of single-family houses on property zoned for two- or three-acre lots, but only if waste management systems are put in place that can safely guard against leaching.
Last month, the corporation made public a 21-point plan that it would use to develop the tract and safeguard its natural resources, Mr. McDermott said. It calls for the study of air quality, community design, open-space preservation, fiscal and flood impact, solid- waste management, recreational use and the use of mass transit to reduce automobile traffic in the area.
For Jeffrey H. Tittel, 32 years old, a Ringwood biologist who is the spokesman for Citizens for Land, Environment and Neighborhoods, a local environmental group, the corporation's pledge has done little to lighten residents' fears.
''It just makes me nervous,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''Any developer is going to make promises to protect this and to protect that, but when the developing is done and problems start to arise, are they going to be there to back up their claims?''
Both the group and borough officials also say that local taxes will have to be raised significantly to improve narrow secondary roads.
For Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood, the region has special significance and its preservation a heartfelt meaning. As a member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, he helped to start Congressional hearings to study the issue.
The forest's preservation, he said, ''is our last chance to put a limit on suburban sprawl and protect the natural greenbelt around New Jersey and New York State.'' A Franklin Lakes native, Mr. Torricelli fondly remembers class trips as a youth into the region to study nature, and he feels that any efforts to eliminate or reduce such land would result in a loss to residents of both states, especially children.
''We're too crowded, and that's the reality,'' he said, ''and to hack away at an area enjoyed by generations of residents who discovered and enjoy nature is self-defeating.''
A bill before Congress, co-sponsored by Mr. Torricelli, Representative Marge S. Roukema, Republican of Ridgewood, and Representative Peter Kostmayer, a Bucks County, Pa., Democrat, seeks to authorize a $250,000 National Parks Service study to weigh purchasing the land for preservation. The land's purchase price promises to be a future issue.
''Will it cost us money?'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''Yes, it will, but I think it's something we owe future generations. And we owe it to ourselves as well.''

HEADLINE: The Clock Is Ticking on David's Island Project

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
THE release of a long-awaited Federal review of the proposed $1 billion residential complex on David's Island, a deserted 78-acre site off the coast of New Rochelle, has renewed a bitter public debate and set the stage for a final state study that will determine whether the project can proceed.
The two state agencies responsible for the final decision have agreed to hold new public hearings on the proposal. No dates have been set, but the hearings must be conducted before the end of the six-month deadline set in motion by the completion of the final environmental-impact statement.
The release on Jan. 23 of the $15 million environmental-review statement, which was prepared by the developer under the direction of the United States Coast Guard, reflects the Federal agency's view that the environmental issues raised by the project have been adequately documented and that the state agencies with regulatory jurisdiction have sufficient information to begin their review.
 
What the Opponents Say
Opponents of the David's Island proposal say the Federal review does not adequately measure the environmental impacts of the project. They welcome the opportunity for further debate. ''When an environmental-impact statement is done with the developer footing the bill, it is ridiculous to think it will be absolutely neutral,'' said Elaine M. Price, a member of the Mamaroneck Town Council who is coordinating municipal opposition to the project in surrounding communities. 
The two state agencies, the Departments of State and of Environmental Conservation, have agreed to hold the parallel but separate hearings because of the public interest involved, spokesmen for both departments said last week. They denied that the adequacy of the Coast Guard's review was an issue.
The project is the largest residential development ever proposed for Westchester's Long Island Sound Shore and would be the largest and most expensive residential development built in the county in recent years, planning officials said. The hearings will provide an additional forum for supporters who maintain that the project will stimulate the city's stagnant economy and support its schools. Opponents, on the other hand, will have an opportunity to contend that the proposal will destroy the area's fragile environment.
The proposed development for the city-owned island includes a 2,000-unit condominium complex, 100,000 square feet of commercial space, an 800-slip marina, a restaurant and a heliport, connected to the mainland by a 3,465-foot bridge.
Because it has the regulatory responsibility for deciding whether to issue a permit for the bridge, the Coast Guard supervised the preparation of the final environmental statement.
 
Coast Guard Comments Studied
The intention of the developer, Xanadu Properties Associates, to build a bridge is the only feasible alternative for the estimated 3,701 people the project is expected to house, the regional office of the Coast Guard has concluded. The proposed $40 million bridge would be built over one-fourth of an acre of Glen Island Park. The park is owned by the county. The Coast Guard's comments on the bridge and every other aspect of the plan are now being scrutinized by state, county and municipal agencies, the city of New Rochelle and by citizens and environmental groups. These groups have until March 14 to submit their comments on the four-volume document to the Coast Guard.
But attention is focused on the state agencies because the actions they take will determine the future of the project. Under both Federal and state environmental laws, the request for a Coast Guard permit automatically requires a review by the New York Department of State, which supervises the environmental protection of the state's coastline through its Coastal Zone Management Plan. The nine-year-old state environmental plan establishes 44 criteria that a coastline-development project must meet, said William F. Brown, a spokesman for the Secretary of State, Gail F. Shaffer.
The department ''tries to strike a balance between development and preservation,'' Mr. Brown said, and its ultimate recommendations have the force of law.
Two years ago, Xanadu Properties withdrew a proposal before the Department of State could consider it, Mr. Brown said, adding, ''They knew we planned to reject it.''
The developers subsequently tried to meet the department's concerns and modified their proposal, reducing the maximum height of the buildings to 31 stories from 55, providing limited public access to the site and offering to build their own sewage-treatment plant.
 
Three Primary Issues Remain
Issues of height, public access and sewage treatment remain as the New York Department of State's primary concerns, Mr. Brown said. ''We can scale down whatever we decide is too ambitious for that area of the Sound,'' he added. His department can require the developer to amend the plan in order to proceed with the project, Mr. Brown said.
Issues from the size of the proposed marina to the effect of adding treated sludge to Long Island Sound will be the particular focus of the hearings conducted by the Department of Environmental Conservation, said Ralph Manna, the regional director.
While neither of the two departments technically has overriding jurisdiction, the action of the Department of State could decide the issues, Mr. Manna said. Referring to the 44 criteria in the Coastal Zone Management Plan, he said: ''The coastal-consistency issues of the Department of State are very important to us. These issues become the binding terms by which our department plays out the rest of its decisions.''
If, for example, the Department of State requires the developer, Xanadu, to reduce the height and density of the project or to provide additional public access and Xanadu refuses, then a decision by the Department of Environmental Conservation on the adequacy of the sewage treatment would not be necessary, Mr. Manna said.
 
The Deadline Is July 24
A decision by the two state agencies as to whether the proposal is consistent with state policy must be made by July 24, Mr. Brown said, under the six-month parameters established by state environmental law.
Should the two state agencies approve the David's Island plan with few modifications, the focus of interest could shift to a different set of elected officials. The city of New Rochelle is expected to ask the County Board of Legislators to forward a home-rule message to the State Legislature, requesting a non-park use of part of Glen Island Park.
The request, which would need approval by the Board of Legislators first, would require a change in state law. Several county legislators have publicly opposed the use of county park land for a bridge, and the outcome of a vote by the board is not certain.
 
New Rochelle's Role
Several members of the Board agreed last week that they had no reason to begin any action. ''We haven't been asked to take any action by anybody,'' said Diane A. Keane, a Republican legislator from Rye. But she added: ''A lot of peope are lobbying us on this project.''
''It's up to the city of New Rochelle to request action from us,'' said Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican legislator from the city. ''There is absolutely no reason for us to take any action unless the city asks us.''
Gordon Marshall, one of several partners in Xanadu Properties, said he was optimistic that the project he has nurtured for most of the last decade is on its way to becoming a reality. ''I have made a lot of compromises throughout the environmental-review process,'' he said last week. ''We have shown good faith and been very flexible.''
Xanadu Associates has reduced both the height and density of the buildings, agreed to allow public access during daylight hours, reconfigured traffic patterns and changed the location of the proposed bridge in accordance with a Coast Guard request. The company is ready to construct a $3 million to $4 million sewage-treatment plant as soon as the necessary approvals are obtained, Mr. Marshall said.
''There are no adverse environmental impacts in the project as it is presently proposed,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''We have the money, we are ready to put people to work and we are ready to spend money locally.''
 
'David's Island Is a Must'
Strong support for a project that is expected to generate 2,000 construction jobs and $13.26 million a year in property taxes has come from New Rochelle's business community, labor unions and school leaders.
''Whether we like it or not,'' said former Mayor Frank Garito at a recent meeting of New Rochelle business leaders, ''development has to happen if we are going to preserve our quality of life. The only way to preserve that quality of life is to produce the tax base to pay for it. David's Island is a must.''
Last year, New Rochelle residents absorbed a 9.9 percent increase in school taxes, said Dr. James Gaddy, the Superintendent of Schools. He added that ''there is no way we can continue to put that burden on our taxpayers.'' The school community supports the development of David's Island, he said, although he added that ''the project should address environmental and community concerns.
 
The Fears of Environmentalists
Environmentalists adamantly oppose a project they call a ''mini-city,'' one which they say will worsen pollution in the already-fragile waters of the Sound.
They argue that the western end of the Sound, from New York City to Bridgeport, is dying from hypoxia, or the loss of oxygen from the water. This, they add, is the result of sewage - including treated effluent - and the evidence of destruction includes numbers of dead fish. Support for this theory comes from reports of the Long Island Sound Study, a Federally sponsored research project to develop a plan to clean up and maintain the Sound with support from New York and Connecticut.
A coalition of neighboring municipalities also opposes the David's Island plan. ''When it comes to a developer's rights on Long Island Sound, we all have an interest,'' said Caroline Silverstone, Supervisor of Mamaroneck. ''Environmental impacts cross municipal borders.''

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.;
An Arts Center For Downtown

BYLINE: By CATHERINE C. ROBBINS

 BODY:
HURT by sliding oil prices and the death of the uranium industry in the 80's and anxious about cuts in spending at nearby defense-related industries, this city is trying to revitalize its downtown, stimulate convention business and attract new industry.
One of the most recent moves was a decision by the City Council to put a new performing arts center on the last piece of vacant land around Civic Plaza. The plaza is ringed by government offices, corporate and banking headquarters, parking facilities, two hotels and a convention center. Across the plaza, other projects are at or near completion. 
The plaza and its 962-space underground parking garage will be renovated starting late this year. Beta West, a Denver subsidiary of U.S. West, also in Denver, will complete its 350,000-square-foot office building next month on the Civic Plaza and will open an adjacent 405-room Hyatt Regency Hotel in August. A convention center to which 106,000 square feet is being added will open this fall with 718 parking spaces. It will increase exhibit and meeting space by 40 percent and permitting meetings of up to 5,000 delegates.
To complement both its downtown and convention centers, the city doubled the capacity of the airport, to 22 gates, in May 1989. Dennis Campbell, director of sales for the Albuquerque Convention and Visitors Bureau, said bookings extending to the year 2000 increased by 158 percent in the last six months of 1989.
The decision to build the arts center downtown was controversial. Development pieces are coming together there, but the city's uptown urban center competes for public investment.
Downtown's 35 buildings contain 2.35 million square feet of office space (not counting the Beta West building). Uptown's 48 buildings offer 1.82 million square feet.
In the fourth quarter of 1989, the vacancy rate for both areas was about 23 percent. Developers in the uptown area - about five miles northeast of downtown - clamored for the city to choose their sites for the arts center. But the city's own planners and citizens groups strongly supported downtown.
While the location issue was settled in November, the arts center's size is uncertain. Some Councilors, nervous about revenue shortfalls, want to trim its $64 million price tag. A proposal to reduce the number of theaters from three to one has been rejected. Until the cost and size questions are settled, the search for an executive director will be suspended, and city planners do not expect to meet the scheduled completion date of 1994.

HEADLINE: SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA;
MANDELA, FREED, URGES STEP-UP IN PRESSURE TO END WHITE RULE

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, Feb. 11

 BODY:
After 27 and a half years in prison, Nelson Mandela finally won his freedom today and promptly urged his supporters at home and abroad to increase their pressure against the white minority Goverment that had just released him.
''We have waited too long for our freedom,'' Mr. Mandela told a cheering crowd from a balcony of Cape Town's old City Hall. ''We can wait no longer.''
''Now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts,'' he said. ''To relax our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will not able to forgive.'' [Transcript of the address, page A15.] First Speech Since '64 Mr. Mandela's 20-minute speech, which he prepared before leaving prison today, constituted his first remarks in public since before he was sentenced in June 1964 to life imprisonment for conspiracy to overthrow the Government and engage in sabotage. 
He asked the international community not to lift its sanctions against South Africa, despite the recent changes introduced by President F. W. de Klerk, which culminated in Mr. Mandela's release.
''To lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the process toward ending apartheid,'' he said.
 
An Eloquent Militancy
Mr. Mandela's voice sounded firm and his words as eloquently militant as when he defended violence as the ultimate recourse at his political trial in 1964. Though he looked all of his 71 years and was grayer than artists' renditions over the years had depicted, he walked out of Victor Verster prison erect and vigorous.
In Washington, President Bush rejoiced over the release of Mr. Mandela, spoke to him by telephone and invited the anti-apartheid leader to visit the White House. [Page A17.] Mr. Mandela gave no evidence that his militant opposition to apartheid had been tempered by the more than 10,000 days he spent in confinement. But he also said nothing that would have surprised the Government had he said it during his years of incarceration. Indeed, there appeared to be nothing in Mr. Mandela's initial remarks after his release to give the Government much consolation or encouragement.
Although he has been viewed as a potential leader for all South Africans, he stressed time and again that his loyalty lay with the African National Congress, for which he was working underground when he was jailed in August 1962 on charges of incitement and leaving the country illegally. He was serving time on that conviction when he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.
Mr. Mandela told a crowd that he remained a ''loyal and disciplined member'' of the African National Congress and still endorsed its policies, including its use of armed struggle against the white minority Government.
He said he saluted the congress's military wing, Spear of the Nation, and its ally, the South African Communist Party, ''for its steady contribution to the struggle for democracy.''
But he also thanked the Black Sash, an organization of white women working to end apartheid, and the predominantly white National Union of South African Students for being ''the conscience of white South Africans.'' And he held out an olive branch to all whites, asking them to join in shaping a new South Africa.
 
'A Political Home'
''The freedom movement is a political home for you, too,'' he said.
In his first speech after his release, Mr. Mandela may have taken an orthodox line with a mass audience sympathetic to the African National Congress and might in private discussions eshow greater flexibility on the question of discussions that the Government wants to have with blacks, who are 28 million of the population, compared with the 5 million whites of the ruling minority.
He said he was only making some preliminary comments following his release, and would have more to say ''after I have had the opportunity to consult with my comrades.'' By this he meant the leaders of the African National Congress now in exile in Zambia as well as colleagues still based in South Africa.
But he appeared to discourage any leading role for himself, such as the Government has in mind, saying, ''A leader of the movement is a person who has been democratically elected at a national conference.''
 
De Klerk Offers Talks
President de Klerk has invited black leaders to join talks leading to the formulation of a new constitution that would let black South Africans take part at last in their nation's politics.
Mr. Mandela acknowledged to the crowd that he had conducted a dialogue with the Government during his last years in prison. But he added: ''My talks with the Government have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in the country. We have not yet begun discussing the basic demands of our struggle.''
''I wish to stress that I myself have at no time entered into negotiations about the future of our country, except to insist on a meeting between the A.N.C. and the Government,'' he said.
He described Mr. de Klerk, whom he has met twice since December, as ''a man of integrity.''
''Mr. de Klerk has gone further than any other Nationalist President in taking real steps to normalize the situation,'' Mr. Mandela said.
 
Still a 'Harsh Reality'
''But as an organization we base our policy and strategy and tactics on the harsh reality we are faced with,'' he said. ''And this reality is that we are still suffering under the policies of the Nationalist Government.''
The National Party, which Mr. de Klerk now leads, instituted apartheid after taking power in 1948.
Mr. Mandela said the Government had to take further steps before negotiations could begin.
As a prerequisite for negotiations, he reiterated two demands that he had conveyed from prison through recent visitors. These are are the lifting of the state of emergency, which was imposed in June 1986, and the release of all political prisoners, including those accused of crimes committed in the struggle against apartheid.
''Only such a normalized situation which allows for free political activity can allow us to consult our people in order to obtain a mandate,'' Mr. Mandela said.
He said the people had to be consulted about who would represent them in talks with the Government.
 
Democratic Election Urged
''Negotiations cannot take place above the heads or behind the backs of our people,'' he said. ''It is our belief that the future of our country can only be determined by a body which is democratically elected on a nonracial basis.''
Mr. Mandela appeared to allude to a formula under which a constituent assembly, in effect supplanting the existing Parliament, would draft a new constitution. Such a plan would mean the creation of an interim government in South Africa and has previously been rejected by Mr. de Klerk for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Mandela walked out of Victor Verster Prison near Paarl at 4:15 P.M., 75 minutes later than the release time announced Saturday afternoon by Mr. de Klerk. Acquaintances of the Mandela family said his departure from the prison was delayed by family discussions.
He was greeted by about 5,000 supporters lining the asphalt road outside the prison farm where he has been held since December 1988. Some waved the black, green and yellow flags of the African National Congress, from which Mr. de Klerk removed a ban on Feb. 2.
Mr. Mandela was then driven 40 miles from Paarl to Cape Town, passing several hundred people who had parked by the roadside or waited on overpasses in hope of seeing him. They held homemade signs, some of which read simply, ''Welcome home.''
A huge crowd, which organizers said reached 250,000 people, assembled in the square in front of the old City Hall in Cape Town to greet Mr. Mandela. Reporters covering the rally put the crowd's size at only 50,000 people at its peak. They became impatient and sometimes unruly, waiting up to six hours in the hot sun and had dwindled to about 20,000 by sunset, when Mr. Mandela finally appeared.
 
Blacks a Minority in Area
In the 1950's it was Government policy to prevent blacks from settling in the Western Cape, so they are not in the clear majority in Cape Town, where Mr. Mandela was released. People of mixed race, known as ''coloreds,'' are the largest population group in Cape Town, where whites also outnumber blacks.
Blacks, who account for nearly 75 percent of the population in the country as a whole, are in the overwhelming majority in the Johannesburg region, where Mr. Mandela can expect his most tumultuous welcome.
The festive occasion was marred by violence after some youths who had been drinking on the fringes of the rally started breaking windows and looting shops in downtown Cape Town.
The police tried to disperse them by firing shotguns and tear gas, and some of the youths retaliated by throwing bottles and stones. At one point, drunken protesters invaded a Chinese restaurant, snatched up the liquor and wine and threw bottles at the police from the rooftop. One man in the crowd was also injured in a knife fight.
 
Two Reported Killed
The South African Press Association reported tonight that 2 people had been killed and 13 wounded in the confrontations. A physician treating casualties on the scene estimated that 100 people had been wounded, mostly by buckshot. Most suffered only light injuries, including three journalists covering the rally.
Cheryl Carolus, a spokeswoman for the United Democratic Front, which helped organize the rally, attributed the violence to outsiders who, she said, were ''beyond our usual crowds, or who supported the rival Pan-Africanist Movement.'''
At times, some supporters at the rally had to scramble for cover as the police chased or fired at looters and stone-throwers. The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent figure in the anti-apartheid movement, pleaded for more than 45 minutes with the crowd to maintain discipline and move back.
Dullah Omar, a lawyer representing the Mandela family, said Mr. Mandela had been unaware of the violence.
 
Due in Johannesburg Today
This evening, Mr. Mandela failed to appear at a news conference arranged by the reception committee that is handling his schedule. A representative said Mr. Mandela would meet the press later this week in Johannesburg.
Mr. Mandela and his wife, Winnie, are expected to fly to Johannesburg on Monday and proceed to their home in the black township of Soweto.
One of the organizers, Saki Mocozoma, said security considerations precluded him from revealing where the Mandelas were spending their first night.
Mr. Mandela also paid tribute to his wife, who has lived apart from him for more than 27 years, and their children. ''I am convinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my own,'' he told them.

HEADLINE: Rural Doctor's Struggle to Care for the Poorest

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TCHULA, Miss.

 BODY:
There aren't many doctors like Ronald Myers, a jazz-playing, Baptist-preaching family practitioner whose dream has always been to practice medicine in the kind of place most other doctors wouldn't even stop for a tank of gas.
But there are plenty of places like Tchula, a forlorn patch of Mississippi Delta poverty where it is hard to find a street that's not rutted, a sign that's not crooked, a paint job that's not peeling or a life that's not perched on the brink of economic ruin.
Dr. Myers's story - how hard it has been for him to get here and how hard it may be for him to stay - provides a dispiriting look at health care in rural America. The situation is worsening because the Government's program to provide doctors for the nation's neediest areas is being dismantled as health care needs continue to grow. 
''Working in Tchula, Miss., is like working in a third world country,'' said Dr. Myers, who became Tchula's only doctor when he opened a clinic this month in an abandoned restaurant next to an empty liquor store. ''The needs are that great. So how is it that here's a well-trained physician who wants to come to an area that's desperately poor, and I can't get any assistance? I can't get a loan. I'll take a tongue depressor if someone will give me one. There's a problem somewhere.'' In poor rural areas, particularly in the South, regular medical care is seldom more than a distant dream. In areas like Tchula and nearby Belzoni, where Dr. Myers previously worked, infant mortality rates are three times the national average, most women receive little if any prenatal care and people usually see a doctor only when they have no choice.
''The health problems in this area are staggering,'' said Dr. Henry Bartee, who operated a practice here before giving it up two years ago and now practices 12 miles away in Lexington. ''I would say 70 percent of the people who walk through the door are either hypertensive or they have diabetes. Many have significant heart disease and their cholesterol levels are all sky high. A lot of people have never had a Pap smear, a breast examination or a pelvic or rectal exam.''
It is a common story, especially in the South. In Tennessee, the state says, more than a third of the 95 counties have no doctors who deliver babies and almost half do not have enough doctors to provide adequate basic health care. In South Carolina, all but 9 of the 47 counties have doctor shortages, and the state says it needs 225 family practitioners, obstetricians and pediatricians.
 
'I Feel Right Being Here'
Dr. Myers is rare in his profession, a physician who went to a good deal of trouble to practice where no one else would. A 33-year old Milwaukeean who graduated from the University of Wisconsin Medical School, an accomplished jazz pianist and an ordained Baptist minister, he said coming to the rural South was always his goal in medicine.
''I feel God put this burning desire in my heart to serve in the rural areas of the South where the need is the most,'' said Dr. Myers, whose new clinic office is decorated with black-history and black-pride posters and mementos from his musical career. ''I feel right being here. I feel it's what I was called to do.''
Tchula, about 60 miles north of Jackson, has 2,000 people, and the population of the area served by Dr. Myers's clinic is 4,500. Mayor Jessie D. Banks says 70 percent of the town is unemployed in winter, when there is no agricultural work to be found.
Dr. Myers began work in Belzoni a year and a half ago as part of his agreement with the National Health Services Corps, which pays a year's worth of medical school costs for each year the recipient agrees to serve in an underserved area.
While he served at a clinic there, he saw that the need was even greater in Tchula, 21 miles away, where there was no doctor at all. He decided to set up his own clinic in Tchula, using money he had made working overtime at emergency rooms, and to work there in the evening after spending his days at Belzoni.
The Federal Public Health Service, which oversees the program, told him he was not authorized to practice in Tchula and ordered him to stay in Belzoni. Officials told him that they did not think a medical practice could survive in Tchula and that doctors fare better when they can take advantage of existing health care organizations. Too Poor to Support a Practice? Undeterred, Dr. Myers took his fight to elected officials and the Mississippi news media, winning so much attention that the Public Health Service relented. He now operates full-time in Tchula while living in a double-wide trailer in Belzoni.
But getting permission to be in Tchula was only half the battle. To cobble together his clinic, he has had to rely on makeshift financing, advances from medical suppliers and his own wits. He has no lab equipment and does his own urinalysis under a microscope.
Dr. Bartee thinks that all this is in vain, that Tchula may be too poor to support a physician. ''The patients he will be seeing will primarily be indigent, Medicare-Medicaid patients, and it's almost impossible to make a living just seeing those patients,'' Dr. Bartee said. ''He's got to have some outside help.''
Dr. Myers wonders why the Government does not encourage the doctors it brings to rural areas to stay there by helping them set up practices. But increasingly, the problem is not keeping rural doctors but getting them there in the first place.
Started in 1972, the National Health Services Corps has placed more than 13,000 doctors in the nation's most underserved communities. But its financing has been slashed from $79.5 million in the 1980 fiscal year to $7.5 million in 1990, and six doctors leave the program for every one who enters it. Now it is unclear whether the program will survive at all. Its plight reflects both the Reagan-era budget cutbacks and an assumption that turned out to be erroneous: that because there was a nationwide oversupply of doctors, large numbers would stay in the rural areas where they were placed.
 
Bemused Cries of 'Hi, Doc'
''It was hoped that natural diffusion would take care of a lot of our needs,'' said Joseph Hayden, the corps's associate director. ''But it didn't.'' Today's needs, he went on, ''are just as great now as they were in 1980.''
Dr. Tom Dean, a family practitioner in Wessington Springs, S.D., who is president-elect of the National Rural Health Association, said that without the health service corps there would be ''a lot of needy people who just will not get care.''
''It would be just another critical hole in the theoretical safety net that's supposed to exist but we all know it really doesn't,'' he said.
If the poverty is most pronounced in the rural South, the problems are national, he said. The vast distances between towns in the West can make problems particularly acute there.
Dr. Myers, who is greeted with admiring if slightly puzzled cries of ''Hi, Doc,'' as he walks through Tchula's dilapidated business district, seems unfazed by the economic prospects here. He has already arranged for an ophthalmologist, a surgeon and a podiatrist to see patients at his Tchula Family Health Center. He doesn't expect to solve the health problems of the Mississippi Delta. But he wonders whether the statewide educational initiatives that have been hailed as the salvation of the South will mean much if no one addresses the health-care needs.
''Here you're putting all of this money into educational reforms, and you've got these sick, malnourished kids whose mothers never got any prenatal care,'' he said. ''If they're not healthy, how are they going to be able to learn?''

HEADLINE: FEDERAL AID, NEW YORK HOMELESS - A SPECIAL REPORT;
Bush Homeless Plan: 'Godsend' or False Hope?

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
On the night of Sept. 25, 1988, a previously obscure piece of Federal legislation was ushered onto political center stage before a television audience of millions.
During the season's first Presidential debate, a panelist asked George Bush what he would do for the homeless, ''this voiceless segment of our society.''
Mr. Bush answered without hesitation. ''I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded,'' the Republican candidate said. The McKinney Act? The reference hardly resonated in the living rooms of America. Most viewers had never heard of the McKinney Act, and Mr. Bush's terse answer offered virtually no basis on which to judge it. 
But Mr. Bush has kept his word. Last year, at his urging, Congress came close to fully financing most McKinney programs for the first time since the act was passed in 1987.
And the legislation remains a central provision of the Administration's plan for helping the homeless. As recently as last month, Mr. Bush pointed toward funds from the McKinney Act in telling a convention of home builders in Atlanta that ''my Administration is going to do its part'' in working to ''solve the problems of the helpless and the homeless.'' $67 Million for New York The act itself is a quiver of 16 programs, each taking a different aim at homelessness. Some of the programs support shelters, with food or funds. Others provide services like job training, health care or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse.
The funds approved last year are likely to raise New York State's share to about $67 million, from $45 million. Because the money filters through a variety of governments and private organizations, it is impossible to determine how much of it is spent in New York City.
But despite the McKinney Act's broad aims and the recent increase in financing, many of those who provide shelter and services to the homeless say the McKinney Act falls short in at least these three respects:
* It provides relatively little money.
* It creates daunting bureaucratic obstacles.
* And it provides almost no funds for low-income housing, which advocates argue must be part of a solution to homelessness.
''It's much ado about nothing,'' said Douglas H. Lasdon of the Legal Assistance Center for the Homeless in Manhattan. ''It gives people the impression that something's being done, but it's not.''
Measured in paint or plaster, protein or pajamas, the law, named for Representative Stewart B. McKinney, a Connecticut Republican who died shortly before its enactment, has made a difference in the lives of dozens of New York organizations. Some McKinney money goes straight to nonprofit agencies working with the homeless; other programs filter the funds through state or local governments. The funds have bolstered longstanding relief efforts and, in a few cases, supported innovative new programs.
Because the legislation helps local groups, Mr. Bush has linked it to his vision of an America burning with ''a thousand points of light'' - a multiplicity of volunteer efforts that chase away the shadow of need.
But critics of the act point to the numbers in arguing that it leaves more dark than spark. Even if Congress approves Mr. Bush's latest budget request, the McKinney Act would provide only $749 million a year nationwide, a figure that advocates say pales beside the undetermined billions spent by local and state governments and private organizations.
 
'A Drop in the Bucket'
In New York State, the McKinney Act has contributed an average of about $35 million a year for the last three years, according to Government figures. By contrast, a single agency of the New York City government, the Human Resources Administration, spends about $330 million a year on programs to assist the homeless, city officials said. A study of state government spending showed $500 million spent on programs for the homeless in a 20-month period, beginning in April 1987. Other governments and private groups spent many millions more.
''The Federal resources are a drop in the bucket,'' said Nancy Travers, assistant commissioner in the State Department of Social Services.
Housing statistics offer another measure of the act's modest scope. City officials say homelessness stems in part from the destruction of boarding houses and hotels where single people used to lodge, many suffering from mental illness or alcoholism. Over several decades, urban development has destroyed tens of thousands of units of single-room-occupancy housing. According to the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the McKinney Act has helped replace 91.
While estimates of the number of homeless people are notoriously imprecise, advocates say that on any night 30,000 people sleep in public and private shelters in New York City and perhaps as many sleep in parks, subways and streets.
 
Part of a Larger Plan
Anna Kondratas, an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a key Bush Administration figure on policy toward the homeless, said she agreed that the McKinney Act had offered modest money and many bureaucratic difficulties. But she said its sums, which the Administration is working to increase, loom larger in perspective outside New York, where state and local spending on the homeless is unusually high. And she said the Administration has taken steps to reduce the law's red tape.
Further, the McKinney Act is only one part of a larger Administration plan to help the homeless, she said, adding, ''We must go far beyond the McKinney Act.''
The President's proposed budget, released last month, seeks about $1.2 billion for a low-income housing initiative called Project Hope. About $246 million of that is designated for those who are homeless. In addition, Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp has pledged to offer the homeless 10 percent of the Federal Housing Administration's foreclosed single-family homes, a move that he said will make at least 5,000 homes available.
In another move to help the homeless, the F.H.A. plans to offer insurance for single-room-occupancy housing, to make its development more financially attractive.
Many advocates for the homeless said those steps are worthy but small, compared with the drop in Federal appropriations for subsidized housing, to $7.9 billion in 1990 from $30.2 billion in 1981. ''It takes us slightly beyond the McKinney Act, but just slightly,'' said Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, who was a chief lobbyist behind the act's passage.
 
A Bill Signed at Night
The McKinney Act was never intended to solve the problem of homelessness, only to provide temporary relief. ''It was a given from the beginning that this was just an emergency measure,'' Ms. Foscarinis said.
Nonetheless, the law, was a significant political step. President Ronald Reagan had long argued that the care of the homeless was a local responsibility, not a Federal one.
Mr. Reagan took the unusual step of signing the bill at night, to communicate what one White House aide called a ''lack of enthusiasm'' for the very programs that Mr. Bush began to tout a year later. In thumbing his nose at the measure, critics say, Mr. Reagan may have sent a signal encouraging the bureaucratic slowdowns that they say have subverted it.
The act's effectiveness was further limited by the lack of full financing, the yearly gap of several hundred million dollars between the ceilings that Congress authorized and the money it actually appropriated. A Success Story A Young Mother Enrolled in College If small in the universe of total aid to the homeless, the McKinney Act registers large in the world of several local programs. Among them is Bethany House, home to 10 young mothers and their children in a former convent in Brooklyn.
''In our instance it was a godsend,'' said Sister Nancy DeCesare, the program director. ''It helped keep us alive.''
With a yearly budget of $350,000, the program was $80,000 short last spring, she said, and about to reduce its size. A $45,582 grant from a McKinney program has helped meet the many mundane needs of mother and child: textbooks, snowsuits, underwear, playpens.
Natasha Castillo, 20 years old, is among the beneficiaries. She and her daughter Nefertiti, who is now 17 months old, moved into Bethany House last May. Like most of the program's residents, Ms. Castillo grew up in a succession of foster homes. They were unimpressive enough to have left her vague about the number of moves or the names of her substitute parents.
 
'You Learn to Be a Family'
Her natural parents died when she was 6 - something to do with drugs, she said, though relatives have not shared the details. She thinks her mother was pushed off a roof in the Bronx.
At 16, Ms. Castillo joined a Job Corps program in upstate New York, where she became pregnant by a fellow student. She said they began sharing an apartment in the Bronx, where ''I didn't do nothing but get up, stay in bed, and eat all day.'' They fought. She left. When she moved into Bethany House, her boyfriend threatened to kill her.
But she credits her stay there with arresting what had become a downward slide. ''I didn't care about nobody,'' she said. ''In here, you learn to be a family - how to show your emotions.''
Ms. Castillo gets up at 6 A.M. -house rules. She attends counseling sessions and classes on sex education and how to be a parent. Last semester, she enrolled at Borough of Manhattan Community College. ''A freshman's supposed to have a 1.75,'' she said, ''and I had a 2.08!''
Her classmates were surprised to learn she was homeless. ''They thought homeless people were supposed to be bummy and smelly,'' she said.
Ms. Castillo keeps several prized clippings taped to the mirror in her room. One is a school brochure depicting a young black woman, like Ms. Castillo, arms confidently crossed, schoolbook in hand. ''Now I'm making it,'' it reads.
''I like the words,'' Ms. Castillo said. ''Cause I'm making it, too.'' The Funds at Work Keeping a Few Men Off the Streets A recent visit to the Bronx offered a different look at McKinney money at work. The setting is Harbor House, a home for 34 mentally ill drug addicts. Some have spent years living on subways. Others have camped behind the bushes in Central Park. Most have tried to kill themselves.
It doesn't take much to ruin their day. Peter P.'s community college instructor recently returned an essay with the comment, ''Great job!'' Peter said the note sent him running to his psychiatrist. ''I said, 'Do you think the brother's jacking me up or what?' ''
Harbor House combines group living and group therapy, with an emphasis on self-help. Residents are expected to help run the program and monitor one another's welfare.
One type of monitoring goes by the name of ''pull-ups'': brotherly admonitions like ''don't slouch'' or ''turn down the T.V.'' Less brotherly confrontations occur in twice-weekly encounter sessions, where streetwise colleagues cast a skeptical eye on the games addicts play. The result is often a verbal brawl.
Toward the end of one recent session, Pedro E. accused Ali R. and Miguel L. of being ''crime-ees'' - friends growing close for the wrong reasons.
Ali had a few thoughts in response. Few are printable. He began by denouncing Pedro's ''disrespectful, irresponsible attitude'' and ended by likening him to untreated sewage.
You too, said Pedro. ''How do you think I feel, Mr. Positive,'' he taunted. ''I got problems, man, or I wouldn't be in here.''
 
Double Afflictions
Psychiatrists say the vitriol of such confrontations is an important part of treating drug addicts, whose abilities to deceive themselves and others often triumph over softer approaches.
Ali agreed. ''They were showing me concern,'' he said after the session.
The model used at Harbor House, called a therapeutic community, has been used widely for drug addicts and occasionally for the mentally ill. But administrators at Harbor House said they are the first to try the approach on men suffering from both afflictions. Most programs for drug addicts exclude the mentally ill and vice versa. As a result, hard-core homeless people suffering with both problems fall through the cracks.
Without McKinney money - $575,000 in renovation funds and $354,000 a year toward operations - administrators said the program could not exist. ''The McKinney program has been particularly good to us,'' said Elizabeth L. Sturz, president of Argus Community, the home's parent organization. ''If not, there would be another few dozen men out on the street.'' The Criticism Good-News Agency 'Is in a Shambles'
Critics of the McKinney Act say these accomplishments do not justify Mr. Bush's repeated celebrations of it.
They lament not only the amount of money provided but also what they call the impediments to its distribution. These have included technical points, involving things like application requirements and deadlines, and what the critics call bureaucratic sloth in administering the program.
One object of criticism has been the Interagency Council on the Homeless, which Congress created with the act. It was to provide one-stop shopping for the thousands of diverse community groups looking for McKinney information: details on deadlines, matching-fund provisions and the like. Beyond that it was supposed to proselytize, to reach out and spread the good news of available Federal funds.
But until very recently, critics say, the council did neither. Its first chairman, Samuel R. Pierce, then H.U.D. Secretary, sent a letter telling field personnel not to let the council's work ''intrude upon a coordinator's existing duties for an extended period of time.'' And by most accounts they didn't. ''We have received no information, assistance, consultation or advice from them,'' wrote Grace K. Lewis of the Ohio Department of Mental Health, in one of a dozen such letters submitted to Congress last March. ''For all intents and purposes, the Interagency Council doesn't exist.''
 
Took Time to Lobby
But the council did find time to lobby the National Association of Home Builders to exclude ''strident'' views from a 1988 conference that sought Mr. Pierce's attendance.
''It is perhaps generous to say that the council is in a shambles,'' concluded Representative Cardiss Collins, an Illinois Democrat, whose House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing held hearings last March.
With the change of Administrations, H.U.D. officials have replaced all nine of the council's professional staff members. Local officials say that while those changes are welcome, the McKinney Act is almost three years old and the council is only beginning to perform its role. Bureaucratic Knots Application Form With 66 Pages Those agencies that do get the word about McKinney programs often describe them as user-unfriendly. Applications are often difficult, they say, reimbursements slow, and program regulations inhibiting.
Sanctuary for Families, a Manhattan organization that runs two shelters for battered women, learned in February 1988 that it had been awarded $11,500 in McKinney money to buy a new boiler. The problem was collecting it: records show the check arrived 15 months later.
''It was completely ridiculous,'' said Alisa Del Tufo, the executive director, who estimated that she spent about 60 hours trying to untie the bureaucratic knots. ''Thousands of dollars were wasted trying to administer the stupid thing. I would never do it again.''
In trying to establish a shelter in Elizabeth, N.J., Michael Fabricant ran up against a different McKinney problem. He started a nonprofit corporation, hoping to find a rundown building, renovate it, and provide housing for five homeless families.
He needed about $200,000 for the project and sought to raise half of it from H.U.D. Then came the complications. H.U.D. regulations required organizations to have control of the site before applying for the funds. But market economics lean the other way: It takes money to buy property.
Eventually, through a sympathetic real-estate broker, Mr. Fabricant found an owner willing to wait the six months it would take to apply. But when Mr. Fabricant discovered that it would take several months more for the Government to release the check, even if the project were approved, the building owner balked.
And so did Mr. Fabricant. ''I've given up on H.U.D.,'' he said. ''What we're doing is raising money through church groups. Who knows if it'll ever materialize?'' #17 Pages of Fine Print The mere bulk of some applications has dissuaded some smaller nonprofit groups - pivotal to Mr. Bush's thousand-points strategy - from applying.
Bensonhurst Homeless Residence Inc., a Brooklyn shelter with 12 beds, is among them. The group heard that it might be able to get money to expand. Then it got the application. The preface alone was six pages. The main document ran 33 pages, with 26 sections seeking information on things like zoning, legal authority, flood plains, equal-opportunity certificates, environmental reviews, operating budgets, development schedules and employee assistance programs.
Then came 17 pages of fine print called ''24 CFR Parts 840 and 841: Supportive Housing Demonstration Program; Rules and Notices.''
And its sequel, ''Notice of Changes to Final Rule'' - a 10-page postscript.
''When we got all the forms, forget it,'' said Joseph Buccheri, the director. ''You had to have a Philadelphia lawyer on staff.''
Ms. Kondratas, the assistant H.U.D. secretary, agreed that bureaucratic impediments have reduced the program's effectiveness. ''It could have been better run, even at the levels funded,'' she said. In some cases, she said, the bureaucratic burdens were written in by Congress, which required things like environmental reviews.
In other instances, the problems come from competing interests. Without proof of site control, for instance, the Government might award money to projects that fall through. This, she said, would waste time and leave valuable funds idle. She said H.U.D. has since revised its rules so that groups may apply if they can show they are likely to acquire property. Surplus Property Why a Golf Course Wasn't Available Perhaps the clearest indication of how bureaucratic barriers have stood between the McKinney Act and its goals can be seen in the case of surplus Federal property.
The act requires Federal agencies to make unused property available to groups working with the homeless. Mr. Bush cited this program during the debate, saying, ''There are certain Army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.''
But Government officials say that no more than two dozen of an estimated 5,000 such properties have actually been turned over to the homeless. A Federal district judge accused the Defense Department last year of ''flirting with contempt of court'' through its resistance to the law.
Ms. Foscarinis, the lobbyist who led the fight for passage of the McKinney Act, has twice filed suit to speed the surplus-property program along. Two dozen Federal agencies were supposed to draw up lists of idle property and forward them to H.U.D., which would determine which were suitable. Instead, H.U.D. was allowing the agencies to make that determination.
This, Ms. Foscarinis argued, was a fatal flaw since few Federal agencies are eager to surrender their property. And few did - 18 out of 24 agencies wrote H.U.D. to say they could not find a single piece of available property. In September 1988, Judge Oliver Gasch of Federal District Court in Washington ordered H.U.D. to take over the duty.
 
A Matter of Definition
But what is idle property anyway?
The McKinney Act defined it as ''underutilized.'' Underutilized, as the Federal bureaucracy chose to interpret it, was a specific, technical term lifted from the rulebooks of Federal property law. It was not to be confused with ''unutilized'' property. Or ''surplus'' property. Or ''excess'' property. Each of those types of empty property had their own technical definitions and, in the Government's eyes, they were not available to the homeless.
Underutilized, in the eyes of groups working with the homeless, wasn't so complicated. It was empty buildings where the homeless might live, or idle land on which a shelter could be built.
In Bob Nasdor's eyes, it was three empty acres in Montclair, N.J., where decades earlier a military golf course had stood, and where he wanted to build homes for 30 homeless families.
He said that when he asked the Government how to apply for the land, he was told that it was ''excess,'' not ''underutilized,'' so he could not have it.
Judge Gasch dismissed the Government's interpretation out of hand, commenting wryly that Government lawyers were ''not daunted'' by the contradictions in their own arguments. Among them was the contention that the McKinney Act intended to offer to the homeless buildings that were half empty but not those that were completely so.
The Government had ''interpreted the act to exclude almost all unused Federal properties from consideration,'' he ruled.
Ms. Foscarinis said: ''They have done everything possible to sabotage the program. They've fought it every step of the way.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Those For Whom 'Peace Dividend' Means Deficit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The movements that were fueled by the cold war are finding that its apparent demise may be good for the world but bad for their business.
Membership is dwindling, and contributions are drying up. Staff members, as well as donors, are defecting to new causes.
The Institute for the Common Defense in Washington, proponent of a stonger military, has disconnected its phone and is apparently no longer in operation. 
Nuclear Times, the peace movement's most popular magazine, stopped publishing six months ago.
 
'They're in Trouble'
Morale at SANE/Freeze, the largest peace group in the country, plummeted when debt forced the group to lay off a quarter of its national staff and cut salaries.
The American Security Council, one of the most successful pro-defense lobbies, has lost half its 300,000 members since 1985. To stay solvent, the group recently sold land adjacent to its headquarters in the Washington suburbs.
''They're in trouble now that peace has broken out,'' said Paul Warnke, the chief arms negotiator in the Carter Administration. ''It's what the Salk vaccine did for the March of Dimes.''
Just as that organization had to refashion its mission to address birth defects when polio no longer threatened the nation, so hawks and doves are searching for a new role in the age of Gorbachev.
 
Searching the Horizon
''We are moving from nuclear disarmament to nuclear waste,'' said Janice Kelly, fiscal manager for Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament, based in Arlington, Mass. ''People's priorities keep changing to something more glamorous on the horizon.''
In the 1980's, Communism was the common adversary and Ronald Reagan was the common rallying point, said Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, a Washington-based advocacy group that has had financial difficulties.
Recalling the old days of fund raising, he said, ''It was possible to put your fishing line in the barrel and come up with a 20-inch bass.''
For decades, the anti-Communists and peace groups confronted each other at demonstrations, faced off on the talk shows and raised millions of dollars to elect sympathetic candidates and unseat opponents. They fed and prospered from each other's rhetoric as well as their own successes. What's Left to Fight For? Now both are sides fighting a tide that is moving to new shores, to issues like abortion, poverty and the environment. Some conservatives are foreseeing what the essayist Charles Krauthammer has called the ''conservative crackup'' as longtime supporters splinter into new directions.
''It's hard to maintain your edge when you continually win Presidential elections, the economy continues to be strong and then on top of that the Berlin wall collapses,'' said John Buckley, a political consultant to conservative groups.
Since the changes in Eastern Europe, fund raising for anti-Communist efforts has dropped off, said Bruce Eberle, a direct-mail fund-raiser whose clients include many conservative groups. ''There's less interest in the issue,'' he said.
Peace groups whose ranks had grown during the arms buildup under Ronald Reagan are suffering the same malaise as conservatives.
 
'A Casualty of Victory'
''Basically, Gorbachev put us out of business,'' said Elliott Negin, the former editor of Nuclear Times, who has been freelancing since his magazine folded. ''Hey! Look at me. I'm happy about it, but I'm a casualty of the victory.''
Mr. Negin said the magazine was finally forced to close after private foundations, which provided one-third of the publication's operating expenses, decided that nuclear disarmament was no longer a crucial issue.
At Physicians for Social Responsibility, a Washington-based disarmament organization, donations are down 58 percent from a year ago, said John Loretz, director of communications.
''We saw a very steep rise in our membership through 1985, the height of the arms race,'' Mr. Loretz said. ''But when people felt the threat of nuclear war was more remote, we saw a cooling off in contributions. The urgency is clearly not there in the mind of the public like it was a few years ago.''
 
Treaties Dash Fund Raising
John Miller, a staff member at the New York-based Mobilization for Survival, a group that has traditionally focused on disarmament issues, said there had been a noticeable fall-off in contributions. ''With every treaty signed, raising money becomes more difficult,'' he said. ''If you win a little bit, people think you've won the whole thing.''
Brent Bozell, finance director of the National Conservative Political Action Committee, argues that it is still possible to raise money for conservative causes, including foreign policy, but that the strategy must change.
There are opportunities, Mr. Bozell said, for conservatives who want to help shape the political and economic future of Eastern Europe. Money is pouring in for people monitoring elections and running training seminars in capitalism, he said.
''It can't be an anti-Communist movement but a pro-freedom one,'' Mr. Bozell said. ''That's the new reality.''
 
Work to Be Done
Both hard-liners and peace activists stress that their work is not yet done. Cold Warriors warn against premature complacency and excessive faith in Mikhail S. Gorbachev. And peace groups note that despite the talk of peace, the military budget proposed by President Bush for the next fiscal year is still larger than this year's.
''In our mailings and our newsletters, we are raising the cautionary sign,'' said David Keene, who heads the American Conservative Union. The group, which a decade ago numbered 750,000, today claims 50,000 donors. ''What Gorbachev is saying is very encouraging, but the Soviets are not changing their defense spending. They're still pouring money into Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and the cold war is not over for those people who are dying in these parts of the world.''
Peace groups are fighting just as hard to diminish the perception that the United States and the Soviet Union are disarming. It is one of the most difficult hurdles peace groups are facing, said the Rev. William Sloane Coffin Jr., president of SANE/Freeze, which claims 170,000 members.
''It's great, what's going on,'' Mr. Coffin said. But he added: ''The military budget is our Berlin wall, and the Congress its guard. Bringing down that wall is a very big job for the peace movement.''
Despite efforts to regroup their forces, defections from the peace movement have already begun.
''I can't see myself staying around much longer,'' said one organization's director, who asked not to be identified. ''The world has changed, and I am looking for other idealistic causes. There are a lot of other pressing needs now.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: GERMAN WHIRLWIND;
Whose Terms, NATO's or Moscow's, For a Unification That Seems Likely?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 11

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union sowed the wind last October when he signaled that it was time for the old East German leadership under Erich Honecker to go. Now, perhaps long before he expected it, he may reap the whirlwind of German unification.
In separate meetings over the last two weeks with the leaders of East and West Germany, Mr. Gorbachev appears to have accepted the inevitable absorption of East Germany, where 400,000 Soviet troops are still stationed, by the more powerful and populous West Germany, where more than 200,000 American troops are posted.
But if the general outcome is already preordained, the form and conditions of unification are not. Whether a united German state will be neutral and demilitarized, as Soviet policy since Stalin has insisted, or remain aligned with the West as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as the United States and the West German Government insist, will be decided in a flurry of negotiations leading to an anticipated meeting in the fall of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Mr. Gorbachev, like President Bush, seems to have realized that he cannot veto that process, but he can shape it. On Saturday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed in several hours of talks with Mr. Gorbachev in the Kremlin that while unification was for the Germans to decide, it could not take place against ''the legitimate interests of our neighbors, friends and partners in Europe and the world.''
Exactly what either Moscow or the Germans mean by that is uncertain. Some diplomats think a neutral demilitarized Germany is what Mr. Gorbachev wants. But even if his abandonment of Mr. Honecker last fall was a clever ploy to bring that about, few here believe he has been in control of the situation since.
 
Power Over East German Events
The West Germans have more power over events in East Germany these days than Soviet or East German officials do. Once the East German border was opened in November, East Germans were free to move to West Germany, and 2,000 to 3,000 a day have been doing so ever since. As the drain continues, local government authority, public services and civic morale in East Germany have been steadily undermined, and West German politicians and political parties have moved into the vacuum.
Mr. Kohl acknowledged that in their talks this weekend, he and Mr. Gorbachev discussed the subject of West German politicians' interference in the campaign for parliamentary elections in the East on March 18.
''I pointed out that among them were a number of personalities who are very well known here - Willy Brandt, for instance, and Egon Bahr - and that strengthened their understanding here,'' Mr. Kohl said at a news conference Saturday night. Mr. Brandt, the former West German Chancellor, and Mr. Bahr, his former foreign policy adviser, are highly respected as the architects of West German reconciliation with Moscow and Eastern Europe in the 1970's. Both are also members of Mr. Kohl's Social Democratic opposition.
With their help, the new East German Social Democratic Party is expected to emerge as the winner of next month's elections there, and if it does, Mr. Kohl could face a stiffer challenge from the West German Social Democrats in his own elections in December.
But will East Germany still exist as a separate state by then? At the end of last month, its caretaker Communist Prime Minister, Hans Modrow, got Mr. Gorbachev to acknowledge that German unification was, indeed, on the international agenda, dropping opposition expressed after the opening of the Berlin wall on Nov. 9. Soviet officials gave cautious backing to the ''Modrow plan'' for unity by stages, with both German states gradually dissolving from their respective alliances and becoming demilitarized.
But events in Germany are rushing ahead so fast that the Modrow plan won't be discussed when the East German leader meets Mr. Kohl in Bonn on Tuesday, the West German Chancellor said Saturday. A new emergency has arisen - the possibility of financial collapse in East Germany. So Mr. Kohl and Mr. Modrow will discuss a West German plan for replacement of the largely worthless East German currency by the West German mark.
The reason, the Chancellor implied, was to shore up the failing confidence of the East German people in their economy and encourage some of them to stay put instead of fleeing to West Germany in search of a better life.
''We are in an unbelievably dynamic process,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''A process that we aren't accelerating, but that people in the G.D.R. are accelerating, day by day.'' But the dynamic is also complex. Pronouncements by West German officials in Bonn about imminent insolvency in East Germany can easily be self-fulfilling. And only officials in Bonn have the means to stave it off.
 
Access to Western Technology
The Soviet Union has vital economic interests in Germany. Western diplomats here speculate that if Mr. Gorbachev is willing to see East Germany go under, one reason is that a united Germany would offer him far-greater access to Western technology, investment, trade and credit than it now has.
East German foreign trade with the Soviet Union, equally divided between imports and exports, is nearly three times as much as West Germany's, and includes long-term contracts for deliveries of machine tools and other heavy industrial products vital to the Soviet economy.
Mr. Kohl said Saturday that even if all those factories soon became absorbed into the West German economic system, ''We can arrive at an agreement satisfactory to the Soviet Union.'' He gave the same answer to the question about what would happen to the Soviet troops stationed there now. But both problems will not be easy to resolve.
Over the coming months, Mr. Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and their East German counterparts will be holding a continuous round of consultations with the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France - the four occupying powers who defeated Hitler in World War II. And this fall, some kind of framework for German unity seems likely to be discussed at a summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 
Idea of a Neutral Germany
Some of Mr. Genscher's recent statements imply that standing bodies of the conference could eventually replace the Warsaw Pact and the NATO alliance, and provide the security guarantees that neither Mr. Gorbachev nor Mr. Kohl was willing to spell out in public this weekend. Eventually, a united Germany would have to negotiate a peace treaty with the 80 countries that had declared hostilities by the end of World War II.
And some of them, a Western diplomat speculated, would not be comfortable with the Soviet idea of a neutral Germany, a country of 78 million people demilitarized or armed, like neutral Switzerland. Perhaps for that reason, Mr. Gorbachev did not publicly insist on it in his talks with Mr. Kohl, who said later, ''From German soil should emanate not war, but peace.''
''German unity has always been an academic question for the Soviets,'' an East German diplomat said the other day. ''I think now they don't quite know what to do. They're just trying to keep up with developments, and save what little they can.''

HEADLINE: New Notions On Old Crisis In Argentina

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
Like many of his countrymen, one of Argentina's leading industrialists was talking the other day about what is wrong with his country and what ought to be done about it.
''How many civilized countries are there where it is possible to make fortunes doing absolutely nothing?'' Hector Massuh asked. ''Where people get rich,'' he continued, ''without ever having produced anything, without having created a business, planted a tree or seeded grain - fortunes made by just moving papers around, placing financial instruments here and there?''
Here, he noted, the Government has to pay such high interest on its domestic debt, quite aside from its problems with foreign debt, that people of modest needs can live off the interest from just a few thousand dollars of capital. 
''There are entire provinces where people live without working,'' he said. ''Countries can't function that way.'' Argentine Riddle: Why?
Argentina is passing through another of its increasingly frequent economic crises, with inflation that is expected to exceed 50 percent for January alone just the tip of an iceberg of structural problems. As a result, many people go to extremes in describing the problem or proposing solutions.
Such talk is not new. What is sometimes called ''the Argentine riddle'' has been debated by historians, economists and political scientists for decades. It is this: Why has a basically European immigrant population been unable to create an advanced industrial nation and liberal democracy on a resource-laden piece of the earth? The answers expressed these days by ordinary Argentines make the experts sound bland.
It is not unusual to hear taxi drivers say they would welcome an invasion by the United States, ''even if they planted the Stars and Stripes right there in that plaza,'' as one said.
Other Argentines in this city of 11 million people talk of immigrating to Australia or speculate about how their lives would be if their parents or grandparents had not decided to come here from Italy. The successes of the once-poor ancestral homelands of about 40 percent of Argentines are the subject of envy and admiration.
The novelist Oswaldo Soriano said in a conversation a few months ago that his solution for Argentina was for Italy to invade and annex this eighth largest country in the world in land size. Argentina, he said, ''would provide plenty of cheap, skilled labor for Italian industry.''
 
Causes: Fear of the Left
The author, a self-described leftist, said with a more or less straight face that there would be almost no resistance to an Italian occupation, while invasion by Spain or the United States would stir anti-colonialist passions.
Carlos H. Waisman, a sociology professor at the University of California at San Diego, in a new book, ''Reversal of Development in Argentina,'' offers a complicated explanation of what went wrong.
He says that going into the 1930's, Argentina was following the same path of development as other nations that are now world leaders but was gradually derailed by fears among ''political elites'' of leftist revolution, fear that he says was based on a ''distorted image of the working class.''
The result was the basically rightist form of socialism that Juan Peron promoted after coming to power in 1946. Although identified as Peronism, the concept enjoyed some acceptance from most political groups in Argentina until recently. The consequences, Mr. Waisman writes, have been ''stagnation and illegitimacy.''
Today, the list of troubles adding up to what President Carlos Saul Menem calls ''the long sickness of the Argentine economy'' includes fiscal deficits that typically exceed 10 percent of the gross national product, tax evasion as a way of life, low productivity, a bloated state payroll and heavy dependence on the state by private enterprise.
 
Promises on Several Fronts
There is also the poor quality of manufactured goods protected by high tariffs, the large amount of business that is done off the books or by the underground economy, the speculation and usury to which Mr. Massuh alluded, corruption, and the tendency of Argentines to keep their savings and investments abroad - an estimated $50 billion worth, almost equal the official gross national product.
Mr. Menem, going against the tradition of his party, the Justicialist movement founded by Mr. Peron, promises to eliminate all those failings. Since taking office in July, he has set forth a series of plans to reduce the state's role in the economy and says he intends to ''privatize private enterprise,'' an allusion to the custom of the Government's guaranteeing markets and profits for private businesses.
But curing these ailments seems to require immediate attention to every part of the economy at once, and the Argentine Government and society lack the money, skills, and, in some cases, the desire to do that. For instance, overhauling state enterprises will probably require firing people, an almost unmentionable idea at the moment.
Miklos Banyai, the Hungarian commercial counselor in Argentina, said he had noted some similarities between the problems of Argentina and his country. He said that both countries created ''overprotected industries'' after World War II, but that Hungary was now ''a bit ahead'' of Argentina in deregulating and taming its bureaucracy.
''Everything is complicated in Argentina,'' said Mr. Massuh, who with his father runs a paper and cellulose concern. ''To export is complicated. To import is complicated. If you want to pay your light bill that is complicated. Argentina has to become a simpler country with much clearer rules, and that's not going to be easy.''

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS: AN UNWAVERING OPPONENT AND AN UNPREDICTABLE LEADER OF SOUTH AFRICA;
Frederik Willem de Klerk

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
There is little in the personal and political history of F. W. de Klerk to suggest that he would be the South African leader to make the bold gestures that have set his country on a course of uncertainty and hope.
Mr. de Klerk, the ninth, and possibly the last, white man to lead South Africa since it was formed in 1910, had always stayed well in the safe middle ground of the tightly structured organization that is the ruling National Party. Until his selection as party leader a year ago this month, he had never taken a single initiative toward change.
But when he assumed the presidency in September, he was obliged to confront a series of daunting realities, from the state of the country's economy to continued criticism from abroad. In his inauguration speech, he urged his fellow white South Africans to join him in creating ''a totally changed South Africa.'' 
 
'Nixon in China' Syndrome
Mr. de Klerk may be an example of what historians have come to call the ''Nixon in China'' syndrome, in which a leader has accumulated the political credentials and capital to act against expectations. One South African official suggested recently in private that Mr. de Klerk also was exhilarated by the possibility of achieving a notable role in history as the man who presided over his country's transition from apartheid.
When Mr. de Klerk outlined his intention last week to free Nelson Mandela and make legal such opposition groups as the African National Congress in an effort to negotiate the shape of the country's future, he was keenly aware of the world audience and its high expectations toward his remarks. In 1985, Mr. de Klerk's predecessor, P. W. Botha, faced similar high expectations from abroad for a much-anticipated speech he was to give at a party congress in Durban.
Mr. de Klerk is said by several South Africans to have pressed Mr. Botha into making the defiant speech he gave, which produced deep disappointment and fueled the international movement to impose economic sanctions against Pretoria. The negative reaction to Mr. Botha's address is said to have had a profound effect on Mr. de Klerk.
In making the speech, Mr. Botha was following the instincts of generations of South African leaders to look inward to the concerns of their own Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and Huguenot settlers who arrived in the Cape Town area in the 17th century. National Party figures like Mr. Botha were conditioned by electoral politics to placate right-wing voters by taking defiant stands against international critics.
While his predecessors were always preoccupied with their conservative constituencies, Mr. de Klerk may be the first South African leader to cast his vision more broadly, seeking approval from the world community.
Frederik Willem de Klerk was born in Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city, on March 18, 1936, to a family prominent in Afrikaner politics.
 
Known as F. W. From Early Age
His father was the headmaster of a school and flourished in Afrikaner politics, becoming the National Party's secretary in the Transvaal province, a post similar to the one the son was to occupy decades later. Mr. de Klerk's uncle was J. G. Strydom, South Africa's prime minister in the mid-1950's and a prime exponent of apartheid.
Mr. de Klerk was known as F. W. from an early age, not only because it is a common Afrikaner custom for men to go by their initials, but also to distinguish him from his grandfather, who was called Frederik Willem.
Mr. de Klerk grew up steeped in the Afrikaner outlook, viewing the world with a proud insularity. When the Afrikaners fought off African tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries, the settlers adopted a tactic of circling their oxcarts in a protective formation known as a laager. In recent years, the concept of the laager has served as a metaphor for the Afrikaners' closing of their ranks against criticism from abroad.
The Afrikaners were suspicious of the whites descended from English colonists and fearful of the majority black Africans. They developed the concept of apartheid, or racial separation, and purported to find justification for it in the Bible.
 
Extended Stays Abroad
Through party and group discipline, the National Party took over the Government in 1948 and has retained control since.
Mr. de Klerk has told people that extended stays in Britain and the United States earlier in his career gave him a broader perspective. His visit to the United States in 1976 was paid for by the United States Information Agency as part of a program for bringing foreigners with leadership potential to the United States.
He clearly delighted in travels to Lusaka, Zambia, one of the leading black African nations opposing apartheid, and to London and Bonn in the last year, saying he hoped South Africa's status as an international outcast would soon end.
Mr. de Klerk was about to accept a position in 1972 to teach law at Potchefstroom University, an Afrikaans-language institution, when he was invited to run for Parliament. His wife, Marike, initially resisted, but then encouraged him to seek a life in politics, taking a job as a bookkeeper to help boost the family income. They have two sons, Jan and Willem, and a daughter, Susan.
Mr. de Klerk, who trained as a lawyer, was long considered a rising star in Afrikaner politics along with his elder brother, Willem. While he began a bustling law practice, his brother, an ordained minister, became a leading editor of an Afrikaans-language newspaper. Both were members of the Broederbond, a semi-secret society of prominent Afrikaners from areas like religion, government and journalism, which until a few years ago was said to control the country.
His brother may have been one of those surprised by Mr. de Klerk's boldness. When Mr. de Klerk took over the party last year, Willem de Klerk associated himself with a rival party to the left of the National Party and told interviewers that he thought his brother was capable only of incremental, cautious changes.
His brother's philosophy, Willem de Klerk said, was ''don't rock the boat.''

HEADLINE: SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA;
Freedom for South African Releases Joy in New York

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Inside the House of the Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn, where the stickers saying ''Free Nelson Mandela'' have not yet been scraped off the doors, several hundred people gathered in an exuberant service yesterday, providing evidence that Mr. Mandela's release resonates far beyond South Africa.
After a time filled with singing and dancing and tears, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry led his congregation outside, where he stood on a table and delivered his sermon.
''I want to make my statement out in the street - I want to be like Mandela,'' said Mr. Daughtry, who conducted the service wearing a sweatshirt that said ''End Apartheid.'' 
 
Statement by Mayor Dinkins
While Mr. Daughtry preached joy tempered with sadness at the House of the Lord that South Africa is not entirely free, Mayor David N. Dinkins told a news conference at Gracie Mansion that he was elated by the news of Mr. Mandela's release. ''The Government of South Africa has taken a welcomed first step,'' he said.
Mr. Dinkins pledged to press for legislation in the City Council to strengthen New York City's 1985 law imposing sanctions against South Africa.
David Scott, an aide to the Mayor, said the law prohibits the city from doing business with companies that do business with South Africa. The proposed amendment, he said, would also prohibit doing business with countries that have indirect ties to South Africa.
At the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, a gathering of over 200 people, including Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, attending a convocation for peace in the Middle East gave a special tribute to Mr. Mandela.
The congregation gave a standing ovation to Susan Nmambosa, the representative of the African National Congress in New York. She said that while she had never seen Mr. Mandela, she said she ''felt like crying.''
She said that she was a child when he was taken into custody and she said that today, her -year-old son, said: '' 'Mommy, isn't it nice. It's Black History Month, and Nelson Mandela is coming out of jail?' ''
At the House of the Lord, in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, many worshipers said they had been up all night, waiting for the moment when Mr. Mandela would speak.
''What does this day mean to New Yorkers?'' Mr. Daughtry asked, as the congregation called out encouragement. ''Well, it has a meaning that transcends New Yorkers. The question ought to be replayed, What does it mean for the people across the world?
 
Walls Are Coming 'Tumbling Down'
''In Africa the walls are coming tumbling down,'' he continued. ''And so for African-Americans in particular, it's a great day. We are linked with our brothers and sisters in South Africa.''
For the people who attended the service, it was a special day indeed.
''They woke us up at 7 in the morning to watch him on TV, but I was glad,'' said Terence Hill, age 10, Doris Pinn, a worshiper, said: ''I feel absolutely exhilarated, His incarceration was symbolic of the incarceration of blacks across the world - politically, socially and economically - and his release is symbolic of the breaking of the chains.''
When Mr. Mandela began his address on television, there was shouting and chanting at House of the Lord. And when he finished, raising his arm in front of him in a salute, his audience raised their arms in response.
On the side of the television, a sticker saying ''Free Mandela'' had been cut up and reconfigured, so that the congregation saw it as they strained forward to watch Mr. Mandela's speech. Now it said ''Mandela Free.''

HEADLINE: Valentine in a Survey: Marital Fidelity

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Like the overheated characters on television soap operas, a lot of the research into American sexual behavior has not done much for the notion of marital fidelity. Some studies suggest that 30 percent to 70 percent of married men and women have had affairs.
Now, just in time for Valentine's Day, a random nationwide public opinion sampling gathered by the Gallup Organization is offering what it calls new evidence to the contrary: that married Americans may be more monogamous than most people believed and that fidelity and love are thriving.
The findings are in a report, ''Faithful Attraction,'' written by the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the Chicago priest, sociologist and novelist. He concludes from the Gallup data that fewer than one in 10 currently married people have been unfaithful to their spouse. 
 
Fidelity, Prayer, Baths
''Marital fidelity is epidemic in America,'' Father Greeley says in his article, which will appear in the March issue of the magazine Psychology Today. Among other things, his statistical snapshot of modern marriage concludes not only that four out of five married people say they would marry the same person again but also discloses that 61 percent of married people pray together; 39 percent take baths or showers together and 20 percent have bought erotic underclothes.
But among some sex researchers and sociologists - and cynics - the poll, described as a survey on family and religion and commissioned by Psychology Today and two national television programs, King World's ''Inside Edition'' and ABC's HOME show - is likely to raise as many questions as it proposes to answer.
The survey, based on a nationwide telephone sample of 657 currently married - and not separated - men and women over the age of 18 had a a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. Its findings take sharp issue with the findings of icons like Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, the sex researcher who, in the 1950's, suggested that as many as half the married men of the time and a quarter of the married women had had extramarital affairs.
 
Priest Is Called Naive
The survey also contradicts the more recent work of writers like Shere Hite, whose 1987 study, ''Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress,'' concluded that 70 percent of women married more than five years were having affairs. Her research was later attacked as crude and representing only the discontented.
Colin J. Williams, the former senior researcher for the Kinsey Institute in Indiana, ridiculed Father Greeley's work as ''very naive'' and among other things criticized Gallup's use of a telephone survey to ask people about their sex life.
''If I were having an affair, I sure wouldn't answer their questions about extramarital sex if my wife is in the next room,'' said Mr. Williams, a sociologist at Indiana University's Indianapolis campus. ''What if someone picks up the extension? How do I know for sure who is even calling? Like a lot of Father Greeley's work, it makes great pulp fiction, but it's hardly science.''
But Tom W. Smith, director of the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center, said the work by Father Greeley and Gallup is important because random, scientific polling techniques had been used to address questions of sexual behavior.
 
'The Most Underresearched'
''Given the importance of sexual behavior and its broad social implications,'' Mr. Smith said, ''there is no question this is the most underresearched topic among all the social sciences.''
It was data from the National Opinion Research Center's annual General Social Survey that inspired Father Greeley to write his current report. In 1988 and 1989, inspired by growing concern over AIDS, researchers asked four specific questions about sexual behavior. The questions were on a questionnaire that the respondents filled out and sealed in an envelope, a method intended to increase faith in confidentialty. The respondents were asked how many sexual partners they had in the previous 12 months.
When Father Greeley and Mr. Smith tabulated the data for married people, they found that fewer than one in 20 said they had more than one sexual partner over the previous 12 months. ''The numbers astonished me,'' Father Greeley said.
 
Future Research Agenda
Michael Hout, chairman of the sociology department at the University of California at Berkeley, said the Gallup survey should be regarded ''as a first step, an important step,'' adding, ''The questions Rev. Greeley is raising ought to help shape a future research agenda.''
Dr. Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington, agreed with the call for an agenda, but said she thought the Gallup numbers on infidelity were too low.
At the same time, Dr. Schwartz said she thought it was possible that her research for the 1983 book ''American Couples'' (which she wrote with Philip Blumstein) might have given a higher incidence of infidelity than there was then in the general population because her respondents were not scientifically chosen.
Of the people with whom Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Blumstein talked, about 30 percent of the husbands who had been married more than 10 years said they had had extramarital affairs and about 20 percent of the wives did.
''It's true that the conventional wisdom says infidelity is relatively common,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''But we often disregard the large portion of the population who are, for example, very religious or very inhibited.''
Father Greeley said the view that infidelity is widespread was underscored even in the Gallup survey. Even though less than one in 10 respondents indicated unfaithfulness to the spouse, he said, only a quarter strongly agreed with the proposition that ''most couples are faithful to one another.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Slows Export of Babies for Adoption

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
South Korea, the source of more than half of all foreign babies adopted into American families in recent years, is phasing out its program of sending babies from its orphanages overseas for adoption.
Since 1980, American couples have adopted more than 40,000 Korean babies. But as a result of a booming economy, a lower birth rate and unfavorable international publicity during the 1988 Olympics, South Korea has cut back drastically on the number of babies released for overseas adoption.
According to Immigration and Naturalization Service figures, South Korea sent 3,552 babies to the United States last year, down from a high of 6,188 in 1986. And the decline is likely to be even more dramatic over the next few years as the Korean Government shuts down its carefully controlled system for placing children abroad. 
In response, many adoption agencies are scrambling to expand their programs in India, Thailand, the Philippines, Brazil and Colombia. But international adoptions are an exquisitely sensitive indicator of world politics, and each shift of the political winds can open or shut doors to American adoptive families.
 
Field of Adoption Changes
''India is probably the next largest source of children, but the field of international adoption changes all the time,'' said Roger Bouwma, director of Bethany International Adoptions in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''If there's a change in the government and a very strong wave of nationalism, boom, you're going to see the children kept in their own country no matter what.''
Some adoption officials say a new religious fundamentalism in India is making it substantially harder to pursuade social service workers there to release babies to Christian adoptive homes in the United States.
By the same token, other political changes, like the upheaval in Eastern Europe, may lead to greater receptiveness to adoptions by families in the United States.
 
'Heartstrings Were Touched'
''When we saw Romanian orphanages panning across the television screen, we began to discuss it,'' said Deb Harter, program director at Adoptive Families of America, a Minneapolis-based information and referral group. ''And we started getting phone calls the same Monday morning from families whose heartstrings were touched by the sight of children who needed homes.
''The Romanian Government banned international adoptions in 1987, but our word from the State Department is that the new Government began considering a new law Jan. 15, and may have a decision by mid-February.''
But most adoption officials say it is unlikely that any country will emerge as a new South Korea, sending thousands of children a year to the United States.
''It was a unique situation, growing out of the Korean War and the feeling of responsibility for the Amerasian children there,'' said Susan Cox of Holt International, an agency in Eugene, Ore., that pioneered Korean adoptions. ''But now the birth rate in Korea has declined dramatically. They have put teeth into their one-child-per-family policy. Abortion is becoming more acceptable, and Koreans are adopting more themselves. And certainly there was some feeling of being attacked after the Olympics, with stories calling babies one of Korea's big exports.''
 
Olympic Publicity Cited
Consul Baek-Sang Cho of the South Korean Embassy in Washington said in an interview published by the Adoptive Families group's magazine, OURS, that the Olympics coverage ''forced my Government and the Korean people to sit down and think about what direction Korean international adoptive policies were heading.''
Mr. Cho, who has since moved to the embassy's political section, said he could no longer discuss adoption policies, but the consul general said the quoted comments generally reflected Government policy.
''I want the American people to understand that Korea is now a country, like Japan or the U.S., which is fully able to take care of its own, and as such, we do not wish to send our children to foreign countries,'' Mr. Cho said in the interview. ''The Korean Government does intend eventually to decrease all foreign adoption to near zero. This, of course, will come about gradually as Korean society adjusts to accepting nonrelated children for adoption.''
Koreans have traditionally avoided adoption because of their culture's strong emphasis on ancestry and bloodlines.
Most families seeking to adopt babies from overseas for the first time are being directed by their adoption agencies to other Asian countries, or to South and Central American countries that are expanding their programs. But some families that already have one Korean child are willing to face increasingly long waits to get another.
''It's very important to me that our child have a sibling from the same birth country,'' said Meg Kelsey Wright of Northampton, Mass., who adopted a South Korean baby, Anna, in 1985, and applied in 1987 for another. ''We have made Korean-American friends, and I've been doing some Korean cooking, and I want to be able to support her in learning about her culture. Every year, besides her February birthday, we celebrate ''gotcha day,'' the day in June she came to us, when I get her something from the Korean culture. We feel very enriched.''

HEADLINE: Minnesota Senator's Troubles Stir Little Sympathy at Home

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Minnesota is a state known for its virgin lakes, pioneer spirit and politics so squeaky clean that a city council candidate was once fined for giving away Hostess Twinkees to his constituents.
So the troubles of Senator David Durenberger, a Republican under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for allegations of financial improprieties, are being seen as, well, outright un-Minnesotan.
The new allegations, appearing almost weekly, appear to be trying the patience of ordinary citizens, some of whom have called radio and television talk shows to denounce Mr. Durenberger in terms that range from unflattering to downright scathing.
Senator Durenberger was earlier accused of trying to circumvent Senate limits on income by entering into a questionable $100,000 book deal, of improperly collecting Senate money for his Minneapolis condominium and getting lobbyists to pay for 22 trips to Boston that critics say were made largely for personal reasons. He has denied any wrongdoing while apologizing for lapses in judgment. 
 
New Questions Surfaced
Just as confused and saddened Minnesotans were beginning to come to grips with those charges, new issues were raised by The Minneapolis Star Tribune. The paper reported recently that Mr. Durenberger had received nearly $1 million in loans below the prime interest rate for, among other things, a swimming pool.
And while talk of book deals and condominiums could be shrugged off as the ambiguous perquisites of power, everyone understood what a bank loan was. The idea of a break that big moved a businessman in the Twin Cities, who has paid interest rates of 23 percent on secured loans to keep his small business afloat, to call Nick Coleman, a columnist at The St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch.
The columnist said the businessman, whom he identified only as ''Bob,'' termed the Senator's loans ''hilariously obscene'' and added, ''When I read that our esteemed Senator was borrowing at half the prime rate for his swimming pool, it makes me sick to my stomach.'' The caller said he had voted for Mr. Durenberger in 1988 but would not vote for him again.
 
Approval Rating Tumbles
Other ordinary citizens, while saying they personally liked the Senator, say they find it hard to get over even the appearance of impropriety.
''He's staying in the gray area and trying to make as much money as he can; boy, that irritates me,'' said Douglas MacArthur, a central Minnesota farmer in a call to Almanac, a St. Paul public-affairs program.
Indeed, the approval rating for Senator Durenberger has fallen from 73 percent last October to 41 percent, according to a poll of 800 adults, conducted Jan. 17-23 by The Minneapolis Star Tribune and KSTP-TV. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The reason for the anger and disappointment, some political observers say, is that Minnesotans pride themselves on a kind of Nordic egalitarianism, and elitist pursuits represent a break from that code.
 
'Personal Attacks' Seen
''There's a sense of fair play, of helping people, cleaning each other's walks in the terrible winters,'' said Jim Rogers, host of a public-affairs radio program here. ''Nobody gets swell-headed because the weather's a great leveler. So when it looks like someone's playing it fast and loose with our clean politics, it's un-Minnesotan.''
But Greg Frank, political director of the Minnesota Republican Party, maintained that ''Minnesotans stand firmly behind Durenberger.'' He and other supporters of the Senator blame the news media for coming up with a new scandal seemingly every week. ''A lot of people are tired of the piling on that's been done in the media,'' Mr. Frank said. ''Personal attacks don't play well in Minnesota.''
Senator Durenberger has said he has no intentions of stepping down. But many people here are saying that if the ethics committee finds him guilty of any wrongdoing, he will be forced to do so. As a teacher from St. Paul put it, ''Minnesota is not a forgiving state.''
While most of the state's newspapers and many citizens are awaiting a decision by the ethics committee before passing judgment, The Mankato Free Press has called for his resignation. ''We decided he had become a pariah,'' said Michael Larson, the newspaper's editor.
State Democrats, fearing a backlash, have avoided pressing the issue. People like Patrick Forciea, a Democratic consultant, are hoping that, because of public pressure, they won't have to. ''The leash that Minnesota politicians are on is quite short,'' Mr. Forciea said.

In Detroit, a Spotlight For Black Composers

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Social relevance is a relatively new occupation for symphonic music in this country. America's orchestras - created, maintained and in some cases destroyed - by small, white, prosperous urban enclaves - now find themselves in very different cities, places where minorities have grown into majorities, seek cultural identities appropriate to their status and have learned the uses of political power.
The question of how a basically European tradition can serve a new constituency has become for orchestra managers not just a matter of principle but one of economic survival. Nowhere is the answer more urgently pursued than in Detroit, whose population nears 70 percent black and whose symphony orchestra depends for one-sixth of its $16 million annual budget on the good will of Michigan legislators. 
One recent response was the widely publicized and debated hiring last summer of Richard Robinson, a bass player who was allowed to bypass the usual ''blind'' audition process in order to increase, to two black players, minority representation in the orchestra.
Another was last week's African-American Composers Forum, consisting of reading rehearsals by the Detroit Symphony of new music, a symposium at nearby Ann Arbor and a pair of concerts over the weekend at the Detroit Symphony's newly renovated Orchestra Hall.
Saturday night's program, repeated this afternoon, offered the first performance of the 28-year-old David Soley's ''Ente,'' ''Hiawatha's Wedding Feast'' by the turn-of-the-century composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and then excerpts from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' J. Rosamond Johnson's ''Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' which has virtually become an anthem for the black movement in this country, was sung by the Brazeal Dennard Chorale and by many in the audience as well.
If Saturday's concert was intended to demonstrate black musicians' ability to compose and perform in the European tradition, then that it did. On the other hand, one looked long and hard and without much profit for any sign of the orchestral medium as an expression of the black experience.
Young Mr. Soley's elegant and slightly abstracted music seemed a world away from the energy of ethnic insurgency. ''Ente'' follows, instead, other recent re-examinations of orchestral sound by European composers like Luciano Berio and Pierre Boulez.
In them, expression by means of sheer weight is rejected, but without a return to the smaller, finer ensemble of the pre-Romantic era. Size, in other words, is used more to yield variety than to accumulate power. Mr. Soley creates precisely mixed and clearly separated colors that are layered one upon the other and yet operate more as a multi-party conversation than as a concerted chorus of sound.
The orchestration is fairly traditional with some exotic percussion instruments added on. ''Ente'' is a confident and convincing eight-minute piece that might as easily have sprung from a bright young Hungarian or German as a black American.
''Hiawatha's Wedding Feast,'' by Coleridge-Taylor, the London-born son of an African father and an English mother, uses thumping rhythms and occasional pentatonic melody to underline Longfellow's familiar American Indian saga. But in much the same way, its roots lie less in any ethnic culture as in the plump and sedentary choral tradition of Edwardian England.
It would be nice to report that Coleridge-Taylor's music is buried treasure, suddenly unearthed. Unfortunately, it is painfully inept. Immobilized by its regular movement and limited sense of harmonic adventure, ''Hiawatha's Wedding Feast'' is dragged down and ultimately drowned in the undertow of relentless cadential formulas.
The Brazeal Dennard Chorale, which has a special talent for clear diction, sang it very well, and James N. Moore Jr. was the competent tenor soloist. Yet in the end Longfellow's leaden poetry gets pretty much what it deserves.
Leslie B. Dunner conducted. He held the difficult moments of ''Ente'' together, did the best he could with what Coleridge-Taylor presented him and, despite some missed ensemble connections in early numbers of the Prokofiev, maintained a forceful momentum throughout.

HEADLINE: A Chicago Exhibition on Lincoln's America

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
''A House Divided: America in the Age of Lincoln,'' an exhibition that has just opened at the Chicago Historical Society, is more than a show of bland manuscripts and evenhanded statements about the Civil War. The 600 rare documents and artifacts on view, together with a pointed narrative, have been arranged to make a case for the idea that it was slavery more than secession that led to the conflict.
The exhibition derives its name from the prescient speech on June 16, 1858, in Springfield, Ill., in which Abraham Lincoln, the Republican nominee for United States Senator, said: ''A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall. But I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.''
 
Tables, a Wall, a Printing Press 
It draws on material in the archives of the 133-year-old Chicago Historical Society, and is unmatched by anything now on display in the cases of the Lincoln Collection in Springfield or the Library of Congress in Washington.
Among the highlights of the exhibition are the table at which President Lincoln drafted the Emancipation Proclamation in the White House; the table from the Appomattox Courthouse that was used when the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee agreed to surrender to the Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant; a brick wall from the Libby Prison in Richmond, which held captured Union soldiers under harsh conditions, and the printing press of Elijah Parish Lovejoy, the editor of the Alton (Ill.) Observer, who was killed in 1837 defending his press against a mob opposed to his abolitionist writings.
It also features John Brown's Bible, in which Brown marked passages justifying his antislavery activity; a commemorative copy of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, signed by President Lincoln and his Cabinet, and Lincoln's deathbed, acquired from the Petersen house in Washington, where the President was taken after he was shot in Ford's Theater across the street.
Union and Confederate artifacts of the Civil War - a surgeon's tools (including a menacing-looking saw), mess kits, rifles and cartridges, a howitzer, battle maps and General Grant's saddle - are also on display.
But the exhibition's emphasis is on slavery. Visitors will see slave shackles; copper tags, with numbers from South Carolina, which resemble Army dog tags and which were used to keep track of nameless rented slaves; posters offering rewards for the recapture of runaway slaves, and minstrel sheet music printed in the North, with caricatures of black dancers that showed racist imagery.
One of the most popular minstrel characters was named Jim Crow, a name adapted after the Civil War to mean the laws and customs that discriminated against blacks.
''The big themes we're showing are the true nature of slavery and Lincoln in history, and not just his toothbrush,'' said Prof. Eric Foner, as he walked through the winding exhibition rooms the other day. He is De Witt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University and the author of ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution.'' Professor Foner and Olivia Mahoney of the Chicago Historical Society's section on decorativeand industrial arts are the curators of the exhibition.
''In emphasizing how critical the slavery issue was in the origins of the Civil War, 'A House Divided' reflects the thinking of the most recent generation of American historians,'' Professor Foner said. ''Many scholars of an earlier generation viewed the war as a needless conflict between two fundamentally similar societies. They argued that the war was caused by irresponsible agitators, who inflamed public opinion, and by blundering political leaders, who proved unable to resolve the resulting crisis. But in recent years, historians have become aware of the centrality of slavery to the fundamental divisions it created in the 19th century. As Lincoln observed in his second inaugural address, everyone understood that slavery was 'somehow' the cause of the war.''
''Many historians abandoned this insight in favor of other narrow economic questions as the cause of the sectional crisis,'' he continued. ''Of course, issues like immigration and the tariff were divisive. However, it's impossible to think seriously about American society without coming to grips with slavery, emancipation and the union, and that's what underlies the way we have constructed 'A House Divided.'
''Lincoln was committed to halting slavery's expansion and his election meant that the slaveholding economy could not continue. I wanted to place the Civil War squarely on the shoulders of slavery.''
 
Mingling People and Cattle
He pointed to an original poster labeled ''Sale of Slaves and Stock,'' advertising a sale held in Savannah, Ga., in 1852. It was a cash-only sale to settle an estate after the death of a slaveowner named Luther McGowan. On the same poster, people and cattle were mingled; no distinction was drawn between women, men, children, horses, mules and cows. One phrase shows a way that families were broken up: ''Slaves will be sold separate, or in lots, as best suits the purchaser.''
Thirty-six slaves, described as a prime lot, were on the block that day. Among them were: ''Melie Ann, 19 years old, housework, smart yellow girl, $1,250; Uncle Tim, 60, fair hand with mules, $600; Adam, 28, Cotton, prime young Man, $1,200; Angelina, 16, prime girl, house or field, $1,000; Sally, 10, handy in kitchen, $675; infant, 1, strong likely boy, $400.''
''We wanted to show the true reality, not the 'Gone With the Wind' view of slavery,'' Professor Foner said. ''When you hear about paternalism and how the masters loved their slaves, a different story is told by these original posters and broadsides.''
 
Taking Lincoln's Position
''A House Divided'' also examines some political and social issues from 1820 to 1865. It includes material about workers and the beginning of machine-made products. ''We take the position that Lincoln emphasized all the time: that he was pro-labor in the sense that free workers had an opportunity to be independent and prosper, unlike slaves who could not improve their condition in life because they had no economic or social mobility,'' Professor Foner said.
The abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass occupies a prominent place in the exhibition. There are portraits of little-known women who served the abolitionist cause. The exhibition also includes some Southern documents upholding slavery.
Moving on to the Senate race in Illinois in 1858 between Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, the Democratic incumbent, electronic excerpts from the debates, read by actors, can be heard. The main issue was the expansion of slavery into the new Western territories, which Lincoln opposed. ''I hope that visitors won't be too disappointed when they listen to the high-minded rhetoric of Lincoln and Douglas compared to politicians today who often fail to discuss serious issues with similar eloquence,'' Professor Foner said.
 
On Paper, Concerns of a President
Lincoln aficionados can find several of his historic letters in the exhibition. There is the letter setting the terms of the debate with Senator Douglas. A letter he wrote concerning freedmen and former slaves entering the Army and donning Union blue may remind filmgoers of ''Glory,'' which focuses on the black infantrymen in the 54th Massachusetts. Written to General Grant on Aug. 9, 1863, about Gen. George Henry Thomas, the letter in part says:
''A word upon another subject. Gen. Thomas has gone again to the Mississippi Valley, with a view of raising colored troops. I have no reason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same subject. I believe it is a resource which, if vigorously applied now, will soon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the enemy and strengthening us.''
In a letter to General Grant, which mentions Gen. Philip Sheridan and which is written from Army headquarters at City Point, Va., on April 7, 1865, Lincoln wrote:
''General Sheridan says, 'If the thing is pressed I think that Lee will surrender.' Let the thing be pressed.''
At the end of the exhibition, there is a copy of the 13th Amendment and of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 establishing black citizenship. The last word is given to Frederick Douglass: ''Verily, the work does not end with the abolition of slavery but only begins.''
''A House Divided'' was underwritten by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and many state agencies, private foundations and business organizations. It will not travel, but is to remain in the American History Wing of the Chicago Historical Society, Clark Street at North Avenue, at least until Lincoln's Birthday, 2000.

HEADLINE: Tougher U.S. Stance on Big Bank Deposits

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The Federal Government's intensified war on drug trafficking has for the first time clashed with the most profitable segment of the banking business.
Though banks have policies against taking drug money, their private international banking departments have long accepted and sometimes actively sought the deposits of foreigners looking to move hundreds of billions of dollars away from weak economies, or seeking to evade tax or currency laws or to hide their money for a variety of reasons.
That pool of anonymous money, known in banking parlance as flight capital, has often included the enormous profits of illicit drug transactions, and Federal prosecutors are now finding themselves entering the world of flight capital.
In a landmark case last week, two units of the $20 billion Bank of Credit and Commerce International were ordered to forfeit a record $15 million after a Federal judge in Tampa, Fla., accepted their guilty plea. In the indictment, prosecutors charged that the Luxembourg-based bank had a strategy to increase deposits by seeking, specifically, flight capital ''and the proceeds of drug sales, in conscious violation of the currency regulations, tax laws, and anti-drug laws of the United States, and of other nations.'' 
Though the bank's units pleaded guilty, five of their officials are now on trial. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which has offices in 73 countries, including the United States, specializes in private international banking. Its deposits included hidden funds of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the deposed leader of Panama who is now in jail in the United States facing drug and money-laundering charges.
The Justice Department's decision to cite flight capital activity in a criminal case has broad implications for banks, according to banking experts and officials: The meaning of the case and other recent Federal Government actions, they say, is that large multinational banks, based in America or abroad, that do business in the United States must now begin to ask tougher questions about their foreign depositors and the souces of their money - or face possible prosecution.
 
'Never Discussed Before'
''The old argument by banks that their customer is just trying to escape the consequences of his economy'' is no longer sufficient, said John J. Byrne, the senior Federal legislative counsel for the American Bankers Association in Washington. ''Flight capital was never discussed before when we talked about money laundering,'' he continued. ''But the notion in the past that it was untouchable is not the case now.''
E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a Washington lawyer for the Bank of Credit and Commerce, as well as several other banks, said, ''The U.S. and the international banking community better realize that there but for the grace of God go they.''
Mr. Byrne and other banking experts agree that banks should scrutinize their customers more carefully. But such inspection can be difficult and costly, the experts said, and it can conflict with what has been the basic nature of a business in which customers expect confidentiality.
Federal banking regulators are now asking banks for the first time to report ''suspicious transactions,'' including a financial transaction known as the back-to-back loan - a tactic central to the Bank of Credit and Commerce case and one that the prosecutors say is often used to hide money.
In such a transaction, a customer may deposit illegally earned money in one branch office of a highly respected bank, and the money is then used confidentially to finance a loan back to the same customer from another branch of the same bank. So the original money, that was illegally earned, is hidden, and if law-enforcement officials ask where the depositor got the funds he now has, he simply says it was a loan from the respected bank.
''The banking industry has a severe problem here,'' said Charles Morley, a former Senate investigator who is a consultant to the banking industry on money-laundering issues. ''Cash-to-cash loans are common in the international banking community. The Government is making them suspicious, and my concern is that the banking industry doesn't recognize this yet.''
 
No Reason for Suspicion
Mr. Barcella, in defending the banks during a recent interview, said that often in the case of a foreign depositor, ''they had no reason to suspect a customer was a drug dealer.'' He continued, ''They assumed he wanted confidentiality because it was flight capital.''
But the Government now rejects that argument, Mr. Barcella said, telling the banks, in effect, that ''the best explanation you can give is that you were helping break the laws of a foreign country.''
The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, which was amended in 1988, makes it a crime to knowingly conceal the ''nature, the location, the source, the ownership or the control of the proceeds'' of various kinds of illegal activity, including many domestic white-collar crimes, but not violations of foreign currency or tax laws.
 
New Regulations
More recently, the Government has issued the new regulations and guidelines that require the banks to disclose ''suspicious transactions'' involving flight capital.
And now, by definition, it is considered suspicious if a deposit in one foreign branch is used to back a loan to the same depositor at another branch. ''Back-to-back transactions; that's how flight capital moves. That's what the Treasury now says is suspicious,'' said Mr. Byrne of the bankers association.
The Justice Department's money-laundering experts decline to comment on the flight-capital developments while the Bank of Credit and Commerce case is pending. But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in addressing the bankers association last fall, indicated that it was no longer free from close scrutiny. ''Wouldn't some bankers, even the Treasury itself, perhaps prefer to keep quiet about wealthy flight capital altogether?'' he asked.
 
Dilemma Facing Banks
The American Bankers Association's guidelines call on bank employees to report suspicious transactions, ''consistent with basic principles of customer privacy.'' But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures American bank deposits, recently pointed out a dilemma now facing the bankers. It told the Treasury that if banks ''report a customer for possible money laundering and continue to do business with that customer, they face the possibility of violating the Money Laundering Control Act for doing business with a suspected money launderer.''
The agency added, ''If they terminate their relationship with the customer based upon their suspicions, they may harm the customer financially and face a lender liability suit.'' Other experts say these customers are not likely to file such lawsuits.
Flight capital was born decades ago, when Western banks helped perfect secret systems in which foreigners, many of them Latin Americans, buried money outside their home country. Gradually over the years, drug traffickers began taking advantage of these secret systems.
''The growth of flight capital in the 1970's laid the framework for money laundering in the 1980's,'' said James S. Henry, an economist formerly with the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Company. ''A whole set of techniques to move money, to hide money, bring it back through back-to-back loans - this was all developed in the 1960's and 1970's by private banking departments.''
As bank financial reports do not separate private banking activities, it is not possible to say what portion of total banking they represent. Whatever fraction of the banking business it comprises, private banking is highly profitable. Because of some of the obvious financial and security advantages, rich foreign investors are willing to pay high fees and accept low yields. Thus, a bank's return on equity for private banking can exceed 100 percent, Mr. Henry said.
''Private banking is the single most profitable activity for money center banks in the 1980's,'' Mr. Henry said.
Global figures on anonymous money are also hard to come by. Two years ago, the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, estimated that between 1978 and 1987, some $170 billion in flight capital left 10 Latin American countries, but that figure did not include money hidden by falsified trade transactions, a common phenomenon in some of these countries.
Mr. Henry estimates that anonymous capital flows, including drug money and flight capital, now total $600 billion to $800 billion.

HEADLINE: Bonn's Point Man on Currency

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 11

 BODY:
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call last week for talks with East Germany on creating a single German currency was a bold political maneuver - plus a daunting economic and financial challenge. And the challenge of putting the proposed monetary union in place, of making the West German mark the official currency of East Germany, would land on the doorstep of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank.
Karl Otto Pohl, the 60-year-old president of the Bundesbank, seems to be a reluctant conscript in Mr. Kohl's drive for a monetary union, which would sharply accelerate the pace of economic reunification of East and West Germany. When the Chancellor announced his proposal on Tuesday, Mr. Pohl branded it ''a very fantastic idea.''
Indeed, even before Mr. Kohl's announcement, Mr. Pohl and other Bundesbank directors had cast doubt on the merits of monetary union in the near future. First, Mr. Pohl said, East Germany needed to build its economy up to a level closer to the West's; he had doubts that shifting to another currency alone would solve East Germany's problems. For Bonn, he warned, a rapid currency union involved serious risks of rising inflation, higher interest rates and deepening budget deficits. 
 
Abrupt Change of Rhetoric
But Mr. Pohl, a central banker of proven political skills, having risen in the Government ranks as a protege of Helmut Schmidt, changed his rhetoric abruptly after the West German Cabinet backed Mr. Kohl on Wednesday. The Government set up a ''German unity'' committee to pursue negotiations with the East German Government on monetary union. Afterward, Mr. Pohl explained pointedly that his differences with the Kohl Government were mainly over matters of timing, not substance.
''One must not look at currency union with a shopkeeper mentality,'' Mr. Pohl said in a radio interview. He called Mr. Kohl's plan ''a historic decision that could not be approached with a faint heart.''
Mr. Pohl's changed tone is largely a compromise with reality. Established in 1957 and modeled closely on the United States Federal Reserve System, the Bundesbank has, by law, a high degree of independence, but it is required to support the general economic policy of the Government.
Besides, any move to create a monetary union would be a political decision for East and West Germany. The Bundesbank could not veto the move, regardless of the qualms of its top officials. Indeed, though Mr. Pohl sat in on the Wednesday Cabinet meeting, no Bundesbank representative will be on the Government's ''unity'' committee, set up to map out all aspects of reunification, beginning with monetary union.
 
'Really Irresponsible'
The Bundesbank, economists say, now finds itself in a difficult position. ''What the Bonn Government has done is really irresponsible,'' said Jonathan Hoffmann, an economist with Credit Suisse-First Boston in London. ''Having an independent central bank gives them the opening to make an extravagant political promise, and then step back and leave it up to the Bundesbank.''
Still, reservations about the proposed monetary union extend well beyond the Frankfurt headquarters of the Bundesbank. Many crucial particulars have not yet been discussed, notably the appropriate exchange rate. Beyond that, serious questions remain about how it will work and if it will have the desired effect of shoring up the East German economy enough to stop the steady drain of its citizens to the properous West, at the rate of nearly 2,000 a day.
The thinking behind the proposal is that monetary union would restore the flagging confidence of East Germans that their economy would be formally integrated into West Germany, giving the East Germans reason to stay home.
In East Berlin, there are clearly misgivings about a rapid monetary union. The economic integration that comes with the shift to a single currency, for instance, may bring widespread layoffs and higher prices as inefficient East German state industries fall by the wayside and subsidies are trimmed. For East Germany, a monetary union would amount to giving up its economic sovereignty.
 
'Social Consequences'
With an eye on the March elections, the Economics Minister of East Germany, Christa Luft, said ''a union has such huge economic and social consequences that a Government with only a few weeks left in office understandably cannot give its blessing.''
''Politically, the proposal could be a solution, but economically, I have my doubts for both sides,'' she said.
For the Bundesbank, the main worry about a rapid monetary union - and the economic reunification that would inevitably accompany it -is that it poses a severe inflationary threat. The most obvious, but less significant, source of inflationary pressure associated with monetary union would be the printing of more West German marks to exchange for Ostmarks.
Until a rate of exchange is decided, it is impossible to say how much additional money supply will be created. But it would not seem to be a big problem for the Bundesbank. For example, if one West German mark was issued and exchanged for five East German marks, the addition to the nation's money supply would be about 3 percent, by some estimates.
''The financing problem is manageable,'' Mr. Pohl said last week.
 
Larger Inflation Threat
But the larger inflation threat linked to monetary union would be posed by the huge amount of spending required to lift the East German economy toward the standards of the West. The forecasts are guesses at best, analysts admit, but the numbers range up to more than $600 billion over the next several years. Most of that money would presumably come from West Germany, through some combination of private and Government investment. And the higher spending, particularly by the Government, could well fuel inflation.
For an institution that has been called ''the world's financial conscience on inflation'' - fighting it even when there is none - the genuine prospect of inflation is a chilling matter.
Like other central banks, the Bundesbank is charged with regulating the amount of money in circulation and of credit supplied to the economy with the aim of maintaining the value of money. The Bundesbank takes its marching orders seriously indeed, helped by a powerful anti-inflation consensus in West German society.
Here, the word ''inflation'' has a tenacious grip on the national psyche. Many German families still have some memory of the hyper-inflation of the 1920's - the wheelbarrows full of currency that bought a loaf of bread or bowl of soup. That clearly colors the thinking of the Bundesbank policy makers, and even modest upturns in inflation are viewed with alarm.
In the late 1970's, West Germany's trading partners, particularly the United States, urged Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic Government to act as an economic locomotive to pull Europe out of recession. While economic growth rose, so did inflation. By 1981 it was running at a 6.3 percent annual rate.
 
Playing on Fears
A year later, Mr. Schmidt was gone, replaced by Mr. Kohl and his center-right coalition, which made effective use of inflation fears in its election campaign.
That lesson was not lost on Mr. Pohl, a Social Democrat who was appointed president of the Bundesbank in 1979 by Mr. Schmidt. During the 1980's the Bundesbank kept its monetary policy fairly tight. Inflation dropped steadily, and in 1986 West Germany actually had deflation of two-tenths of 1 percent. During Mr. Pohl's tenure, West Germany has had the lowest inflation of any industrialized nation, and it is now running at a modest annual pace of about 3 percent.
Because of its success in limiting inflation, the Bundesbank is held in high esteem by most Germans.
Accordingly, its critics have been almost exclusively foreigners. For example, James A. Baker 3d, when he was Treasury Secretary in the Reagan Administration, would often accuse the Bundesbank of being obsessed with inflation, undermining the world's economic growth. The French Government has also pricked the Bundesbank from time to time about slow growth. In the French view, inflation of up to 8 or 9 percent is a sign of a robust economy.
 
Moderate to Rabid
Within the Bundesbank's 19-member central bank council, the views seem to range from moderately to rabidly anti-inflationary. Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of the Bundesbank, is often singled out as a true hard-liner. Mr. Baker once accused him of leading a cadre of inflexible monetarists on the Bundesbank's council that would fight inflation at any cost, including economic growth.
The council meets every two weeks at Bundesbank headquarters in Frankfurt to set monetary policy. It is headed by either Mr. Pohl or, in his absence, Mr. Schlesinger, and consists of the 8 bank directors and the presidents of the 11 state central banks, for a total of 19 members.
The composition is intended to represent fairly the federal structure of West Germany. Decisions are made by a simple majority of the votes cast. While the state central bank presidents usually take their cues from the Bundesbank directors, there have been instances in which the council went against their wishes.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Books on Greed Worry Wall St.

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The husky-voiced caller from Pittsburgh was almost pleading. ''Tell me something that will restore my confidence in the free-enterprise system,'' he asked the guest on ''Larry King Live,'' a popular Cable News Network talk show.
Michael Lewis, the author of ''Liar's Poker,'' a book about Salomon Brothers, paused and then answered, ''I don't think there is much going on on Wall Street now that would restore your faith in free enterprise.'' It was every investment banker's nightmare.
It is bad enough for those on Wall Street that jokes about their profession have become a national pastime. Now, several recent books paint a devastating portrait of the Street and some of its most senior executives. 
 
Best-Selling Books
Two of those books have soared to second and third positions on The New York Times list of best-selling nonfiction hardcover books. ''Barbarians at the Gate,'' a Harper & Row book by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, is an account of the takeover struggle for RJR Nabisco Inc., which ended with the company being acquired by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. ''Liar's Poker,'' a hilarious first-person account of life on a trading floor, is published by W. W. Norton & Company.
The excesses of Wall Street have been popularized before in films like ''Wall Street'' and in the Off Broadway play ''Other People's Money.'' Both are works of fiction. Many people on Wall Street are divided about the accuracy of the portrait of the Street painted in the new books, most of which are nonfiction. But some executives said such harsh representations of Wall Street - whether accurate or not - could have serious repercussions. They come as the nation seems to be in transition to a new gestalt.
Old-fashioned values are coming into vogue again, spurred on by the model of an ostensibly kinder, gentler President, political analysts say. Conspicuous consumption is out; environmentally correct diapers are in. In such an atmosphere, some analysts say, a populist backlash might develop against business in general and Wall Street in particular.
''Culturally, you're probably looking at the leading indicators of a move away from looking at finance and business through favorable glasses,'' said Kevin Phillips, a political analyst in Washington with close ties to the Republican Party.
Mr. Phillips thinks that conservatives of the ''let's deregulate, anything goes'' school are already on the run, thanks to widely publicized debacles involving the savings and loan industry, overly leveraged companies and high-yield, high-risk ''junk bonds.'' His views are shared by many on Wall Street, who worry that if the economy weakens and unemployment rises, public attitudes toward business could turn hostile.
''Some of these books are indictments of the business community as much as the Wall Street community,'' said John C. Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State who was a senior partner at the Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Although none were willing to discuss it openly, several prominent Wall Street executives said a new novel called ''Hanover Place,'' written by Michael Thomas and published by Warner Books, has aroused fears of a resurgence of anti-Semitism.
In its apocalyptic ending, the novel equates takeovers and insider-trading with a new money-grubbing culture. Many of the characters are Jewish and, in the novel, that produces a virulent anti-Semitic backlash.
The other books do not raise an issue of such gravity. But they do offer insights that many readers have found astonishing and disturbing. In Mr. Lewis's ''Liar's Poker,'' Salomon Brothers executives are depicted as an unruly band of juvenile delinquents whose idea of a good time is to rig chairs to collapse when sat upon and replace a suitcase of their colleague's travel clothes with wet paper towels. Sort of an ''Animal House'' with suspenders. The book also depicts Salomon underlings as selling undesirable securities to unsuspecting customers.
''Be very wary, suspicious, is the point,'' Mr. Lewis counseled Larry King's audience.
A spokesman for Salomon, Robert Baker, said the book was ''an amusing caricature.''
 
Treacherous Executives
''Barbarians at the Gate'' - and a less successful book published by New American Library on the same subject, ''True Greed,'' by Hope Lampert - depicts some of Wall Street's most prominent executives as even more treacherous. Deal makers named in both of these nonfiction books are shown as conniving and manipulative, more consumed with their own agendas than the goals of their clients. Readers are left with an overwhelming sense that the $25 billion acqusition of RJR Nabisco occurred not because it was worth that much, or because it made economic sense, but because it was the inevitable climax of a battle royal of egos.
In an interview with Mr. Burrough, Tom Brokaw, the NBC news anchor, asked the co-author of ''Barbarians'' if he had ever heard any of the principals say something like, ''Wait a minute, we do have an obligation to those people who live in places in North Carolina and Atlanta, Ga., and who depend on this company, really, for their daily paycheck and maybe for their financial future.''
Mr. Burrough replied, ''In fact, the evidence shows that the workers were the last thing anyone was concerned with.''
While some of those who are depicted in the books say the accounts are largely correct, others insist the portraits are exaggerated.
 
Other Side of the Picture
''There are a lot of very thoughtful, conscientious people who are interested in their clients, who put their clients before themselves,'' said Martin Lipton, a top takeover lawyer at the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz. ''You never see the other side of the picture because that would be called a 'puff piece.' It's books like ''Liar's Poker'' and ''Barbarians'' that sell.''
Henry R. Kravis, a partner at Kohlberg, Kravis, expressed concern that journalists were exaggerating Wall Street's faults. ''I'm afraid a lot has been blown out of proportion,'' he said. ''We could kill the goose that laid the golden egg: the capital markets of this country.''
The overriding issue may not be how accurate or representative these books are, but the extent to which they are perceived to be. Some people think the books have already had an impact. Many Wall Street figures speculated privately that the recent resignation of Peter A. Cohen as chief executive of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was partly the result of his characterization in ''Barbarians'' as hot-headed, inept, even slightly thuggish. In a particularly memorable scene in the book, he tells one of Wall Street's top attorneys: ''Hey you, lawyer. I'm talkin' to you.''
Some financial figures thought it was no coincidence that Mr. Cohen's replacement, Howard Clark Jr., is known for being quiet, soft-spoken -a bow, as it were, to public opinion.
 
'Mirrors of Each Other'
The RJR Nabisco books could also cause some changes in corporate America, for Wall Street deal makers are not the only ones being sullied.
Henry B. Schacht, the chief executive of the Cummins Engine Company, maintains that corporate America must bear some responsibility for Wall Street's behavior. ''We're mirrors of each other,'' he said. By and large, Wall Sreet deal makers ''serve the requirements that are laid down to them,'' he added.
The furor over the recent books grows especially intense when discussions turn to two that deal with Jews on Wall Street.
''The New Crowd,'' a Little, Brown book by Judith R. Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld, depicts a new generation of Jewish investment bankers as brash and ostentatious, in sharp distinction to what the authors feel is the understated wealth and dignified behavior of the German-Jewish investment bankers of the early 1900's.
But the book that stirs the greatest debate is Mr. Thomas's novel, ''Hanover Place.'' It uses a fictionalized firm, S. L. Warrington & Son, as a vehicle for describing the evolution of social attitudes on Wall Street over seven decades.
''It is a violently anti-Semitic book,'' said Mr. Lipton, the lawyer, echoing the view of Judith Martin, who reviewed the book for The New York Times Book Review on Jan. 7.
Mr. Thomas said that when he started writing the book, insider trading scandals involving Dennis B. Levine, Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, all of whom are Jewish, led him to fear that ''an anti-Wall Street backlash, already brewing in the wake of uncontrolled '80's merger mania, might now take on a serious anti-Semitic cast.''
''I am not an anti-Semite,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I would hate to have this book viewed as anti-Semitic because it is about anti-Semitism.''

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Learning to Invest In Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
SIFTING through Eastern Europe's startling developments, American corporations are slowly developing a strategy for investing in that part of the world - one that treats Eastern Europe as a source of low-cost labor and a platform for exporting products to rich Western Europe. Making consumer products for the hard-pressed Eastern Europeans is not, for American executives, an appetizing goal.
The emerging strategy is understandable. Eastern European currencies are not easily convertible into dollars or yen or marks. So why invest in a factory that would make, say, toothpaste for Czechoslovaks when the profits from such operations cannot easily be sent back to the United States or spent outside Eastern Europe. 
''Until you get the currency problem solved, American businessmen will consider their opportunities limited,'' said Richard Rahn, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
And besides, there are not that many customers: only 43 million people in Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the richest markets. It is far better, American executives say, to make light bulbs in Hungary, as General Electric is doing, and export them for francs or marks, which can be converted quickly into dollars and sent home.
Peter Rona, chief executive of IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust Company, who is helping United States companies get started in Eastern Europe, sums up the thinking this way: ''The big leverage is the low labor cost in the proximity of very high Western European labor costs. Without that there would not be much American interest in foreign investment in Eastern Europe.'' Wages in Eastern Europe are generally below $3 an hour, versus $10 an hour in most of Western Europe. So far Hungary, the easiest Eastern European country in which to set up shop, has drawn most of the meager American investment in the area -the total outlay still being below $300 million.
Among export-oriented companies setting up in Hungary are Samsonite (luggage), Guardian Industries (plate glass) and G.E., whose outlay of $150 million to purchase control of Tungsram, Hungary's only light-bulb maker, is easily the biggest American investment in Eastern Europe.
The plusses for G.E. are impressive, and so are the risks. On the plus side, G.E. sells high-tech lighting in Europe, but not screw-in bulbs and fluorescent lights. Tungsram had been exporting just these items to Western Europe, and controlled 4 percent of the market, which G.E. inherited.
''That 4 percent market share, with its hard-currency revenue, is worth more than the $150 million G.E. paid for the whole company,'' Mr. Rona said.
General Electric does not disagree. ''This will give us a good base to expand in Western Europe,'' said Frank Doyle, a senior vice president.
But for the low price, General Electric takes on the burden of converting an inefficient operation into an efficient one. Among other things, that means cutting the work force of 18,000, perhaps by half, a task that could embroil G.E. in Hungarian politics. (Some Hungarian economists argue that the state should first carry out these unpleasant but socially important tasks and then sell a revitalized Tungsram - for much more than G.E. paid.) But no one at Tungsram has been laid off yet by G.E.'s newly installed managers. Indeed, Mr. Doyle said, resignations and retirements might shrink the staff, without layoffs. And if attrition does not solve the problem, then G.E. and other companies setting up export operations in Eastern Europe have another way of controlling costs.
Inevitably, each of the Eastern European countries will devalue its money, seeking levels that will increase exports and eventually make their currencies convertible into hard currencies. Each devaluation means that wages and other costs will represent a smaller percentage of the dollars or marks that a G.E. or a Samsonite collects in revenue for its exports.
But if export-oriented investment strikes American companies as the safest route to profits in Eastern Europe, some are nevertheless attempting to serve local consumers. U S West, the telephone company, is putting up $5 million in a venture with Hungary's state telephone company to build a cellular phone network in Budapest.
Repatriation of profits will not become a problem until the network is up and running and revenues begin to flow, perhaps late next year, said Edward Mattix, a U S West executive. By then, converting florints into dollars may be easier than it is today - and even if it is not, then $5 million will have bought U S West an inside track in future Hungarian projects, Mr. Mattix said.
Clearly, manufacturing in Eastern Europe for export to the rich nations is a better business, just as it was for American companies when they first set up shop in East Asia. ''You didn't see people going into Singapore or South Korea for those markets, either,'' said Charles Movit, a senior economist at PlanEcon, a consulting firm. ''Eastern Europe is really very much the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Dean of Central Bankers Has Had Spotlight Before

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank and the man faced with the daunting task of overseeing German monetary union, should it occur, is no stranger to the spotlight. He is considered the dean of the industrial world's central bankers, having served in his position since 1979.
Mr. Pohl, who is 60 years old, is one of the three most powerful central bankers in the world, along with the chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, and Yasushi Mienom, governor of the Bank of Japan. 
Mr. Pohl is respected by his peers for his pragmatic approach to monetary policy and the political skills that have helped him shape international agreements like the Louvre accord to stabilize currency values in 1987 and the so-called Plaza agreement, signed in New York in 1985, which was intended to lower the dollar's value against other leading currencies.
In December 1989, he was elected to a three-year term as chairman of the Committee of European Community Central Bank Governors. In that post he will play a crucial role in guiding the community toward its own monetary union and a European central banking system. The model he prefers is the Bundesbank.
 
'Priority on Price Stability'
''A European central bank should be based on the same principles - if not the same structure - as the Bundesbank,'' Mr. Pohl has said, a sentiment he has voiced often. ''That means independence from governments and from community institutions, with a priority on price stability.''
While Mr. Pohl has given lukewarm support to the idea of a European central bank, he has frequently expressed doubts about whether European governments are willing to give away that much sovereignty over monetary policy. His views on German monetary union appear to mirror that position.
Originally appointed by the Social Democratic Government of Helmut Schmidt, Mr. Pohl, a member of the Social Democratic Party since 1948, was reappointed in June 1987 by Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition, despite some resistance from the Chancellor's Christian Democratic Union.
 
Worked as a Journalist
Mr. Pohl was born on Dec. 1, 1929, in Hanover, the son of a municipal clerk. He graduated from the University of Gattingen in 1955 with a degree in economics. He worked as an economic journalist for various newspapers, including Die Zeit, a highly respected weekly.
In 1970, Karl Schiller, the Economics Minister in Chancellor Willy Brandt's Government, hired Mr. Pohl, and he was eventually appointed Under Secretary for international monetary policy. In 1977, Mr. Schmidt assured him an appointment as vice president of the Bundesbank. He succeeded Otmar Emminger in 1979.
His tenure has been marked by a policy of relatively high interest rates and tight monetary policy to maintain currency stability and fight inflation. Mr. Pohl opposes deficits in public spending and state programs to fight unemployment. In 1984, under his leadership, the Bundesbank registered its highest annual profit to date, 13.2 billion marks.
Mr. Pohl, who has been married twice, has four children.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Are Tied to Events Overseas

BYLINE: y KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The extraordinary developments in the Germanys and political uncertainty in Japan have led to fears of higher inflation abroad. Those concerns will not dissipate quickly, and economists and portfolio managers say interest rate movements in the United States are likely to remain strongly dependent on developments in the overseas bond markets for a while longer.
''Near-term prospects for any overseas bond market rallies are dim,'' said Richard B. Berner, an economist at Salomon Brothers. ''These higher rates will keep a floor under U.S. interest rates for the time being, and Treasury bond yields may flare further in response to international developments.'' 
After viewing developments in Japan and Europe, Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. concluded that a major role reversal is taking place: The United States, long the home of high consumption and low production, will be supplanted as a vibrant source of internal demand by the Germans and the Japanese. That will ultimately have a beneficial impact on interest rates in the United States, the analysts argue, but it will take some time for markets to arrive at that conclusion.
 
'Growth Rates Are Diverging'
''Our inflation rates are converging, but growth rates are diverging,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''In the future they are going to look like us in terms of big spending.''
The shift toward more consumption is most striking in the Germanys, which appear to be on an irreversible course toward reunification.
''Imagine what would happen to our budget if we suddenly granted statehood to Mexico,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. ''Those are the sorts of needs we are talking about. Interest rates in West Germany will rise higher, as the full cost of this adjustment process becomes clearer. And rising interest-rate cycles in West Germany and Japan will delay improvement in the Anglo-Saxon countries,'' a reference to the United States, Britain and Canada.
In response to the developments, yields on West German 10-year bonds have climbed above 8 percent for the first time since the mid-1980's.
 
Rates Seem Too High
William H. Gross, a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif., observed: ''From a domestic standpoint, interest rates do not belong at these levels; they are too high for where we are in the business cycle. But they are being pulled up by other economies that are growing faster than we are.''
Some analysts suggested that the developments in foreign bond markets will prevent the Federal Reserve Board from lowering American interest rates in the near term.
''Right now, German bonds are among the most attractive investment vehicles in the world,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
''But it was a very good sign for American bonds that there was no after-effect last week in the United States market after the sharp selloff in the German bond market,'' he said. ''The more restraint we get from the Fed, the better bonds are going to perform.''
 
Bond Market's Rally
After pushing interest rates to their highest levels in the last 10 months in advance of last week's quarterly refunding auction by the Treasury, the bond market ended the week with a strong rally. The new bellwether 8.50 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price to yield 8.33 percent.
''We have had a nice rally of 30 basis points from the lows last week,'' said Mr. Gross of Pacific Investment Management. ''Near term, we have to rest. Things are not that different from last Tuesday, when the market hit bottom.''
The rally in the Treasury market also lifted prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds. The development could prove beneficial to New York City, which this week is expected to make its first public bond offering since the Dinkins Administration took office in January.
Unlike most New York City offerings, which are usually negotiated deals, the $250 million worth of general obligation bonds to be sold this week will be offered at competitive bid.
 
Setting 'the Right Tone'
A competitive auction ''sets the right tone,'' said Elizabeth Holtzman, the city's new Comptroller. ''It's a new administration, and we expect the competitive sale will get the city the best possible price under the circumstances.''
The Dinkins Administration is currently sifting options about who will serve as its financial adviser and form its core underwriting syndicate in the years ahead.
With those plums dangling, bidding for the bonds could be spirited indeed, analysts said.
''As the city goes through the process of selecting managers for its negotiated deals, this competitive sale gives underwriters the opportunity to put their bodies and their wallets on the line,'' said James F. Lynch, an investment adviser and editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter published in New York.
''It is an excellent strategy, because the underwriters will want to look very good in the city's eyes,'' he said. ''Those investors who are thinking about buying these bonds should be aware of this mating dance and steer clear of this deal. They will probably be able to get better yields on these bonds in a week or so, because the underwriters will overpay for them.''
Late last week, dealers estimated that the bonds that mature in 2020 would be priced to yield 7.85 percent to 7.90 percent. The Standard & Poor's Corporation has an A-minus rating on New York City's outstanding debt. Moody's Investors Services, which has had an A rating on outstanding New York City bonds, said late last week it would update its rating today.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Will Panama's Woes Frustrate Democracy?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA

 BODY:
On Central Avenue in downtown Panama City, clothing stores are slowly reopening, selling jeans for $3, cotton shirts for less than $2 and plastic shoes for 99 cents. Shoppers browse under the protection of private security guards carrying shotguns, machine guns and revolvers.
The scene is a graphic reminder of the economic and political problems plaguing this country, which until recent years was growing faster than the other nations in Central America.
The economy has been battered by two years of sanctions from the United States, domestic restrictions on bank accounts to prevent runs and governmental corruption. The ousted Government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has been accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. Now rashes of looting, street violence and other crimes have left many stores without even their shelves. 
Political leaders of the main parties acknowledge that survival of the fragile new democracy after 22 years under military rule depends on how the economy fares in the coming months.
 
A Service Economy
What makes the process particularly tricky is that unlike other nations in Latin America, Panama's economy is largely based not on goods, but on services. Its financial center, free-trade zone and commerce from re-exporting merchandise represents the largest component of the economy in the country of 2.4 million people.
''There isn't a business that hasn't been touched,'' said Sam Kardonski, whose family owns the Tower International Bank, the Western Insurance Company and also runs the Sanyo Electric Corporation's Latin American operations. ''But even though the economy is down, there is a ray of hope. The tension that had been building up over the past years is broken.''
For its part, the coalition Government is embarking on a mix of policies that is partly Thatcherite privatization and partly Keynesian spending for public projects. At the same time, officials say they intend to ease price controls and ease trade barriers.
''We have a very difficult cash flow situation,'' Finance Minister Mario Galindo said in a recent inteview. ''It is very difficult politically for us. The next few months will be critical.''
 
Taxes: 'Anybody's Guess'
Asked for a projection about how much the Government can expect to receive from 1989 taxes, Mr. Galindo shrugged his shoulders and said, ''It's anybody's guess.''
He said the cash problems had forced the Government to decide to sell the state's main businesses, which include sugar and banana companies, a cement factory and Panamanian Airways. The utilities will remain in state hands.
One critical decision that must be made soon involves what to do with new foreign aid and existing revenues. The choice is a relatively simple one: create public projects to stimulate growth and promote employment, or alleviate the crushing $3.8 billion foreign debt and thus make the country credit-worthy again. Interest payments on the debt were suspended two years ago.
American dollars are used by most Panamanians as standard currency. The official currency, the balboa, is fixed to a gold standard and the Government is unable to print new money. This means that Panama has no inflation problem, but it also means that the only ways of adding to the public coffers are by taxing or borrowing.
 
Chaotic Transition
But credit has been hard to come by. And taxes, originally due on Dec. 31, could not be collected because of the chaotic political transition that followed the American invasion earlier that month. Taxes are now due on Thursday.
In the meantime, the Government payroll is being met with Panamanian money that had been frozen by the United States Government.
''The situation is very touchy,'' said Ruben Carles, the Comptroller General and a former economics professor who has provided a steady diet of disclosures to local reporters about what he says is the corruption under the military. ''We cannot satisfy foreign creditors first, leaving aside work on hospitals and other socially responsible construction.''
To the regret of American officials here, Panamanian leaders have said they are considering spending at least $200 million for building projects, a move aimed at reviving the moribund construction industry. A senior American official said the United States has been pressing for more spending to reduce foreign debt, which represents almost a third of the Government's total debt of $5.98 billion. With a gross domestic product of $1.76 billion, Panama has one of the world's highest ratios of debt to gross domestic product.
 
U.S. Aid Package
The Bush Administration has said it will provide a $1 billion assistance package, consisting of grants and loans to promote economic development and incentives for American investment and trade with Panama. Congress recently approved the first portion of the package, $42 million in emergency aid.
The entire package, about half of what Panama requested, also includes financing for an emergency public works program, new housing to replace that damaged by American troops, money to help Panama reduce its foreign debt and a decree lifting restrictions against American imports of Panamanian sugar.
''We are like a very sick man who needs his medicine desperately,'' Mr. Kardonski said.
A bloated Government payroll employs more than 150,000 people, padded by thousands of jobs created by the Noriega administration that were of no value to the country.
Still, officials say that a serious increase in unemployment, now more than 16 percent, will lead to political insurrection.
 
Fear of Unemployment
''We have to cut public spending, but we don't want to lay off 30,000 workers,'' Mr. Galindo said. Before the crisis, the unemployment rate was just under 12 percent.
Local banks have been facing a liquidity crisis that has been caused by severe restrictions on withdrawals imposed two years ago.
Banking officials say that under the regulations, $1.5 billion, or almost 20 percent, of the assets in bank accounts has been frozen under restrictions that limit the size of withdrawals from time deposits and savings accounts. The restrictions are scheduled to end by June 30, but may end by April if officials can persuade depositors not to take out their money immediately and cause banks to collapse.
Only a dozen banks have closed since the sanctions, leaving the number at 110.
The banking commission is considering setting up a contingency fund and a special discount rate for short-term borrowing in cash-tight situations, but no decisions are expected before the end of this week. Bankers report that while foreign deposits have begun to trickle back in, the refusal by most Latin American nations to recognize the new Government has made lending hard.
 
Establishing a Police Force
American troops have also been helping Panamanians establish a local police force, although many business executives are skeptical.
Looting has left them picking up the losses, since insurance policies have clauses that limit liabilities for acts of war. Without a fully trained local police force, street crime still persists - jails were opened during the invasion and many common criminals remain at large. There is also widespread fear that when the invasion force of American troops leaves the country by the end of February, violence will flare again.
The violence severely damaged businesses in Colon, a city on the Atlantic Ocean side of the Panama Canal that is 50 miles from Panama City and is the heart of the largest free-trade zone in Latin America, re-exporting $4 billion in goods each year. The bulk of these goods are from businesses in the United States, Korea and Japan.
But despite all the hardship, some business leaders are upbeat about the future.
Mr. Galindo, the Finance Minister, said just about the best news he heard recently came from the National Brewery, makers of the beer sold under the label Cerveza Panama.
Reflecting on a conversation with one beer executive who told him that rising consumption of its product means that the company will be paying a record amount in taxes, Mr. Galindo said, ''I suppose the recent events have encouraged beer drinking.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts from President's News Conference on World Issues

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
 
BUSH: Afternoon. Well, this has been an extraordinary and positive week in East-West relations.
In the Soviet Union, progress was made at the Central Committee plenum on moving the Soviet political system toward pluralism and genuine respect for the views of the Soviet electorate. I commend this development, which demonstrates once again why our Administration has supported Chairman Gorbachev's efforts to extend glasnost and perestroika through the Soviet Union.
Secretary Baker's visit to Moscow made solid progress in pushing the U.S.-Soviet agenda forward in preparation for the June summit here. We made important headway on conventional arms control, Start, nuclear testing and chemical weapons, and continued to explore ways to reduce our differences on regional issues, especially concerning Central America and Afghanistan. 
All in all, Secretary Baker's talks in Moscow accomplished much of what Chairman Gorbachev and I intended when we set the goals for this meeting during our discussions at Malta. I am confident that if we continue this kind of momentum in our bilateral relationship with the Soviet Union, the June summit will be a major success.
And finally I want to congratulate Chancellor Kohl for his successful visit to Moscow. His visit reflects the accelerating pace of German self-determination. And the statements on German unity on the Soviet side -by the Soviet side - were most welcome. And we support Chancellor Kohl's position that a unified Germany should remain a member of NATO.
And let me also express my appreciation of Chairman Gorbachev's statesmanlike view that decisions regarding German unity should be left to the people of Germany.
I made a statement this morning on the wonderful news of the release of Mr. Mandela, so I will leave that to the question period. But, Terry, I understand you have the first question today.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Q. Mr. President, what is your reaction to Mr. Gorbachev's counterproposal for troop cuts in Europe? And in the wake of Secretary Baker's visit to Moscow, what do you think the likelihood is that there'll be three treaties to be signed this year - chemical, strategic and conventional?
 
A. Let me take the last one first. I'm not sure that there will be three treaties to be signed by the time we have this summit, but I think there's going to be progress towards all three. And it's still our goal to get that C.F.E. agreement signed.
On the troops, for Gorbachev in order to have either 195 or 225, we're going to stay with our proposal, because we don't see this, this linkage to that degree. We're talking about the forward deployment there in Europe, the 195,000. And that's what we're challenging him to reduce.
And we've got a big ocean between us and Western Europe, and so the argument that we should always have a linked reduction is one that I want to get away from now. ... Troops for Stabilization
 
Q. With the breakup of the Soviet empire, and you want Germany to remain in NATO, who's the enemy?
 
A. What was that?
 
Q. Who's the enemy? Who are they supposed to be fighting against?
 
A. Who?
 
Q. The NATO troops. The U.S. troops in Germany.
 
A. The U.S. troops are there as a stabilizing factor. Nobody can predict, Helen, with total certainty what tomorrow's going to look like. I've been wrong; you've been wrong; he's been wrong; she's been wrong, on how it's going to go. And we don't know - may I finish please? Our European allies want us there. I have a feeling that some of the Eastern Europeans want us there, because they know that the United States is there as a stabilizing factor. ...
 
Q. I've heard, Mr. President, that there's a wide perception that your whole military budget is out of synch, that you're tone-deaf as to what's been happening. And that there is a possibility of this money going for distressing domestic needs.
 
A. I don't think that perception is widespread with the American people. I think the American people want a cautious approach to this. I don't think any of us think we can see with clairvoyance what's going to happen the day after tomorrow. ... Sanctions on South Africa
 
Q. Mr. President, does the release of Nelson Mandela and the other steps announced by President de Klerk in South Africa alter in any way your views toward the United States economic sanctions, which, of course, the Reagan Administration and you, as a part of it, were never very enthusiastic about?
 
A. What do you mean? In the sense of - alter my views as to what we ought to do in the future?
 
Q. Well, as to whether they work or not.
 
A. Well, I don't know that one can attribute all the change in South Africa to sanctions. Now, we've got some sanctions on there. And by law they remain on until the South Africans have taken certain steps. And I think that, you know, somebody asked me about this yesterday. I said, Well, I can't judge.
Frankly, I think some are counterproductive. I happen to think American jobs there make good sense, and I don't think they perpetuate the status quo. But I think what's really changed is the mind-set of the South African leadership. And I think that we ought to give Mr. de Klerk certain credit for being able to look much more realistically about political change and hopefully more favorably about a society that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with apartheid. Putting Discussions First ...
 
Q. Mr. Mandela continues to call for armed struggle to overturn apartheid. When he comes to the White House, would you urge him to adopt the nonviolent tactics of Martin Luther King?
 
A. Yes, I would. But I read his statement to be more on the defensive side when I looked at it this morning. Yes, we've always advocated nonviolence. And I think the United States ought not to move away from that. Yes?
 
Q. On the question of the sanctions, are there things that you can do for South Africa's Government apart from lifting sanctions? We realize that by law you can't lift the sanctions unilaterally. Are there other things you can do other than just asking the President to come to Washington?
 
A. Well, I would say out of the meeting with Mr. de Klerk I would have a clearer perception of what other things might be. I think having him here is a major step. ... Reward for de Klerk?
 
Q. Mr. President, there are those who say keeping on with sanctions that now is more of a time than ever to keep all the pressure on and if not - and if not keeping the pressure on, even go one step further. I wonder if you intended your invitation to Mr. de Klerk as a reward for what he's done, given that no South African President has ever been here before. And secondly, do you think it's time, regardless of what you think of sanctions, to reward them in some other way? ...
 
A. Well, I don't know about rewards. I think his coming here evidences the fact that we see in him a new brand of leadership, a man who is making dramatic changes in South Africa. The freeing of Mandela clearly is a very positive sign. And so I think there's more to be done, but there are things that he has done that I think deserve our support and I'd say appreciation. . . . Yeah.
 
Q. Mr. President, on Germany, would you be willing to consider a situation where a united Germany was not necessarily a full member of NATO?
 
A. No, I think that Chancellor Kohl is absolutely correct and we ought to support him. NATO membership. And I think it's stabilizing. I think it's good. There might be some flexibility, obviously, on deployment of NATO forces. But in terms of membership, I think that is the most reassuring and stabilizing concept. I happen to believe that it is most reassuring and stabilizing in terms of how the Eastern Europeans will eventually look at it. Maybe not today -
 
Q. - but you mean the same kind of membership that West Germany now has?
 
A. Sure. Yeah. But as I've said there's some flexibility on deployment of NATO forces into Eastern Europe. Nobody wants to threaten the Soviet Union. . . . The U.S. presence is a stabilizing presence. Yeah, Charlie.
 
Q. Mr. President, on the de Klerk visit that now seems to be almost a fait accompli, are there any conditions on that? ...
 
A. I said I want him to come. You have freed Nelson Mandela. You've taken certain steps that are positive. And we want to see more, want to see you go further. But you're welcome. And that's the way it is.
 
The Recent Trip
Yeah.
 
Q. Mr. President, do you have any second thoughts about the -
 
A. - I tried to identify the lady next to you, but go ahead.
 
Q. Do you have any second thoughts about the trip last week? I'm especially thinking of the war games with the Soviet tanks, particularly when your views on the defense budget are well known and the Central Committee was meeting at the same time.
 
A. No. I think it was a good trip. And I've read some tick-tock inside here, but it doesn't bother me a bit. I think that those people that were there understood that it - that training has applications elsewhere. We've seen recent areas where military force was used because it was well-trained. And so I stand by that as a very good trip. You see, I support our defense budget. . . . I think the American people want to see us stay strong.
 
Q. What signal does that send to Mr. Gorbachev, however, whom you've just praised a few minutes ago?
 
A. Well, it sent a pretty good one, I guess, because we came out of that meeting with some forward motion. And I salute him. . . . If you'd listened to some of the critique from Capitol Hill, you'd have thought it had been a disaster. And yet I've told you we've just completed one of the most successful ministerial summits that we've had with the Soviets. So you can't, the critics up there on the Hill can't have it both ways. Germany and NATO
 
Q. I just wanted to follow up on the Germany question. You said you thought that the Eastern Europeans would ultimately come to see this alliance with NATO as a positive thing, too. Are you suggesting, sir, that there's something less threatening about a Germany that is in alliance - any alliance -rather than a neutral Germany?
 
A. . . . They're good NATO partners now and they'll be good NATO partners then. And they're very closely linked to the United States. And I think that's a very good thing. ...
 
Q. Mr. President, you indicated you don't think that conventional talks are at an impasse. Would you be willing to consider an arrangement, an agreement, in which the U.S. was able to keep extra troops in Europe but at a number somewhat less than the 30,000?
 
A. Well, we've made our proposal. . . . I don't make these proposals without consulting the allies. And there's agreement that these are the proper levels. It's a level that has been scrubbed by our military, and I think there's happiness within our own military about this. For this time in history, I think it's the right level.
And so we're not out there trying to trade that away.
Yeah. Free Markets and Mandela
 
Q. Mr. President, you said - you talk often about the importance of free markets for democracy, but Nelson Mandela supports the A.N.C. view about nationalizing South African industries, including banks and mines. Now how do you feel about that, and does that pose a problem for real democracy in South Africa?
 
A. We are not for nationalizing; we're for privatization across the - and we're for free markets. And so if we have a difference there, that's fine; we'll discuss it with him.
But I'm not about to embrace the idea that what we want to do is go down to more socialism when socialism is folding, folding its hand and going over to the other side all across the world. And you see this.
So this is - this is, you know, a difference that we - if that's his view, why certainly we're not going to embrace that.
 
Q. Is that a severe obstacle, though, to having a successful democracy there? ...
 
A. I don't necessarily associate nationalization, socialization of industry, the goods and services produced belonging to the state. I don't see that as particularly helpful towards democracy, if that's what you mean. . .. What I do agree with Mandela is is to try to get a society that is not a racist society, doesn't support a concept of apartheid. A Role Like Carter's?
 
Q. Mr. President, on South Africa, the question is how far, how willing are you to become personally involved, your Administration become personally involved in facilitating negotiations between Mr. Mandela and President de Klerk? Are you ready to play a role like President Carter did in the Camp David accords?
 
A. If such a role would be productive, I certainly would. But I have the feeling from the talks with both men - just short phone conversations with both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela - that they feel they can talk to each other without the U.S. catalytic role. But, sure, if we could be helpful in a way of that nature we certainly would. Yeah, Jerry. On Conventional Forces
 
Q. Mr. President, there are some people who are questioning the need for a conventional forces treaty at all at this point. The argument being that we're in a situation in which the East European countries are going to invite all the Soviet troops to go home anyway, and all that we'd be doing is codifying a Soviet presence that isn't even wanted in Eastern Europe. What's your response to that argument?
 
A. I'd say it's very interesting. And it may well be that the pressure on the Soviets will have them withdraw to lower levels. I don't think there's great sentiment in the Warsaw Pact countries for continued Soviet presence. And I'm not sure that it would negate the need to have an agreement. I think the Soviets would like to get our commitment, too.
But, you see, those troops are not wanted in Eastern Europe any more. Our troops are wanted by the free world. And I suspect, I can't prove it, that some countries in the Warsaw Pact countries today would see us not as a threatening presence but as a stabilizing presence.
Yes. ...
 
Q. Mr. President, what was your reaction to the rather effusive embrace of the South African Communist Party and the presence of the Communist Party flag on the balcony when Mr. Mandela made his speech yesterday?
 
A. I didn't notice that. But, you see, I think these Communist Parties for the most part are sliding downhill. And I think what's coming uphill, and triumphantly so, is democracy and freedom.
And I would hope that the steps that Mr. de Klerk is taking and has suggested be taken would enhance the view that democracy and freedom are on the move.
 
Q. A follow-up, sir. If Mr. Mandela persists in allying himself with a Communist party, would that change your view of his -
 
A. Too hypothetical. I mean what's good is that he's out there; he's been in jail a long time. And it's interesting back here, but I'm not embracing every position of the A.N.C. or some of the positions that are represented here today as Mr. Mandela's positions. What I am doing is embracing the concept that it's good that he's out of jail and that it's good that the South Africans seem to be moving towards a more equitable society.
Yeah. The 4 Powers and Germany
 
Q. Do you think it's time for a conference of the four powers on Germany?
 
A. No, not, not at this juncture. I know that idea has some credibility right now, but I think it's moving along pretty well. And we have always favored self-determination. ...
 
Q. If Gorbachev continues to insist on German neutrality, Mr. President, do you think that could create a dangerous impasse that would spawn a neutrality movement in West Germany?
 
A. Not necessarily. But I think that we've seen the Soviet Union position change on the whole concept or the whole acceptability of German reunification. It wasn't so long ago that Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet system were positioned very skeptically about any reunification.
And that's what was so symbolic about the Kohl-Gorbachev meeting - so, so important about it. And I might say that, that it is a very emotional day for people in Germany, G.D.R. and F.R.G. Highly emotional. Brother separated from brother, cousin from cousin, and all of this now with a chance to have a peaceful reunification. ...
We ought to applaud the fact that the Soviets demonstrated a real flexibility on this question that we didn't think they had a few months ago. Reuniting and the Russians
 
Q. Do you now think that a German reunification is unstoppable, and that Gorbachev will back off his demand?
 
A. Well, I think, again, I'd just refer it to the will of the people there. And it seems to be moving very fast in that direction.
Yes.
 
Q. Mr. President, what is your visceral reaction to the resignation of Ariel Sharon and its affect on the peace process? And is this part of a pattern of the hard-liners losing out around the world?
 
A. You know, I just heard about this. And I have to understand more about what went on there. But Mr. Shamir was the proponent of these talks, and if this clears the way for the talks to go forward, that would be in keeping with U.S. policy. Yes.
 
Q. When you talked with Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, did you talk about - and you talked about democracy and freedom - did you make the point that in our understanding of democracy the majorities rule?
 
A. We didn't go -
 
Q. - about de Klerk. Or will you talk with him about that when he comes here?
 
A. I'm sure we will, and with Mr. Mandela. But that did not come up in these conversations. ...
 
A. I'll just wait and see what happens when he gets here.
Yes, Sarah. You haven't had one for a long time. The Closing of the Bases
 
Q. Thank you so much. Sir, we have a big problem in this country with the bases that we have to close and the tens of thousands of personnel we have to let go out of the military and out of civilian roles, too. I wonder if you would be for taking these military bases and turning them into prisons rather than building new prisons, and if you'd be for using the extra housing for the homeless?
 
A. Well, Sarah, let me say this, that when military bases close, various communities historically seem to prosper. And I think of one in Waco, Tex., where a base was closed -it was years ago - all kinds of speculation that this would be the end of the world, and then gradually found out that it doesn't work that way.
And so I think there will be socially redeeming uses for these benefits that municipalities and county governments and others may - of these bases that these entities may want to use them for. And so I would say that it's a good question, because we can say to others, This is not the end of the world.
But let me say on base closings, these suggested closings were made without political favor, and I would hope that we could get the Congress convinced that the age-old adage -cut here, cut there, but don't cut in my district - could be laid aside now. And I hope that that's what will prevail.
I said out there in San Francisco that instant doves becomes feathery instant hawks on base closing only if it's in their district. And I want to see that changed. And I've got to convince these folks that we're not doing this some vindictive, political way. We're doing it to try to accommodate to what will be a new kind of defense force in this country.
Carl. Hopes for Summit Talks
 
Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you could clarify your position on your hopes for the June summit. Is it your view that it may be possible there, if not necessarily to sign formal treaties, but to substantially complete the C.F.E. and the Start and even maybe the chemical?
 
A. Chemical. I'd hope we'd be substantially completed. It's a good way to phrase it. Yes sir.
Yeah, Jim.
 
Q. Your Assistant Secretary for Africa seems to suggest that some sort of gestures were now needed toward South Africa. Has there been any discussion of that or have you pretty much ruled it out - any concrete move until the state of emergency is lifted?
 
A. Well, we have certain - we have certain provisions in the law that have to be met. But I would hope people would see the invitation to Mr. de Klerk as a, certainly as a gesture, but one that will have, after the discussions with him, I think, considerably more substance to it.
Owen. Stressing the Alliance
 
Q. Can you support a situation - back to Germany - where there is membership, let's say, political membership in NATO but not a military relationship that exists now with the possibility of no foreign troops on German soil in a unified Germany?
 
A. I don't - I don't think we're contemplating a neutralized Germany. And I instead stated my position in terms of the alliance. And that's the way we view it and I'm sure that's the way our allies look at it.
 
Q. How - could I ask how, since you had mentioned that unification is a matter to be left to the German people. If there were some referendum where they wanted a configuration without foreign troops on German soil, how would you deal with it?
 
A. I would cross that bridge when I came to it. But I would point out that Helmut Kohl, to his credit, is not considering that. Yes.
 
Q. Mr. President, in a different hemisphere, over the past couple of months, when asked why you're going to Cartagena this week, you said you want to show support for the Government down there. Now that you're just a couple of days away, do you expect to do anything more than that, than show the flag? Do you expect anything concrete to come out of it? Perhaps increased use of the military down there?
 
A. Well, I do think that we want to support Mr. Barco, a courageous leader. And I think going there will certainly indicate how strongly I feel about that. But I think there'll be more than that come out of it. I hope we can get agreement in terms of support for the anti-narcotics effort in three countries: Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. What was the last part? U.S. Warships in Drug War
 
Q. Anything in particular like the increased use of the military, the plan that seemed to have been scuttled earlier, to use U.S. warships off the coast of Colombia?
 
A. Well, what happened on that plan was some mischievous stories that suggested blockade. So one of the things I'll try to do -because there was never any intention of a blockade. Absolutely absurd. And yet that threw a panic amongst many of the Colombians who said, 'We don't want a blockade off our coast.' And that wasn't whatever had been intended. But in terms of interdiction, what I'd like to convince them is that we can be extraordinarily helpful, particularly to Colombia, in their courageous fight against narcotraffickers by a sophisticated interdiction effort. ... The Drug War at Home
 
Q. As you head for the drug summit, what would you tell the other leaders about the status of the war on drugs in this country?
 
A. One of the points I'll emphasize at the beginning is, look, I know you three leaders think that this is all the fault - not entirely, but a lot of the fault because of the demand in the United States. And let me assure you we're not just talking about interdiction. We're not just talking about anti-crime aspects of this in the United States. We're talking about major efforts on the demand side, a major initiative.
And it's a lot of it - most of it is out in the private sector, in the schools, to educate people against the use of narcotics. Because they think that it's all - that the United States is causing all this problem.
It's changed a little bit, because some of them are beginning to see user problems inside their own countries, or neighboring countries, or that have crossed the ocean even. So I think we've got to convince them that we are going out on all fronts. And I think I can do that.
 
Q. As a follow-up, sir: They're, from what we've heard, going to ask you for more money for crop substitution, to substitute other goods for the coca crop down there. Will the U.S. put its money where its mouth is on that?
 
A. Well, I will listen to what they have to say on it. . . .
Yes. Soviets in Eastern Europe
 
Q. You, sir, you said that Eastern European countries want the Soviet troops to leave, and you've also pointed to the progress in talks about conventional force reductions. But the fact of the matter is virtually all those Soviet troops are still there now, in Eastern Europe. Can you point to any real progress on the ground in terms of any changes in Soviet troop deployments in Eastern Europe, and to what extent do you see the continued press for reversals politically inside the East bloc that should cause those troops to continue to be deployed -
 
A. - I can't see a political change inside the Eastern European countries that would have an invitation go out to ''Please remain.'' I don't see any politics or any political changes that would make me think that that is a likely scenario right now.
But - and I do think that you put your finger on something. They have not - I don't know - I was looking for Brent to see if any have been pulled back at all.
VOICE IN BACKGROUND. Yes, they have.
 
A. And he says some have. So I'll have to get you the information on exactly what withdrawals have taken place.
 
Q. Mr. President, do you have a date for the summit with Mr. Gorbachev yet?
 
A. To what?
 
Q. Do you have a date?
 
A. I don't think we've set the exact date. The Chinese Students
 
Q. Mr. President, when you won the China veto vote, you said there were signs things were easing up in Beijing. Now they say they want before a citizen can leave the country to study abroad they'll spend five years at work. Isn't it backsliding, or is there some evidence that you have that things are easing up in China?
 
A. Well, I'm disturbed by that statement. I don't like that statement. Because I feel that student exchanges are very good things to have between our countries.
I know that some visas have recently been given to students, so I'd want to check the statement against the reality. I know that some students over there have been issued visas to come to the United States. But I saw the statement, and if you just want me to comment on the statement, I thought that was counterproductive, very much so. Oil Spill and Oil Leases
 
Q. Mr. President, has the current oil spoil on Southern California in any way changed your thinking about the wisdom of further development with offshore oil lease sales? And what is your timetable for when you're going to make the decisions on those lease sales?
 
A. You know, I saw somebody - the freighter, a tanker, had a hole punched in it, and I see a bunch of guys jumping up and down saying this proves you can't have any offshore drilling. I say to myself, I'm not sure I understand the connection between tankers. Do they want to cut off all tankers or do we just want to do our level best to make tankering safer?
I have said that we're not going to have drilling in highly environmentally sensitive places, but I'll be darned if I think we ought to shut down all offshore drilling everywhere. And I don't see that that a spill from a tanker really has much to do with whether you can drill an offshore well safely, because it's going on all the time. And this country depends on it. ...
 
Q. When do you plan to make your decision on those lease sales?
 
A. Fairly soon. I've read the recommendations and the report. It should be fairly soon. Janet. Inviting South Africans
 
Q. Mr. President, did Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk accept your invitation? And if so, when are they coming?
 
A. I felt - I have to go back and look at my notes. But I felt they accepted in principle, both of them. I think Mr. Mandela said he wanted to talk - I thought he said to his executive council or something. But anyway he wanted to talk to some others. It came first, you know, right out of the first few hours. I must say he seemed very pleased at that. And I think Mr. de Klerk the same way. But there isn't, there wasn't, any time set on either of those invitations. Way in the back. The Lance Missile
 
Q. Mr. President, is this the time to re-examine the flexible response doctrines of NATO and particularly the wisdom of continuing work on the Lance missile?
 
A. Well, that decision will not be taken till 1992. That was an agreement between all the NATO partners. And I see nothing to change that at this point.
 
Q.
 
A. ...
 
Q. Mr. President, what role did anti-apartheid demonstrations in this country play in the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners?
 
A. I don't know, because you had anti-apartheid demonstrations in many countries. So I think if people get the feeling in South Africa that apartheid itself is abhorrent to the United States, through whatever way they get that feeling, whether it's a statement by the President, whether it's some legislative action or whether it's some demonstration, that's helpful. But I can't help you on how you would quantify that.
Thank you all. I've got a 2:30 meeting. But thank you very, very much.

HEADLINE: Controlling The Damage;
Regulators Move Fast To Reassure Markets

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The speed with which Federal regulators responded to financial problems at Drexel Burnham Lambert's parent illustrates their awareness of how quickly problems at this particular Wall Street firm could spread through the complex structure of today's financial markets.
The focus of their concern was the ''junk bond'' market, a corner of Wall Street that Drexel invented and still sustains. More politely known as ''high risk, high yield'' securities, junk bonds are the debt of companies considered too young, too small, or too shaky to sell their bonds to traditional lenders.
What Drexel made popular was the notion that, provided the interest rate was high enough, even such speculative offerings could be a sound investment, particularly if investors sought safety in an assortment of such issues. Some borrowers would go broke, the theory conceded, but the extra-high interest paid by those that did not would more than make up the difference. 
 
Widely Held Securities
Drexel's theory - together with the firm's willingness to foster trading and confidence by standing ready to buy or sell such bonds - underlay the growth of a $200 billion market. Junk bonds are now counted among the assets of scores of perfectly conventional pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and tottering savings and loan institutions, With signs of trouble at Drexel -still the dominant junk bond firm -regulators clearly wanted to make sure that other firms do not pull back in panic from this already-fragile marketplace.
In the last six months, one company after another has stumbled under the burden of interest payments it took on when it sold junk bonds, with unsettling effects for scores of companies. Those problems, culminating in the unraveling of the Campeau Corporation's vast retailing empire last month, have made potential lenders more wary and potential borrowers more nervous. Their fear has permeated the credit markets.
Beyond the impact on corporate America, as junk bonds drop in value, so does the wealth of those who own them. Scores of institutions and investors could be left less able to weather economic shocks. Last week, for instance, many insurance companies saw their stocks tumble in value because of the market's concern about their holdings of junk bonds. And thrift institutions, themselves no paragon of strength, could be severely hurt if the junk market weakens further.
''Drexel may not be a household word to the average American,'' Gary Schilling, a Wall Street economist, said yesterday, ''but people are aware of the stock market, and they know that the market is built on confidence. God didn't set the price of General Motors stock; that price is set in the marketplace. And if there are problems with Wall Street, people could decide that the price should instantly be $20 cheaper.''
 
Timing Called Unfortunate
''This couldn't have happened at a worse time,'' Mr. Schilling added, ''because we are so dependent on the rest of the world to finance our deficits. So the regulators could see that it is imperative that the rest of the world should continue to have confidence in us and in our markets.''
While the speed of the regulators' reaction illustrates how seriously Drexel's troubles were taken, the nature of that response seemed to show that Washington and Wall Street had learned the lessons of the October 1987 market crash: The Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange responded in close coordination.
As news spread yesterday of financial troubles at Drexel, officials at the S.E.C., the Fed and the Big Board apparently did not wait to see how the markets would react. The chairman of the New York Stock Exchange was on the phone with reassuring words to the heads of major brokerage firms. The Federal Reserve had similar conversations with top bankers, one top Wall Street executive said last night.
''This was a well-rehearsed contingency plan, far more so than in 1987,'' the executive said. ''They were reaching out to every nook and cranny where an exposure to Drexel's problems might exist.''
There were many such crevices. As rumors of trouble at Drexel swept through the market yesterday, people who were parties to transactions with Drexel became worried about completing those deals. ''Unless the regulators step in,'' another executive explained, ''people move to protect their own interests. What happens is, you have rumors, you have panic, and, by definition, a lot of allegations arise that are not true.''
 
Rumors Compete With News
Yesterday's scene at the stock exchange was a telling example. At the opening bell, traders were passing around an ominous, and inaccurate, rumor that a major brokerage house was going to file for bankruptcy protection. When the report about Drexel's problems moved across the traders' screens, they seemed to find the news less alarming than the rumors, and selling pressure began to ease. But as uncertainty grew about the extent of Drexel's problems, the market closed nearly 30 points lower.
Given the quick response by regulators, it remains to be seen how serious a threat Drexel's problems pose to the markets. A lot depends on whether other firms step in and absorb the leading role that Drexel has played in trading junk bonds. Without that liquidity - the ability of the market to absorb selling without a price collapse - there is really no floor under the value of billions of dollars in speculative bonds.
''It's not a financial panic; it is not a broad market event,'' said another executive, who declined to be named. ''But there are fragilities in the junk bond market.'' Underwriters tend to focus their buying and selling in the issues that they sponsored, and Drexel sponsored more than any other. The key, he said, will be for the regulators to get other firms to broaden their trading beyond the bond issues that they brought to market.

HEADLINE: CUOMO BUDGET GAP SEEN RISING AGAIN

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 12

 BODY:
In a reflection of New York State's declining economy, Cuomo administration officials said today that New York would end the fiscal year short more than $1 billion - $300 million more than they had estimated just last month.
Administration officials said they had revised their forecast on the basis of estimated income-tax payments for the month of January. And they said the latest figures were particularly alarming because they showed that, for the first time since the state's fiscal troubles of the 1970's, estimated tax collections were lower for the year than for the year before.
''It's unprecedented,'' said the state's Budget Director, Dall W. Forsythe. He attributed the sharp decline in income-tax payments to ''very poor conditions'' in the state's securities and real-estate industries. 
 
Other Cuts in Estimates
Today's announcement is in keeping with the stream of bad news that has emerged from the Governor's budget office over the last few months. The budget office has reduced its revenue estimates for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, at least three times in the last four months. When the gap was first disclosed in November, it was estimated to be at least $250 million.
At the same time that the Cuomo administration cut its revenue estimates for the current fiscal year today, it also revised its estimates for tax collections for next year. Citing the slump in income-tax collections, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said expected state revenues next year would be $250 million lower than he had predicted a month ago, when he presented his budget to the State Legislature.
While direct connections between the state's economy and its tax collections are hard to draw, making the science of forecasting revenues painfully inexact, New York's treasury appears to be suffering from the effects of lower profits on Wall Street and in the real-estate market.
On Wall Street, financial analysts expect year-end bonuses for last year to be the lowest in seven years. And in the real-estate market, home prices in the New York metropolitan area, which peaked in 1988, have since fallen almost 7 percent, while new office construction, which helped fuel New York City's economic boom in the mid-1980's, has dropped off sharply over the last year.
''We are going through a very tough transition from a period of rapid economic growth to a period of slow growth,'' said Mr. Forsythe, the State Budget Director.
 
Back Into Balance
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Cuomo said legislative leaders had agreed to try to trim next year's proposed $51 billion budget by $250 million to bring the spending plan back into balance. The Governor did not outline specific cuts, saying he would work with legislators to come up with measures they would accept.
To cope with the shortfall for the current fiscal year, now estimated at $1.1 billion, the Governor said today that the state would have to borrow more than $600 million by issuing short-term deficit notes to be repaid within a year.
The rest of the shortfall is supposed to be made up through spending cuts that the Governor ordered in November and through the use of state reserve funds, including the Court Facilities Fund and the Hazardous Waste Fund.
Some financial analysts have questioned the prudence of the Governor's plans and have suggested that the heavy short-term borrowing, which will not have to be paid back until after the November election, is simply a way of putting off the state's financial problems until after the campaign season. Governor Cuomo and all 211 state legislators are up for re-election this fall.
 
'Merely Responses'
Today, analysts said they were concerned that the administration had not developed a lasting solution to the state's recurrent financial problems and was relying too heavily on reserve funds.
''These are not solutions, they are merely responses,'' said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. ''This approach has the potential of seriously stripping the state of all of its reserves.''
Today's announcement came just as state budget negotiations for the coming fiscal year were getting under way, and it seemed likely to delay further the process, which rarely concludes on time, even under the best of circumstances. But after a closed-door meeting this afternoon, both the Governor and legislative leaders insisted that they were committed to putting next year's budget in place by the legal deadline of April 1, which they have missed for each of the last five years.
''We're still committed to that date,'' Governor Cuomo said. Effect on Tax Cut The gloomy announcement also made it appear even more likely that the next phase of the state's income-tax cut, scheduled to go into effect in October, will be suspended as the Governor has proposed. The State Senate's Republican majority has come out against this proposal, as have most business groups in the state. But to put the tax cut into effect as scheduled would cost the state $400 million, a sum that the state appears less and less likely to be in a position to pay.
In a departure from the usual budget-season posturing, the State Senate's Republican majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said today that he would work with the Governor to try to come up with spending cuts in an effort to balance next year's budget. Usually at this time of year members of the Senate's Republican majority accuse the Democratic Governor of inventing fiscal problems to conceal money.
''The Governor's indicating a very dismal picture,'' Mr. Marino said. ''We are working together trying to put together a budget by April 1.''

HEADLINE: Bush Facing Threats Usually Avoided

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
When President Bush flies to Colombia on Thursday for a conference on drug trafficking, overruling objections from almost all his senior aides, he will face dangers that Presidents normally avoid.
But in deciding to go to the one-day meeting, which will be primarily a photo-taking session and is expected to produce few significant agreements, Mr. Bush concluded that his desire to show solidarity with President Virgilio Barco of Colombia outweighed any increased risk he was assuming, the officials said.
''You'd have to say that he's going into a more unstable environment than the President usually goes into,'' a senior Administration official said. ''You have something amounting to armed forces inside Colombia, both the cartels and guerrilla organizations, with immense amounts of money and access to the international arms market.'' 
Officials involved in planning the meeting said they were satisfied that Mr. Bush can be protected against any possible attack by Colombia's drug traffickers during his visit, which will last only about six hours. Mr. Bush will be under tight military and Secret Service guard that will exceed even the usual precautions taken on the President's travels.
 
Little Evidence of a Threat
The officials said the actual threat to Mr. Bush's life is far less than some news accounts have suggested. ''There is little actual evidence that a threat exists,'' the senior official said. ''We're really talking potential threat, rather than indications that the drug cartels plan an attack on the President or something like that.''
But extraordinary precautions are being taken by the Colombian military, Colombian officials said, including fighter escorts for Air Force One, having warships off the Colombian coast and planning against possibilities like an attack by anti-aircraft missiles on the President's plane, which carries electronic devices and other equipment intended to foil such weapons.
The Colombian military is also providing thousands of soldiers for the conference of the Presidents of the United States, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, which will be held in an old fort on a secluded peninsula near the city of Cartagena.
Before Mr. Bush made his final decision to attend the conference, a choice that graphically illustrates Mr. Bush's insistence on handling diplomacy himself, most of his senior advisers cautioned against going, officials said.
 
Opposition by Advisers Wanes
Since then, the opposition has abated in the Administration, the senior official said, but the White House has confronted nearly unanimous opposition outside of Washington.
''I haven't talked to anybody who thinks the President ought to go,'' the official said. ''I mean out around, people come up and say, 'Why are you going?' ''
Mr. Bush's plan to attend the drug conference has bipartisan support in Congress. Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, the senior Republican on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committeee on Governmental Affairs, said he hoped it would prove ''that we and our Andean allies are beyond the unproductive, finger-pointing stage of recent years.''
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said, ''I think that it goes a long way in trying to repair the damage of a faulty foreign policy.''
In Cartagena, the four leaders are to issue a joint communique that will outline some new measures to combat cocaine production and export.
Judging from the draft of the joint statement, the conference will reflect some deep differences between the United States and the other nations.
The communique will include promises of increased American economic aid and more activity by Federal drug agents in stopping the flow of chemicals used to process cocaine and in tracing shipments of automatic weapons to South America. But the Andean leaders are likely to seek more economic aid than the United States is willing to provide.

HEADLINE: 42 Poorest Lands, Fearing Loss In Leverage, Plan Drive for Help

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, Feb. 11

 BODY:
In an atmosphere of gloom and foreboding, representatives of the world's 42 poorest nations met here this weekend to devise new ways to convince richer countries that nearly half a billion people need help desperately.
The sense of urgency is heightened by the fear that the lessening of East-West tensions will reduce the leverage that poor countries can exercise on the superpowers.
In these nations, which the United Nations lists officially as Least Developed Countries, the 1980's have brought more degrading poverty, declining literacy, worsening health and generally lower living standards - all made worse by large population increases, fragile environments, vulnerability to natural disasters and, often, limited civil rights or outright repression.
''In a world of plenty they remain poor,'' said President H. M. Ershad of Bangladesh in his opening speech Saturday. ''In a world of movement, their lives are static. In a world full of hope, they are fated to despair.''

Nine of the poorest countries are in Asia, 28 are in Africa, 1, Haiti, is in the Americas, and 4 are island nations in the Pacific or Indian Oceans. Bangladesh, with about 110 million people, 85 percent of them living below minimal nutritional levels, is the largest in population. It acts as spokesman for the group.
This first ministerial meeting of least developed countries, which ends on Monday, is expected to restate forcefully a plea that aid donors and international lending organizations treat the poorest nations separately from the rest of the developing world. The poorest countries have effectively fallen into a category of their own.
''The L.D.C.'s, being the poorest and weakest in the international community, deserve first consideration,'' Anwarul Karim Chowdhury, head of the economic section of Bangladesh's Foreign Ministry and organizer of the conference, said in an interview Friday. ''We have done all we can, but the people living in absolute poverty have increased. The effects of our belt-tightening, our structural adjustments, are falling worst on the most vulnerable groups, particularly women and children.''
The group of 42 will meet with donor nations in Geneva at the end of March in preparation for a larger international conference in Paris in September on the plight of the most disadvantaged countries. A similar conference took place in 1981, when there were 31 such nations.
 
No Goals Are Met
None of the major development goals set at that conference have been met.
In the world's poorest nations, there is now additional apprehension that aid, already dwindling, may all but dry up as Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan respond to the unexpected opening of Eastern Europe, where investment returns are likely to be quicker.
''The world is a safer place to live,'' Mr. Chowdhury said. ''But we feel concerned about the rush to Eastern Europe when the overall resource kitty is limited.''
''Now that the East and West have patched up, everyone suffers in the L.D.C.s,'' he added, explaining that with the big power blocs no longer needing to compete for advantage in the third world, a source of leverage was lost.
According to statistics compiled by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, average annual per capita income in the 42 countries, about $200, is only a quarter of that in the developing world as a whole.
Mr. Chowdhury said the eradication of poverty and the improvement of women's - and thereby children's -lives would be given high priority in meetings this year.

U.S. and Soviets Confident as Trade Talks Open

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The United States and the Soviet Union opened talks today on ending nearly a half-century of trade restrictions. Both sides expressed confidence that an accord could be ready for signature when President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Washington in June.
Among other things, an agreement would help the Soviet Union by cutting the unusually high duties that the United States levies on imports from the Soviet Union. 
Mr. Gorbachev is under increasing domestic pressure to show economic improvements. Mr. Bush's decision to seek a trade agreement, which was announced at the summit meeting in Malta in December, is a sign of American support for Mr. Gorbachev's economic and political reforms.
''We got off to a good, fast start,'' said a senior official at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, speaking at the end of the first day of negotiations.
The United States team is being led by the Trade Representative, Carla A. Hills, and the Deputy Trade Representative, Julius L. Katz, and includes officials from several other departments, including State, Treasury, Commerce and Labor.
Asked whether he was optimistic, Yuri N. Chumakov, the Deputy Soviet Trade Minister who heads the Soviet team, said: ''It's not a question of optimism. We are soldiers in this case.'' He was referring to the Malta directive that an agreement be reached by June. He added that his team was ''not pessimistic.''
Reflecting more open Soviet emigration policies, Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev at Malta that he would work toward granting ''most favored nation'' tariff status to Moscow as part of a trade accord. The United States is also seeking some concessions from the Soviet Union, especially assurances of greater access to its markets, for example, for machinery and other heavy equipment, where the American share has been running at under 5 percent.
As Mr. Chumakov put it tonight, the agreement could be ''a very big support for exports of U.S. goods in the Soviet market.''
Economists here say American consumers could see prices for products like Soviet vodka drop by as much as $1.25 a bottle. Prices could also be lower for luxury imports like furs and caviar.
Soviet exports to the United States are chiefly petroleum products, inorganic chemical elements and minerals, and nonferrous waste and scrap metals, as well as vodka and furs.
Given the intense competition from Japanese, South Korean and Western European exporters, it is unlikely the Soviet Union will sell more consumer goods in the American market, at least over the short term.
The principal American export to the Soviet Union is food. Over the first 11 months of last year the United States exported $3.82 billion to the Soviet Union, with most of this grain. Imports totaled $658 million.
Some American officials say they think the easing of trade restrictions over the next three to four years could lead to two-way trade in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion.
Both American and Soviet officials indicated that the issue that will probably give them the most trouble will be the duration of the agreement.

HEADLINE: SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA;
Black South Africans in New York Area Are Upbeat but Cautious

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Black South Africans in the New York area said in interviews yesterday that the release of Nelson Mandela improved the prospects for negotiations between the Pretoria Government and South Africans opposing apartheid.
Some of the South Africans, scholars, students and participants in anti-apartheid organizations, said they interpreted the release as an acknowledgment by the Government of the strength and pivotal role of the African National Congress, the leading anti-apartheid organization, which was granted legal status on Feb. 2.
Some also said that Mr. Mandela's return to the political scene would increase cohesiveness within the anti-apartheid movement. And many routinely referred to what they viewed as continuing evils and rigidity in the South African Government's policies and laws. 
''The release of Mandela has removed a major roadblock toward a negotiated settlement'' said Bernard Magubane, a professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut at Storrs.
 
Group Called Unconquerable
Professor Magubane, whose books include ''The Political Economy of Race and Class in South Africa,'' said Mr. Mandela's release showed that the South African Government had recognized the durability of the African National Congress, to which both he and Mr. Mandela belong.
''For almost 40 years the party that rules South Africa has used the resources of the white-minority state for the destruction of the A.N.C. and the demonizing of its leadership, including Mandela, who for almost 27 years was a non-person whose picture couldn't be shown in any of the South African newspapers, nor his words be quoted,'' Professor Magubane said. ''Suddenly, we have this regime not only unbanning the A.N.C., but also devoting a whole day to observe the release of Mandela on its TV network,'' he said. ''What this suggests to me is that there has been a realization in the regime that the A.N.C. and the ideals of political force for which it was formed are unconquerable.''
 
Release Is 'Not Enough'
Seloka Phirwa, a member of the staff at the African National Congress's observer mission to the United Nations, said the release of Mr. Mandela ''is an indication that the regime may be getting serious about negotiations at long last.''
But he noted that various conditions set by opponents of apartheid for negotiations with the Government remain unfulfilled. Letting Mr. Mandela go, he said, ''has been a bold step, but it's not enough.''
Peter Molotsi, who teaches history and African studies at Rutgers University and is a member of another anti-apartheid group, the Pan-Africanist Congress, said Mr. Mandela's release ''raises hope for better things to come regarding the interests of African people'' in South Africa.
''I do believe and hope that his release is setting a new stage for the struggle of the African people in the country,'' he said.
But Dr. Molotsi emphasized that ''we demand the release of all other political prisoners.'' And he said the congress ''still stands unwaveringly committed to a unitary South Africa based on one person, one vote,'' and insists ''that the land ultimately return to the African people.''
That means, he said, that ''the indigenous people'' become the owners of all the land in South Africa.
 
Continued Sanctions Backed
The current labor secretary of the Pan-Africanist Congress, Lesoana S. Makhanda, said Mr. Mandela was being released ''merely into a larger jail, which is the rest of South Africa.''
Mr. Makhanda, who was in Manhattan yesterday, said Mr. Mandela took positions, in his first public pronouncements after being released, that dovetailed with important Pan Africanist Congress positions.
Mr. Makhanda said ''we are quite happy'' that Mr. Mandela affirmed that economic sanctions against the South African Government should remain in place and that, as Mr. Makhanda put it, ''there is not a necessity for armed struggle to be discarded.''
A student leader, Thoahlane Thoahlane, said, ''I see the release of Mandela as a symbol of unity amongst different groups within the country.'' Mr. Thoahlane, president of the New York chapter of the South African Azanian Student Movement in North America, called the return of Mr. Mandela ''a uniting factor among people who oppose the apartheid system.''
 
Mandela the Symbol
Jerry Mofokeng, an actor and a theatrical director, said he thought Mr. Mandela's re-emergence would give the anti-apartheid movement new cohesiveness and strength. He said Mr. Mandela ''in a sense personifies the hope for freedom not only for blacks but for the entire nation.''
Mr. Mofokeng said Mr. Mandela's first declarations after leaving confinement were tantamount to saying to the Government, ''Hey guys, listen, I have the same demands as I had when you put me in here. They are just the same. I am even saying we must be more intense than we were.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Empathy's Drawback: No Room To Disagree

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Question: How do you tell the difference between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress? Answer: That is just what the Democrats would like to figure out.
The Democrats are becoming increasingly aggravated by their inability to draw distinctions between themselves and Mr. Bush. Part of the reason for this is that the Democrats can't agree on who they are. But equally important is that even when they do take a firm stand on something, Mr. Bush usually closes right in to say he shares their concerns. 
Mr. Bush has proven to be quite effective at the politics of empathy. Education. The Environment. Civil Rights. Child Care. These are all issues of potential weakness for a Republican President. They are also issues on which Mr. Bush has expressed his concern.
The next step for the Democrats is to say concern is not enough; we need action. Mr. Bush is ready there, too. The week after he said that bigotry must end, the Democrats (joined by a few Republicans) introduced legislation to shore up civil rights laws that had been curtailed by the Supreme Court.
The Administration had said no legislation was needed. Within hours after the bill was introduced, the Justice Department reversed the stand. The Administration would support legislation, although not as sweeping as the Democrats' bill.
A central goal of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda seems to be to prevent substantial political space from opening up between him and the Democrats. It is the exact opposite of the Reagan approach.
Where President Reagan resisted civil rights measures, Mr. Bush says he is for them. Where Mr. Reagan proclaimed his opposition to abortion, Mr. Bush talks about how the big tent of the Republican Party can shelter various views.
The Democrats have been searching for new issues to define themselves. They planned to make ''economic competitiveness'' a watchword. But before the ink was dry on their speeches, the President was visiting high-tech laboratories.
The Democrats protest that the details are crucial and that Mr. Bush's rhetoric does not match reality. You can't be an education president and call for only a 2 percent increase in education spending, Speaker Tom Foley declared after Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message.
But from a distance, which is how most Americans view politics, it looks like all those Washington insiders are just haggling over the fine points, with Democrats wanting to spend more, and everyone remembers Mr. Bush's warning to Congress that voters did not ''send us here to bicker.''
In fact, the Democrats would be doing well were the public even to notice that they are bickering with the President. When Republicans organized two focus groups in Chicago to gather impressions of the President and his Message, not one of the 24 people knew that the Democrats had responded to the address. Nor did anyone know who Tom Foley is.
In the short run, Mr. Bush's approach has helped to keep his popularity at the ionospheric levels he achieved at the end of his first year. But more than that: He and his strategists are beginning to think like leaders of a majority party, and are trying to assemble the broad and disparate coalitions that used to be both bane and benefit of the Democratic Party.
The difficulties were apparent the other day when Mr. Bush gave a speech about global warming, although he never used the phrase. Writing the speech was a struggle, as the White House sought to demonstrate concern without frightening manufacturers and utilities with plans to require costly controls.
Inside Washington there was great fascination with the internal Administration feuds over this speech. But outside, all that people know is Mr. Bush wants to help. ''So he wants to plant a billion trees,'' said Tony Podesta, a Democratic political consultant, capsulizing the Democrats' frustration. ''The Democrats are left with: 'Should we try to plant a billion and a half?' ''
Mr. Podesta also described both the frustration and grudging admiration Democrats have these days for the strategists of the Bush Administration: ''I think they're really underestimated. They have a bumbling schedule and a clumsy attitude toward intra-party politics. There's no soaring rhetoric. But they've tended to occupy two-thirds of the political space. If you continue to blunt whatever argument your opponent can offer against you, you create a situation in which it becomes impossible to attack you.''

HEADLINE: Coal Accord in Doubt as Fines Stand

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

 BODY:
A judge in Virginia refused last night to suspend $64 million in strike fines levied against the United Mine Workers of America, raising doubts that the long, costly and sometime violent walkout against the Pittston Coal Company would end soon.
The union has said that until the fines are lifted it will not ask its membership to vote on a tentative contract agreement reached with Pittston during round-the-clock negotiating sessions Dec. 31.
But the union's general counsel, Robert Stropp, said in Lebanon, Va., that union leaders would reassess that decision, The Associated Press reported.
 
Community Service Proposed
Contending that the fines, many for strike-related violence, are unfair and the most onerous ever set in a labor dispute, the union has proposed that in place of monetary punishment its members do 10,000 hours of community service. It also promised that it would adhere to strike laws in the future. The union was accused of scores of violations of specific court orders during the strike, with many violations involving unruly picketing. 
Pittston joined the union in court yesterday, reversing its earlier hard line against strikers and arguing that suspension of the fines was justified because of the labor peace that would follow. Some coal industry officials said Pittston was reacting not only to economic pressure but to the union's promise to obey strike laws.
But the judge, Donald McGlothlin Jr. of Russell County Circuit Court in Lebanon, Va., was unmoved by the union and company arguments, saying they were ''an affront'' to justice and would set a bad precedent for breaking the law in future labor disputes. The company's decision to reverse its stance on union lawbreaking was ''incredible irony,'' he added.
Judge McGlothlin gave both parties 10 days to return to his court with new arguments on whether he should cancel the fines.
 
Dispute Over Work Rules
The strike by 1,700 miners, now in its 10th month, is mainly a dispute over work rules and health benefits. It is the most serious labor dispute in the coal industry in a decade.
Other conditions that the union and company negotiators said had to be met before a ratification vote have largely been satisfied in recent weeks.
Judge McGlothin's decision yesterday followed an agreement Friday by the National Labor Relations Board to set aside all charges before it resulting from the strike, both union and company actions. It was the board that first extracted the union's pledge to adhere to strike laws in the future.
The union has said ratification of the proposed new contract, which includes special arrangements for administering health and retirement funds, also will not take place until trustees of those funds approve the proposed changes. Union officials said tonight that they considered such approval all but certain, and they suggested that the ratification process would begin in a matter of hours should the fines be suspended.
 
Health Benefits Are Focus
No details of the tentative agreement have been released, but both sides have agreed from the outset that the strike has national implications.
The main sticking point has been health benefits, with the union arguing that they are inviolate in an industry with numerous health hazards, and the company arguing that the benefits have become so expensive that it is having trouble remaining competetive.
Pittston is Virginia's largest coal producer. Its last economic report indicated the strike had cut its production by a third or more and cost it more than $27 million in lost sales and other expenses.
The mine workers union, which has about 65,000 active members around the country, began the walkout with a strike fund of almost $100 million. The 1,700 strikers have been getting $220 a week in strike benefits, slightly more than a third of their usual salary.
Industry officials estimate the strike has cost the miners a total of $65 million in lost wages and benefits. Merchants and other business people in southwest Virginia also report significant losses because of the strike.
Only about a third of the nation's coal is now mined by union labor, compared with more than 90 percent in the 1950's. Automation has eliminated almost half a million mining jobs and, at the same time, increased mine production.
But union labor is still important in the coal fields because labor unrest means instability in an industry that is increasingly competitive both at home and abroad.

HEADLINE: Jewish Group Faces Reorganization

BYLINE: By ARI GOLDMAN

 BODY:
The American Jewish Committee, widely regarded as the dean of Jewish organizations in the United States, plans a major restructuring that it hopes will give the group a sharper focus and reduce its costs.
About 40 of the group's 275 employees will be laid off and $1 million will be cut from its $16 million annual budget, Sholom D. Comay, president of the committee, said last week.
Mr. Comay confirmed the extent of the cuts after they were reported in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a Manhattan-based news agency.
The American Jewish Committee, a civil rights group with offices in 31 cities around the country, is involved with a wide range of activities in areas like education, public policy, Israel and interfaith relations. It will receive a ''top-to-bottom review,'' Mr. Comay said, to determine what areas should be cut or streamlined. 
 
Consensus at Board Meeting
Mr. Comay, a lawyer and corporate executive from Pittsburgh, said he received a mandate to proceed with the reorganization from the committee's board, which met this month in St. Petersburg, Fla.
There was a consensus at the meeting that the committee had branched off into too many areas and needed to focus its work under the broad cateogory of ''intergroup relations.'' As a result, he said, emphasis would now be placed on eliminating bigotry, working for peace in the Middle East, strengthening the Jewish family and enhancing the relationship between the United States and Israel.
Committee officials said there was a consensus to eliminate the organization's activities in Western Europe and South America. In addition, the international relations offices in New York and Washington will be merged into one office in Washington.
The elimination of the committee's liberal magazine, Present Tense, was made public last week. Its conservative journal, Commentary, will continue to publish.
 
An Economic Decision
Mr. Comay said the decision to stop publishing one magazine and keep the other represented an economic judgment, not an ideological one. He said Commentary was able to raise private money to keep it afloat, while Present Tense was not.
The American Jewish Committee was founded in 1906 by a number of prominent Jews, including Jacob Schiff, Mayer Sulzberger, Louis Marshall, Oscar Straus and Cyrus Adler. Prompted by a wave of pogroms against Jews in Russia, the members, mainly of German descent, formed the organization ''to prevent the infraction of the civil and religious rights of Jews in any part of the world.''
At the outbreak of World War I the committee helped organize the American Jewish Relief Committee, a central relief fund for war victims. With the rise of Hitler in Germany and the outbreak of World War II, the group worked to press the Roosevelt Administration, the Vatican and the League of Nations to save Jewish lives. When it found that its efforts had largely been in vain, the committee again turned to the massive job of refugee relief.
While its early attitude toward Zionism was sometimes ambivalent, the committee became an enthusiastic supporter after Israel declared its independence in 1948.
Over the years the committee has investigated and battled anti-Semitic groups in the United States, disclosing the work of hate groups and Nazi sympathizers. And it has taken a leading role in the struggle for equal rights for blacks in the United States.
 
External Challenges Cited
In recent years the committee has suffered from staff instability; it has changed executive vice presidents five times in the last decade.
Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, the author of ''The Jews in America'' and a columnist for Present Tense, said the committee has been challenged externally by more aggressive groups.
''The committee has been outflanked on the anti-Semitism issue by the A.D.L. and the Wiesenthal Center, which have more rock-'em, sock-'em styles,'' Rabbi Hertzberg said, referring to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the California-based Simon Wiesenthal Center.
He also noted that another organization, the American Jewish Congress, has attracted many liberals with its willingness to criticize hard-line positions of the Israeli Government under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
The committee, Rabbi Hertzberg said, has been left with an identity crisis. ''It is left asking itself, 'What is our mission?' ''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 15, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 13 about reorganization plans by the American Jewish Committee referred incompletely to its intentions for a role in Western Europe and South America. The human rights group has since said that while ending its formal staff structure along geographic boundaries, it will continue to pursue issues of concern to the Jewish community wherever they arise.

HEADLINE: Smoking Limits Gain in Virginia

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Feb. 12

 BODY:
A bill to limit smoking in this tobacco state won preliminary approval today in the House of Delegates, over the objections of health lobbyists and legislators who had backed a bill calling for stricter regulation.
The bill would require establishment of no-smoking areas in state and local government buildings. It would allow local governments to impose stricter rules against smoking, but would limit local efforts to ban smoking in small businesses, in theaters and on public transportation.
The measure passed in a voice vote and was due for a final House vote Tuesday. If approved, the bill will have to be reconciled with more stringent legislation recently approved by the Senate.
Some legislators worried about the reaction to the bill in a state whose economy was built on tobacco.
''Seldom in my career have I built my own political gallows and provided the rope,'' said Delegate Charles R. Hawkins, a Republican from tobacco-growing Pittsylvania County. ''If I vote for this, I might be doing that.''
It would allow local governments to demand no-smoking areas in restaurants and would ban smoking in elevators, schools, indoor service lines and school buses.
But the measure would prohibit local ordinances from regulating smoking in businesses with less than 10,000 square feet of floor space or in privately owned meeting rooms, in theaters or on public transportation. The bill does not address smoking in private work areas.
The rejected rival bill, similar to that already approved by the Senate, would have allowed workers to declare their areas smoke-free by a two-thirds vote.

HEADLINE: Sunrise in South Africa

 BODY:
The jail that opened Sunday for Nelson Mandela began to free a nation even as it freed a man. After 27 years, and with the whole world watching, South Africa saw a half-mythical prisoner recalled to political life. Mr. Mandela rose impressively to a remarkable occasion. Calmly and without bitterness, he displayed the measured dignity the old Romans described as gravitas. 
Mr. Mandela praised his radical followers for their steadfastness, but reminded them that democratic principles had to be respected. He excoriated the hateful system of apartheid, but praised President F. W. de Klerk as a man of integrity. He defended the ''armed struggle'' but hoped that a new climate would soon end the need for a ''defensive'' response to racial repression.
And while urging the West not to lift economic sanctions until apartheid is finally buried, he called for open negotiations to shape a new South Africa rooted in universal suffrage.
That won't happen quickly, or easily. But a corner was turned when South African television dared show the outlawed flag of the African National Congress as Mr. Mandela walked free through the vineyards of Cape Town. ''The sun is not just for the growing of grapes,'' a commentator said. ''The sun is shining on South Africa.''
By heeding those too long denied a place in the sun, Americans can help speed the transition. Global sanctions have plainly helped pry open prison doors, hasten the legalization of the African National Congress and other proscribed groups and bring about a partial end to the emergency. These steps are a vindication of sanctions, not an argument for repealing them.
President Bush has taken the right first step by inviting both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela to Washington. For the moment, as Mr. Bush suggested yesterday, that seems ample reward for Mr. de Klerk's courage. Meantime, however, Congress needs soon to review its conditions for ending sanctions against South Africa. It may make sense to ease some penalties as Pretoria moves forward, thereby providing incentives for further change while keeping the legislation in force.
Under the 1986 sanctions law, the President can waive or modify sanctions if Pretoria frees all political prisoners and meets three of four remaining conditions. Mr. Mandela has been freed, but other political prisoners languish in jail. And only one of the other four stipulations - legalizing opposition political groups - has been met. The other three require Pretoria to end emergency rule, to repeal the laws imposing racial segregation and to begin good-faith negotiations between dominant whites and the huge black majority.
What those talks can achieve is far from clear. President de Klerk has repeatedly declared that any new constitution must provide guarantees against the domination of any group by another. For his part, Mr. Mandela offers this definition of his goals: ''Universal suffrage on a common voters roll in a united democratic and non-racial South Africa.'' Finding ways to mesh these principles, possibly in a federal system incorporating a bill of rights, won't be easy. But it's not impossible.
In any case, the first perilous steps have been taken on freedom's road. Enlightened South Africans are at last talking rather than shouting across racial barricades. Leaders are breaking the chains of dogma. In Cape Town as elsewhere in these amazing times, the unthinkable has become imaginable, and a struggle for human rights begun by nameless ordinary people has found champions in leaders like Mikhail Gorbachev, Lech Walesa, Vaclev Havel, F. W. de Klerk and, now, Nelson Mandela.

HEADLINE: Intellectuals May Have Changed, but They Haven't Faded Away

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Intellectual Issue for the 1990's Is Why America's Intellectuals Have Faded Away'' (Week in Review, Jan. 28) is actually a nonissue, as well as a case of nostalgic sour grapes. There are today more ''public intellectuals'' than ever, whether they are writing for Op-Ed pages and national magazines, are interviewed on national television or are working as consultants for government or private industry. 
What has faded away is a mono-poly, once held by a small group of famous essayists, literary critics and novelists doubling as social commentators, such as Edmund Wilson or Norman Mailer. Instead, public intellectuals are now increasingly recruited from among experts, in a variety of fields, who can also think broadly and express their ideas in plain English.
For better or for worse, economist-intellectuals get a large share of the limelight these days, for example, Milton Friedman and Kenneth Galbraith, or George Gilder and Robert Reich from a younger generation, but then their knowledge seems to be needed more than general intellectual insight in a public life that is marked by recurring economic problems.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Turnpike Plan Dwindles Despite $2 Billion in Debt

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Five years ago the New Jersey Turnpike Authority issued $2 billion in bonds to finance the widening of 35 miles of the state's most important road. Today much of the project has been abandoned, none of it is complete, and the authority is seeking large toll increases to pay the cost of the borrowed money it is still deciding how to spend.
Critics say the turnpike project is the tale of an independent authority swerving out of control: an agency that can borrow, spend, and make major policy decisions without close scrutiny by the state and without answering to the public.
The critics, who include regional planners and aides to former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, say the idea for the bond issue was quickly concocted by a turnpike chairman who wanted to run for governor and by Wall Street bankers who made tens of millions.
The authority consulted neither transportation nor environmental agencies as it designed the plan, which would have had a major effect on roads, mass transit and the environment in the nation's most densely populated state.
 
'Nobody Looked Closely'
Some of the state's experts who reviewed the turnpike plan say that when the authority borrowed the money, it had no clear idea of how long the project would take, how much it would cost or its effect on traffic and the environment. 
And the authority informed Governor Kean of the $2 billion bond issue only days before it was offered for sale.
''I see the turnpike as a classic case of an authority run wild,'' said Barbara L. Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit agency concerned with the metropolitan region. ''This independent authority has driven public policy in New Jersey. Nobody looked closely at the plan because it was presented to all of us as a fait accompli.''
The authority's executives say they have been unfairly criticized by state officials who are jealous of their independence. They have run the turnpike well for four decades, they say, and their decisions have been based on the best interests of the public.
The former chairman who started the widening plan, Joseph (Bo) Sullivan, said that the decision to borrow $2 billion had saved the public millions of dollars.
The bonds cost the public nothing in interest payments over the last five years, Mr. Sullivan said, and in the coming years the payments are likely to remain well below current market rates. ''The purpose of an independent authority is to work on its own to get the job done,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''Doing great public works is always complicated. It didn't deter Robert Moses.'' Building Quickly, Planning Secretly Much like the public authorities headed by Mr. Moses, who designed much of the transportation system around New York City, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority was established as an independent entity in 1948, to build a 118-mile ''superhighway'' between Philadelphia and New York.
The roadway was completed in 23 months, an accomplishment its executives attributed to their independent role under the law. The authority is governed by a board of unpaid commissioners whose decisions can be vetoed by the governor, but the authority can borrow money, hire staff, and award contracts free of direct supervision by other state agencies or the Legislature.
The busiest toll road in the nation, the turnpike is now traveled by more than 600,000 vehicles a day. By 1984, the authority's staff was reporting increasing congestion, as the state's economy boomed and workers sought to get to and from hundreds of thousands of new jobs in northern New Jersey.
In 1985, Mr. Sullivan, the chairman, along with the authority staff, settled on a grand plan to ease the congestion, the largest construction project since the turnpike had been built.
On May 10 he announced that the turnpike would add one lane in each direction from New Brunswick to Newark and six lanes along the western spur. He also proposed a redesigned interchange at exit 16W, near the Meadowlands Sports Complex.
Public agencies usually finance such projects by borrowing in stages as costs are incurred. But the authority decided to borrow all it needed at one time.
Mr. Sullivan, in an interview last week, recalled that the investment banking firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company had advised the authority that if it borrowed the money in 1985, before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect, it could invest the money at a higher rate of return than it would pay in debt service. In effect, the bonds would pay for themselves until construction began.
The authority and its financial advisors put together the project and bond issue in the following months, largely without consulting the state's fiscal, transportation or environmental agencies, former Kean officials say.
''The turnpike put this together without talking to anybody,'' one former commissioner said. ''If they had started incrementally, scoped out everything, they would not have been able to say in good faith they could complete this in five years.'' Telling the Governor He Had No Choice Former top aides to Governor Kean say they and the Governor were stunned when Mr. Sullivan presented the finished bond offering to Mr. Kean, giving him less than two weeks to review and approve the plan.
One former aide recalls that Mr. Sullivan told Mr. Kean that if he did not agree to the bond offering, the state would lose hundreds of millions of dollars. In an interview, Mr. Kean, who left office last month, said he had felt compelled to approve the plan.
''My question was, why can't we take a step back, take our time, do it in a different way?'' Mr. Kean said. ''They said it is so far along, it would jeopardize our financial reputation in New York.''
A memo to the Commissioner of Transportation, Roger Bodman, from Deputy Commissioner Michael F. Barrett, on March 18, 1986, concluded that the turnpike's traffic projections were overstated because the roads leading to the turnpike could not handle so many vehicles. The memo seemed to suggest that the authority had considered its highway in relative isolation.
The Transportation Department staff also said that by committing so much money to the widening, the the authority was depriving other worthy projects of funds.
Further, the department found that the authority had not comprehended the vast environmental problems of adding to the highway over the meadowlands. In many ways, it seemed to Kean aides, the authority had planned the project as if it were still the 1940's, before a vast web of environmental regulations had come into being.
''The extent of widening proposed by the Turnpike Authority appears excessive,'' Mr. Bodman wrote in a confidential memo to Governor Kean dated April 1. ''The authority's publicized schedule for advancing its plans to construction appears to be unrealistic.''
Despite criticism, the authority continued to embrace a major widening until last spring, when a study by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating firm, found that the expansion would cost $1 billion more than planned. Mr. Sullivan, who had left the agency in 1988 to explore a race for governor, blamed the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies for dragging out the project, ''The Corps of Engineers changed the rules on us tremendously,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''We had no way of anticipating the environmental costs of the project.'' Project Is Scaled Back, But Not the Bond Issue Faced with the prospect of cleaning up dozens of landfills and toxic-waste sites, the authority's new chairman, Frank A. Loveys, said the authority would scale back the project and abandon the most environmentally difficult construction in the meadowlands.
The new plan called for adding six lanes to the highway between exits 8A and 9 below New Brunswick and one lane each way from exits 11 to 15E. The plan, which includes improvements, is expected to cost between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.
Mr. Loveys said that a toll rise was necessary to begin paying off the interest on the bonds, which will begin to cost the Authority more than $100 million a year begining next November.
A provision in the bond issue permits the authority to return the unused portion of the $2 billion to bondholders later this year. But he described such a choice as unwise, saying that the funds are now borrowed at a rate of 7.2 percent, far lower than the state could expect to receive if it floats new bonds in the future.
A meeting is scheduled for tonight at 7 in Mount Laurel on a proposal to raise tolls as much as 135 percent over the next few years.
The new Governor, Jim Florio, has been highly critical of the independence of state authorities and the proposed toll increase. But he has not said whether he will approve the toll increase or the authority's plans to use the remaining funds.
Rather than retire bonds and return the unused portion of the funds, the authority told Governor Kean that it was willing to use the money to contribute to other projects, including mass transit. But again, critics say, the authority chose to make transportation policy decisions independently, often disregarding the opinions of outside experts and other agencies. Going Its Own Way On Hudson Waterfront Last year representatives of state agencies held a series of meetings on transportation projects proposed for the area between the Meadowlands and the Hudson waterfront. Among the projects were two plans to increase public access to the waterfront.
One, proposed by Hartz Mountain Industries, called for drilling a new tunnel through the Palisades and building a road and a rail or monorail system to the northern waterfront, near the Lincoln Tunnel. Hartz, the largest real-estate development company in New Jersey, owns property in the Meadowlands and on the northern waterfront.
Another project, called Bergen Arches, would bring buses, trucks and cars to the southern waterfront near Jersey City.
Participants in the meetings and aides to Governor Kean say that the authority repeatedly insisted on giving priority to the Hartz plan, and that its representatives threatened to boycott a news conference held by Mr. Kean last October to describe the plans.
In a recent paper on its capital plans for 1990, the authority again gives priority to financing the Hartz tunnel and monorail at a cost of $273 million.
Hartz contends the plan would be the fastest to build and the most economical for developing the waterfront, with its constricted road network.
But a Department of Transportation review of the projects concludes that the potential for development in the southern waterfront is greater than in the north, that the Bergen Arches project is likely to handle twice as much traffic, and that a dollar spent on the Bergen Arches project would develop three times as much commercial office space as a dollar spent on the Hartz project would produce.
One of the people disturbed by the authority's support for the Hartz project is Delores T. Prideaux, an authority commissioner who questioned whether Hartz Mountain's public relations consultant influenced the authority. The consultant, Alan Marcus, is also employed by the authority, which has paid him $166,000 in fees.
Mr. Loveys said that the authority had made no commitment to the Hartz project or any other plan for the Hudson waterfront and that the authority favored working with the state on the best transportation project.
Mr. Loveys said that although Mr. Marcus's work for Hartz and the Authority might give the appearance of conflict of interest, he was certain Mr. Marcus would do nothing to influence the authority in favor of financing Hartz projects.
''I have a higher standard on conflict of interests than even the public, trust me,'' said Mr. Marcus, when asked about Ms. Prideaux's criticism. ''I have offered to resign three times. The Turnpike Authority refused to let me go.''

HEADLINE: Idyllic Theory Of Goddesses Creates Storm

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
MARIJA Gimbutas is an eminent archeologist who says she believes the world once lived in peace. It was during the Stone Age, she says, when goddesses were worshiped and societies were centered on women.
Then, about 6,000 years ago, this Old European culture, in which the two sexes lived in harmony with one another and with nature, was shattered by patriarchal invaders who installed their warlike gods in place of the life-generating Great Goddess.
It is a thesis that has made the 68-year-old professor of archeology at the University of California at Los Angeles a heroine among many feminist social critics and religious thinkers and a controversial figure, to say the least, among her colleagues.
References to Dr. Gimbutas's theories are sprinkled liberally throughout a growing literature about goddess-based religion. For some time feminist writers have been seeking non-patriarchal mythologies and rituals in Jungian psychology, reconstructed notions of witchcraft, or even in pure creations of the imagination. But Dr. Gimbutas gives them something more: the seeming stamp of science and the reassurance of history. 
Her work was a major scholarly source for Riane Eisler's ''The Chalice and the Blade,'' a sweeping analysis of cultural evolution that has become a minor classic in the women's movement. In ''The Once and Future Goddess,'' a new book on goddess symbols and images, Elinor W. Gadon calls Dr. Gimbutas's research germinal and fundamentally important.
''Marija Gimbutas is the one world-class scholar showing that what feminists wished were true is in fact true,'' said John Loudon, a senior editor at Harper & Row who worked on the archeologist's book published last year, ''The Language of the Goddess.''
Dr. Gimbutas is indeed a prolific scholar, the author of 20 books, including a monumental study of Bronze Age Indo-European cultures, and more than 200 articles. She has directed five excavations in Europe, reads more than 20 languages and brings to her work an extraordinary knowledge of European folklore and mythology.
But the skepticism about this thesis by many leading archeologists and anthropologists is unmistakable, although it is almost always comes with expressions of respect for Dr. Gimbutas's other contributions and with concern for her struggles with lymphatic cancer.
Yet the growing acceptance of her theories among nonexperts has led some of these scholars to feel that they should make their own criticism more widely known. In the end, they say, Dr. Gimbutas's work raises sensitive questions not only about prehistoric civilization but also about the relations between speculation and scholarship and between scholarship and social movements.
Dr. Gimbutas argues that between 7000 B.C. and 3500 B.C. the people of Europe lived in sedentary agricultural societies that worshiped the Great Goddess, delighted in nature, shunned war, built comfortable settlements rather than forts and crafted superb ceramics rather than weapons. The social system was matrilineal. Women headed clans or served as queen-priestesses. Men labored as hunters and builders. But neither men nor women dominated the other sex.
Death was not absent from this world. Death-wielding goddesses are found among the female deities that predominated in this period but their worship, Dr. Gimbutas theorizes, was always closely linked to themes of life and regeneration.
Between roughly 4000 B.C. and 3500 B.C. this peaceful and harmonious ''Old Europe'' was shattered by waves of Indo-European invaders on horseback, the theory holds. These marauders from the Russian steppes transformed Europe. Their warrior gods dethroned the nurturing Goddess. Her various manifestations were incorporated into the male-dominated pantheons as wives, daughters or consorts, sometimes eroticized like Aphrodite or militarized like Athena. Patriarchy and hierarchy replaced sexual and social egalitarianism.
The Goddess religion and its symbols went underground, putting on the masks of subordinate but still powerful female Greek and Roman deities, of the Virgin Mary, of mysterious figures in folklore and fairy tales. But a substratum of Old Europe survived in harvest customs and peasant beliefs about springs, rocks, trees and animals, in medieval magic and the practices that Christian authorities persecuted as witchcraft.
This secret stream is essential to decoding much of Western culture, Dr. Gimbutas maintains, but it is also a source of ancient wisdom that modern civilization must tap to counter its own alienation from nature.
It is a dramatic story of paradise lost and now rediscovered. Originally set forth in a 1974 book, ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe,'' it inspired, besides feminist thinkers, a number of women artists who were captivated by the remarkable images of ancient female figurines in Dr. Gimbutas's book and later publications.
 
Ideas Welcomed by Some
Her ideas have been welcomed by eminent figures like the mythologist Joseph Campbell, who wrote a foreword to Dr. Gimbutas's latest volume before he died in 1987, and the anthropologist, Ashley Montagu, who hailed that book as ''a benchmark in the history of civilization.''
But many other investigators of prehistoric Europe have not shared the enthusiasm. Bernard Wailes, a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, says that most of Dr. Gimbutas's peers consider her ''immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis.''
''She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument,'' Mr. Wailes said. ''Most of us tend to say, oh my God, here goes Marija again,'' he said.
Ruth Tringham is a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley who is an authority on the same time and geographical area of prehistoric Europe as Dr. Gimbutas. Choosing pages at random from ''The Language of the Goddess,'' she repeatedly voiced dismay over assertions that demanded, she said, serious qualifications. ''No other archeologist I know would express this certainty,'' Ms. Tringham said.
Linda Ellis, an archeologist at California State University at San Francisco, who took courses from Dr. Gimbutas as an undergraduate at U.C.L.A. and has worked at some of the same archeologiscal sites in southeastern Europe, said, ''We're looking at small agricultural villages of no more than between 10 and 25 homes.
''We can tell a lot about their economy, what they traded, what they made, what they ate, how they built homes, with whom they had contacts. The problem becomes how far you can push that, how much you can say about how a person thought,'' she said. Ms. Ellis makes it clear that she thinks Dr. Gimbutas has gone too far.
David Anthony, an assistant professor of anthropology at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., whose areas of research also coincide closely with Dr. Gimbutas's, said that, contrary to her claims, the cultures of Old Europe built fortified sites that indicate the presence of warfare. There is also evidence of weapons, including some used as symbols of status, and of human sacrifice, hierarchy and social inequality, Mr. Anthony added.
The collapse of Old Europe is not fully understood, he said. It may have been due to a change in climate, the exhaustion of the soil, internal social dissent or population pressures.
Mr. Anthony agreed that the arrival of migrants and the emergence of less sedentary, stock-grazing societies around 3000 B.C. was a principal component of later European developments. But there was not real evidence that the migrants caused the collapse rather than followed it, he said.
 
'Extremely Foreign' Societies
There is also no evidence that women played the central role in either the social structure or the religion of Old Europe, he said. These were ''important and impressive societies,'' he said, but rather than Dr. Gimbutas's ''Walt Disney version'' they were ''extremely foreign to anything we're familiar with.''
Dr. Gimbutas said in an interview that the 19th-century Swiss scholar Johann Jakob Bachofen and his followers Robert Briffault in France and James Frazier in England were among her forerunners.
In ancient laws and legends and in the beliefs of isolated tribes or communities, they found vestiges of an earlier matriarchal stage of human civilization centered on worship of a mother goddess.
Dr. Gimbutas tempers her forerunners' notion of strict matriarchy, but her similarities to these predecessors divides her from many colleagues.
Anthropologists are now uncomfortable with what, a century ago, were popular schemes of civilization passing from one well-defined stage to another. Archeologists reject Dr. Gimbutas's reliance on the folklore and mythology of historical times to interpret objects from many millenia earlier.
But what others see as Dr. Gimbutas's weaknesses, she sees as weaknesses of her discipline. Archeologists are not interested in religion, she said, and they lack the knowledge and language skills to use comparative mythology and folklore to interpret their findings.
Her own interpretations involve extended chains of associations. Using stripes or hatchmarks or other motifs as clues, she identifies figurines, often from societies thousands of years apart, with specific animal deities, which in turn are assigned specific religious functions.
 
'A Very Brave Woman'
All of this she subsumes into the ''cohesive and persistent ideological system'' of the Great Goddess. It is a method that Mr. Campbell, in an introduction to her book, compares to the one used in deciphering the Rosetta Stone but her critics find fanciful or abitrary.
''In a way she's a very brave woman, very brave to step over the boundary and to take a guess,'' said Ms. Ellis. But Ms. Ellis strongly rejects Dr. Gimbutas's detailed assertions.
Dr. Gimbutas calls the enthusiastic reception of her work by artists and feminists ''an incredible gift'' coming late in her life. But ''I was not a feminist and I had never any thought I would be helping feminists,'' she said.
Still, ''The Language of the Goddess'' rings with a fervent belief that knowledge about a Goddess-worshiping past can guide the world toward a sexually egalitarian, nonviolent and ''earth-centered'' future.
This immediate, some would say ideological, agenda is one thing that disturbs some archeologists and anthropologists. They recall how easily their fields have been bent to ideological purposes, including the use Nazi scientists made of Indo-European prehistory to bolster claims of Aryan superiority.
In endorsing ''The Language of the Goddess,'' Gerda Lerner, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, who has written on the origins of patriarchy, said that although Dr. Gimbutas's theory ''can never be proven,'' by simply providing an imaginative alternative to male-centered explanations, the theory can ''challenge, inspire and fascinate.''
Dr. Gimbutas's critics agree that speculation and intuitive leaps are essential prods to scholarly progress.
''But it is the responsibility of the leaper to be aware that they are leaping and to make other people aware of it also,'' Ms. Tringham said.

How a Grim Black Area Got That Way

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The ''Throwaway People'' of tonight's ''Frontline'' live in Shaw, a beat-up, beaten-down district of Washington where the facts of life are grimly familiar: unemployment, single-parent welfare families, school dropouts, drugs and crime. This hour, on Channel 13 at 9 P.M., offers a close-up of sites off the Beltway.
The reporter and narrator, Roger Wilkins, looks back on the way Shaw, once a vibrant black community, got this way. Families from the rural South, who came north between 1910 and 1970, found opportunity; low-skilled jobs paid enough for a man to support his wife and children. They lived in ghettos, but life had stability. 
The civil rights movement changed that. The most successful won the opportunity to leave; a quarter of a million moved from Washington to its suburbs between 1970 and 1980.
''America creamed off the luckiest and best-trained blacks and assimilated them to some degree,'' says Mr. Wilkins. ''And Shaw was left with the less fortunate.''
The neighborhood guides are Ernest Peterson, who owns a messenger service that employs 16 young black men, and Frank Wright, who works at a settlement house. They are gloomily realistic about Shaw's thousands of ill-educated, unskilled young men, a third of whom are destined to be arrested on drug charges by the time they are 30 years old.
''They're true businessmen,'' Mr. Peterson says of the boys of Shaw. ''Just got a terrible product.'' What they don't have, he adds, is the sort of hero that luckier American boys have: the father who comes home after work, has dinner with them and asks what they've been up to.
Mr. Wilkins, who teaches history at George Mason University in Virginia and is associated with the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, faults Washington for diverting war-on-poverty money to Vietnam and is particularly tough on the Reagan Administration for ''crippling'' training and job programs. Taken together with the coming of crack in the mid-1980's, he says, Administration indifference has proved devastating.
More conservative voices have blamed the wrong sort of Government assistance in pre-Reagan years for some inner-city ills. All parties might agree with Mr. Wilkins's message: ''The crisis of black poor men is now the central destructive fact of community life.''
''Throwaway People'' also goes into prisons, where so many of Shaw's youths wind up. (''The black man,'' says an inmate, ''is on the 10 most endangered species list.'') And it goes into nurseries, where babies, some born crack-addicted, are beginning a life of misery. Mr. Wilkins reports there are only three such nurseries in Washington, helping 30 children, about 2 percent of those in need.
The facts are not new, but they cannot be reported too often, and this hour does it in a quietly forceful way. It ends by noting yet a further assault on what remains of a community in Shaw: gentrification. Mr. Peterson predicts, ''And when enough people come in here who don't look like the people who are here now, you'll see the schools improve, you'll see public safety improve, the garbage will get picked up, the streets will get swept.'' The losers, presumably, will be swept into another neighborhood, perhaps a little further from the White House.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
U.S. Notes And Bonds Off Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday on what dealers described as profit taking in the wake of the strong rally that followed last week's Treasury refunding auctions.
Concern about losses in foreign bond markets also prompted selling in the United States, dealers said.
Bond prices bore the brunt of the selling here and prices of some long-term issues fell in moderately active trading by more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
 
Talk About Drexel
Word that Drexel Burnham Lambert is seeking a major investor or a merger partner firmed prices early in the session. Investors apparently sought a safe haven in high-quality Treasury issues, fleeing from the high-yield, high-risk ''junk bond'' market, which Drexel pioneered. But as the day progressed, the urge to take profits, dealers said, outweighed the safe-haven inclination. 
In the already skittish junk-bond market, investors reacted negatively to the news about Drexel. Traders said that prices of most issues declined by one to two points.
Yesterday's selloff was preceded by a fairly successfuly series of Treasury auctions in which the Government sold $30 billion of notes and bonds. Yields on those securities were high enough to attract wide institutional and individual interest in the securities. That prompted a rally in prices that, by the end of last week, had pushed yields on some securities down by as much as 30 basis points, or hundredths of a point, below the levels at which they were auctioned.
''Everybody has big profits in the refunding issues, and foreign markets are collapsing, so people are selling,'' one Government bond trader said.
 
Acute in West Germany
The selloff in foreign bond markets was particularly acute in West Germany, where the movement to integrate the two Germanys has intensified fears that a sharp increase in inflation will be an inevitable byproduct of reunification. Rising inflation erodes the real rate of return on fixed income investments like bonds.
West German bonds, which were battered all last week, came under heavy selling pressure again yesterday, and yields on the Government's 7 1/4 percent 10-year bonds of 1999 rose by 20 basis points, to 8.48 percent, said analysts at Salomon Brothers. Yesterday's increase put the yield on 10-year German bonds above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, now at 8.37 percent, for the first time in more than a decade.
''Developments abroad were unfriendly for the Treasury market,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''But the rally last week was overdone, and the market was vulnerable.''
By late in the day, the 8.50 percent bonds of 2020 that were auctioned last Thursday were offered at a price of 100 26/32, down more than a point, to yield 8.42 percent, compared with 8.33 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8.50 percent 10-year notes auctioned last Wednesday were offered at 100 26/32, down 19/32, to yield 8.37 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 23/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.28 percent.
The selloff had little impact on the short-term Treasury bill market, where rates on new three-month and six-month bills auctioned yesterday were well below those sold at the auction a week ago because of last week's rally.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.65 percent, down from an average rate of 7.83 percent last Monday.
Meanwhile, six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.65 percent, compared with an average rate of 7.72 percent a week earlier.
 
Easing Considered Unlikely
Word of Drexel's financial problems led some traders to speculate that the Federal Reserve Board might be forced to ease interest rates to help the firm and its creditors. But most economists said such a step was unlikely.
''The chances of a Fed easing due to Drexel are almost nonexistent,'' said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''That's why the Fed has a discount window. When a corporation gets into financial trouble, it can seek relief by borrowing at the discount window rather than expect to see a general decline in interest rates.''
The discount window is where troubled institutions can borrow from the Fedeal Reserve at a discounted rate, which is currently 7 percent.
Many of the concerns expressed about Drexel in the high-yield market yesterday centered around how the firm's portfolio of bonds would be disbursed if Drexel were bought by another company. A rapid liquidation would only put more pressure on prices, some traders said.
 
Drexel Role Questioned
But other analysts said that Drexel's portfolio, as well as its role as a source of liquidity in the secondary market in high-yield issues, was not that great. They said the real question was how mutual funds and others that buy high-yield securities would react if Drexel ceased to exist as an independent entity.
''Drexel used to advertise that, on a day-to-day basis, they had $2 billion worth of junk bonds in inventory,'' said Kingman Penniman, a senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, securities firm. ''I am sure that it is somewhat less than that now, with most of it in old, generally illiquid Drexel deals. They weren't that active in the secondary market. It wasn't their role. They were the provider of issues to the market.''
Mr. Penniman said that most professional investors, sensing that Drexel's problems might cause a further slide in prices, had moved to the sidelines.
 
Philip Morris Issue
Elsewhere, the corporate bond market was highlighted by a $350 million offering of 10-year notes by the Philip Morris Companies. The 9.25 percent notes, which mature Feb. 15, 2000, were priced at $99.465 to yield 9.333, 95 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on the 8.50 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said prices of most actively traded issues fell by about one-half a point.
Municipal bond traders said that prices of most secondary tax-exempt issues fell by about half a point in fairly light trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Medical Insurance And Job Mobility

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
AMONG the many horror stories from people who have difficulty obtaining health insurance, that of Paul Tobias is a striking example. Mr. Tobias, an internationally known cellist who has appeared as a guest soloist with the New York Philharmonic, said several major insurers had rejected him and his wife, Elizabeth Moschetti, a concert pianist. One insurer gave as the reason that ''there were too many AIDS cases in the arts community,'' he said. Eventually the couple went to the Empire Blue Cross plan, where they pay $1,520 every 90 days for comprehensive coverage.
Looking beyond the personal problems of people with costly or minimal coverage and the 31 million Americans with no coverage, many economists and industry critics say the inadequacies in the system raise broad national issues. The growing number of exclusions and restrictions on eligibility for health insurance, these people say, may even affect flexibility and mobility in the work force. 
A worker whose child is asthmatic, for example, or a high-pressure executive with ulcers has to think seriously about health coverage when considering a change to a new employer. Insurers typically reject people with family health problems working for small businesses or offer them rates they cannot afford. Even large employers, who are often self-insured, may delay coverage for 6 to 12 months, during which they do not pay for treatment of a chronic condition.
Such problems can be significant, said Stephen Crane, a health policy analyst at the Boston University School of Public Health. ''People don't realize that there are gaps in coverage when they change jobs, particularly in going from a larger employer to a smaller one.'' Dr. Crane said one highly paid executive was in the process of switching jobs when he learned that his treatment for a gastric ulcer would not be covered for at least a year. ''He ended up continuing his coverage under his old employer's plan, which would not be financially possible for a lot of people.''
''We don't know how many people are in this never-never land,'' Dr. Crane said. As people grow older, he added, fear of losing benefits ''could act as a significant barrier to job mobility.''
Changing jobs ''used to be a free float,'' said Stuart H. Altman, an economist at Brandeis University and chairman of the Government commission that advises Congress on Medicare payments to hospitals. ''You were never asked a health question. But now it's a giant moat around our employment. People think it's the poor's problem. But some insurers go into an individual small firm and single out people'' who are refused health insurance because they are considered poor risks.
For instance, Lawrence C. Mitchell, president of Mitco Industries, a small manufacturer in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., said the company went without insurance for three years after its monthly health premiums were raised to more than $6,000 from $4,000. He said his 14 employees are ''baby boomers in their mid-40's, basically in good health,'' but they include ''a borderline diabetic,'' an employee with an enlarged heart and another employee whose wife had a relatively minor ulcer condition.
''It's a terrible situation,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''It's almost forcing me to say I'm going back to a one-man shop and not hire employees.'' He said Mitco recently joined a Blue Cross plan and pays $4,200 a month.
Blue Cross of California is wooing small businesses, hoping to head off political pressure for a new state-imposed system. Both Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, and the Democratic majority in the Legislature want to expand health insurance protection. Blue Cross of California recently announced coverage for small businesses, even those with expensive health problems, that would hold the rates to within 30 percent of what Blue Cross charges other small companies in the same area.
The Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group in Washington, is also wrestling with the problem. The group recently sent recommendations to the bipartisan health-care commission headed by Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, who plans to report next month to Congress and President Bush.
Under the industry proposals, businesses with fewer than 25 employees could not be denied coverage even if a member of the group was considered ''uninsurable or a high risk.'' Once insured, ''neither the group nor an individual in the group'' could be denied coverage for health reasons, even if an individual moved to a different employer. High-risk people would be covered through an industry reinsurance fund.
The association said its program should be put in place in the 50 states, rather than by Congress. Insurance lobbyists in many states have often succeeded in fending off regulation.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 29.06 on Slowest Day of Year

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
A late spurt of selling depressed stocks across a broad front yesterday in the slowest trading of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged by 29.06 points, or by 1.1 percent, to 2,619.14.
The Dow's drop came after three successive gains that amounted to nearly 42 points. Many traders attributed yesterday's activity to the Lincoln's Birthday holiday. 
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advancing ones by more than 2 to 1 yesterday, as 1,042 fell in price and 479 rose.
 
Volume at 118.4 Million
At the same time, volume on the Big Bost rates peak out.''shares, far below this year's previous low turnover of 131 million on Feb. 5. That was the slowest day since since Dec. 26, when 77.6 million shares changed hands. On Friday, 146.9 million shares changed hands.
The traders said concern about higher interest rates, some profit taking and sharply lower bond prices combined to depress equities. By late yesterday, the new 30-year Treasury issue was down by a point, to 100 26/ 32, to yield 8.42 percent, up from 8.33 on Friday.
''Stock market worries are both internal and external and may not be sorted out for awhile,'' said Rao Chalasani, the chief investment strategist at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in Cleveland. ''Earnings disappointments are internal, and interest-rate increases are external. Sideline cash is aplenty but may not be drawn in unless German and Japanese interest rates peak out.''
In the broader stock market yesterday, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped by 3.54 points, to 330.08, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined by 1.84 points, to 182.55.
Panhandle Eastern was the most active stock, slipping by 1/8, to 28 3/8, on a volume of 2.1 million shares. The stock went ex-dividend yesterday. Southwestern Public Service was another busily traded utility, dipping by 1/8, to 29 1/8, on a turnover of 1.5 million shares.
 
Time Warner Off to $101.50
Time Warner fell by 3 1/4, to 101 1/2. The New York-based company said it had lost $222 million in the fourth quarter because of costs from its acquisition of Warner Communications Inc. But analysts said that the earnings were in line with expectations and that the drop in the shares probably reflected the general anxiety about highly leveraged companies.
ASA, a fund that invests in South African stocks, dropped by 4 1/2, to 64 3/8, after Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, said he supported nationalizing private industry.
But gold stocks rose, reflecting the prospect that disarray in South Africa would limit the production of gold and drive up its price. Homestake Mining rose by 1/2, to 23; Newmont Gold by 7/8, to 56 1/8, and Hecla Mining by 5/8 to 15 5/8.
Hilton jumped by 2 7/8, to 64 5/8. NWA Inc. declined to comment on a report that its chairman, Alfred Checchi, was part of group seeking to raise refinancing for a bid for Hilton.
The traders said insurance stocks dropped, with General Re slipping by 1/2, to 85 1/4, and Chubb declining by 5/8, to 93 3/4. In over-the-counter trading, Ohio Casualty plunged by 3 1/2, to 39 1/2, and Safeco fell by 1 3/8, to 38.
Active blue-chip issues included Citicorp, up by 3/8, to 23 3/8, and General Electric, off by 1, to 62 1/4.
Berkshire Hathaway, the highest-priced issue on the Big Board, fell by 730 to 7,220. An article in Barron's magazine contended that the stock was overvalued based on the investments the company holds.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index dropped by 1.92 points, to 358.87, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index fell by 2.46 points, to 426.38.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Gains As the Mark Remains Off

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly higher yesterday against most major currencies in quiet trading.
Currency dealers said the dollar continued to gain ground at the expense of the West German mark. The market remains concerned that a proposal to reunify the monetary systems of the two German states could hurt West Germany's economy.
Against the mark, the dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6755 marks, up from 1.6680 late Friday.
The markets, however, were slowed by the closing of Tokyo trading houses for a holiday, dealers said.
In London, the dollar fetched 144.20 yen, compared with 144.72 Friday. Later, in New York, the dollar stood at 144.37 yen, down from 144.725 yen Friday.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling cost $1.6960, up from $1.6930 late Friday, and $1.6918 in New York, down from $1.6955.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday quotes, included: 1.5005 Swiss francs, up from 1.4915; 5.6965 French francs, up from 5.6720; 1,246.00 Italian lire, up from 1,241.25, and 1.20065 Canadian dollars, up from 1.20025.
Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.6695 West German marks, down from 1.6750; 1.4960 Swiss francs, up from 1.4935; 5.6785 French francs, up from 5.6765; 1.8890 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8835; 1,242.00 Italian lire, down from 1,242.25; and 1.2023 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1987.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The Strategy For Benson & Hedges

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
DISPUTING the accuracy of recent reports in the advertising trade press, a top Philip Morris marketing executive says the company is not repositioning Benson & Hedges cigarettes as a brand for blue-collar smokers. Instead, the nation's largest tobacco company will try to maintain its edge with the current customers who like the cigarettes' image of style and affluence.
In a wide-ranging interview that also touched on Philip Morris's ad agencies and the drive to ban the tobacco advertising that nourishes them, David E. R. Dangoor, the senior vice president of marketing at Philip Morris U.S.A., denied reports that in one article's words said his company would ''dump upscale advertising in favor of a new marketing campaign directed at less affluent smokers.'' That article and others cited interviews with unnamed sources. 
''In this market, to maintain Benson & Hedges's position is the task,'' Mr. Dangoor said over a recent breakfast in New York. ''The loyalty level of current smokers is very high, so the main objective is to maintain that base and reinforce the brand's position for quality against the low-price brands.''
Benson & Hedges spends about $60 million annually on advertising, slightly less than a quarter of Philip Morris's total budget for cigarette advertising. But ad industry interest in the brand also relates to its history at Wells, Rich, Greene, the agency that introduced it 20 years ago with a witty television campaign that focused on the social problems created by longer cigarettes.
The agency has gone through several battles to keep the business in the face of Benson & Hedges's declining market share. Analysts estimate that the share last year was 3.7 percent, down a full percentage point from 1985. Wells, whose current ''For people who like to smoke'' campaign features chic urbanites in slice-of-life photographs, early this month survived another review for the account, which unleashed the latest rumors.
A 14-year veteran of Philip Morris, Mr. Dangoor, who is 40 years old, maintained that ''we are fundamentally happy with the agencies we've got,'' which include Leo Burnett and Backer Spielvogel Bates, in addition to Wells. But the Swedish native -who, with his narrow-collar shirt, European-tailored suit and swept-back, thinning hair looked like one of the Benson & Hedges ads' stylish characters - also declared, ''We are looking for the new makers in the advertising world,'' and cited TBWA and Omon among them.
''Leo Burnett is a terrific company,'' Mr. Dangoor said. ''Wells, Rich and Backer & Spielvogel are fine as well. But we want to find the great ad minds of the 90's. If you look at what made Philip Morris as a cigarette company, we always found small agencies. Leo Burnett was a small agency in the 50's, when we found them with Marlboro. The old man, Leo, spent 80 percent of his time on the brand.''
''In the case of a small agency like Omon, they could be the agency of record if we built a brand together, like we did with these others. We haven't found anything yet, but I'll give them a chance.''
The Philip Morris Companies has been aggressive in battling the mounting legislative efforts to restrict or ban tobacco advertising. Mr. Dangoor maintained that a ban was economically unsound, because it would eliminate the incentive to develop products.
''Advertising allows for innovation,'' he said. ''Let's hypothesize that there is a smoking device that in the future can replace cigarettes. As long as advertising is allowed and it seems profitable for companies to invest in research and development, such a device can come up. But if there is an advertising ban and your new product development can't give you advantages because you can't advertise them, I'm not sure a company would come up with that idea.''
Another threat to his company's cigarettes, Mr. Dangoor implied, was the magazines in which they are advertised. ''If you have a company as image-driven as we are, the clutter of print is a tremendous problem,'' he said. He particularly criticized women's service magazines, calling them ''a nightmare'' and asserting that magazine ad clutter was one reason Philip Morris in recent years had channeled most of the increases in its cigarette marketing budgets to direct marketing and sales promotion and, to a lesser degree, to outdoor advertising.
In magazines, ''there is a level of advertising saturation and oversaturation,'' he said. ''Outdoor, there's nobody near you.''

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
At The 'Junk Bond' Banquet, The Host Is Suddenly Absent

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. signals the end of an era in which speculative debt became Wall Street's stock in trade and America's corporate establishment was transformed by financiers buying companies for billions of dollars in i.o.u.'s.
The rapid disintegration of the firm, whose troubles were deemed serious but not life-threatening only a few days ago, also demonstrates just how quickly confidence can vaporize on Wall Street.
Drexel, once a minor player on Wall Street, became a titan by pioneering the sale of ''junk bonds'': corporate obligations of companies with low credit standing. Michael R. Milken, an evangelist for junk bonds who became America's highest-paid executive - in 1987 he took home more than half a billion dollars from Drexel - succeeded in persuading investors that the extra-high interest rates on such bonds more than offset the risk that they would not be paid.
By making huge borrowings possible, secured by no more than rosy forecasts of future profits, Drexel helped transform the mentality of corporate America. Corporate insurgents, armed with the pools of money that Drexel raised, went on the offensive, until no company felt safe from a takeover financed by borrowed money. Captains of industry rushed to borrow money and put it in shareholders' pockets, fearful that if they failed to do so, some raider might do it for them. 
''Its collapse is much less significant than its career,'' commented James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a financial magazine that has long been critical of Drexel. ''It did far more damage to the system by operating than it will by shutting down. The damage was the creation of debt that stood no chance of survival in anything except the balmiest summer economic weather.''
Before Mr. Milken, who is under indictment on charges of securities-law violations, the only junk bonds in existence were ''fallen angels,'' Wall Street's endearing term for bonds issued by companies that seemed solid when the loans were made, but later ran into hard times.
Drexel changed all that. It developed a close-knit pool of buyers eager for the ''high-risk, high-yield'' offerings. Many of those buyers were themselves substantial issuers of junk bonds.
A result was a wholesale relaxing of credit standards, fostering many corporate takeovers that would have been unthinkable a few years earlier. Now many of those bonds are shaky, as the companies struggle to come up with the cash to meet their obligations. The fate of those companies may be Drexel's most enduring legacy.
To be sure, some companies owe their existence to Drexel. Without junk bond financing, they might never have expanded or succeeded in becoming major forces in their industries. Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the cable television programmer, is notable among them. But many others, like Integrated Resources Inc., a financial services company, failed. It filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. And Merv Griffin's Drexel-financed purchase of Resorts International Inc., the casino operator, took less than a year to wind up in bankruptcy court.
Some of the worst deals - at least in terms of how rapidly they collapsed - were underwritten not by Drexel but by competitors who lusted after the large profit margins that made Drexel the most profitable firm on Wall Street. The Campeau Corporation used financing underwritten by First Boston to build a department store empire that has filed for Chapter 11.
Now, such financing is difficult to obtain, at best. RJR Nabisco Inc., which was taken over in the largest leveraged buyout ever, last week was forced to delay a planned financing. The company is doing relatively well, but few investors want to lend to a firm so laden with debt. To meet its obligations, it may have to sell more of its operations than it had planned, assuming buyers can be found.
Yesterday, the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., the broker's parent firm, failed to meet its obligations and late last night filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. The brokerage firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was not expected to file, but the distinction was of little practical importance.
''For all intents and purposes, they are out of business,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage industry analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''Nobody will transact with them right now.'' The fear is that when it comes time for cash and securities to be exchanged, normally a week after a deal is made, Drexel might not be able to complete the trade.
It was the refusal of banks to lend to Drexel that sealed the fate of the parent this week. ''A brokerage firm is a highly leveraged financial institution with no lender of last resort,'' said an official of a Drexel competitor. ''When it comes apart, it comes apart very fast.''
While Drexel may be about to fade from the scene, the securities it sold will not. The junk bond market has been shaken by fears that Drexel will be forced to sell its bond holdings, but in the longer run the value of junk bonds will be determined by just how profitable their issuing companies are.
''At some point, these bonds trade on their own,'' Peter Lynch, the manager of the Fidelity Magellan mutual fund, said yesterday. Mr. Lynch, one of the most successful fund managers, said he had been buying some junk bonds, among them issues from the Fort Howard Corporation, a paper company, and the Kroger Company, a grocery chain.
For companies wishing to borrow money in the future, it is not clear how much tighter the credit standards will be. Throughout the 1980's, companies were able to borrow ever greater amounts against future income. When it was clear that the company could not sustain the debt load, as was often the case, arrangements were made in which no cash needed to be paid as interest for five years or more. By then, the theory went, operations would have improved or the company would have sold off assets.
When the smoke clears, it is likely that some lesser-quality companies will be able to borrow less than they could have otherwise. But others will no longer have access to the public debt market. ''Companies will go back to being financed privately or through their banks,'' said Gail Silberman, a bond analyst at Jefferies & Company.
Companies that have borrowed money are likely to have to struggle with new rules. The expectation that debt can be refinanced easily has already vanished. Many companies will have to reorganize, giving stock to borrowers to gain relief from onerous interest payments. Others may have to cancel plans for capital investment, or for spending on research and development, to obtain the cash needed to pay interest.

HEADLINE: THE COLLAPSE OF DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT;
Drexel, Symbol of Wall St. Era, Is Dismantling; Bankruptcy Filed

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the once-dominant investment house that fueled many of the biggest corporate takeovers of the 1980's, began selling off its securities yesterday, and its parent company filed for bankruptcy protection. The moves marked the demise of a firm that seemed to symbolize the fast-money era on Wall Street.
Drexel's securities business effectively collapsed yesterday after the parent company defaulted on $100 million in loans and other Wall Street firms sharply curbed their dealings with the investment house.
The parent, the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code late last night, a few hours after the company's board had approved the filing.
 
Subsidiaries Not Included
The parent's filing does not include the investment firm or a subsidiary that deals in securities issued by the United States Treasury. But unlike companies in other industries that file for bankruptcy, Drexel is not expected to re-emerge as a going concern, the firm's executives and lawyers said. More than most businesses, the survival of a securities firm, they explained, depends on the confidence of investors and other dealers; without that confidence, the business unravels quickly. 
''After it's all over, Drexel will be left with cash, and a lot of laid-off employees,'' one executive at the firm said.
Accordingly, the investment house that pioneered the use of high-yield ''junk bonds'' to finance high-risk ventures yesterday started the tortuous process of closing down. Executives from a number of Wall Street firms visited Drexel, examining the securities holdings of Drexel for possible purchases.
 
Gathering Resumes
And many of the firm's 5,000 employees began to get their resumes together. ''Everybody's looking to go out of this place in a professional manner,'' one executive said.
Because Drexel employs thousands of people in New York, the news of the firm's collapse stirred concern among public officials in the region.
The demise of Drexel represents ''a sad day for New Yorkers and a sad day for the American financial system,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat. ''It represents a significant blow to New York City's economy and marks the end of an era in American finance.''
The rapid collapse of the firm, which on Monday announced that it was seeking a merger partner because of a cash crunch, created fears among some Wall Street executives about the possible ripple effect on other firms. They said that with Drexel liquidating its huge junk bond portfolio, the value of other firms' holdings in the securities could well collapse.
''If forced sales take place, there may be a capital erosion problem starting,'' one Wall Street executive said. ''Drexel could end up taking some companies with it.''
Wall Street was stunned by the rapid decline of Drexel, but some executives said it was simply the way of the finance world. ''This is the nature of the financial services business,'' said Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Primerica Holdings and former president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ''You go into a steady decline, and then you fall off a cliff.''
The stock market shrugged off the news on Drexel, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 4.96 points, to close at 2,624.10.
 
Pioneer in Junk Bonds
Yesterday's developments underline the stunning turnaround at Drexel, which was one of Wall Street's most powerful firms until last year, when it settled criminal and civil charges of securities law violations.
Drexel rose from being a Wall Street also-ran in the late 1970's to become one of the nation's most profitable investment banks in the late 1980's as a creator of the modern junk bond market. Under the guidance of Michael R. Milken, former head of its junk bond division, Drexel became a primary player in the takeover battles that swept corporate America during the last decade. With Drexel's bonds, smaller companies that never before could have obtained financing were able to make bids for some of America's largest corporations.
But things started to come unstuck for Drexel in 1986, when the firm was caught up in the scandals that swept Wall Street after the fall of Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager. Mr. Boesky paid $100 million to settle charges of insider trading and agreed to testify against Drexel and Mr. Milken.
 
Milken Indictment
Last year, Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts, agreeing to pay $650 million. Mr. Milken was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud and other charges, and has left the firm.
The rapid collapse of Drexel was precipitated by financial dealings between the firm and its corporate parent. Drexel said the parent had assets of more than $3.6 billion and liabilities of more than $3 billion. Federal bankruptcy law permits a company to enter Chapter 11 if the assets exceed the liabilities when there is a prospect of insolvency.
The parent company - which had sizable holdings of junk bonds and other securities that had declined sharply in value and could not be easily sold - last week began to siphon some of the $500 million in capital that the investment bank held in excess of the amount Federal law required.
That move quickly attracted the attention of the Federal Reserve, which alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, which monitor the activities of investment firms. The exchange was already conducting an audit of Drexel's holdings to insure that they were being accounted for and handled properly by the firm.
On Friday, Drexel executives held meetings with the Government agencies and the exchange, at which they were directed to stop moving cash from the investment bank to the parent company.
 
Marathon Meetings
Then, during a marathon series of meetings over the weekend, Drexel struggled to find a merger partner. At the same time, a number of banks, led by Citibank, attempted to put together a loan to bolster Drexel's deteriorating financial position.
Those efforts collapsed yesterday, and the firm announced that it was in default.
As the problems at Drexel continued to unfold, the S.E.C. and the Big Board had teams of auditors at 60 Broad Street, Drexel's headquarters, going over the firm's books.
In a statement yesterday, Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., who has been a main coordinator in the effort to find a solution to the problems at Drexel, said in a statement that the commission and the Big Board were closely monitoring Drexel's financial position and that the firm was meeting the Federal requirements for capital.
Speaking early yesterday on Drexel's in-house communications system, Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive of Drexel and the president of the holding company, told employees to begin liquidating many of the securities held by the firm in an orderly manner.
 
A Speedy Dismantling
The speed of Drexel's dismantling was surprising. A number of other Wall Street firms, like Salomon Brothers, First Boston and Bear, Stearns, were examining Drexel's holdings to see if they might purchase the securities.
But before any proposals were made for the purchases, Drexel had sold off billions of dollars' worth of Government and corporate bonds, stocks and other securities. The firm also sold tens of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds from its portfolio of about $1 billion. Irritation at S.E.C. Government regulators were somewhat taken aback in recent days by the speed of Drexel's worsening financial troubles. Indeed, S.E.C. officials expressed irritation that they had not been more closely informed. ''The financing squeeze on Drexel didn't materialize over a weekend,'' one person said of the surprise by the regulators at the events. ''Nobody likes catching grenades, and none of them want to preside over the largest bankruptcy in Wall Street history.''
Some Drexel staff members also criticized the top management for not informing employees of the firm's eroding financial position. But Drexel directors insisted that the management had made the best of a difficult situation.
 
'Heroic Battle' by Joseph
''Truthfully, this has been a heroic battle by Fred Joseph,'' said Roderick M. Hills, a former S.E.C. commissioner who was appointed to Drexel's board after its settlement last year.
Drexel's day began with efforts by the firm's dealers to trade securities normally. But within a matter of minutes at about 10 A.M., executives were told by the S.E.C. and Mr. Joseph to halt their trading, pending an announcement by the firm.
Employees then waited for about 45 minutes to hear the news. Soon, the traders saw it running across the tape: Drexel had defaulted on $100 million worth of loans and was holding a board meeting to consider whether to file for bankruptcy.
In seconds, Mr. Joseph was on the in-house communications system, along with Steven Anreder, a spokesman for the firm, and one of the parent company's bankruptcy lawyers.
In his statement on the communications system, Mr. Joseph said that a large investor for the firm had not materialized and that the parent company appeared to be insolvent. He also said that the firm was continuing to discuss selling all or part of the firm to third parties. Mr. Joseph added that customer accounts would be transferred to Smith, Barney.
 
'An Unhappy Event'
For employees, Mr. Joseph said, the announcement was ''an unhappy event.'' But he added that all employees would receive their paychecksand that the checks would clear the bank.
At that point, to the consternation of some employees, a bankruptcy lawyer began to discuss with the employees what the meanings of a filing for the parent would be. ''Most employees don't have anything to do with that group and are mad because they think that's what brought the entire firm down,'' one executive said.
Executive job-placement firms reported a flood of calls from Drexel staff members yesterday worried about their future. ''We're getting 10 to 20 phone calls an hour from Drexel people,'' said Gary Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm.
Drexel was also besieged by calls throughout the day from worried suppliers, executives of the firm said. Indeed, they say, the car service that some executives use to go home refused to accept the firm's business, fearing it would not get paid.
 
Holdings Are Diverse
After the discussion on the in-house communications system, Mr. Joseph said employees could begin to trade again and attempt to liquidate as much of the firm's holdings as possible.
Besides the $1 billion in junk bonds, the firm's holdings are diverse. More than one-fifth of those holdings were said by executives at the firm to be liquid, or easily convertible into cash.
For the rest of the day, Drexel began to move out of one business after another. By noon, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the over-the-counter market, said Drexel had voluntarily ceased making markets in 229 Nasdaq issues for which it was the market maker. Most Nasdaq issues have multiple market makers, and so would not have to be transferred to another firm.
Late in the day, rumors spread that Drexel was losing its designation as a primary dealer in Government securities. However, the Federal Reserve issued a statement saying the firm retained that status.

HEADLINE: Bush May Revive Plan for Warships Off Colombia

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
At his meeting in Colombia on Thursday, President Bush is likely to try to revive a United States proposal to deploy Navy warships off South America to monitor drug-trafficking flights, senior Administration officials said today.
But the officials said the Administration recognized that any effort to increase the role of the United States military in cocaine interdiction in South America was ''a big problem'' in the current climate between Washington and Latin America and was therefore not at the center of Mr. Bush's plans for the meeting in Cartagena, Colombia.
The meeting is not likely to produce any formal agreement on the use of American warships or any other expanded role for the United States military, the officials said. Disclosure of Pentagon plans to deploy an aircraft carrier off Colombia provoked a storm of protest there last month and forced Washington to delay the program. 
In another potential point of dispute at the four-nation meeting, the Administration made it clear today that Mr. Bush will not offer to increase United States economic aid to the Andean cocaine-producing nations beyond the $2.2 billion, five-year program that it has already proposed to Congress. The program focuses instead on drug interdiction and crop eradication.
Two days before Mr. Bush travels to Cartagena for the meeting with the Presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, the White House conducted an intense round of public relations to smooth the talks.
Mr. Bush signed a United Nations convention on drug trafficking and the White House made public a national study showing a continued drop in illegal drug use among high school students. Officials said Mr. Bush would use the survey in Cartagena as evidence that his Administration is working to cut demand for illegal drugs.
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's press secretary, also announced that the Pentagon had cut the number of troops in Panama to fewer than were in the country on Dec. 20, when the President ordered an invasion to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Mr. Fitzwater said 13,504 United States soldiers were now in Panama compared with 13,597 on Dec. 20. He said that met Mr. Bush's commitment to withdraw the entire invasion force before the end of February.
The announcement seemed largely a symbolic gesture to ease the irritation that the invasion brought in relations between Washington and Latin American governments.
The United States has not withdrawn all of the invasion force but simply lowered the overall number of troops in Panama by removing most of the combat soldiers and by rotating home some soldiers who were stationed in the country before the invasion.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said today that the Cartagena conference was expected to produce a broad framework for cooperative anti-drug efforts.
He said the four Presidents would issue a statement including the current United States proposals for economic aid and promises to reduce exports of automatic weapons, cut exports of chemicals for making cocaine and increase efforts to stop money laundering.
Mr. Scowcroft said the idea of using American Navy ships to monitor flights by drug traffickers, which he said was intended to help the South American governments place land-based radar installations, was shelved after the Colombian protest last month.
A senior official said the military's role in anti-drug efforts is ''not at the forefront of our proposals.''
''The question is likely to come up because it was such a brouhaha,'' he said. ''But we realize that the flap over it has created such a problem that it's tough for people to deal with, and we're prepared to leave it on the shelf.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Party's Agenda: Liberty and Justice

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Soviet Communist Party adopted a platform last week endorsing the abolition of the party's constitutional monopoly on political power and other changes. The text of the platform was distributed on Monday night by the official press agency Tass. Here are excerpts from the platform, as translated by Tass.
The party seeks to place man in the center of social development, providing him with worthy living and working conditions, guaranteeing him social justice, political liberty and possibilities for comprehensive development and spiritual fulfillment, and regards this as its main goal. This is exactly what should determine social progress. 
The Soviet Communist Party stands for the earliest formulation of legal acts guaranteeing the rights and freedoms of citizens. The recognition of personal liberty as the key and vital value and a volte-face to guarantee the entire complex of human rights is perestroika's most important accomplishment. Now it is necessary to consolidate these rights, to rest them on a solid material, legal and political foundation. The party will uphold: Reliable legislative protection of a citizen's personality and honor, the immunity of his home and property, the secrecy of correspondence and telephone conversations, Stronger guarantees to realize the right to work, including payment according to the quantity and quality of work done and its final results. The formation of a mechanism to maintain employment, training and re-training of personnel and adequate material support for those who are forced to change their trade, profession or place of work, The development and strengthening of the political rights of citizens: participation in running the affairs of society and the state, freedom of speech, the press, meetings and demonstrations and the formation of public organizations. Law and order and requirements of Soviet laws should be strictly observed, Freedom for creative activities and attitude to talent as a national asset.
 
The Role of Law
Man's free self-determination in the spiritual sphere, the freedom of conscience and religion. Without abandoning its world outlook, the party will step up the dialogue between atheists and believers and pursue a policy that offers all churches the opportunity to freely operate within the law, contributing to mutual understanding between people, A higher role of the court of law in protecting civil rights, the establishment of public-state commissions exercising law-enforcing activities, The C.P.S.U. prioritizes the adoption of laws in the near future on the press and other mass media, freedom of conscience and religious associations, public associations, the order of emigration from and immigration to the U.S.S.R., Soviet citizenship, languages of Soviet peoples and other legislative acts that will guarantee the political and personal rights of citizens. ...
Every means envisaged by law should be used to combat crime, while the presumption of innocence and the right to protection and juridical norms should be strictly observed. ...
The solution of the food problem should rest on the development of all forms of economic management in agriculture. State-run, cooperative and individual farms and diverse forms of management, based on contract, leasing and other principles, should be given equal possibilities. ...
We continue to focus on efforts to increase the production of consumer goods. The C.P.S.U. will help implement measures to help satiate the market.
 
Property and Economy
The party advocates an effective finance recovery program, including such measures as the encouragement of deposits in savings banks at increased interest rates, the development of the insurance business, the distribution of state loan bonds on advantageous terms, the selling of dwellings, advance payments by the population for durable goods they plan to buy in the future and the selling of stocks and other securities.
More flexible economic instruments and quotas will be needed to prevent unfounded incomes and the issue of money in excess of the supply of goods. ...
The C.P.S.U. believes the existence of individual property, including ownership of the means of production, does not contradict the modern stage in the country's economic development. . . .
One of the most difficult aspects of the economic reform is finding an organic combination of plan and market methods to regulate economic activity.
Modern production is impossible without a centralized planned management. This essentially socialist principle of economic management has been adopted by many countries.
However, it is crucially important to determine the precise degree and methods of such management. Unlike in the past, when the plan attempted to encompass the entire process of production and distribution, there is now a need for a procedure in which planned, centralized economic management will be exercised through prices, taxes, interest rates, credits, payments etc. ...
The creation of a full-fledged market economy requires the formation of markets of consumer products, capital goods, securities, investment, currencies and research and development, and an early reform of the financial, monetary and credit systems.
 
The Environment
The restructuring of price formation is a sine qua non condition for the market to start regulating the economy. The artificial price levels and proportions, the burden of ineffective subsidies for some and ruinous deductions from others provide false reference points for economic management. They confound the assessment of management's effect, perpetuate scientific and technological backwardness and prevent the efficient utilization of the advantages of the international division of labor.
Competition between product manufacturers, including foreign firms, must become an important factor regulating and restraining the growth of prices. ...
The protection of nature is the protection of man. Toward the close of the 20th century, environmental protection has become a categoric imperative for preserving life on the earth. We must introduce world standards in this country and take an active part in international ecological cooperation.
The rapid industrial growth of the U.S.S.R., coupled with an attitude of neglect toward conservation measures, has led to grave pockets of ecological disaster. Urgent measures and large investments are required to rectify the situation. ...
The party's policy proceeds from the recognition of the sovereign will of the people as the only source of power. The rule-of-law state of the whole people has no room for dictatorship by any class, and even less so for the power of a management bureaucracy. . . .
The electoral system should be brought in line with the principles of universal, equal, direct suffrage. We wish elections to become an honest competition between representatives of all the sections of society, of individuals and ideas submitted to the judgment of voters by the party, public organizations and movements and individual candidates.
 
Party and Presidency
The development of society does not preclude the possibility of forming parties. The procedure for their formation will be established by law and reflected in the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
The formation and activity of organizations and movements that expound violence and interethnic strife and that pursue extremist, unconstitutional aims should be prohibited by law.
The Soviet Communist Party does not claim a monopoly and is prepared for a political dialogue and cooperation with everyone who favors the renewal of socialist society. ...
The Soviet Communist Party holds that the separation of legislative, executive and judiciary powers is fundamentally important to the Government's efficiency. In Lenin's words, we should combine the advantages of the Soviet system with the advantages of parliamentarism. ...
The question of instituting the post of head of state - president - responsible to the Congress of U.S.S.R. People's Deputies and having the necessary powers is posed by society ever more insistently.
A president is needed to maintain the country's stable development, to speed up perestroika, to guarantee its irreversibility, to ensure the normal and effective functioning of all state and public institutions in the process of democratization, to ensure law and citizens' security, to protect the Soviet Union's interests and to represent our state on the international arena. ...
A rule-of-law state presupposes effective political guidance of the defense, the accountability of the military department to the supreme civil authorities, and maximum openness in the activity of the military department, taking into account the level of confidence among states. . . .
 
Self-Determination
Internal security. In view of the need to protect state frontiers, counteract foreign intelligence agencies, protect the Soviet constitutional system and the rights of citizens, we should be attentive to the needs of frontier and internal troops, which fulfill complex and at times dangerous duties.
Remaining vital to the maintenance of public order, interior and state security bodies should operate strictly within the law and under control of elective government bodies. ...
The principle of the self-determination of nations in a renewed Soviet federation presupposes the freedom of national-state entities to choose forms by which to structure life, institutions and symbols of statehood. Our ideal is not unification, but unity in diversity.
The party reaffirms its commitment to Lenin's principle of the right of nations to self-determination, including secession, and favors the adoption of a law on a mechanism for the exercise of this right.
At the same time we are convinced that the weakening and disruption of reciprocally diverse and interrelated ties could lead to negative consequences for all peoples, to say nothing about individual destinies, consequences that are very difficult to foresee.
That is why we resolutely oppose separatist slogans and movements that would lead to the destruction of the great multiethnic democratic state. ...
There is a need for rethinking the principle of democratic centralism. It should no longer be treated in such a way that it can be used to implement barrack-room, hierarchical discipline.
There is no other way to overcome Communists' dissatisfaction with their role in the policy and activity of the party. There is no other way to restore in each of them a sense of dignity and inner freedom.

HEADLINE: Survey Shows Use of Drugs By Students Fell Last Year

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The number of high school seniors who say they have used illicit drugs at least once continued a downward trend last year, although there was no decline in reported use of the highly addictive crack, according to a national survey released today.
The federally financed annual survey, by the Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan, questioned 17,000 of the nation's 2.7 million seniors. It found that narcotics use continues to be a grave problem, with 50.9 percent of those questioned in 1989 reporting that they had at least tried an illicit drug like marijuana or cocaine, as against 53.9 percent in 1988 and 56.6 percent in 1987. The 3.1 percent of seniors who said they had used crack in the past year did not mark a shift from the previous year. 
Administration officials, highlighting Federal anti-drug efforts two days before the drug conference in Colombia on Thursday, called a news conference at the White House today to hail the study as evidence that their national drug strategy was succeeding and that narcotics use was becoming unfashionable among young Americans. At the drug conference, Latin American leaders are expected to urge Mr. Bush to intensify efforts to reduce drug demand in the United States.
''It is obvious from these survey findings,'' said Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. ''that young people have made dramatic changes in their own use of most illicit drugs, as well as changes in their attitudes toward drug use by others during the decade of the 1980's.''
Dr. Sullivan and other officials at the conference, including William J. Bennett, the Federal drug policy director, attributed the shift to heightened concerns among students about the ill effects of drug use.
But critics of Administration policy immediately questioned the study, noting that the figures probably understate the problem because they do not include high school dropouts, unemployed workers and other groups among whom the drug problem is pronounced.
The survey did break out figures for respondents who are frequently truant or have poor grades, and they showed that among those seniors the trends were generally the same as for the overall sampling.
The confidential survey of 17,000 students at 135 public and private high schools across the country, is one of the most widely used indicators of drug use in the United States. Although it can never be known how forthright students are in revealing their own drug use in the survey, those authorities who conducted it said they believe the trends over the years have been consistent and supported other surveys.
The institute that conducts the survey does not say the results show the exact percentage of high school seniors in the population as a whole using drugs. Since the figures that the institute provided are only for the group surveyed, they do not involve a margin of error as is the case when a survey group is used to project trends in the overall population.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan who is the chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said that the survey was of ''extremely limited value'' and cited Federal figures showing a high school dropout rate of more than 27 percent. ''The individuals with the greatest drug and crime problems are not even included.'' Mr. Rangel added that the crack figures were not cause for optimism, saying that ''it is definitely not good news that crack use has not dropped.''
 
Crack Use Is Little Changed
The survey showed no significant reductions in crack use, with occasional use of crack among high school seniors surveyed not changing appreciably, falling to 4.7 percent in 1989 from 5.4 percent in 1987 for who reported ever using the drug. Still less change was reported among users who reported using crack in the past 30 days, the group with the most serious addiction problem. Use by people in that group remained virtually unchanged, at 1.4 percent in 1989 as against 1.3 percent in 1987.
Lloyd D. Johnston, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan and the principal investigator for the study, said that the crack problem may be even worse than the survey suggests. ''We know we are not going to capture many heavy crack users in these surveys,'' he said. ''And it is clear from other types of information that there are plenty of heavy users out there.'' But he said that with time there may be a decline in crack use, citing as evidence for that a slight drop in use from 1987 to 1989 among college students and other young adults also questioned as part of the survey.
There were other troubling signs in the survey, notably an increase in the reported use of PCP, a dangerous animal tranquilizer known for its hallucinogenic effects. Reported use of PCP among the seniors questioned rose to 1.4 percent in 1989 from 0.3 percent the year before. Dr. Johnston said he could not explain the increase.
The survey found little change in cigarette smoking rates in the past decade, with 29 percent of the seniors questioned saying that they smoke regularly. Dr. Johnston called the findings about cigarettes ''by far the most disappointing part of the story.''
Federal authorities also said they were concerned about the use of crystal methamphetamine, or ''ice,'' a stimulant that has many of the effects of crack and was included in the survey for the first time last year. About 1.2 percent of the seniors surveyed said they had used the drug in the past year, and use was highest in the west, where 3 percent of the seniors said they had used it.
 
Drugs Easier to Obtain
Despite the overall decline in reported drug use, a considerably higher percentage of seniors said it would be easy for them to get drugs. Forty-seven percent said they could get crack fairly easily in 1989, an increase of 4.9 percentage points from the previous year, while 58.7 percent said they could get cocaine, an increase of 3.7 percentage points.
On the positive side, the use of marijuana in the prior 30 days reported in the survey was down to 17 percent in 1989 from a peak of 37 percent in 1979. Cocaine use in the previous 30 days, which began declining in 1987, fell from 6.2 percent in 1986 to 2.8 percent in 1989. Amphetamine use in the prior 30 days was down to about 4 percent last year, from more than 12 percent in 1980. The reported use of tranquilizers, barbiturates and methaqualone have reached such low levels that they showed little additional decline.
Most of the seniors questioned said they drink alcohol, but the proportions declined. Sixty percent of the seniors said they had consumed alcohol in the previous 30 days, down from a peak of 72 percent in 1980.

HEADLINE: On Arms: Start, and Start Again

 BODY:
The news on Europe continues to astound. Moscow and Washington have now reached agreement on future troop levels in Europe and on a two-stage procedure for German unification. Even as they do so, they're also considering even more far-reaching talks on nuclear and conventional weapons. That sounds premature, but it isn't. 
Exploring further agreements is welcome for many reasons. It will help keep arms talks relevant to the rush of political events, like German unification - and the development of new weapons. It will reassure those who worry about shortcomings in the treaties now nearing completion. And it will reaffirm the need to make arms control a continuing process, not a once-and-for-all answer.
But to establish that process, first things first. The two sides must finish what they have already started: negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe and the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.
Presidents Bush and Gorbachev expect promptly to conclude the first treaties ever that require substantial cuts in superpower forces. They also know that the treaties will leave important questions unresolved.
The proposed Start treaty would cut the superpowers' nuclear arsenals by a third. But it will not slow the pace of modernization. Both sides are developing new, more accurate land-based missiles with multiple warheads that could threaten mutual deterrence. Some officials, notably Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, want to begin limiting these missiles in Start 1. But injecting this issue now would invite Soviet counterproposals and delay conclusion of the present talks. Better to make such missiles the first priority in Start 2.
Defenses, if further developed, could undo an agreement to cut offenses. But force cuts will take place over a number of years. That will leave time for Start 2 to spell out precisely which Star Wars tests should be permitted.
The newly agreed-on U.S. proposal for troop strength in Europe will cut U.S. troops from 305,000 to 225,000, and Soviet troops from 575,000 to 195,000 - leaving the U.S. with an advantage of 30,000. But Eastern European states want all Soviet forces to withdraw from their soil soon. Critics say problems can arise in setting troop ceilings too high.
For example, the new agreement countenances a larger Soviet presence than new East European governments want. That criticism has merit, but Moscow may very well wish to make deeper cuts to satisfy East Europeans or its own economic needs. And neither Mr. Bush nor the NATO allies is eager to negotiate even deeper cuts at this time. A second phase of conventional force talks is the logical place to set lower ceilings.
Only the rarest international agreement covers every contingency. Leaders on both sides must make judgments about priorities. Thus far Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev have, arguably, made the right calls. But as their June summit meeting nears, they will be under pressure to settle even more issues quickly. Their common interest is to resist -and begin talking, soon, about future talks.

HEADLINE: How Japan Can Reduce Its Huge Trade Surplus

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Toshihiko Mori of the Bank of Japan discusses (letter, Feb. 7) an Economic Scene column (Business Day, Jan. 12) that reports me to have placed the blame for the chronic trade deficit of the United States with Japan on both countries. What I said was that the trade balance with Japan cannot be improved by the United States alone. It requires complementary policies by Japan.
Mr. Mori points out that the United States deficit in the balance of payments on current account is equal to the deficiency of United States savings relative to domestic investment. This is a truism and does not show whether the cause runs from a deficiency of savings to the current account deficit or from a current account deficit to the deficiency of savings. 
When a country has a high rate of use of its productive resources, as the United States has, the imbalance arises mainly from a deficiency of savings to the current account deficit. Even then, there may be sectors of the economy, such as the automobile industry, in which a reduction of imports could result in increases in production, in employment, in income and savings.
No one disagrees with the proposition that the United States must increase private savings and reduce the budget deficit to adjust its balance of payments. That, however, will not result in a significant improvement in the trade balance with Japan unless Japan also reduces its savings.
To support this view I cited the increase of United States savings between 1987 and 1989. Over these two years, personal savings increased by $105 billion, and the budget deficit on a national accounts basis was reduced by $12 billion. Increased savings were largely absorbed by an increase in domestic investment, but there was also a reduction in the trade deficit from $160 billion in 1987 to about $112 billion in 1989.
Although the United States trade deficit with Japan is nearly 45 percent of the total deficit, it was reduced by only 9 percent in these two years. By contrast, the trade deficit with the newly industrialized countries of Asia was reduced by 30 percent and the deficit with Western Europe by more than 80 percent.
I emphasized that easing import restrictions would have only a minor effect on the trade deficit, although it would help United States exporters trying to sell to Japan. But if wages of Japanese workers were raised to reflect the value of their work to the economy, or if the foreign-exchange value of the yen were to appreciate to reflect the real international economic position of Japan, the United States trade balance would substantially improve.
Japan is the only large industrial country in which manufacturing wages have increased less in the 1980's than productivity - that is, unit labor costs have fallen. In the United States, unit labor costs in manufacturing increased by 23 percent in the last 10 years, and in Germany they increased even more. To maintain exchange stability, in countries whose relative international economic position has improved, as it has notably in Japan, wages should be increased even more than the increase in productivity in export industries.
To put it simply, workers in Japan are paid less than the economic value of their work. That is one reason personal consumption expenditures in Japan are a far smaller share of the gross national product than in any other large industrial country. Raising the share of wages in the national income would lower the undistributed profits of corporations and reduce the excessive level of savings. It would stimulate consumption of domestic goods and import goods, divert production from export markets to the domestic market and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States and other countries.
If, for some reason, wages cannot be increased, the yen should be allowed to appreciate. This would restrain exports, encourage a shift in consumption from home goods to import goods, hold down profits and savings, and reduce the trade surplus.
The yen is greatly undervalued because of the outflow of capital from Japan. The direct investment of Japan in the United States is in the interest of both countries. On the other hand, the huge Japanese investment in monetary assets denominated in dollars is not in the long-run interest of either country. Japanese investors have suffered large losses from these holdings, and the excessive amount of such investment has prevented the necessary appreciation of the yen.
Japanese legislation and policies have encouraged such investment. One instance is the forward purchase by Japan Airlines of $4 billion over 11 years at much more than the present rate. If there were an economic justification for this huge forward dollars purchase, Japan Airlines would not have incurred the large loss it has suffered.

HEADLINE: Give Commuters a Break in Deducting Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It has always amazed me when filing income taxes, based on gross income, that no provision is made to deduct the cost of commuting to and from one's place of employment.
Subway and bus fares rise along with the ever-increasing tolls instituted by bridge and tunnel authorities. Higher tolls lead the owners of independent buses that cross state lines automatically to raise fares. Such raises place another burden on commuters who are dependent on this mode of transportation, especially where a company has a mono-poly. A New Jersey line that is said to have one of the highest per-mile travel tariffs in the country has just announced a further increase.
Tolls and fares have risen alarmingly in the last decade, and many commuters pay hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars a year in job-related travel without any increase in salary to offset it.
At the same time, the quality of service has not improved and in many cases has even deteriorated. Accusations of mismanagement or misdirection of funds have been leveled, but to no avail. Commuters are the victims of circumstance, with seemingly no recourse, yet they face the prospect of greater travel expenses in the future.
When it comes to gross income and traveling to and from work, the situation can be summed up as nothing less than ''gross.'' An across-the-board method must be found that allows commuters to deduct a reasonable amount from their income taxes. It may be hoped this can be done before travel becomes truly prohibitive for workers and puts another dent in our economy.

HEADLINE: Growth of Revenue Slows in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You erroneously report that New York State tax revenues are ''in sharp decline'' (''Mr. Cuomo, at Least, Is Serious,'' editorial, Jan. 18). Not so. Total tax collections in New York State will increase, even if nothing is done to raise tax rates or impose new taxes.
New York State will not have less to spend than it did last year. However, the state will have less to spend than it had anticipated. This is the cause of the fiscal dilemma facing us. Should we retreat from tax cuts and impose new taxes to make up the difference, or should we live within our means?
It is preposterous for you to suggest that prudence demands new and higher taxes. The need for New York State to recognize the economic realities of slower revenue growth demands consideration of all the alternatives, spending cuts included.
The desire of State Senator Ralph J. Marino, the majority leader, to explore all those alternatives before leaping to embrace higher taxes is a course that you should indeed endorse.

BYLINE: By Chester A. Crocker; Chester A. Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 1981 to 1989, mediated the Angola-Namibia peace plan.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For decades, we have been told that South Africa's racial conflict is at the stage of five minutes to midnight. For decades, the nation's future has been discussed in grisly scenarios: revolutionary upheaval, enduring white domination, racial partition and Lebanon-style chaos.
Suddenly, something has happened. Since taking office in September -especially last weekend, when he ended Nelson Mandela's 27-year prison sentence - President F. W. de Klerk has opened the first truly new chapter in the country's history since 1948. That was the year when his National Party swept to victory and began implementing apartheid. 
Before we can assess where the current moment will lead, we need to understand how it happened and why it happened now.
Although the significance can easily be overstated, there is a connection between the collapse of the Communist enterprise in Europe and events in South Africa. First, as Moscow disengages from military adventurism abroad, Afrikaner nationalists have been deprived of their external enemy and can now recognize their real problem: coming to terms with all the people of South Africa.
Similarly, the African National Congress and its hosts among the frontline states have lost a revolutionary ally. Violent confrontration and armed struggle always made more sense as a battle cry than as a practical road to liberation in South Africa. That is even more true today. Finally, Marxism, state socialism and one-party rule have been discredited globally; this undercuts their current and would-be practitioners in South Africa.
But the dramatic changes in the East do not offer a model for what will happen in South Africa. The white-minority Government in Pretoria is not capitulating; it has made a sober choice to pursue negotiations. It cannot be swept away by force.
The significance of Mr. de Klerk's boldness lies in his tacit recognition that negotiation can create new facts and fresh openings for compromise, and that negotiation is the only road to legitimacy.
What, then, has caused Mr. de Klerk to move so boldly? First, he represents the younger Afrikaner political generation, which learned the lessons of the 1980's and watched in frustration as former leaders waste one golden opportunity after another. For such people, 10 or 15 years ago the nationalist vision of apartheid had become a nightmare. The 1980's showed that it could not be defended at an acceptable price.
Second, the past three years have brought major improvements in South Africa's regional position. In a fascinating dance of regional diplomacy and military machismo, the rulers of South Africa and Cuba made precisely parallel moves and for parallel reasons: to get away from the quagmire of regional warfare. Maneuvering like scorpions in a bottle, they avoided hurting each other.
The December 1988 Namibia-Angola agreements, mediated by the U.S., transformed the strategic equation in Southern Africa. Now, Cuban forces are returning home from Angola, removing Pretoria's only conventional-warfare threat. This, in turn, makes it possible for South Africa to shed its costly and distracting colonial burden in Namibia, losing nothing of value and leaving in its wake a new neighbor with a negotiated and entrenched democratic constitution. A.N.C. military cadres have been relocated from Angola, the last neighbor still hosting them, while South African soldiers have come home from the regional wars.
Finally, doors have opened to trade, investment and diplomacy in other African countries.
As a result of this process, Pretoria will soon begin to enjoy a substantial peace dividend as resources are reallocated toward South Africa's own massive needs. This prospect, and the extraordinary skill with which Nelson Mandela has communicated his inclusive, reconciling vision to his former jailers - help explain how Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela are liberating each other from their physical and mental prisons.
The third factor in Mr. de Klerk's new thinking is his own readiness to listen to diverse views and reflect on hard and enduring facts. There is nothing new about those facts. Inexorable socio-economic trends have created a more integrated society.
Increasingly, racial laws and policies were neither observed nor enforceable. Unrest, repression and political paralysis in the mid-1980's only reinforced a long-standing economic gloom, converting sporadic capital flight into sustained capital export. Confirming the private sector's vote of ''no confidence,'' the sanctions of the 80's added an external apartheid tax to the huge burdens imposed by bureaucrats and ideologues in Pretoria.
From these considerations, three things are clear. First, the pressure has been growing steadily over decades. What is new is the emergence of a leadership that comprehends the situation and seems to wish to address it now. Like Mikhail Gorbachev, President de Klerk is the product of the party machine in which he was formed and wants to escape from conceptual, ethnic and statist economic prisons.
Second, the pressures for change are overwhelmingly internal. It denigrates the struggle for decency and democracy by generations of black and white South Africans to presume that any particular set of policies by any distant nation can ''end apartheid.'' Thus, this is a time for Americans to restrain our messianic impulses and admit the possibility that the breakthroughs and tragedies occurring around the world are not necessarily the result of some American action or inaction.
But we and other major nation's clearly have choices to make about our roles. President Bush is correct about the need for a review of policy. It must be acknowledged that the U.S is unlikely to have much impact if it fails to rise above past domestic wrangling. Mr. Bush has set precisely the right tone in seeking to remove the partisan poison that has diminished the participants in past debates.
The real issue to be reviewed is not sanctions. It is whether the U.S. should actively seek to foster negotiations now. If so, we would be placing our words and actions in support of the process of negotiation and the parties who participate in it.
The first kind of support can take many forms - making active, substantive use of our excellent channels of communication to all actors; serving as a supplementary catalyst, when appropriate; holding out the promise of tangible U.S. backing for the results of negotiation.
The second kind of support means making a U.S. commitment to negotiators who commit themselves to defining a democratic structure appropriate to the circumstances of their country. It does not mean that we are the ally of any particular side.
If we really want to see negotiations begin, we must avoid linking our discussions of when to lift sanctions to the South African debate about the ''conditions'' for negotiation. That debate could go on and on, especially if outsiders encourage it by taking sides.
At some point soon, a responsible American policy should ask South Africans to get on with it. At that point, we could stop punishing the old South Africa, which Nelson Mandela has done so much to change, and start lending our support to the new South Africa, which he and Mr. de Klerk want to build.

HEADLINE: Eulogy to John Doe, a Symbol of 'All Hurts'

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
It came time yesterday to eulogize the homeless man killed last month on a subway platform at Columbus Circle, and still no one knew his name.
All that could be said about the middle-aged man was that he had appeared violent, disturbed, and something of a loner. And that another middle-aged man, Rodney Sumter, says he killed him out of fear for his life and that of his 3-year-old son.
 
He Is Still Unidentified
Since the homeless man was killed on Jan. 22, records checks have failed to identify him, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office. Further investigation could take as long as six months, she said. 
But it appeared yesterday that the symbolism of his death would not wait.
Almost no one came to St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church, on Avenue B opposite Tompkins Square, expressly to mourn John Doe, as the speakers awkwardly called him. The man, who witnesses say spat at Mr. Sumter and hit him for no apparent reason, was not known to have had any friends. The memorial was organized by The Partnership for the Homeless.
Michelle Sumter, Mr. Sumter's wife, came to pay respects, she said. Several homeless people were ushered in from the neighborhood to listen: one left, one asked for change from a man in the next pew, another fell asleep.
But of the problems that the dead man came to embody, there was much to say. So into St. Brigid's filed a handful of advocates for the homeless, for subway riders and for Mr. Sumter, an unemployed construction worker who had himself worked with the homeless. Most of the 30 people in the audience were reporters, photographers and television cameramen.
After rock-and-roll spirituals by a well-amplified church quartet, the pastor of St. Brigid's Church, the Rev. George Kuhn, began a sermon with the observation that he knew almost nothing about the man, save the circumstances of his ''brutal murder.''
 
'Homeless People Are Not Wanted'
Behind dark sunglasses, Mrs. Sumter appeared to fight back tears. And Father Kuhn went on: ''He seems almost, when you think about it a little bit, like a symbol of all of the hurts and violence of this society.''
''Homeless people are not wanted in our country,'' the pastor said. ''We have to say I am ready to give my all so that this does not happen again.''
When the service ended, most of those in attendance recessed to a back corner of St. Brigid's for several interlocking news conferences. The conferees varied in their viewpoints, but agreed that both the man who died and the man who killed him were victims of a faulty system.
Mrs. Sumter at first declined to comment but when microphones were pushed toward her, she said that the killing had traumatized her family.
Her husband, who is charged with first-degree manslaughter, is deeply distraught, she said, and her son will need psychotherapy.
''He still has fear of going into the train station,'' she said. ''It's something that will be with us for the rest of our lives.''
 
Venting His Anger
Peter P. Smith, president of The Partnership For the Homeless, a nonprofit advocacy group, lashed out at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for refusing, he said, to adequately face the problem of homeless people in the subways. He asked that District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau investigate the M.T.A.'s possible culpability in the killing.
Roy Innis, national chairman of the Congress On Racial Equality, vented anger, he said, on behalf of both Mr. Sumter and common people around the city.
''The million or so riders who ride the subway and the millions more who walk the streets are conflicted,'' he said, concerned about the homeless but uncertain how to deal with unpredictable and irascible homeless people like the man Mr. Sumter killed.
And Mr. Sumter's lawyer, Simeon Greenaway, charged the District Attorney's office with ''a compounding of the tragedy,'' by prosecuting his client.
 
'Exploiting the Death'
Mr. Innis said that Mr. Sumter had wanted to attend the memorial. He was advised against coming to avoid ''the impression of exploiting the death of John Doe.''
Early yesterday morning, few people at the Columbus Circle subway station said they had any memory of the dead man.
''He was all over,'' said one porter who recalled the man vividly, and asked not to be identified. ''But this was one of his main stations that he used to come to.''
People living in the station say its tunnels and stairwells have little to recommend them save the soft, malodorous heat that fills them in winter. While the transit police occasionally harass them, few others seem to show any concern for them at all, they say.
The porter, who did not want to be identified, placed the dead man in a category different from most of those cocooned in sacks of old clothing, dreaming on the stiff wooden benches and chilled concrete floors.
Often, the porter said, Mr. Sumter's aggressor, a short, heavyset man in his late 50's or early 60's, would stretch out next to young women and verbally abuse them.
''Every time I cleaned up, he'd go in and pull out the trash bags and throw them on the floor,'' the porter said. ''He'd walk around in people's face, cursing. You couldn't carry on a conversation with him. He was different from the other ones - violent.''
On the steps leading up to the station's 57th Street and 8th Avenue exit, a stooped man who called himself Robert took a hit from a crack pipe and pondered the man's end.
''I'll tell you,'' Robert said. ''He had no right spitting on anybody. That's what they say he did. But the guy had no business killing him. People are always harassing us.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins Present as Labor Talks Start

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Breaking with tradition, Mayor David N. Dinkins appeared yesterday at the first negotiating session on a new contract with municipal workers and warned that New York City's fiscal problems would require ''tough decisions.''
But after a brief statement in which he assured city workers that they were ''politically and philosphically'' important to him, Mr. Dinkins turned the talks over to the professional negotiating team and departed.
''With the fiscal difficulties I inherited, and which came to light only after I took office,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''the outcome of negotiations has become even more critical, not simply for me, but for all New Yorkers.'' 
 
Trying to 'Set a Tone'
The session was held in the 14th Street headquarters of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which is negotiating on behalf of its 6,000 members, from lawyers to blacksmiths. Mr. Dinkins attended the session at the request of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237, who is a longtime political supporter.
In the past, mayors have tried to stay away from the bargaining table, to avoid blame if talks go badly and to avoid the appearance of undermining their negotiators. Mayor Koch, according to former city negotiators, took part in critical negotiations only once, in 1980, when police officers were threatening job actions.
Mr. Dinkins told reporters that he wanted to ''set a tone'' for the talks and did not plan to become involved personally.
But he faces a problem. After six weeks in office he has not hired a chief negotiator. Several labor officials said he had discussed the job with Harold Ickes, a labor lawyer and top campaign adviser.
Contracts for the teamsters and police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers expire on June 30, while contracts for most other city workers expire in the fall. This year's negotiations have been complicated by a slowing economy that has cut into city revenues and produced a budget gap of $450 million this fiscal year and nearly $1.2 billion in the year that begins July 1. #17 Percent Rise Sought So far, the city has included a reserve of 1.5 percent a year for increased labor costs. In yesterday's talks, Mr. Feinstein proposed a contract that would provide almost 17 percent in raises and new benefits over two years.
This includes a general salary increase at the projected rate of inflation, 2 percentage points for workers whose salaries lag behind others in comparable jobs and 1.7 percent to set up an annuity fund of $3 a day to supplement the retirement of city workers.
Each percentage point increase in a labor settlement costs the city more than $100 million if extended to all municipal workers, according to city officials. So 17 percent could cost the city more than $1.7 billion over two years.
Mr. Feinstein said that during the Koch administration he frequently called the Mayor and top city officials while negotiations were under way, and he did not think anything would change now.
''I don't have any sense that the fact that David Dinkins knows us is going to make any difference in what he does,'' Mr. Feinstein said.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Wednesday about New York City's labor negotiations misidentified a segment of the membership of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Local 237 negotiates on behalf of horseshoers, not blacksmiths. Blacksmiths are represented by Local 5 of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers.

HEADLINE: F. R. Collbohm, 83, Ex-Head of Rand, Dies

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PALM DESERT, Calif., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Franklin R. Collbohm, an aviation engineer who became the founding president of the Rand Corporation, the nonprofit research organization, died Monday at his home here, three weeks after a suffering a stroke. He was 83 years old. Mr. Collbohm, who studied engineering at the University of Wisconsin, worked for the Douglas Aircraft Corporation at Santa Monica, Calif,, on designs for the Douglas DC-1, DC-2 and DC-3 aircraft. 
In 1946, while still an employee of Douglas, he was asked by Gen. Henry H. Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces in World War II, to consider assembling a talent pool to study long-range problems.
In 1948, Mr. Collbohm broke Rand away from Douglas, establishing it as an independent, not-for-profit corporation that specialized in scientific research related to national security.
Mr. Collbohm retired from Rand, which is based in Santa Monica, in 1967.
A widower, he is survived by two sons, Robert of Santa Monica and Carl of Middleburg, Fla., two sisters, a brother and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Lessons

BYLINE: By Edward B. Fiske

 BODY:
American education has a new buzzword: restructuring.
It's not exactly clear what the term means. Indeed, everyone who uses it seems to have something different in mind. The common thread appears to be that recent efforts to improve public schools have fallen short and that some drastic new strategies are necessary. 
''To improve our schools we need a total redesign of our educational system,'' said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States.
Mr. Newman was the principal organizer last week when more than 150 governors, state legislators and educators from across the country convened in Baltimore to brainstorm on restructuring. The session was sponsored by the National Governors' Association and the commission, a federally supported organization that coordinates the education policies of the 50 states.
The 1980's was a decade of school reform. Inspired in part by a 1983 report, ''A Nation at Risk,'' by the National Commission on Excellence in Education, virtually every state legislature enacted new policies ranging from tighter course requirements for high school diplomas to higher pay for teachers.
Now, a growing number of political and educational leaders are concluding that those efforts were not enough. As Gov. Michael Castle of Delaware, a Republican, told the meeting, education spending has increased by 29 percent in the last eight years but ''the test scores in the United States of America are the same.''
''We need to restructure our schools,'' Mr. Castle said. ''More of the same will not bring the results we need.''
A logical first step, many people agree, is to decentralize the management of schools - something that is already under way in a number of large city school systems. Joseph A. Fernandez, the new Schools Chancellor in New York City, earned a national reputation as superintendent in Miami by creating a network of schools run by management teams consisting of the principal, teachers and, in some cases, parents and representatives of the local community. He plans to push a similar program in New York City.
Beyond the decentralizing of schools, restructuring can mean just about anything. The Bush Administration has given a high priority to school choice, a system under which parents would pick the public school their children would attend. The assumption is that by forcing competition the schools would be encouraged to become better.
Others define the heart of restructuring as changing what happens in classrooms. Theodore Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, has worked with dozens of schools seeking to cut down lecturing by teachers and to encourage students to take a more active part in their own learning. Mr. Castle urged the development of ''new ways of measuring student progress'' and new ways to ''better and differently train teachers.'' Still others look to computers and other forms of new technology as the basis of restructuring, using them to help in instruction.
No one believes that the path to restructured schools will be either straight or smooth. In Rochester, for example, efforts to create management teams in local schools drew an unsuccesful lawsuit from principals and other middle managers, who argued that the change usurped contractually guaranteed management functions. Mr. Fernandez could face a similar challenge in New York City.
Thomas Dornan, president of the North Carolina Forum for Education, recounted an incident in that state where the finance director for a local school district refused to set up a fund to be controlled by the staff of a local school. ''It took a letter from the state controller to free up the money,'' Mr. Dornan said.
Indeed, it is by no means clear how many American teachers even want the new responsibilities that come with decentralized schools. Adam Urbansky, president of the teachers union in Rochester, noted that most teachers have been trained to go along with policies enacted at higher levels. He estimated that no more than a slight majority of his members are enthusiastic about the powers they enjoy under their current contract.
For such reasons Marc Tucker, director of the National Center for Education in the Economy, argued that restructuring - whatever concrete forms it takes - involves nothing less than a ''cultural transformation'' of public schools.
''Executives who have decentralized big corporations will tell you that this is what they did,'' he said. ''They radically changed people's attitudes about the organization and their role in it. Gorbachev is trying to do the same thing in the Soviet Union, trying to mobilize masses of people who have never had much control of their lives and aren't sure how to handle it when given the opportunity. The same thing has to occur in our schools. They call it perestroika. We call it restructuring.''

HEADLINE: Women's Game Draws Rising Crowd Support

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

 BODY:
On Saturday night at Seattle, more than 7,000 spectators watched Washington upset Stanford in women's basketball. On Sunday afternoon at West Lafayette, Ind., more than 13,000 watched Iowa upset Purdue in women's basketball. Both games were televised nationally and not blacked out locally and still drew large crowds.
Those attendance figures tell much about the rapid climb of college basketball for women. Starting in the 1970's, the Federal government's Title IX program required colleges to provide equal funding for women's sports. Before that, few colleges had women's basketball teams. Now colleges that have men's teams invariably have women's teams. 
''Women's basketball is a highly skilled, highly competitive game,'' said Coach Pat Head Summitt of Tennessee yesterday.
''I think the game is doing great,'' said Coach Tara VanDerveer of Stanford. ''Play is improving and can get better.''
Summitt and VanDerveer spoke at the Grand Hyatt Hotel yesterday in Manhattan at a National Collegiate Athletic Association symposium on women's basketball. The panel included coaches and players from Stanford (20-1), Tennessee (19-4), Purdue (17-4) and St. Joseph's of Philadelphia (18-4), four of the nation's leading teams.
 
Play Is Under the Rim
All speakers agreed that the level of play had risen dramatically.
''You can see it every year,'' said Jennifer Azzi, Stanford's all-America shooting guard. ''Crowds are getting bigger. People are getting excited. The Final Four will be in Knoxville this year, and there's already a big billboard on the Interstate advertising it.''
In many ways, women's basketball is different from men's. Women's games can be intense and competitive, and a 30-second clock keeps the ball moving. But women cannot dunk the ball, so they do not have a Michael Jordan or a Dominique Wilkins to play over the rim. They cannot run as fast or jump as high as men.
''That doesn't mean I can't jump or can't run,'' Azzi said. ''I can shoot as well as a man. I know because I work out with men in the off season. So people who don't think a girl can play basketball are crazy.''
VanDerveer said she was often asked how the women's game compared with the men's.
 
'Team Game'
''It's a fair question,'' she said, ''but there are so many variables. Our game is so young, and so much is new. I didn't play high school basketball because my school didn't have a team. I didn't have any role models growing up. Now millions of young girls are playing and watching us and have role models.
''We play on the same court as the men, but is a comparison fair? Is it fair to compare college men with the pros? The pros may have higher skill levels, but in college you see more teamwork. The college and the pro games are different for the men, and the games for college men and college women are different, too.
''I think we have more of a team game, with more screening, more passing. Our game is still new. I don't know if we will ever be as - I don't want to say accepted - as men's basketball, but I don't know that we have to compare our game with the men's. If our games are played well, people will want to watch.''
Television is showing more women's games than ever, so the audience is greater. But the sport has not had a big-name player since Cheryl Miller in the mid-1980's, and no American professional league has been able to survive.
''When I graduate this year,'' Azzi said, ''I hope to play overseas, maybe Italy. For a season of six or seven months, I can make $50,000 to $150,000 plus an apartment and a car. So I might make more money out of that than from my degree in economics. But it's too bad I can't stay in the United States and play pro ball here. Maybe some day.'' Lack of Exposure While women's basketball may have a long way to go, it has come a long way.
''We haven't had exposure,'' VanDerveer said. ''At Stanford, the team has been in existence only 15 years.''
''We're in the early stages,'' said Coach Lin Dunn of Purdue. ''Our school has been giving scholarships only four years.''
''We're young,'' Summitt said. ''We have to remember that.''
Still, there is obvious pride in the product.
''Some people have told me they enjoy the way we play more than the men,'' said Coach Jim Foster of St. Joseph's ''If you like basketball and like fundamentals, women's basketball is a pure joy to watch. We're the best-kept secret in the country.''

HEADLINE: Satisfying Menages a Trois: Husbands, Wives Restaurants

BYLINE: By ANN BARRY

 BODY:
''WHEN gourmandism is shared,'' the French gastronome Brillat-Savarin wrote, ''it has the most marked influence on the happiness which can be found in marriage. A married couple who enjoy the pleasures of the table have . . . a subject of conversation which is ever new; they can talk not only of what they are eating, but also of what they have eaten, what they will eat, and what they have noticed at other tables.''
Many marriages depend on shared interests, of course, but for husband-and-wife teams in the demanding restaurant business - a work day can run from 9 A.M. until well past midnight - can there be too much of a good thing?
Interviews with a dozen husband-and-wife restaurant teams suggest that the balancing of business and personal lives requires a well-defined division of responsibilities founded on talents and preferences. 
Usually the wife commands the front of the house, dealing with patrons and reservations and supervising the dining room staff, while the husband serves as chef, ordering the food and managing the kitchen staff. The sparks tend to fly if one invades the other's territory, especially at an inappropriate or stressful moment.
Robert and Mimi Del Grande have operated Cafe Annie in Houston for eight years. ''If you end up competing with each other to do the same things, you've got problems,'' Mr. Del Grande said. ''Our areas of expertise are so different; it's a finely tuned thing.''
Certain issues may be discussed in concert - a new dish, a troublesome employee - but typically the final word lies with the person whose domain it is. ''It's a matter of mutual respect,'' Ms. Del Grande said.
Barbara Lazaroff, who with her husband, Wolfgang Puck, operates Spago and Chinois on Main in Los Angeles, describes the same notion as a constant attempt to ''compartmentalize'' life.
''The hardest thing is to separate the personal persona from the work persona,'' she said. ''Any business between two people shouldn't become a sexual battleground. When a business discourse gets personal, you're off the track at that point. Wolf has said you shouldn't take business home. I say you shouldn't take home to the business.
''This, of course, is nearly impossible. So what I'm talking about is a semblance of balance.''
Privacy is precious for a restaurant couple. A few wedge in a quick lunch, keeping the staff at bay; others consider a walk or taxi ride home at the end of the day a blessed retreat. But views varied as to the nature of their communication.
While the food business can be an exhilarating source of discussion, some admit to a fear of becoming Brillat-Savarin's couple in extremis. ''We realized we weren't having a real conversation, even though we were talking all day long,'' said Deann Bayless who, with her husband, Rick, owns the Frontera Grill in Chicago. ''There was not any personal communication. Part of the solution is just accepting the fact that it's a different kind of relationship. And we work hard to make personal time away from the restaurant.''
Barry Wine of the Quilted Giraffe in New York, who has been in the business with his wife, Susan, for 14 years, sees it in a different light: ''If Susan and I are debating, even though it's in the context of the restaurant industry, we're really talking academic issues. Building a restaurant is a design issue, having our own farm for vegetables and flowers is an agricultural interest, the concept of a service charge becomes a sociological-political-economic matter.''
As a consequence of the continual flow of conversation, a restaurant couple doesn't experience the typical ''Hi, how was your day?'' syndrome.
Margaret Fox, who owns Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino, Calif., where her husband, Christopher Kump, is chef, said: ''Spending so many hours under the same roof, you already know so much that has happened in the other person's life. So when you have the chance to be together, it doesn't have the impact. The relationship is diluted through exposure, and conversation can be diminished to restaurant patter.''
A restaurant team's social life is clearly affected by the rigors of the profession. Most of the couples said their close friends simply accepted the limits. On a day off, most couples did not feel up to entertaining except in the most casual way, and either preferred to loll about at home or meet friends out for dinner.
What constitutes a social life, however, has numerous interpretations. Many try to incorporate a social engagement with friends in their restaurant. John and Sally Darr, who have been married 34 years and in partnership at La Tulipe in Greenwich Village for 11 years, set aside Friday evenings to dine with friends at their restaurant. Yet it has a professional edge: to critique the operation from the patrons' viewpoint.
The Wines regard their staff as something of an enlarged family. Their dinner with the kitchen staff late every afternoon is thus a social occasion - albeit, only a half-hour or so. But Frank and Frances Stitt, who operate the Highlands Bar and Grill in Birmingham, Ala., separate their social life from the restaurant. ''Friends are not in the restaurant business,'' Mrs. Stitt said. ''We rarely socialize with people we work with.''
The addition of children in a couple's life (the home is usually near the business) has a great impact, mainly, it seems, on the wife. ''It continues to be a very difficult balancing act,'' Ms. Stitt said. ''Sometimes I feel I'm not good at any of my jobs because I can't devote a hundred percent of the time to the job, or to the child or to my husband.''
Not all restaurant marriages stand the test of time. Ultimately, what keeps many couples together is friendship. ''We'd be divorced if one of us was in another business,'' said George Germon, who with his wife, Joanne Killeen, owns Il Forno and Lucky's in Providence, R.I. ''With the kind of demands of the business, we would never see each other.''
''We both love the business,'' Ms. Killeen said. ''We are both committed. There's something wonderful about having the same goals. To have a buddy along the way to reach your dream, to have someone you can trust completely, is a very satisfying situation.''

 BODY:

Record Enrollment?
In an average week, a publisher might sign contracts for anywhere from two to five new books, but it is rare to have a week as productive as Random House had recently, when it acquired books by seven high-profile authors.
Walter Wriston, the retired chairman of Citicorp, will write about ways in which new technology is going to change the world as profoundly as did the Industrial Revolution. And William Styron, the novelist, in a book entitled ''Darkness Visible,'' will describe his struggle with depression, a struggle that involved committing himself to a mental hospital in the winter of 1985-86. 
Nonfiction works on undisclosed subjects will be written by Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC Entertainment; David Rockefeller Sr., the retired chairman of Chase Manhattan, and Gail Sheehy, journalist and author of the best-selling ''Passages: Predictable Crises of Adult Life.''
J. M. Coetzee, the South African author, has a new novel, set in his homeland, entitled ''Age of Iron,'' And Joe Montana, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, will write his autobiography.
Joni Evans, the publisher of Random House, said that while all the negotiations were concluded in the same week, some of the books had been under discussion for several years. Some were acquired in auctions, each author was represented by a different literary agent, and the books will be edited by five different Random House editors. Moreover, while some of the books will not be published for a couple of years, the Styron, Wriston, Coetzee and Montana books may be published next fall.
''It's wonderful when projects you've been involved in for years finally work out,'' Ms. Evans said. ''But it's even more memorable when so many important projects work out in the same week.''
 
Updating the Ending
''Ivana Trump: A Very Unauthorized Biography,'' by Norman King, is listed in the Carrol & Graf catalogue for publication in July. ''We're still going to publish on time,'' said Kent Carrol, the publisher. But in view of the recent breakup of Ivana and Donald J. Trump's marriage, Mr. Carrol added, ''The author is furiously writing a new last chapter.''
 
Sun Also Rises
Simon & Schuster has acquired world rights to ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' an expanded, revised version of a much-debated book that is a best seller in Japan. The author, Shintaro Ishihara, a legislator and former Government official, contends that Japan holds the technological balance of power in the world, and must therefore no longer be deferential to the United States. In his view, Japan is on the rise and the United States is declining.
The book, scheduled for publication here next winter, has been widely circulated in Washington in an unauthorized translation. Richard E. Snyder, chairman and chief executive officer of Simon & Schuster, said that Mr. Ishihara voiced ''powerful, nationalistic themes,'' but he added that the book would be very important ''for Americans and Europeans to read carefully.''
Mr. Ishihara's co-author on the Japanese edition was Akio Morita, the chairman of the Sony Corporation. But Mr. Morita, who has admitted to having had differences with Mr. Ishihara, will not be involved with the version to be published by Simon & Schuster.
 
Rights-Abuse Works
Yale University Press and Human Rights Watch recently announced a joint publishing program to distribute more widely reports on human rights abuses around the world.
The Human Rights Watch, created in 1987, is the umbrella organization for Africa Watch, Americas Watch, Asia Watch, Helsinki Watch and Middle East Watch. Those committees issue periodic reports of human rights abuses in their region, based on fact-fnding missions by lawyers, journalists and government officials. In addition, Human Rights Watch publishes an annual ''State of the World'' volume, as well as books on torture, prison conditions and related topics.
Human Rights Watch will continue preparing those reports, but Yale will begin offering the co-published books and reports beginning with its fall 1991 list. Yale will also be responsible for design and production of the books. The J. M. Kaplan Fund, a charitable organization with headquarters in Manhattan, is providing about $40,000 to help finance the program.
 
A Ken Kesey Flurry
Ken Kesey, the author of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' has signed a contract with Viking for a novel about Alaska, to be published in the fall of 1991. Meanwhile, three other books by Mr. Kesey will have been published by Viking or Penguin by the end of this year.
The Alaska novel, tentatively called ''Sailor Song,'' is set in the next century at an economically depressed fishing village, at which a Hollywood movie company arrives to make a motion picture of a classic children's book.
Penguin recently published ''Caverns,'' a mystery set in 1934 that Mr. Kesey wrote in collaboration with the 13 members of his graduate writing seminar at the University of Oregon. In October, Viking will publish ''The Further Inquiry,'' about Neal Cassady, the noted figure of the Beat generation. Also in October, Viking will publish Mr. Kesey's ''Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear,'' a story that the author has often performed with the accompaniment of a trio or a full symphony orchestra.

A Twisting Road of Humor To an Imperial America

BYLINE: By Herbert Mitgang

 BODY:

Emperor of America
By Richard Condon
300 pages. Simon & Schuster. $19.95.
Who would dare to combine the styles of the ''Manchurian Candidate'' and ''Prizzi's Honor,'' more or less, and invent a character who heads the Royalty Party, not in Naples but in the United States? None other than Richard Condon in his latest sendup of the American scene and Presidency. 
In ''Emperor of America,'' his 23d novel, Mr. Condon is a little more hortatory than usual. He seems to be warning readers against electing a kingly ruler, as Sinclair Lewis once did in his cautionary anti-dictator novel, ''It Can't Happen Here,'' about a flag-waving general in the White House. Mr. Condon obviously aims to be serious, but he can't help it if his writing is outrageous. He keeps putting English on the eight ball, giving his story screwy turns.
''Emperor of America'' is written with a wink and a smirk and the confidence of an author who has resolved that he's not going to hold back his strong opinions, not at his exuberant age of 74, even if they come across like rabbit punches.
Without giving away every detail of the convoluted plot, it can be revealed that Mr. Condon is not an admirer of the former President and First Lady, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who play more than cameo roles in his satire. He doesn't even like their pet, whom he calls a ''dear little rented dog.'' They are mentioned at least a dozen times during the establishment of the fictional imperial presidency.
The time is March 18, 1990. At 11:04 A.M. on that day next month, a nuclear device is exploded in Washington, wiping out the District of Columbia and evaporating 1,397,200 people. The catastrophe causes the White House to vanish, demolishes the Capitol and destroys every national building but the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Royalist Party shares responsibility with the National Rifle Association for causing the atomic explosion.
Afterward, news is sent out by the television networks in the form of daily mass exorcisms that were started, Mr. Condon writes, ''by the Reagan Administration (1981-1989): the constant moral bloopers; the Grenada mockery; the Lebanese disasters; the Iran-contra scandals; the Persian Gulf debacles; the Libya fixation; the Supreme Court appointment messes; Congressional committee exposures; the charges, arraignments and indictments of high Federal officials beyond any count of corruption in White House history.''
Here is the country's mood after the bomb: ''The Royalists had best access to where the American people lived; that vast diamond-bright area of daytime television and prime-time soap.'' He continues, ''The Reagan Administration - that shining definition of reigning glamour and romance associated with queens, big money, great dressmakers, great poverty, colorful (moderate) mullahs, glamorous (if shocking) scandals and entertaining South American drug lords - had overtaken the national imagination of a society which had been compartmentalized by money.'' Naming names, ''The yuppie virus, which had been fed by the decade of Ron and Nancy, the bull market and eight unrelenting years of political fantasy, struck as AIDS had struck.''
But follow the money and the military. How does an Army colonel, Caesare Appleton, become the first Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the United States and then Emperior Caesare I? Blame Nicaragua, which the author calls ''an evil empire,'' for his rise to power. With breeding techniques, the Sandinistas swell their population from 3 million in 1980 to 21 million people, ''almost all of them fierce males who wanted to invade and occupy the United States, rape the flower of American womanhood, desecrate the flag and ban the Pledge of Allegiance from all American schoolrooms.''
Colonel Appleton beats the Sandinistas on the battlefields of Portugal and Southeast Asia, becomes a national hero and takes over as a Royalist. It helps, of course, that his manipulative mother gets him to sign up with the William Morris Agency to make money and a name for himself.
In case of doubt about how Mr. Condon feels about the former President, some of his characters pause now and then to emphasize his views indelicately: ''Ronald Reagan was the greatest President this country has ever produced. He gave us the F.B.I. race wars, the Qaddafi bombings, the 'Star Wars' flapdoodle, the Grenada farce, the Bitburg shaming, the endless bank failures, the Lebanon disasters, the crumbling national airlines, the rape of HUD, the oligarchy of Big Oil, insured inflation and the shoring up of sinister Israeli politicians - all to keep our people diverted and entertained until the Royalty Party could consolidate its position.''
And that's not all. The novel also includes cocaine, rape, the mafia, abortion, a House of Lords in Dallas (where the author lives), sibling rivalry, momism and a huge statue erected on Government grounds to former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. By the end of ''Emperor of America,'' Mr. Condon has had more fun than anybody; most of the time his humor is wild enough to work.

HEADLINE: A Big Chicago Realty Firm Stops Paying Some Bills

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 13

 BODY:
One of the nation's largest real estate firms said today that many of its commercial properties were so troubled financially that it had no choice but to stop paying certain bills.
The announcement by VMS Realty Partners, which last fall valued its properties at more than $9 billion, was both a commentary on the poor health of the real estate industry and on VMS's condition in particular.
As property markets have sunk into recession in the Southwest, the Southeast and the Northeast, hundreds of developers have filed for bankrupcty and real estate lenders have seen their portfolios of bad loans grow. The announcement by VMS is the latest indication that real estate in many regions remains depressed. 
The announcement seemed to suggest that VMS was in such difficult straits that it was more prudent to postpone paying bills than to continue depleting cash. It left unclear, however, whether its difficulties were so severe that the firm might have to file for bankruptcy.
But experts who have followed the firm said its prospects were grim.
 
Position of Xerox
Today's action may also reflect a desire by the Xerox Corporation, one of VMS's four general partners, to limit its exposure to losses from the firm. Xerox originally committed $200 million to VMS and increased that in November by extending a $125 million line of credit. By no longer making nonessential payments to outsiders, however, VMS has presumably stopped its cash outflow. That, in turn, could help Xerox salvage part of its investment.
In its heyday in the early 1980's, VMS was one of the largest real estate syndicators, raising more than $1.5 billion through more than 100 real-estate limited partnerships. The firm's properties include the Boca Raton Hotel in Florida and the Omni Park Hotel in New York.
Some real estate professionals said VMS had been far too optimistic in its assumptions about future rents and property values.
''I'm not sure, but I would bet 100 to 1 that VMS will not be around for long,'' said Scott Miller, a Houston-based consultant who has followed VMS for years.
VMS's decision to hold non-essential payments will directly affect suppliers that provide it with short-term credit. The biggest impact, however, will be felt by the eight publicly traded real estate investment trusts that VMS sponsored beginning in 1986, after tax law changes wreaked havoc with VMS's core limited-partnership business.
 
Borrowing From Trusts
VMS borrowed more than $1 billion from the trusts to purchase a broad array of commerial properties, including hotels and office buildings. Now that VMS is facing a cash crisis, the trusts will not get paid anywhere near the amounts they are due.
For some time, many VMS properties have been in such bad shape that the firm has had no choice but to make cash advances to keep them current on their obligations.
In such a fashion, the trust investors were able to receive a return on their mortgage loans and the banks that lent against VMS properties received payments. But with today's announcement, VMS has effectively said that, in its view, it no longer makes financial sense for the firm to continue pouring money into properties that are not showing signs of improvement.
It will now be up to the various lenders involved - the banks, the trusts and others - to hold talks and decide how to divide what little positive cash flow the properties generate.
Today's announcement was considered a surprise. In November, the firm's new chief executive, Jeffrey A. Park, said VMS, while troubled, was solvent and not facing a cash crisis. VMS sent letters to a number of its investors suggesting that the firm's prospects were encouraging.
Investors today bid down the price of the trusts' shares. The VMS Mortgage Investment Fund, fell 57 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $1.625, down $2.125. The VMS Hotel Investment Fund, traded on the American Exchange under the symbol VHT, fell 43 percent, to $1.625, down $1.25.

HEADLINE: Intel: Supplier Rising As a Big Competitor

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HILLSBORO, Ore.

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation, once just a supplier of chips to computer makers, is increasingly becoming their competitor, making everything from personal computers to supercomputers. Some of Intel's customers are grumbling, but industry analysts say the diversification makes sense for a company that already makes the most complicated and important part in a computer.
Intel has quietly operated its computer systems business since 1975. While this unit historically concentrated on add-on boards and computers for industrial uses, it has diversified broadly in the last two years, and it now accounts for a bit less than 30 percent of the company's $3.2 billion in revenues, Intel says. Already a big producer of personal computers, Intel last month announced both a new supercomputer and a line of computer work stations aimed at the technical market.
Intel's computer business sells primarily to original equipment manufacturers, companies that resell its machines under their names, sometimes packaged with proprietary software or other equipment. Big resellers of Intel's personal computers include the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Unisys Corporation. 
 
Customers Are Uncomfortable
Such arrangements do not please companies that make their own machines using Intel microprocessors and memory chips. Companies including Compaq Computer, Zenith Data Systems and AST Research have complained about Intel's entry into their business. They say they are uncomfortable competing with a big supplier.
Intel executives say personal computers are both a logical extension of their core business and a response to customer demands. In recent years, some customers that once bought only chips and later bought circuit boards have begun to buy complete computers. If Intel did not supply these customers, a third party would, the Intel executives add.
''It's almost a misnomer today to say that Intel is a computer component and systems company,'' said Leslie Vadasz, president of the Intel Systems Group, which is based in Hillsboro, a suburb of Portland. ''We are a computer company delivering our product in different levels of packaging.''
 
Same Power, Fewer Chips
As semiconductor technology has advanced, placing ever more transistors on a single chip, so the number of chips in a personal computer has declined, from about 170 plus memory in 1984 to 10 plus memory today for the same level of performance. Some Intel officials think the number could drop to one chip plus memory by 1993.
With fewer chips, manufacturing a computer becomes a simpler process. As this shift occurs, the percentage of a machine's value contributed by Intel increases while that of the computer manufacturer declines, making it more worthwhile for some companies to buy finished machines than to support the manufacturing capacity to build them. Ultimately, personal computers could be like videocassette recorders, where a handful of manufacturers produce all the machines, regardless of what brand name is on the box.
As the maker of the microprocessor, which is the most important and most technically complex piece in a personal computer, Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., is in an unusually strong position to build upon its expertise - in part because the International Business Machines Corporation made its personal computer an open system, one that that can be cloned or copied by other manufacturers.
The other big chip makers in the United States do not have a microprocessor comparable to Intel's. Motorola Inc., which makes the microprocessor used in Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, cannot become a computer maker as easily because Apple does not tolerate clones. Motorola microprocessors are also used in work stations and in file servers, computers that operate networks; to date Motorola has made some file server products, but no work stations.
 
Largest Supplier of PC's
For those companies in the market that lack the manufacturing prowess of an I.B.M. or Compaq, Intel is well positioned to manufacture whole machines. Indeed, for original equipment manufacturers, Intel is already the largest supplier of PC's using 32-bit microprocessors, like its 386 and 486 chips.
Computer makers that still prefer to build are worried by this strength, as well as by their new position as rivals of their important supplier.
Intel ''moving into the systems business puts us on a collision course,'' said John P. Frank, president of Zenith Data Systems, a unit of Groupe Bull of France and a big Intel customer. ''It is not good business to compete with your best customers.
While many customers complain about Intel's competing with them, ''Intel can get away with it because customers have no choice,'' said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter based in Palo Alto, Calif. Intel has a monopoly on the microprocessors used in the latest generation of personal computers from I.B.M., Compaq and other manufacturers.
 
'A Messy Situation'
''Intel says we only sell to original equipment manufacturers, as if their own customers don't sell to O.E.M.'s and as if the O.E.M.'s that buy those products don't sell into the same customer base,'' Mr. Slater said. ''It's a messy situation.''
Andrew S. Grove, Intel's president and chief executive, acknowledges the conflict, but says it is unavoidable. ''At a given time that we have I.B.M. resolutely buying at the chip level, there are other major companies, such as A.T.&T., which have decided to out-source'' whole machines, he said. He continued, ''Between I.B.M. and A.T.&T. I don't want to make a choice; I want to supply both of them.''
He added: ''It's easy for me to understand that we are doing things our customers would rather have us not do. Doing this puts an extra responsibility on us; we have to play this game on a meticulously level playing field, with absolute integrity.''
 
Not Favoring the Systems Group
Accordingly, the Intel Systems Group is treated like any other big chip customer with regard to pricing and allocation. For example, it was not the first to receive shipments of the new 486 chip last year.
Customers say that in this regard Intel has played fair, which has helped make its entry in their business tolerable. If Intel began playing favorites with its own systems unit, some companies say they would have to consider shifting to other manufacturers' microprocessors.
While customers complain, securities analysts praise Intel's move. Because the capital costs of computer assembly plants are so much lower than those of semiconductor fabrication, increasing revenues through computer manufacturing is more cost-effective for Intel than adding semiconductor capacity, they say. Noting the companies that have grown large and profitable selling machines based on Intel's microprocessors, they say it is natural for Intel to enter this business.
 
Building PC's 'Makes Sense'
Rajiv Chaudri, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said: ''The value in a PC is in the semiconductors; the most valuable semiconductor is the microprocessor, and that is theirs. Between the $200 microprocessor and the $5,000 box there is not a lot of technological value added. This is something that both opportunistically and strategically makes sense for Intel.''
Thomas J. Thornhill, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in Larkspur, Calif., estimated that Intel's systems business accounted for $812 million in 1989, or about 26 percent of the company's $3.2 billion in revenues; he expects it to earn a little more than $1 billion in 1990. ''I would expect the Systems Group would have lower income-statement margins than the semiconductor business, but the rate of return on capital is very attractive,'' he said.
As a logical extension of its PC business, Intel recently introduced three work stations. Like the personal computers, these machines are based on its 386 and 486 microprocessors, but they operate on the Unix software operating system rather than MS-DOS, and they are aimed at technical rather than business customers. Like Intel's personal computers, the work stations will be sold through original equipment manufacturers and will compete primarily with the products of Sun Microsystems Inc. and the Hewlett-Packard Company. Both are Intel customers.
Intel also sells a line of add-on boards for enhancing a personal computer's performance - the only products it sells to retail stores under its own name - and a series of specialized computers for communications and network purposes. Its most ambitious offering is the iPSC 860 supercomputer, which uses multiple microprocessors to offer performance the company says exceeds that of the most powerful conventional supercomputers. This machine does not compete directly with the products of any Intel customers.
Not every Intel Systems business succeeds. An early venture in digital watches was an expensive flop, and last year the company decided to abandon Biin, a joint venture formed with Siemens A.G. to develop a powerful computer for business customers based on multiple microprocessors. The company said the cost of continuing the effort would have exceeded the potential return.
 
Prospects for Growth
Despite its diversification, Intel's systems business has consistently remained under 30 percent of the total revenues of the company, largely because of the runaway growth of its microprocessor business. The success can be credited largely to Intel's technical prowess - it invented the microprocessor, the dynamic random access memory chip and the electronically programmable read-only memory chip, all in 1971 - and the adoption of Intel's microprocessor by I.B.M. for its personal computers.
Looking forward, Dr. Grove said the systems business's growth was tied to the rate at which United States and European companies pulled out of manufacturing. ''The faster it erodes, the faster Systems will be a larger portion of Intel,'' he said.
As more Western computer manufacturers decide it is better to buy machines than to build them, Intel must work to avoid the intrusion of companies, many of them from East Asia, that would buy Intel parts, assemble them into computers and then sell them to computer companies, Dr. Grove said. ''I don't want these economic trends to leave us further behind in the food chain,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Support for Airline Deregulation

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
After an extensive study of airline competition, the Transportation Department has found no cause for alarm in the shrinking number of major airlines in the decade since the industry was deregulated.
But the study cited a few ''pockets of problems'' as a result of the industry's new hub-and-spoke system of routes, which has led to a concentration of market power in some cities and overcrowded skies in others.
Although just eight airlines now carry 90 percent of the nation's air traffic, the study, to be released in Washington today, finds that they are competing vigorously. The public now enjoys more service and lower fares than it did several years ago when there were twice as many major airlines, the study said. 
 
Legislation for Competition
Officials of the Transportation Department who provided a copy of the study's main conclusions and discussed its implications in an interview said that Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner would arm himself with the study's voluminous data and argue vigorously against any move to re-regulate the airlines, whose routes, fares and finances were deregulated in 1979.
The study, which took nine months, has been one of the Bush Administration's department's most important examinations of transportation policy and comes amid signs of further consolidation in the industry and amid proposals in Congress for legislation that would require the Federal Government to encourage competition in markets where little exists.
In announcing the findings in Washington, Mr. Skinner is expected to declare that from the standpoint of insuring competition in the industry, deregulation has been a stellar success, with only a few areas of concern.
The study identified two main problems under deregulation, the officials said.
''Not all travelers and markets have enjoyed the same level of benefits,'' the study concluded. ''Passengers departing from or traveling to some highly concentrated hub airports pay higher fares. And while hub-and-spoke operations have fostered industry efficiency, they have also increased airport congestion.''
 
Price of Concentration
The study found that in eight cities where a single airline has established an important operating hub and provides most of the daily flights, fares are on average 18.7 percent higher than at other cities. The eight cities are Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Dayton, Ohio, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Memphis, Salt Lake City and Charlotte, N.C.
This phenomenon has long troubled many members of Congress, especially those whose districts include these concentrated hub airports.
Second, the officials said, the study shows that in some crowded markets, including New York, Washington and Chicago, a serious shortage of airport capacity has limited the access of new competitors to the marketplace.
The Bush Administration holds that adding capacity to the national airways is the most important measure that can be taken to foster competition in the industry, and has requested several billion dollars in additional spending on airport expansion and modernization of the air-traffic control system in the years ahead.
 
Sanguine Conclusions
The department's sanguine conclusions about consolidation in the industry stand in marked contrast to the deep concern expressed by Mr. Skinner and his staff at the outset of the project last year. Since then, the prospect of further consolidation in the industry is continuing, with the possibility remaining that weaker carriers like Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines and Eastern might not survive.
But the study concluded that the survivors would be vigorous competitors, their routes extending across the nation and their revenues bolstered by sharp gains in international air traffic.
Between 1978 and 1984, the industry expanded from 30 to 38 large carriers, and in 1984 16 airlines shared 90 percent of all traffic. Now, after 11 mergers and 16 acquisitions, there are 29 large airlines, eight of which provide 90 percent of the service. The eight are American, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, USAir, Texas Air, which owns Continental and Eastern, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am.
 
Contrary to Intuition
But the study reached the conclusion, which it called ''seemingly counterintuitive,'' that the changes in the industry have led to ''more service at a lower cost.''
The reason, the study found, was that the development of hub-and-spoke operations by the surviving carriers, which rely on centrally situated airports where passengers make connections on the way from one city to another, has produced more efficient airlines and more choices for passengers.
The study found several positive trends, all brought on by the hub-and-spoke development of the industry.
At many airports, the new system has provided additional service. The majority of cities with air service had more frequent flights in 1989 than in 1978, it said.
Smaller cities have benefited as much as larger ones because hubs have been set up at small cities and because spokes have been established to them. The growth in weekly flights to 28 large cities was 61 percent between 1978 and 1989, the study said. Flights to medium-sized cities increased 70 percent, those to small cities grew 33 percent, and those to towns and rural communities grew 44 percent.
 
More Choice for Flyers
When service between pairs of cities is examined, competition has markedly increased because passengers can choose among airlines making connections through different hubs. In 1988, more than 55 percent of all air travel was between pairs of cities served by three or more airlines, up from 28 percent in 1978. The number of city pairs served by one carrier, on the other hand, has remained fairly constant.
In 698 travel markets, or pairs of cities, where one airline is dominant, passenger fares were on average 14 percent higher than they were on routes with competing airlines, the study found.
The noncompetitive routes accounted for 10 percent of the total passenger mileage nationwide.
But over all, after taking inflation into account, fares declined by an average of 15 percent from 1984 to 1988, the period of consolidation among airlines, and small cities benefited from the greatest decline in fares, the study found.
Fares have been rising since 1987 even faster than the rate of inflation, but the long-term trend remains down, the study said. It noted that this trend had been in place for decades, even before the industry's deregulation. AMRd (american) UALd (united) NWAd (Northwest)

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Global Warming: Look or Leap?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FOR George Bush the candidate, global warming was hot stuff - not as critical to the nation's future, perhaps, as ending prison furloughs for murderers, but near the top of the list of issues that mattered to the quiche and Volvo crowd.
For George Bush the President, global warming is another of the universe's great mysteries, worthy of careful study but not precipitous response. Indeed, in deference to those who believe the globe may even be cooling, Mr. Bush now discreetly refers to the issue of ''climate change.''
This transformation has been widely reported as an ideological victory for John Sununu, the President's conservative guru. But it also represents a technocratic victory for President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, and in particular for one council member, Richard Schmalensee, an expert on regulation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The council's annual report, published last week, offers the economist's case for looking a while longer before we leap. 
In a bow to Mr. Sununu, a former nuclear engineer, the report notes that computer forecasts of warming necessarily turn on primitive assumptions about atmospheric dynamics. It is even conceivable that the ''greenhouse effect,'' caused by the accumulation of atmospheric pollutants that trap solar energy, will be more than offset by cooling caused by increased cloud cover.
But the council's views carry the most credibility on the council's own turf. The economic burden imposed by a temperature increase, the report says, may be relatively modest, while the costs of containing the greenhouse-effect pollutants over the next century may prove extraordinarily high. Increased summer temperatures could directly affect health. But while ''the average temperature differential between New York City and Atlanta is as large as the most extreme predictions of warming,'' the report notes, ''there is no evidence that Atlanta's warmer climate creates a greater health risk than New York's.''
Higher temperatures are likely, however, to reduce overall agricultural productivity. According to the Department of Agriculture, the net costs worldwide of a doubling of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, would run from $35 billion to $170 billion annually.
That is a lot of money. But it amounts to just 1 percent of current world income. And as the council argues, it is in the same ball park as the costs of Government regulations that now distort food production and reduce its total value. To put it another way, freer markets in agriculture, the council suggests, could more than offset greenhouse-effect losses.
On the other side of the ledger, controlling carbon dioxide emissions would be no small undertaking. There is no practical way to trap carbon emissions from smokestacks or tailpipes. And according to one study cited by the council, the energy conservation needed to reduce carbon dioxide output by 20 percent in the United States over the next 110 years would cost from $800 billion to $3.6 trillion.
Nor, the council notes, would that titanic conservation effort be worth much if the rest of the world did not follow suit. Europeans and Japanese, who are less addicted to fossil fuels than Americans, may be ready to make the sacrifice. But developing countries, most notably China, are not about to slow industrialization to keep Boston cool or spare Iowa from drought.
Is the council right to be so cautious? While it is hard to find an economist who believes the benefits of slowing global warming exceed the costs, many economically sophisticated environmentalists still believe many anti-greenhouse measures are worth it in any case.
One class of extremely potent greenhouse gases, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) used primarily in refrigerators and air-conditioners, are also responsible for most damage to the ozone layer. The United States is already committed to ending CFC production gradually to forestall a worldwide epidemic of skin cancer. Why not buy a little extra insurance against global warming, environmentalists argue, by accelerating the phase-out?
Then there is the issue of energy conservation. Some forms of carbon-controlling conservation, almost everyone agrees, would be extremely expensive. But other measures - for example, efficiency improvements in home appliances and commercial lighting - would probably save more in electricity bills than they would cost in new equipment.
The council accepts in principle the idea that some anti-warming initiatives could be justified on unrelated merits. The challenge for the Bush Administration will be to translate those principles into policy - to stop looking at global warming as a yes-or-no question and look for cheap ways to exploit the maybes.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Gained 1.6% In January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales rose a strong 1.6 percent in January, the sharpest gain in more than a year, the Government said today. Analysts said the broad advance demonstrated enough consumer confidence to hold off a recession.
''Consumer spending is still alive,'' said John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Most categories showed advances that ''suggest to me that the consumer is coming back in the first quarter, taking up his normal pace of spending.'' 
The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $146.4 billion and posted the steepest increase since a 2.1 percent gain in October 1988.
December sales, which originally were said to be up two-tenths of a percent, actually fell two-tenths of a percent, dragged down by a 2.6 percent decline in automobile sales, today's report said. Auto sales represent about 20 percent of retail sales.
 
Car Sales Increase
But car sales, prompted by new incentives that continued into February, were up 5.4 percent in January. The gain in car sales was the largest since a 6.6 percent advance in October 1988.
Excluding the often-volatile auto category, retail sales still rose six-tenths of a percent last month.
''The underlying strength is really quite remarkable,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York government securities dealer. ''You really had strength across the board.''
''It hints that consumer confidence is not fading,'' Mr. Jones said. ''As long as consumers stay positive, since they count for two-thirds of G.N.P., the economy is likely to stay out of a recession.''
Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, which itself represents about two-thirds of the gross national product, the nation's output of goods and services.
 
Growth Slowed
The economy - particularly the manufacturing and construction sectors - slowed in the fourth quarter of 1989, squeezed by high interest rates as the Federal Reserve Board kept a tight rein on credit to combat inflation.
Durable goods - those expected to last more than three years - felt the brunt of the sluggishness since many of these products are financed through loans.
But durable goods sales rose 3.9 percent in January, after falling 2.1 percent in December. Sales of building materials were up 2.3 percent, and purchases of furniture and other home furnishings rose 2 percent.
Purchases of nondurable goods, like food and clothing, advanced three-tenths of a percent on top of a gain of nine-tenths of a percent in December.
For the three months from November through January, overall retail sales were up 3.8 percent.

HEADLINE: The Collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert;
For Those Tied to Drexel, Concern but No Panic

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
Those who have a vested interest in the fate of Drexel Burnham Lambert and of the ''junk bond'' market that Drexel created and once dominated are scattered across the business landscape.
Ranging from the commodities markets to the insurance industry, the roster includes mutual funds, banks, the Federal Government and the employees and creditors of all the corporations that have sold the speculative bonds that Drexel pioneered.
For now, most of those directly affected seem to be taking a wait-and-see stance until Drexel's fate is settled. There is attention and concern but no panic, several analysts said. 
Drexel's legal and financial problems have obviously hurt the market for high-yield speculative bonds, and the strain worsened yesterday on the news that Drexel planned to file for bankruptcy protection.
Even that troubled arena behaved better than expected yesterday. And some analysts expected the market would ultimately find its bearings. ''At the end of the day, it is the companies you lent the money to who are going to pay you back, not Drexel,'' said Gail Silberman, a bond analyst with Jefferies & Company in New York. ''Someone will end up owning Drexel's junk bonds - someone who is content to sit there and collect principal and interest payments in the years ahead.''
 
Insurance Companies
Insurance companies are among those that already own a lot of the bonds Drexel brought to market. While many companies may have to reduce the book value of those assets, only a few firms hold enough ''junk'' assets to be substantially affected by such shrinkage.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. has identified several insurance companies with a ''material exposure'' to the junk bond market, said Weston Hicks, Moody's associate director. Heading the list are Executive Life of California and its New York subsidiary, they are the principal operating arms of the First Executive Corporation of Los Angeles.
The other companies are the United Pacific Life Insurance Company, owned by the Reliance Group of New York; the Presidential Life Insurance Company, a public company whose stock is traded over the counter, and Fidelity Bankers Life and First Capital Life, both owned by the First Capital Holdings Corporation of Los Angeles.
''We're watching the situation,'' Mr. Hicks said. ''We are somewhat concerned about these companies, but in most cases, they are very liquid on a near-term basis.'' He said the five companies were not likely to be ''forced to sell at a loss.''
Randolph B. Root, a partner at Kwasha Lipton, a benefits advisory firm, said the Drexel developments ''are a good reminder'' that purchasers of annuities, guaranteed investment contracts and similar insurance investment products ''should pay more attention to who your insurance carrier is.'' But he said the junk market's troubles would probably not spread beyond a handful of insurers.
 
Mutual Funds
Mutual fund investors, of course, have a direct stake in how their funds' portfolios fare in the months ahead. So far, Drexel's problems have not prompted a significant exodus from high-yield funds.
''It was very quiet,'' said a spokesman for Fidelity Investments in Boston. At T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, Steven Norwitz, a vice president, said: ''Anybody who was queasy about the market has already left it. The ones who are left understand the risks and probably are going to just ride it out.''
Although Drexel's junk-bond activity dominated its public image, the brokerage house was also active in other arenas. It trades over-the-counter stocks, a variety of commodity products including oil futures and precious metals, and government securities and foreign currencies.
In all those markets, Drexel is not the force it has been in junk bonds. Nevertheless, an active player may withdraw, and the markets must prepare for that possibility. Yesterday, some markets had to deal with the widespread uncertainty about Drexel's status.
 
Crude Oil Futures
The crude oil market was especially unsettled. Drexel is a member and an active trader on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where futures contracts on crude oil are traded. The exchange assured its other members yesterday that Drexel's customer accounts were safely insulated from the company's problems.
But some oil trading firms were uneasy about Drexel's ability to meetlonger-term delivery contracts. The result was a decline in the price of near-term crude oil contracts.
Hosts of other businesses and people also have a significant stake in the recovery of the junk bond market.
The banks that lent money used to finance the original junk-bond deals usually did so with the expectation that additional junk bonds would be sold to repay their loans. Such refinancings require a functional high-yield market.
So does the Federal Government's effort to rescue the savings and loan industry. Many savings institutions that were taken over by regulators held large portfolios of junk bonds. A decrease in the value of those assets will require an increase in the taxpayers' share of the rescue costs.
Obviously, some companies that sold junk bonds are vulnerable to market upheaval, which is likely to raise their cost of additional capital and force them to spend more operating revenues on interest payments.
The market upheaval might also make it harder for those companies to sell the assets they originally intended to sell, said Alfred Rappaport, an accounting and corporate finance specialist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School.
''Transactions will get even more difficult to do,'' Professor Rappaport said. ''When the companies do find buyers for assets, the buyers may not have the debt capacity to complete the transaction.''
And to the extent that assets cannot be sold and debt costs rise, the pressure on some weaker companies will increase. ''Their problems are in the economics of their operational cash flow,'' Professor Rappaport said. ''And their creditors, their employees and their communities are all stakeholders in that.''

HEADLINE: The Collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert;
The Fed Nightmare

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
For years, E. Gerald Corrigan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has warned anyone who would listen that Wall Street firms have as much potential to disrupt the financial system as commercial banks do - if not more. Thanks to their rapid growth in the 1980's, securities firms today - like banks -have billions of dollars of financial obligations. Yet, unlike banks, securities firms are not answerable to any Government agency with the authority to supervise them in their entirety. Regulators fear that gives them too much leeway to get into risky ventures.
The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. raises many of Mr. Corrigan's fears anew. Drexel's financial problems, which seemed to spring up overnight, materialized in a unit of the firm - the brokerage firm's parent company - that was not regulated by any Government agency. Yet the mere possibility that problems in that unit could cause pressures elsewhere in the financial system raised the specter that the Fed might be forced to extend credit to the financial system to assure the rescue of a securities firm over which it had no direct control. 
''This is a nightmare that none of them wanted to confront,'' said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 
Fed's Overall Responsibility
Technically, only banking institutions and some savings and loan associations have the right to borrow emergency funds from the Federal Reserve. The Fed, however, also is charged with protecting the integrity of the financial system as a whole, and it is in that capacity that it could have been forced to put its own money to work.
So far, that seems to have been unnecessary. Under the supervision of the Federal regulators, Drexel yesterday proceeded to sell off or liquidate various portions of its brokerage business. Perhaps even more surprising, the financial markets reacted calmly both to the news of Drexel's problems and to the sale of securities Drexel held, which might have been expected to send prices down.
But if the markets were on their best behavior, and if the situation seemed under control, Wall Street officials cautioned that there was still much about the situation that is unknown or unresolved.
 
Problem of Retail Customers
For example, while most of Drexel's retail accounts were sold to other brokers last year, there are still some retail customers whose accounts have not been transferred. These accounts may require some form of Government guarantee against possible losses before any other firm would agree to take them over.
Some Wall Street executives speculated that there could also be unforeseen problems with complex, exotic products that created financial obligations for Drexel but which may have been on the books of other subsidiaries and which might not, therefore, be included in a regulatory safety net.
''What about options contracts, what about futures contracts, what about interest-rate swaps, what about non-dollar-denominated interest-rate swaps?'' asked Henry Kaufman, who is the head of a New York investment firm bearing his name.
It is precisely this lack of information that is at the heart of many regulators' complaints. Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has urged Congress to pass a measure that would enable his agency to receive information about other affiliates of a securities firm, rather than just the broker-dealer.
And Mr. Corrigan, in an aptly timed speech in late January, took that suggestion even further. He said: ''It seems to me that careful thought should be given to the suggestion that minimum capital standards and a limited degree of consolidated supervision should apply not only to registered broker dealers, but to the securities firm as a whole, including its parent holding company.''
Wall Street executives have long feared that the Fed intended to extend its regulatory reach over their industry as well. But Mr. Corrigan has stated that his interest stems from concerns for the health of the nation's payments systems.
 
'Potential to Disrupt the System'
Mr. Corrigan wrote in 1987, in a document on financial regulation that was widely read, ''The hard fact of the matter is that linkages created by the large-dollar payments systems are such that a serious credit problem at any of the large users of the system has the potential to disrupt the system as a whole.''
Drexel's problems come at a time when Congress is considering erasing the regulatory barriers between banking and the securities industry. If the financial industry were restructured along those lines, firms like Drexel could gain the right to rely on the Fed to provide a safety net.
Fed officials are reluctant to grant that privilege without gaining an increase in their regulatory powers. Some Wall Street executives thought it was no coincidence that the regulators were apparently working hard to preserve Drexel's broker-dealer unit, which is regulated by the S.E.C. and the New York Stock Exchange, and the government-securities subsidiary, which reports its financial condition to the Fed, but seemed prepared to let the unsupervised units fail.
''My instinct is that they are going to try to keep their hands off,'' Mr. Litan said. ''They're very nervous about setting a major precedent, especially in the midst of a debate over financial restructuring.''

HEADLINE: The Collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert;
Washington Unshaken by Drexel's Fall

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission worked today to limit damage to the financial markets from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., but there was no sense of panic or drama here.
''The notion that this will have a tremendous rippling effect throughout the economy is probably overstated,'' one Administration economist said.
Another Fed official noted with some pleasure that ''the markets reacted quite positively.'' Stock and bond markets opened the day shaken by the Drexel news, but for the most part recovered by day's end with small losses or small gains. 
An investment banker with close ties to the Bush Administration said, ''My sense of the view in the Government is that this is quite manageable.''
 
Greenspan Watching Situation
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been in close contact with E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a Fed official said, but he added that Mr. Corrigan was in charge of the operation.
Mr. Greenspan did not feel it was necessary to call a meeting of the other Fed governors, the official said, and none went to New York on official business today.
Mr. Corrigan issued a statement this morning saying that the New York Fed would ''carefully monitor'' the situation.
A former Fed official who talked with people in his old office today said the central bank was assuring commercial banks that were Drexel's creditors that they would eventually get back most of what they were owed and that the Fed would provide loans to tide them over if necessary.
Federal banking regulators said today that they were surprised that the Drexel situation had not created more problems in the financial markets. They said a review of Drexel's finances last year led them to believe that a crisis at the company could cause the capital markets to plunge.
Treasury officials met with their counterparts from the S.E.C. and the Federal Reserve today, but the Treasury's role was limited. A Treasury official said the department had been concerned about the effect of the Drexel collapse on individual investors but had determined that the problem was not a serious one.
 
Auditors Checking the Books
A team of auditors from the New York Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission has been poring over Drexel's books for several days.
An S.E.C. statement today said that ''detailed financial information submitted by Drexel Burnham Lambert'' indicated that for now the brokerage house had a positive balance sheet and remained in compliance with rules on money reserves.
To protect the assets of the brokerage subsidiary, the commission today barred it from transferring any more money to its parent company without regulators' approval.
Congress is not in session this week, but few lawmakers are likely to feel sorry for Drexel. ''I can't see anyone here lifting a finger to save them,'' said a senior Banking Committee staff assistant.
 
U.S. Faces Losses
The collapse of Drexel could cost the Government hundreds of millions of dollars. The Government holds about $1 billion in ''junk bonds'' that were in the portfolio of savings and loan institutions that have been taken over. In addition, according to a regulatory official, Federal insurance programs for banks and pension funds could be affected.
Nonetheless, there is no talk here about a bailout, like the ones that preserved the Chrysler and Lockheed Corporations, or an expensive Government restructuring operation like the one that followed the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Transportation Company.
''That's not on anyone's mind,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits on the House Banking and Budget Committee.
Mr. Schumer was one of those who expressed confidence in the regulators. ''The Fed,'' he said, ''is getting better and better at scrambling to make sure things are calm, that there is liquidity, that the market is preserved. That's the main goal of regulators, not whether companies survive or fail.''

HEADLINE: Government Shift on Data

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Commerce Department intends to abandon its computerized model of the economy, one of very few in the Government, and the monthly publication associated with it called Business Cycle Developments.
Allan H. Young, the director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, called the moves part of ''a restructuring of our program'' to better utilize resources at a time of budgetary restraint. But he said the department would continue to compile its index of leading indicators, which had been thought to be a candidate for elimination.
About 30 pages of data contained in Business Cycle Developments will be retained and published as part of the Survey of Current Business, another monthly publication, Mr. Young said. The changes, assuming Congressional approval, are to begin this spring. The 12 employees performing the affected work will be transferred to other duties.
The disappearance of the department's economic model, which was for internal Government use, will force various Federal agencies to obtain such services from the private sector.
It could not immediately be determined to what extent, if any, the Federal Reserve would make available its model of the economy to other bodies. Mr. Young described the two systems as ''basically equivalent.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Issues Rise Despite Drexel

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Reverberations from the financial crisis at Drexel Burnham Lambert were felt in the credit markets yesterday as prices of short-term Treasury securities moved higher and bond prices recorded gains of more than half a point.
Although huge questions remain unanswered about how Drexel's difficulties might affect the financial system, most firms said it was business as usual yesterday, with concern expressed but no signs of panic.
''This doesn't look like a financial catastrophe to me,'' one government bond trader said. ''In terms of liquidity in the money market and the Treasury market, there has been no substantive effect.'' 
William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, said, ''The markets seem to feel the fallout from Drexel will somehow be contained.''
Some people had been worried that the market might not be able to absorb Drexel's portfolio of Government securities, after the firm said it intended to liquidate its positions and subsequently dissolve its government securities unit, Drexel Burnham Government Securities Inc.
But market participants said those worries were unfounded, given the size of the Treasury market. $2 Billion No Trouble ''Even if they had $2 billion worth of securities in inventory, which wouldn't be the case, we have absorbed that amount in liquidations by savings and loan organizations with no trouble in two days,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Goverment Securities.
To get the best price, Drexel has reportedly asked Salomon Brothers to sell Drexel's portfolio of Government bonds and notes. The First Boston Corporation has reportedly been asked to act as agent in the sale of Drexel's portfolio of corporate bonds.
Finding a buyer for the government securities unit, which is a primary dealer in government securities, would have proved much more problematic.
''Who would want to buy it?'' the bond trader asked. ''There are already too many primary dealers.''
Primary dealers are dealers that make markets in Government securities. The Federal Reserve Board conducts its open market operations only through primary dealers.
Aside from the flight to short-term issues spurred by Drexel's troubles, a rebound in the German bond market also aided Treasury prices, dealers said.
Results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills reflect the desire of investors to move funds into safe, short-term investments.
 
Large Number of Bids
The bills were sold at an average discounted rate of 7.42 percent. More than $36 billion worth of bids were placed for the $9.5 billion worth of bills that were sold, the largest amount of bids since July 1987.
At the last one-year bill sale on Jan. 11, one-year bills were sold at an average rate of 7.21 percent, when interest rates were generally lower.
Noncompetitive bids, a good proxy of individual investor interest, totaled $1.3 billion, the largest such bid in more than a year.
Actively traded three- and six-month bills in the secondary market were also popular vehicles, and rates on those securities fell sharply.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.52 percent, down 11 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.53 percent.
Bond prices, which zigzagged in early trading, moved higher throughout the afternoon.
In late trading, the 8.50 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 3/8, up 19/32, to yield 8.37 percent.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered late yesterday at 97 27/32, up 10/32, to yield 8.26 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 7/8, up 5/ 32, to yield 8.19 percent.
 
'Junk' Decline Reversed
Elsewhere, bids on issues traded in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market fell early in the day after Drexel said it was contemplating a bankruptcy filing. Those declines were reversed later on, and junk bond traders said by the end of the day prices of most issues had risen one to two points.
''There are a lot of wild cards up in the air right now,'' said Frank V. Columbo, director of high-yield research at Dillon, Read & Company. ''But we are at a point where on a fundamental basis a lot of issues are attractive.''
Prices of actively traded issues the secondary corporate bond market rose by between 1/4 of a point and 3/8 of a point, dealers said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Rise Sharply On Stock Market Strength

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The price of copper futures surged yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange in reaction to the stock market's resilience amid reports that the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would file for Federal bankruptcy protection.
Copper futures settled 3 to 4.55 cents higher in New York, with the contract for delivery in February at $1.0545 a pound, its highest level in about four weeks.
The copper market has been taking its cues lately from the stock market as a forecaster of the nation's economic climate, and the activity yesterday demonstrated how closely the two markets are tied. 
Copper is used heavily by industry and in home and office construction, so the shape of the economy is perceived as an indicator of copper demand.
 
Lower at Opening
Copper futures opened lower, reflecting expectations that the troubles at Drexel would lead to a drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow did drop in early trading, falling about 19 points before buyers came in and pushed it up to nearly a 5-point gain by the close.
Analysts said the Dow's reverse sparked a turnaround in copper futures, which then soared as technical buy signals were tripped.
Randolph Donney, an analyst with the brokerage firm of Elders Futures Inc., said the Commerce Department's report of a 1.6 percent rise in retail sales last month also supported the copper market.
Precious metals futures were notably quieter after rallying sharply on Monday amid concerns about possible supply disruptions in South Africa.
 
Gold Off by $1.60
Gold futures finished $1.60 lower across the board on the Comex, with February at $417.60 an ounce; silver futures were 2.8 to 3.3 cents higher, with March at $5.333 an ounce; platinum futures settled $1.40 to $1.70 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with April at $522.50 an ounce.
Sugar futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange after a West German statistician, F. O. Licht, forecast record world production of 107.9 million metric tons for 1989-90.
Sugar futures finished 0.27 cent to 0.38 cent lower, with March at 14.56 cents a pound.
Petroleum futures ended mixed on the New York Merc in advance of the American Petroleum Institute's release of the weekly report on United States stocks.
In the report, which was released after the close, the institute said gasoline stocks rose by 7.5 million barrels last week, compared with market expectations ranging from one million to three million.
 
Crude Oil Stocks Fall
The Washington-based trade association said crude oil stocks fell about two million barrels, as expected, while supplies of petroleum distillates, including heating oil, rose by 870,000 barrels, compared with market expectations for an increase of up to three million barrels.
West Texas Intermediate crude settled 13 cents lower to 29 cents higher, with March down 13 cents at $21.90 a barrel; heating oil was 0.62 cent to 0.90 cent higher, with March at 56.85 cents a gallon.
The wheat market led a decline in grain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting improved crop weather for winter wheat and South American soybeans, and signs of disappointing foreign demand.
Wheat settled unchanged to 4 1/2 cents lower, with March at $3.85 1/2 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to a quarter-cent higher, with March at $2.41 3/4 a bushel; oats were unchanged to a half-cent higher, with March at $1.39 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 1 3/4 cents lower, with March at $5.64 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading As Gold Finishes Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher in quiet trading yesterday, although the prospect of a bankruptcy filing by the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. eroded some of its earlier gains.
Gold prices declined after a mixed performance overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $417.60 an ounce, down $1.60 from late on Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $417.50 an ounce, off $1.20. 
Currency dealers said technical factors were largely responsible for pushing the dollar higher. But they said an announcement from Drexel that it planned to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code depressed the dollar.
Linda McLaughlin, a trader with the Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the market was concerned that a Drexel filing would force the Federal Reserve to provide more liquidity in the market, which would lower interest rates.
Lower interest rates tend to depress a currency's value because they make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
In Tokyo, where trading ends as the business day in Europe begins, the dollar closed down 0.24 yen, at 144.48 yen. It was quoted at 144.25 yen in London, and at 144.35 yen in New York, down from 144.37 yen.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling brought $1.6907 an ounce in London, down from $1.6960 late on Monday, and $1.6895 in New York, down from $1.6918.
Against the West German mark, the dollar rose to 1.67625 marks from 1.6755 marks.
But the dollar closed lower against the yen in New York. It was quoted at 144.35 yen, down from 144.37 yen late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Monday, included: 1.4975 Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 5.7015 French francs, up from 5.6965; 1,245.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.00, and 1.20095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.20065.
In London, gold fell to $418.65 an ounce, from $419.50 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose 75 cents, to $419.75 an ounce.
Earlier, in Hong Kong trading, gold rose $5.17 an ounce to close at $419.58.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Koop's Idea For Alcohol Ban Debated

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
AGREEING with a group of communications professionals that ''advertising works,'' the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, yesterday called for a complete ban on broadcast beer and wine advertising to prevent alcohol abuse and drunken driving, particularly among young people.
But his recommendation, made at a meeting of marketing, advertising and media executives in New York, was strenuously opposed by a pair of prominent First Amendment lawyers, who said it smacked of the central planning that even Eastern European nations are abandoning.
In a spirited debate at the annual television workshop of the Association of National Advertisers, Dr. Koop and Bruce A. Silverglade, the director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group that supports limitations on alcoholic-beverage advertising, laid out the arguments for advertising restrictions that appear to be gaining adherents in Congress.
Opposing them were Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School and a former legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, and David H. Remes, a lawyer with Covington & Burling, a law firm in Washington that represents the Tobacco Institute. 
Last year, testifying to Congress before leaving his post, Dr. Koop recommended that a variety of restrictions be legislated against broadcast advertising of alcoholic beverages. Since leaving office, he has stepped up his attacks on the marketing of beer and wine, leading to his recommendation for a total ban.
Children, he said, see 100,000 beer commercials by the time they turn 18. He said that field research conducted by the National Commission on Drunk Driving had shown that these ads, in which drinking ''is visually associated with sex, patriotism, active life styles and health,'' have an impact on convincing young people to drink.
''The great majority of young people testified they began to drink because of the advertising,'' Dr. Koop said. ''Advertising works,'' he told the audience of communications professionals. ''You people know that better than anybody.''
But Professor Neuborne responded that it did not work that well, asserting that no studies had linked alcohol abuse to advertising. Staking out a position as a First Amendment absolutist, he attacked Dr. Koop's recommendation for an ad ban.
''We have commited ourselves to a society where the commands are cumulative and come up from the people, not from some central planners,'' he said. He called banning any form of advertising ''a mortal blow to the fundamental moral, political, social and economic structure of America.''
The debaters sparred most aggressively over the issue of tobacco and alcohol advertising directed at women and minorities, an issue highlighted recently by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's plans, later abandoned, to test-market a cigarette aimed at blacks called Uptown.
Professor Neuborne and Mr. Remes both attacked what they called the ''paternalism'' inherent in attempts to restrict advertising to women and minorities. ''For years, centuries, what we have done is suppressed the ability of blacks and women to compete equally in this society,'' Professor Neuborne said. ''I find it absolutely tragic that this same philosophy surfaces in the notion that blacks are not capable of making the same choices about products as others can.''
Mr. Silverglade, however, noted that the recent controversy over Uptown had been spurred by attacks on the marketing of tobacco to black Americans made by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, who is black.
Although a vocal critic of much food advertising and of alcoholic-beverage advertising, Mr. Silverglade took a conciliatory stance toward marketers and advertisers, maintaining that ''defending beer ads on television that have an impact on youth is bad public relations.''
He argued that the alcoholic-beverage industry should accept some restrictions on its advertising, such as not running television commercials until after 9 P.M. and mandatory anti-drinking commercials, in order to ward off more serious marketing and advertising problems.
As an example, Mr. Silverglade reminded the audience that the reduction of Federal Trade Commission oversight of advertising during the Reagan administration had impelled the state attorneys generals to police advertising more vigorously.
Dr. Koop said he would accept restrictions on alcohol advertising. ''But I'd like to start at the bargaining table,'' he said, ''with a total ban.''

HEADLINE: For Many Women, One Job Just Isn't Enough

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
Amid the great wave of women sweeping into the American labor force in recent years is a group whose numbers are increasing even faster: women who hold more than one job.
Government studies show that moonlighting among women is becoming as commonplace as it is among men, in both the percentage of working women and in absolute numbers. The figures for men, by contrast, have changed little in decades.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics found in a sampling of the work force last May that the number of women with two or more jobs had quintupled, from 636,000 in 1970 to 3.1 million in May, while the number of moonlighting men rose much more slowly, from 3.4 million to 4.1 million.
 
Staying Above Poverty Line
Reasons for the surge among women are enmeshed in social and economic shifts of the 1970's and 80's, economists and Government officials say. With jobs opening that were once denied them, some women moonlight to gather experience for new careers, and some do extra work to build up savings or pay debts. 
But as the last two decades have brought a record number of divorces and families maintained by single women, many of the women take two jobs because it is the only way to eke out a working-class life and stay above the poverty line.
The changes in family life are apparent in Harrisburg, a state capital with a diversified economy and unemployment near the national average of 5.3 percent. The Harrisburg area in central Pennsylvania, with a population of 591,000, resembles many older towns in its struggle to recapture a prosperity that has drifted to the suburbs.
Patricia Keammerer, 42 years old, is a recently divorced mother of a 10-year-old girl. To get by, she holds three jobs. She is an administrative assistant in the Harrisburg school system, works two nights a week and every other weekend at a fabric store, and from her home manages 41 homes that investors rent out. She moonlights, she says, so her daughter, Sara, can live in the same neighborhood and attend the same school.
Celeste Henderson, 40, is another single parent who must strive to make ends meet. She has been separated for years from a husband who has not provided child support for their three children - two daughters who married last year and a 17-year-old son, Rick, still at home. Ms. Henderson earns $11.50 an hour as a secretary at Amp Inc., a big electronics company. She says that is not enough to provide for Rick and herself. So on weekends and two nights a week, Ms. Henderson works as a saleswoman at a kitchenware store, for $5 an hour.
Another woman, Linda Jackman, 42, might seem fairly well off, but she doesn't think so. Divorced and without children, she makes $35,000 a year as an official in a state government job and $5,000 a year selling curtains part time at a branch of the J. C. Penney Company Inc. She says she moonlights to set aside money for a down payment on a house.
 
Women Face More Burdens
Sabina Mitnaul, 26, earns $16,500 as a secretary, and her husband receives a $10,000 stipend as a graduate student. They say that is not enough to cover expenses that include $395 a month for rent, $195 a month to pay off their 1986 Renault Alliance and credit-card payments. So Ms. Mitnaul works five nights a week from 6 to 11 as a data entry clerk, for $5.50 an hour.
The increase in moonlighting among women illustrates the larger role they are assuming in the economy. ''I put emphasis on the fact that women's contribution to families is increasing no matter how you measure it,'' said Heidi Hartmann, an economist who is the director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. ''More of them are economically responsible for families, while there has been no big change in men's economic responsibility.''
For men and women, the incentive to moonlight has risen as it has become harder for people to manage on one paycheck, Government statistics show. When increases in the cost of living are taken into account, hourly wages have slipped about 5 percent in 20 years.
Some families have managed to get ahead of inflation, because so many wives, like Ms. Mitnaul, have gone to work and so many single women with children, like Ms. Henderson and Ms. Keammerer, have taken two jobs. And typically, a woman who moonlights has to work more than a moonlighting man to earn the same pay. The average woman working full time is paid 70 percent as much as the average man working full time.
 
Who Moonlights and Why
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which surveys moonlighting occasionally, found in its sampling that the number of women with two or more jobs had jumped from 2.2 percent of 28.9 million working women in 1970, to 5.9 percent of 52.8 million who were working in May.
The number of men with two or more jobs rose in the 20 years from 3.4 million out of the 48.7 million men who were working in 1970 to 4.1 million of 64.3 million working men last year. The percentage of moonlighting among men declined, from 7 percent in 1970, to 6.4 in May.
For men and women, the survey showed that moonlighting was concentrated among people 25 to 44 years old, the most able-bodied and most likely to have children to support. These workers said they moonlighted more to make ends meet and pay debts than for other reasons, like saving.
The survey also showed that most moonlighting men were married, while most moonlighting women were divorced, separated, widowed or had never married.
Labor Department officials cautioned that the figures might understate the number of people holding more than one job. Many are paid in cash for their extra work and might not report those earnings to the Government, to avoid paying taxes on them.
 
There is a Typical Pattern
Ms. Henderson's chronicle of motherhood and moonlighting illustrates a typical pattern. ''I got married at 18,'' she said, ''and after about five years my husband and I started to do badly. So when we broke up, I went back to school and got an associate's degree in secretarial science from Harrisburg Community College.''
Thirteen years ago, Ms. Henderson started a secretarial job at Amp, and she began moonlighting then as well. ''When the kids were smaller,'' she said, ''I'd work around the Christmas season. For five years I did that.''
As Ms. Henderson sees it, she needed to moonlight not to make the payments on her car, currently a Dodge Omni, or to pay the rent on her duplex in a working-class section of Harrisburg, but to give her children the things their friends and classmates had. ''You have to see that they enjoy their youth,'' she said.
'When the kids got to be teen-agers,'' she said, ''their tastes got more expensive: bikes, clothes, records.'' She started working at a second job year-round, most recently in the kitchenware store. For a time, she worked every weeknight from 6 to 9:30, and on weekends. With just Rick left to support, Ms. Henderson cut back her moonlighting late last year.
''It was my responsibility to maintain my family,'' she said. ''Even today I don't have a bad feeling about it.''
Ms. Henderson's 22-year-old daughter, Marty Mayo, graduated with honors from a vocational high school, joined the Dauphin Deposit Bank here as a data entry clerk and has moved up to processing loans. Married to a man in the Army who is now stationed in Greece, Ms. Mayo also moonlights, working nights at a Rite Aid store while a cousin watches her 2-year-old daughter.
Ms. Mayo said that as a child, she that missed having her mother at home when she returned from school but that her mother saved her the embarrassment of looking poor to the other children. ''My mother worked so we could have nice things,'' she said.
 
Some Complain of the Stress
Some women who moonlight complain of the stress, but they also appear to be strivers. Many take courses to qualify for better jobs that might free them from moonlighting. Ms. Keammerer, for example, who holds three jobs, is studying to teach special education; Ms. Henderson is studying business administration, which could qualify her to move to Amp's accounting staff.
''Those who moonlight here,'' said Kenneth Washington, president of the Urban League of Harrisburg, ''are usually controlled types who will go out and seek another job when they have money problems and not go on welfare.'' They go to unusual lengths to mesh their work schedules with those of their children and to make the most of a modest income.
Ms. Keammerer, for example, works from 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. at the high school, finishing about 20 minutes before her daughter leaves school. She said she arises at 5:30 weekday mornings and wakes Sara at 6:15. She has to start work an hour before Sara starts school, so she takes Sara to her mother's home nearby.
''She gives her breakfast and makes sure she gets on the school bus,'' Ms. Keammerer said.
From 5 to 8 P.M. Tuesdays and Fridays and alternate weekends, she works at the Fabric Mart, a store within walking distance from her rented townhouse.
For the Mitnauls, strains arise from debt. They go home to South Carolina for a week over the Christmas holiday with gifts for their parents, her four siblings and his five.
For Ms. Mitnaul, as for many other women, moonlighting seems a necessary evil. She said she had been doing it off and on for four years: ''Once I get it into my system, I get used to it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Sues Longshoremen's Locals And 44 People, Citing Ties to Mob

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
The Federal Government yesterday sued six longshoremen's locals and 44 union officials and reputed organized-crime figures, including John Gotti, in an effort to end what the authorities say is Mafia domination of the New York and New Jersey waterfronts.
The civil suit seeks the removal of corrupt officials, the return of ill-gotten funds and court trusteeship of the six locals until new elections are held and mob influence is wiped out.
Federal prosecutors described the case, the latest in years of legal actions against the union, as a hybrid of a civil suit brought in 1988 to oust corrupt leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and an earlier attempt to rid organized crime from unions at the Fulton Fish Market.
 
'Embezzlement of Union Funds'
The United States Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, who announced the lawsuit at a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, said the suit ''seeks to remedy decades of organized-crime involvement in the New York and New Jersey waterfront.''
''The criminal acts include extortion, bribery, mail fraud, assault, murder and - the complaint alleges - year after year after year, extensive embezzlement of union funds,'' he said. 
If successful, Mr. Thornburgh said, the action would end a ''hidden tax'' paid by consumers in the higher prices for goods moved through the waterfront by shippers subject to extortion and kickback payments.
The suit was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan under RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. It would bar members of the Gambino and Genovese crime families and members of the Westies, a small, violent gang with Mafia ties, from any involvement in business or union activity around the harbor.
The defendants would not be subject to fines or jailing unless they violated the terms of an eventual court order.
Reached last night in Bal Harbor, Fla., where he was attending a union meeting, John Bowers, the union's president and a co-defendant in the suit, denied that the three New York locals, which he also heads, were subject to any organized crime influence.
''I can't believe it,'' he said of the suit, which he said he had not seen. ''All I know is, in the locals I have there's no mob influence and nobody's ever told me there's any mob influence.''
Mr. Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, called the suit a ''continuing vendetta to try to throw his name around.'' He added, ''This case is of no import to anyone.''
Decades of investigations have given the 90,000-member longshoremen's union almost mythical status as a focal point of Mafia involvement in labor. The organization was expelled from the American Federation of Labor for corruption in 1953.
A number of present and former union officials have been jailed for racketeering and other crimes. The position of General Organizer of the longshoremen, for example, was held by four reputed Mafia dons, three of them convicted in succession on racketeering and income tax charges, officials said. One of those convicted, Anthony Scotto, and the current general organizer, Anthony Pimpinella, were named in the civil suit yesterday.
 
Just Like a Puppet
Nonetheless, prosecutors said the reputed mob figures charged in the suit so fully controlled the union that they were able to replace jailed officials with others loyal to them. The union has kept some officials in place even after conviction, saying they were entitled to await the outcome of appeals.
''We know only too well that out of office does not mean out of power,'' said James Fox, the assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in charge of the New York office.
With increasing mechanization and the general decline of the shipping industry, membership in I.L.A. locals in the New York area has fallen from 27,750 in 1960 to 4,577 now. But waterfront commission and F.B.I. officials said the union has kept a stranglehold over shipping and stevedore companies and other waterfront business.
F.B.I. and Waterfront Commission investigators began to assemble the case three years ago, officials said. Some of the predicate acts with which the case tries to prove a pattern of mob involvement date back 20 years.
Filing of the suit was postponed to avoid confusion during Mr. Gotti's recent state trial on assault and conspiracy charges. Investigators said the suit would have been filed regardless of the outcome of Mr. Gotti's recent trial. The Government's brief in the union case cites surveillance tapes entered in the state trial as ''the most compelling evidence of the Gambino family's domination'' of the union's largest affiliate, Local 1814 in Brooklyn.
After Mr. Gotti's acquittal last week, the office of the United States Attorney in Manhattan held off filing the suit to coincide with a visit yesterday by Mr. Thornburgh to New York, a senior law-enforcement official said. #12th Civil RICO Case The case filed yesterday is the 12th to use civil provisions of the RICO statute against organized crime. In one such case, a court appointed trustee was named in 1986 to take over Local 560 of the teamsters union in Union City, N.J. When a court supervised election was held in December 1988, the members returned the union to associates of the late Anthony (Tony Pro) Provenzano, a convicted racketeer.
A more sweeping action by the Justice Department in 1988 sought to oust the leadership of the 1.7-million-member teamsters international. The case was settled last March when the union agreed to the naming of a court-appointed administrator and investigators to control union discipline, corruption and the union's elections in 1991.
In the suit yesterday, the Government opted not to prosecute the union's international organization, but instead to focus on a specific area.
''We attempt here to put an entire economic marketplace effectively under court supervision,'' said Otto G. Obermaier, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
 
A Difficult Task Ahead
In that, legal experts likened the 1987 action taken against mob involvement in labor at the Fulton Fish Market. Although the Government failed in January 1989 to win a court takeover of the major union at the market, an outside administrator was left in place to guard against organized crime activity. A Federal court said the Government had failed to prove that the union's top two leaders were controlled by the Genovese crime family.
Prosecutors yesterday admitted that they face a difficult task. Compared to the 1988 international teamsters case, in which the Government set out to prove the inaction of union leaders on evidence of corruption by the officials of various locals, the waterfront suit would require far stronger proof, tying organized-crime figures to union activities.
''Nobody is saying that this is going to go our way,'' Mr. Fox said. ''It's just a new way to use the RICO statute to try to separate the mob from the unions.''
The suit asserts that before and during Mr. Gotti's leadership, the Gambino family has controlled Local 814 in Brooklyn and, through the Westies and their leader, James Coonan, have controlled Locals 1809, 824 and 1909 on the West Side of Manhattan. The Genovese family, reputedly controlled by Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno, dominates Locals 1804-1 of North Bergen, N.J., and 1588 of Bayonne, N.J., the suit contends.
Of the 32 present or former union officials named as defendants, 21 were identified in the suit as members or associates of organized crime groups. Another 12 reputed mob members also were named, along with several waterfront businesses cited solely for purposes of recovering illicit gains.

HEADLINE: Who's Environment Czar, E.P.A.'s Chief or Sununu?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
As the nation's defense recedes as an overriding issue and the environment becomes a more important one for Republican candidates, the White House chief of staff's role is being watched with alarm by many environmentalists and with concern by some Republican strategists and officials.
Although unwilling to criticize President Bush publicly, these Republicans voice concern that with important decisions looming on offshore drilling and the Clean Air Act, Mr. Bush seems to be relying increasingly on the advice of John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, who is a mechanical engineer by training and an environmental skeptic by temperament.
Environmental lobbyists and organization leaders also say they are alarmed because Mr. Sununu has asserted his influence at the expense of William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose appointment was hailed as a sign that Mr. Bush was serious about his campaign pledge to be ''the environmental President.''
 
Political Motives Charged
Mr. Sununu, who is strongly supported by the business wing of his party and by many senior aides, dismisses criticism of his role as ''pure politics,'' and says the environmental movement is conducting an orchestrated offensive to scuttle Mr. Bush's portrayal of himself as an environmentalist.
''The President has a commitment to moving forward on the environment,'' Mr. Sununu said, ''but he wants to do it in such a way that we don't make irreversible moves without knowing the benefits and negative impacts of each move.'' 
Both Mr. Sununu and Mr. Reilly say there is no personal animosity between them, but people familiar with the relationship say it is a setup for conflict.
Mr. Sununu treats Mr. Reilly cordially, officials say, but fears that the E.P.A. Administrator, a former head of the World Wildlife Fund and the Conservation Foundation, could be influenced by advocates of extreme positions, both from environmental groups and from inside his agency.
Mr. Reilly has taken his licks from Mr. Sununu on the theory that as long as he has Mr. Bush's ear, he should get as much as he can for his environmental constituency. Mr. Reilly is also said by officials close to him to fear that Mr. Sununu, if his blunt intrusions go unchecked, could tarnish Mr. Bush's chances for a distinguished environmental record.
Those close to Mr. Reilly say he worries that the responsibility for making good on Mr. Bush's campaign promises rests on his shoulders. But many environmentalists suggest that Mr. Reilly runs the risk of seeming to be a patsy for Mr. Sununu if he mistakes access for influence.
Mr. Reilly was bested twice by Mr. Sununu last week, first when the chief of staff softened a Presidential speech on global warming and later when he weakened an agreement between the environmental agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to protect wetlands.
Mr. Reilly said that he had come out of the scrapes ''O.K.'' and that the Administration was moving forward on its goals, despite an outcry from many environmentalists and his old allies denouncing Mr. Sununu as ''Dr. No'' and ''the new James Watt,'' referring to Ronald Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior.
 
List of Gains Cited
''The Bush team has put E.P.A. into the starting lineup and we frequently get hits,'' he said. ''In other Administrations, the agency has been a bench warmer.''
As ''hits,'' Mr. Reilly's aides point to the phasing-out of chlorofluorocarbons, air pollutants thought to damage the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere; a ban on asbestos, which is linked to cancer; additional enforcement officers for hazardous waste cleanup; the 57 percent increase in the 1991 budget for global warming research, and the 12 percent increase in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget.
They also say Mr. Reilly's achievements should be viewed in comparison with the record of the Reagan Administration, rather than in the context of ''rhetorical battles'' with Mr. Sununu that represent minor setbacks.
Indeed, worried that President Bush might be offended by news reports of friction on the global warming issue, Mr. Reilly made a point of riding in the limousine with the President when he went to make his speech on the subject last week, White House officials said. Mr. Sununu was in the car as well and the two men assured Mr. Bush they were both happy with the speech, which was denounced by many environmentalists and by scientists and diplomats from Europe as too tepid.
Many White House officials support Mr. Sununu, saying he needs to keep an eye on Mr. Reilly. One official said Mr. Reilly was a captive of his bureaucracy.
In a column in The Washington Post today, Rowland Evans and Robert Novak suggested that Administration officials are growing more suspicious that Mr. Reilly may be privately feeding complaints in the press that the President has scaled back on environmental commitments.
''With Reilly soon to get Cabinet status, he is seen by colleagues as the enemy within - the Trojan horse of an environmental movement determined to make up for the lost Reagan years,'' the columnists wrote.
 
Environmentalists' Fears
Mr. Reilly's longtime supporters among the environmentalists, however, disagree and say they are beginning to fear that he has been too easily subdued. They fret that Mr. Sununu has tied Mr. Reilly's hands and that the environmental chief has become more concerned with his White House access and the planned Cabinet status for his job than with fiercely battling for the cause.
Mr. Reilly is trying to reassure his friends that despite the dustups with Mr. Sununu, he believes that the President has his heart is in the right place, as one official close to Mr. Reilly put it, and that Mr. Bush is the sort of man who actually asks how the Brazilian rain forests are doing.
''One way of looking at it is that it is flattering to have the chief of staff's attention,'' said an E.P.A. official enjoying what he called ''the rarefied air'' of access to the highest levels of the Administration.
Administration supporters of Mr. Reilly say he has the will and charm to counteract Mr. Sununu's influence with the President. They say that he maneuvered his way into the trip last summer to the Paris economic summit conference, where he grew much closer to Mr. Bush, a fellow Yale University graduate, and that the President and Mrs. Bush have taken Mr. Reilly and his wife to the theater.
White House officials insist the clash between Mr. Sununu and Mr. Reilly is gentlemanly and rooted in their differing perspectives.
Officials say that as a veteran of the environmental movement, Mr. Reilly fears that Mr. Sununu will tarnish Mr. Bush's credentials if he holds sway too forcefully. They say Mr. Sununu believes that Mr. Reilly is a well-intentioned and loyal administrator who deserves a fair chance to influence the President but that it is his mission to prevent both Mr. Bush and Mr. Reilly from being led astray by extremists.
Explaining why he is now helping formulate policy rather than merely executing it, Mr. Sununu said he had a deep distrust of the E.P.A. bureaucrats ''who forget that it is Bill Reilly and the President who make policy, not some folks deep down within the system who are not answerable to the American public.''
Mr. Sununu said that when advisers are not in consensus on a policy matter, he does not prevent Mr. Reilly or other Cabinet officials from meeting Mr. Bush individually if they want to register a dissenting opinion.
 
Bush May Like the Conflict
As a former Texas oil man, Mr. Bush wants to pay attention to economic consequences. He may also prefer the mild conflicts between the men. He likes having advisers on one side appealing to his moderate, good-government impulses and another side appealing to his hardball political side. That way, the President can split the difference and feel that he has satisfied his decent impulses while protecting his conservative political base.
''Sununu's the lightning rod so that the President can stay above the fray,'' a White House official said.
Some environmentalists said they took as another bad omen this week the White House withdrawal of the appointment of a respected lawyer, Dan Reicher, as deputy general counsel of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
Although the chairman of the council, Michael Deland, took responsibility for the withdrawal, saying he had not realized what a ''persistent critic'' of the Administration Mr. Reicher was, the environmentalists suggested that White House pressure had been brought to bear, and that the affair was another example of Mr. Sununu's influence with the President.
The chief of staff made his stand on the environment clear from the beginning. After the worst oil spill in the nation's history, in Valdez, Alaska, last March, Mr. Sununu chided the press for focusing on the oil that was spilled rather than ''the bulk of the oil that was kept on the ship.''
 
A Worry for Republicans
But while Mr. Sununu's position may appeal to the traditional business wing of the Republican Party, the party is also working to maintain its newfound appeal on an issue that has become increasingly important to younger voters. Some party analysts assert that while Mr. Sununu sees himself as protecting the President from extreme treaties or regulations his success may squander hard-won gains among these voters.
Administration officials say Mr. Sununu enjoys nothing more than using his engineering and computer expertise to debunk the predictions of imperfect computer models that forecast a severe threat from global warming.
The traditional role of the chief of staff is as a nonideological coordinator and honest broker for the presentation of different views to the President and to execute the President's decisions.
But by becoming a policy formulator with strong conservative views on issues like abortion and the environment, Mr. Sununu may be setting himself up as someone ''you have to get on your side,'' as one Bush insider put it.
J. Michael McCloskey, the chairman of the Sierra Club, said: ''What is really unfair is that Bush has put in a person as his chief of staff who is not a neutral member of the Administration on enviromental issues. He is the most aggressive advocate of an extreme position.''
Mr. Sununu is unrepentent. ''Folks inside the White House think I'm being constructive,'' he said, ''so it doesn't matter what the perception is on the outside.''

Sununu, White House chief of staff, left, is watched with alarm by many environmentalists.
