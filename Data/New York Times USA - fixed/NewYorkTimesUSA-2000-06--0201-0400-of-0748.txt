HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MIRCROSOFT: THE APPEAL;
After a Rout, Still Fighting

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
With his final order yesterday in the Microsoft antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said yes to the government one more time. He has agreed with the government, almost without qualification, on the facts of the case, on the law and now on the harsh remedy of splitting the company in two.
In Judge Jackson's Federal District Court, the result has been not just a defeat for Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal contest but a judicial ratification of the government's case. 
 Yet the two-year-old case is far from over. And with a year or two of appeals ahead, the chances of Microsoft's ever being broken up are uncertain. Microsoft will try to reverse every element in Judge Jackson's ruling that the company is a monopoly that has repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, stifling software competition and innovation.
The odds against Microsoft's winning outright on appeal are extremely high, according to antitrust experts. But they say that there are legally vulnerable points in the judge's ruling that if reversed on appeal might well enable the company to avoid the drastic sanction Judge Jackson has now endorsed.
"Microsoft is going to try to whittle away at the judge's ruling on appeal," said Andrew I. Gavil, professor at the Howard University law school. "And once you get an incremental erosion of the case, you erode the power of the argument for a breakup as well."
In his order yesterday, Judge Jackson acknowledged that the federal appeals court or the Supreme Court, or both, might disagree with some of his work. Two weeks ago, he surprised both sides in the case and most legal experts when he abruptly ended the court proceedings without a further round of hearings on the government's plan to split Microsoft in two and require a series of curbs on its business conduct.
In his order, Judge Jackson explained that he had moved quickly because, if his findings or legal conclusions are overruled, a higher court might decide on its own remedies or send the case back to him.
After noting that Microsoft contends it will be vindicated on appeal, he wrote: "The court is well aware that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds to a similar view. It is time to put that assertion to the test."
So Judge Jackson chose this approach as a way to speed along a case of national economic importance. The alternative, he decided, would be to risk going through two time-consuming sets of hearings on remedies -- one based on his legal ruling and one based on a case perhaps scaled back on appeal.
Still, some antitrust experts say that simply accepting the remedies plan from the Justice Department and states suing Microsoft could prove to be a mistake.
"If he's assuming that this case is probably coming back to him anyway, I think that is a safe assumption," said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school. "But the danger of his approach is that it increases the chances it will come back to him."
Microsoft's prime target on appeal, antitrust experts say, will be the judge's ruling that it illegally tied its Internet browser to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, which handles the basic operations on 85 percent of all PC's.
To Microsoft, the tying charge is the heart of the case. If that ruling is upheld on appeal, Microsoft sees a threat to its corporate way of life -- its ability to add new software features to its operating system, as it has repeatedly over the years.
In several rounds of settlement talks with the government, Microsoft was willing to change some of its practices, but it stood firm on not allowing any tampering with Windows or letting personal computer makers pick and choose from an ala carte menu of Windows features.
To Microsoft, this stance is not arrogance or hubris -- or an antitrust violation, for that matter -- but a stand of principle.
"This case, in our view, is about whether we are free to improve our products and whether we can protect the integrity of our most important product, Windows," said William Neukom, senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft.
Microsoft has argued that Web browsing software should not be considered as a separate product but as a feature in the ever-evolving Windows operating system.
The government contended, and Judge Jackson ruled, that Microsoft had illegally tied its Internet browser, a separate product, to Windows to thwart competition and illegally protect its monopoly. To accept Microsoft's argument, the government said, would amount to granting the dominant software maker an exemption from broad swaths of the nation's antitrust laws.
But antitrust experts note that product-tying charges are tricky, especially when dealing with software, in which the products are rendered in the 1's and 0's of programming code and product boundaries often blur. And a federal appeals court in June 1998 sided with Microsoft in a separate but related case. That court said Microsoft had the right to fold a browser into its operating system as long as it could make a "plausible claim" of consumer benefit.
In addition to the tying charge, Microsoft, antitrust experts say, stands a good chance of getting a reversal on the court's finding that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape Communications to divide the browser market between them. The collusion offer, Judge Jackson ruled, was made during a meeting between executives of Microsoft and Netscape, the commercial pioneer in Internet browsers, in June 1995.
The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts say, is fairly high. The crucial case, they say, occurred in 1984 and involved airline executives talking about jointly raising fares in a conversation that was tape-recorded. Whether the meeting notes, e-mail messages and conflicting witness testimony about the Microsoft-Netscape meeting are evidence that reaches the standard of "clearly unequivocal," established in the 1984 case, is open to question, experts say.
Microsoft is also expected to argue that much of the rest of the case -- mainly contracts and practices that the court found to be a "pattern of anticompetitive behavior" -- is merely evidence of a company competing aggressively in a dynamic industry, not of an economic outlaw.
"We think this ruling is very vulnerable on appeal," Mr. Neukom said. "We're in the middle innings of a contest that won't be over for another year or two. And the most critical innings are yet to come."
Yet antitrust experts say that the steepest uphill climb for Microsoft on appeal will be to overturn Judge Jackson's determination that the company engaged in an array of illegal acts to protect its monopoly, wielding its market power like a club to bully industry partners and rivals.
"It's the whole gestalt that is a real problem for Microsoft -- the court's finding that these are bad guys, who repeatedly acted to stifle competition and not for any efficiency reasons," said Richard Steuer, an antitrust specialist and a partner at Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler. "That is a lot harder for an appeals court to overturn."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Where the Case Goes Next"
In his ruling against Microsoft yesterday, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson stayed his order to break up the company, but not his restrictions on its business practices. Microsoft will seek a stay of the entire ruling while it appeals the overall case.
 
U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
 
The Justice Department, with Judge Jackson's encourage-ment, intends to take the case directly to the Supreme Court for review.
 
Microsoft wants the matter to go to the Court of Appeals, which ruled in its favor in a related case two years ago.
 
U.S. SUPREME COURT
If the court takes the case, it is likely to rule by June of next year, the end of its next term.
 
The Supreme Court may decide not to take the case, sending it to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals.
 
U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
The first question is whether the court will stay Judge Jackson's ruling. If it does, it would be likely to do so quickly.
 
The full appeal could last as long as two years. The court could uphold the verdict, or overturn it in full or in part. Whatever the court decides is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.
 
In any event, the case will return to Judge Jackson, either to oversee implementation of the remedy or to amend it according to the higher court's findings.
 
IF THE JUDGE'S RULING IS NOT STAYED -- A long and detailed list of restrictions on the company's conduct will take effect on Sept. 7. Microsoft will also have to file a detailed plan for breaking up the company by Oct. 7.
 
IF APPEAL FAILS -- Microsoft must complete the breakup and begin life as two separate and competing companies within one year of the date of the appeals ruling.

THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE PLANS 'PROSPERITY TOUR'
Vice President Al Gore plans a "progress and prosperity tour" next week in which he will propose protecting Medicare by taking it off-budget, meaning he would remove it from annual budget fights. "It's the next logical step to ensuring our long-term security," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. "What Al Gore is going to be doing next week is talking about the choices that we face in terms of continuing economic strength." In contrast to President Clinton's "poverty tour" last year, the vice president's tour is intended to highlight the economic successes of the last eight years -- and by extension associate Mr. Gore with that success. The vice president said tonight at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles, "progress and prosperity ought to be expected in this country." Mr. Gore's fly-around will include several of the crucial battleground states across the Rust Belt, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Advisers said the tour was part of a long-planned strategy to emphasize the positive and optimistic aspects of Mr. Gore's candidacy. It is to coincide with the release of a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign this week to continue to redefine Mr. Gore's image. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT) 

THE STATES
 
CHALLENGE IN MASSACHUSETTS
Jack E. Robinson, the Republican challenger to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, says reports of his campaign's demise have been greatly exaggerated. It looked unlikely for a while that Mr. Robinson would succeed in gathering the 10,000 signatures of voters he needed by Tuesday to qualify for the race. The Massachusetts secretary of state's office credited him with 10,139 signatures before the deadline passed, so Mr. Robinson, an entrepreneur, is still in the running. But he still faces another major obstacle: overcoming the disclosures about his personal life, including bad relations with women and traffic problems. Carey Goldberg (NYT)
 
THE REPUBLICANS
 
FORD OFFERS BUSH ADVICE
Former President Gerald R. Ford says Gov. George W. Bush should consider picking an abortion-rights advocate as his running mate. Such a choice, he contends, could be the difference between winning and losing a close race. "We need a team that reflects the broadest possible spectrum of the Republican philosophy, which means somebody who is pro-choice, for example, or at least is more so than some Republicans would like," Mr. Ford said Monday in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. "To me, freedom means nothing if not the freedom to choose," he said. "As Republicans, as conservatives, we regard life as very, very sacred. That's why we believe the individual conscience and the right to choose is a major, major factor in how we should live and how our country should survive." (AP)

HEADLINE: LIVING IN A NUTSHELL;
Living Large In Little Apple

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MIHM 

 BODY:
A LOT of New Yorkers live in small spaces, some smaller than others. My own, for example, measures 250 square feet as the crow walks. Over time, I've become obsessed with making the most of it, getting up at odd hours to stack file cabinets and weed my belongings, even removing doors from hinges. Today, within easy reach, I also have a sofa, a desk, two chairs, three bureaus and an 18-pound cat named Gus, who takes up more than his fair share of the bed.
Suburbanites with toolsheds bigger than my apartment may have good reason to wonder whether New Yorkers like me are a bit crazy. But I'm not alone, as I found out when I went in search of other small-apartment lovers in Manhattan. 
 While financial concerns force many New Yorkers to cling to small quarters, some actually savor living in the human equivalent of a beehive. Those I met could have moved long ago into much more spacious housing outside the city; the average single-family American home, after all, provides 835 square feet of living space a person, up from 477 square feet 30 years ago, according to the United States Census.
The city's housing code certainly doesn't coddle the claustrophobic. Section D26-33.03, adopted in 1967, holds that every apartment dweller is entitled to 80 square feet of so-called livable space -- not much bigger than a king-size bed. Though bathrooms aren't figured in, that's still less than the 94 square feet allotted to well-behaved inmates at Attica. Yet, Manhattan seems destined for compact living, and downsizing here has become almost a trend. Costas Kondylis, a well-known architect of residential buildings, said that in New York in the 1980's "typically, one-bedrooms used to be 750 square feet." He added, "Now on average they are 640, even 625 square feet."
The first stop in my search was the 400-square-foot Greenwich Village apartment of Zabel Meshejian. The sign in the elevator put me in the right mood. "Maximum occupancy 6 people," it read, surely a joke given that it measures less than 2 feet by 2 feet.
Ms. Meshejian works by day as a food stylist, staging photographs for companies like Godiva, Red Lobster and Nabisco. At night, in a galley kitchen, she cooks for herself, drawing from a floor-to-ceiling collection of pots, pans and condiments. "I have spices for any kind of cuisine," Ms. Meshejian said, pointing to wooden cabinets and boxes overflowing with herbs and bottles of oils. "Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Mediterranean. They're all here."
But never mind the challenge of preparing dinner in a closet. It turns out that Ms. Meshejian is also a frustrated gardener, and her apartment seemingly houses more flowerpots than a professional greenhouse. "I started with one plant, and all of a sudden I had hundreds," she said. Tiers of glass shelves in three southern-facing windows catch the afternoon sun, all filled with her favorite miniature plants: euphorbias, haworthias and lithops, kept small and root bound.
Yet, the apartment, shared with a 19-year-old cat named Munchkin, doesn't seem crowded, just cozy. Antique bureaus, wooden boxes and cookbooks line the perimeter of the living room, while odds and ends -- a parasol, some baskets, family photographs -- take up the rest of the wall space. Everything has a place, even Munchkin, who spends his days dozing in a basket.
"I have this recurring dream that I go through my closet and discover another room," Ms. Meshejian said. Not that she would ever abandon her apartment of 22 years, which is perfectly positioned across the street from a community garden, where she tends her outdoor plants. Indeed, if there's anything besides economics that keeps people chained to small apartments, it's location.
For Doris Tobias, it all comes down to breezy views of the East River and the United Nations. She lives in a one-bedroom with a little less than 700 square feet and a kitchen the size of a bathtub, not all that unusual -- except that Ms. Tobias happens to be a cookbook author. ("The Golden Lemon," published in 1979, is being reissued by iUniverse, and Ms. Tobias is the co-author, with Jean-Paul Picot, of "La Bonne Soupe Cookbook" from Macmillan.) She is preparing her next book, on "salads that start the meal and salads that are the meal," in the same small space.
"People love to have grandiose, grand-scale kitchens," she said, wrinkling her nose. "It's an act of one-upmanship. They're not for use; they're showy."
The alcove that passes for her kitchen houses a standard refrigerator; a diminutive four-burner stove; a Frigidaire minidishwasher; a convection oven barely big enough for an eight-pound turkey; and some wooden cabinets that spill into the living room. A few choice pots and utensils hang at arm's length; basil and rosemary sit in the windowsill, swaying in the breeze.
"You have to clean up as you go," Ms. Tobias added. She not only washes as she cooks, but also prepares parts of the meal ahead of time, running her kitchen like a miniature military barracks. "Tidiness is space," she said. "You have to work and clean, work and clean."
Will she ever move, get a bigger kitchen? Not likely: she's too attached to the neighborhood, where she has lived since 1979. "Things have changed," she said wistfully. "But the river is still there, rolling along."
Living small isn't for everyone, of course, and it hasn't worked so well for Richard Mason, a short cherubic man who moved into his 15-by-15-foot studio apartment in 1957, when he was 30. At first, he said, the size of the place didn't matter. He and his friends "had great parties," he continued, adding, "We had 25 people over at one time."
Later, he acquired a house on Long Island near Hofstra University, where he taught theater, and he used the apartment only on weekends. But when he retired, he moved back. Now, "It's really a challenge to live here," he said, pointing to shelves that cling like barnacles to every wall. "There's not a square inch that your eye will rest on that I actually haven't done something to."
Despite such efforts, as he sees it, he needs professional design help. "For years now I've been trying to neaten this place," he said, but it is always "on the threshold of continuing chaos."
Some savor the chaos. Surprisingly, I found that includes families. My final stop was at the home of Ursula and Nilo Mitra, who live on Pomander Walk, a 1920's gated community of miniature Tudor row houses lining a blocklong pedestrians-only alley that runs from 94th Street to 95th Street between Broadway and West End Avenue. Their 600-square-foot apartment on a single floor has two tiny bedrooms, with a home office in the parents' room and a library lining their son's bedroom walls. There is a modest dining/living room area and a kitchenette wedged into a walk-in closet.
The Mitras, who arrived from separate dwellings a few years ago, are the first to raise a child on Pomander Walk in more than 20 years. Ms. Mitra works as bookbinder; her husband, who has a doctorate in particle physics, works for Ericsson, which makes cell phones. Their son, Amitav, is 2 and will be joined by a baby sister in October. Two cats (Samantha and Nimbus), plus a sometime nanny, round out the household.
"Dinner is crazy around here," Mrs. Mitra said. And privacy is practically nonexistent. "There are no real borders in this place, except maybe our bedroom," she said. And that doubles as an office, with a hardwood partition the couple designed themselves. The floor-to-ceiling unit contains a clothes closet, a file cabinet, several bookshelves and drawers for linens. Another storage unit, also of their own design, wraps around one of the windows, providing space for china and a collection of vases.
The Mitras store bulk purchases of diapers, toilet paper and canned goods off-site in Ms. Mitra's studio in Hoboken. When they get restless, there is always Central Park. "We spend half of every day out there,' Mrs. Mitra said. "Amitav loves the sandbox."
The Mitras can afford to move out, but they are attached to their community And they are inured. Both grew up in small spaces: Mr. Mitra in India, where extended families make privacy a luxury; Mrs. Mitra, in an apartment in Germany with three siblings. "My father was the only one who had a private room," she said, recalling his study.
As she sees it, small is good for children -- and parents. In big suburban homes, she said, "the child is often in the farthest corner of the house."
"Far too much responsibility is shifted away from the parents and put elsewhere," she added. "Part of being responsible is being there and seeing what's going on with your kid."
She laughed. "That is not a problem in a place like this."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT;
Gates's Statement: The First Day of the Rest of the Case

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the opening statement by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, at a news conference yesterday in Redmond, Wash., as recorded by The New York Times:
I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of the rest of your life. I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case. 
 The central issue here is a disagreement between ourselves and the Department of Justice over whether we should have been allowed to support the Internet inside Microsoft Windows. Our inclusion of that support in an integrated way did nothing to exclude Netscape or any other competitor from distributing and improving their technology. In fact, as the court found, Netscape distributed over 160 million copies of its browser in 1998 alone.
The government's position here on the specific of the browser and on the general question of improving products really flies in the face of the kind of improvements that have benefited consumers from innovation coming out of the technology industry. So today's ruling really represents an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America. This ruling would provide that the Internet support in Windows could never be enhanced, it could never be updated to new standards whether they relate to privacy or XML or any other consumer needs. This ruling says to creators of intellectual property that the government can take away what you created if it turns out to be too popular.
We will be exercising our right to appeal this decision, and we're confident the judicial system will overturn today's ruling. We will also seek a stay of this order so the appeal can move forward without any unnecessary harm to Microsoft and to consumers through the delay or interference with our work on new products.
I want to make it clear that the Microsoft team worked very hard to try and settle the issues in this case without the need for additional litigation. I also want to make sure that people understand that during the appeal we'll continue to do what we do best, which is building new software. We have many reasons to be confident in our appeal. For example, the ruling is directly inconsistent, as the district court acknowledges, with the appeals court ruling on exactly this topic that was made earlier.
Also, it's an unreasonable thing to call to break up Microsoft and create these regulatory provisions about how software should be defined. I also think if you just step back from this and look at the paradigm shifts taking place today and the very intense competition in our business, what's being said today flies in the face of the innovation and low prices that consumers are seeing every day, low prices that really arise out of the PC industry and the values that we brought as one of the companies that really fostered the entire PC phenomenon.
So we have strong legal, factual and procedural arguments. The court adopted the government's plan to break up and regulate Microsoft without a single day of testimony. Microsoft asked for a reasonable opportunity to respond to the government's unprecedented plan, but we were denied that right.
Here at Microsoft we've assembled a world-class team. For 25 years, that team has brought widespread benefits to the economy and to consumers. We have very exciting plans for that team including things like a breakthrough user interface that involves handwriting and speech recognition. These are efforts that can only be done by a large company with a total focus on taking its R&D and moving those into products. Keeping our team together as one Microsoft is critical to our efforts.
The values that have guided our efforts throughout our entire history include competing hard, but competing fairly; listening to customers and innovating to meet their needs; and partnering with literally thousands of companies in the hardware, software and services businesses to make our vision of low-cost computing a reality and a reality that has moved forward faster than any sector of the economy. We've got a lot of great new ideas and great new products we're working on for the months and years ahead. In particular we're very excited about the vision of a next generation of services delivered through the Internet. The Internet, as powerful as it is today, can be made easier and far more effective for both consumers and businesses.
We recognize that as an industry leader we have grave responsibilities in working inside our business. And we accept that. While we disagree with the government on this specific issue, I want to make clear that we respect the role of government and our legal and economic system. And we will, of course, abide by any final judgments reached in this case. We continue to work on a very positive basis with federal and state officials. In fact, just yesterday I was in Washington, D.C., discussing with a great number of legislators issues like improving technology in education, bridging the digital divide and important legislation like that upcoming digital signature bill.
So in conclusion, today is the start of a new phase of this case, a phase where we'll get review by a higher court. We're confident that the courts will overturn what's happened at the district level. And as the legal team works to resolve this, we're going to focus our energy on building great software for all our customers.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Untrained but Inspired, Hands Dreamed in Stone

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
In 1941 Edward Weston photographed the grassy yard in Nashville where the sculptor William Edmondson (1874-1951) carved and displayed his work. Judging from the pictures, it was an enchanted ground.
The limestone sculptures, cut from castoff blocks, look almost translucent under the sun. Dozens of figures -- celestial, human, animal -- seem to be enacting a kind of epic folk opera: score by Scott Joplin, libretto by Aesop, choreography by the great master dancers of Yorubaland. 
 Some hint of this effect can be found in "The Art of William Edmondson," an exhibition organized by the Cheekwood Museum of Art in Nashville and now at the Museum of American Folk Art. Nearly 45 of Edmonson's sculptures are shown against a blowup of one of Weston's pictures, along with photographs of the sculptor by Consuelo Kanaga and Louise Dahl-Wolfe.
As one sees at a glance, all creatures, lowly and exalted -- hoot owls and angels, preachers and politicians, athlete-heroes and back-porch neighbors -- found their way into Edmondson's work from the time he carved his first stone piece in 1931. He was 59 and recently retired from 24 years as a janitor at Nashville Woman's Hospital. His real career was just beginning.
During the next 17 years, using scrap stone and a railroad spike and a hammer as tools, he produced hundreds of sculptures, most of them figurative, others near-abstract, as tombstones and garden ornaments for the city African-Americans.
Many of the images were religious, and specifically biblical. The sisters Martha and Mary appear as plump twins tucked under a vigorously chiseled coverlet, and Eve as a strapping lass in a fig-leaf miniskirt. The crucified Jesus is an infantile figure in a diaper, something like the early Christian Christ, floating against the cross, hands held high in a gesture of praise and release.
There's also a church-shaped Noah's ark that Edmondson originally placed on a high base made of stone columns. The base, visible in photographs but now lost, probably represented Mount Ararat, where the ark perched safe and dry after the floods had receded, and for which Nashville's first black cemetery was named.
Edmondson said the ideas for his sculptures were heaven sent, delivered in visions or dreams. Traditional artists in Africa and India say the same thing. It's another way of talking about what some of us refer to as inspiration.
Wherever they came from, angels abound in his work. One in the show has big hair, a solemn face, wings like cupboard doors, and a pocketbook clutched to her side. The subtle distinctions in texture made among her hair, flesh and wings are an Edmondson hallmark and a source of intense optical pleasure in his art.
Despite his otherworldly subjects, this artist was no recluse saint. He was up on the news and paid tribute to celebrities of the day, from Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, to Eleanor Roosevelt, who visited Nashville in 1934. And his own friends and neighbors are well represented in his work.
Here one encounters classic types: a preacher with a Sharptonesque coif, a buttoned-up schoolmarm, a pretty ingenue in a squared-off cape. But Edmondson seems to have been close to some of his subjects, like the affectionate couple in "Bess and Joe," and he warmed their figures with closely observed details: Joe is shown in a rakish snap-brim cap; Bess's legs peek, slim and shapely, from beneath her lifted skirt.
Particularly expressive are carvings of animals. Some are naturalistic: an alert squirrel munches his lunch; three small birds nod on a log. Others have a near-human presence. An extraordinary eagle with outstretched wings projects a grandeur that Edmondson's crucifixes play down. And then there are fantastic beings, like the ardent, buxom "Mermaid" and the all-but-abstract "Critter," an asymmetrical wedge of stone with a single shrewdly positioned notch to indicate a mouth.
"Mermaid," at nearly three feet long, is one of his largest works. It is one among his many sculptures with cultural roots running straight, and still green, to Africa. And "Critter" exemplifies Edmondson the modernist (stylistic cousin to Brancusi) who knocked the New York art world off its feet.
This happened in 1937. Dahl-Wolfe, a fashion photographer for Harper's Bazaar, had heard about Edmondson through friends in Tennessee and began taking pictures of him and his work in 1934. At the time the magazine refused to run work by black artists in its pages, so she passed the photos on to Alfred Barr, director of the Museum of Modern Art. Edmondson became the first African-American to have a solo show at the museum.
It is when Edmondson is considered in the light of a mainstream institution like the Modern, in fact, that the insider-outsider dichotomies that have gathered around him and other so-called self-taught artists turn instructively paradoxical.
Edmondson was intimately tied to and produced art within an economically marginal culture. But that culture has shaped virtually every aspect of American life. His art naturally looks at home in the modernist tradition, which draws so deeply on non-Western sources. It also inflects, challenges, even resists that tradition, with a whole range of specific local interests and beliefs. In the presence of his work, in short, insider and outsider are revealed to be entirely relative terms, and any attempt, however well-intentioned, to shoehorn him into either category is to shortchange him. He's too rich and complicated for that.
The Edmondson exhibition, organized by Rusty Freeman of the Cheekwood Museum and in New York by Brooke Anderson, the new director of the Contemporary Center of the Museum of American Folk Art, comes with an intelligent catalog in which these issues are explored. But in the end it is the sculptures that count, and they need neither arguments not advocates.
Formally spare, conceptually both lighthearted and profound, they represent a personal vision, but they also offer a credible version of Visionary Art -- one with both feet on the ground -- for a spiritually uptight age. And as to Edmondson's history-book status, there is something symbolically right in the fact that while his sculptures hold a place among modernism's monuments, his grave in Mount Ararat cemetery has no stone.
 "The Art of William Edmondson" is at the Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, through Aug. 27. It travels to the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester (Sept. 23 to Jan. 7); the High Museum of Art in Atlanta (Feb. 24 to May 20); and the Mennello Museum of American Folk Art in Orlando, Fla. (June 2 to Aug. 26, 2001). A dozen of his works are in "William Edmondson and 20th-Century Self-Taught Artists" at the Newark Museum through Aug. 13.

Ties (and Bungee Cords) That Bind

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
More male eyes tear up in "Pop and Me," a likable documentary about fathers and sons, than turn misty in "Frequency," the macho tear-jerker about filial devotion that word of mouth has turned into a surprise hit. Could it be that the tough-but-tender ethos of Robert Bly's "Iron John" has trickled down into the cultural mainstream despite the buckets of glib derision heaped on the men's movement? The coincidence of these two male weepies suggests perhaps yes.
"Pop and Me," directed by Chris Roe, a generically clean-cut young Californian who seems largely untouched by life, follows the boyish filmmaker on a nine-month trip around the world with his recently divorced and unemployed 55-year-old father, Richard. While on the road, between bickering and making up, the Roes interview pairs of fathers and sons in various cultures about their relationships. Although the majority of these interviews turn out to be question-and-answer sessions that reveal almost nothing, two or three are quite touching. 
 We visit the home of a bossy Egyptian general who, in the custom of many Muslim families, unconditionally rules the roost in a household where he is surrounded by several generations of his family. According to Islamic teaching, he tells us, children must unquestioningly obey their parents. And judging from the film's joint interview with the general and a grown-up son who lives at home and clearly idolizes his father, such strictures can help ensure a familial social stability. But even in this tight-lipped environment, as the general is questioned about whether he loves his son and awkward hugs are exchanged, the mists begin to roll into their eyes.
It is in Australia, of all places, while visiting an old friend of Richard's, that the Roes' kissy-huggy ethos is stonewalled by the son of a rancher who smugly dismisses this freshly thawed style of filial camaraderie as wimpy "American stuff."
The interviews and some pretty travel scenery are really only the glue holding together the story of Chris and Richard's thorny relationship while traveling. Their agreement before setting out is that Chris will be in charge of the film and Richard, who is footing the bill, in charge of travel, meals and accommodations. But Chris, the second of three sons, resents being bossed around by his father, and their relationship becomes increasingly strained until the end of the trip, when Chris coaxes his acrophobic dad into a dual bungee jump while holding a camera and sound equipment.
For a film devoted to celebrating intimacy and the breaking down of emotional barriers, "Pop and Me" is oddly withholding of information about the travelers. By the end of the movie Chris, who has done a smooth job of directing, seems almost as blank as he did at the beginning. When addressing the camera he is affable enough, but we get no sense of any inner life beyond his continual peevishness about not being in command. We learn a great more about Richard, who comes fairly close to being an ideal father with his mixture of confidence, humor, optimism and general openness. Born in the Bronx, he recalls being the son of a hopeless alcoholic who spent the last decades of his life in a mental institution. In the film's most touching story, he recalls paying a rare visit to the hospital shortly before his father's death and apologizing for being such a neglectful son. For a moment his father emerged from his fog, Richard recalls, just long enough to forgive his son.
What we don't find out is anything about the career or the marriage Richard is leaving behind or why he is stranded without even (we learn at the end of the film) a home base to go back to. Talk about midlife crises! Although Richard appears affluent enough not to have to worry about making a living once he returns to the United States, his future at the end of the movie is a complete mystery. "Pop and Me" leaves you wishing more cards had been put on the table.

Europe's Central Bank Acts To Raise Inflation Barrier

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 8

 BODY:
In an unexpectedly aggressive attempt to help insulate Europe against inflation, the European Central Bank tightened its grip on monetary policy today by raising its core interest rate half a percentage point.
The move, pushing the baseline rate from 3.75 to 4.25 percent, surprised most economists and sent currency traders into a confused frenzy over the euro, Europe's common currency. 
 The euro, which has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in the last two weeks, initially climbed against the dollar, going from 96 cents to more than 97 cents. But then it slipped back to 95.7 cents.
Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency. The euro's rise and subsequent fall today, foreign-exchange traders said, may have been caused by Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, who implied that there would not be any more rate increases soon.
Before today, most currency experts and economists had predicted that the European Central Bank would increase rates by only a quarter of a point.
Today's move came against the backdrop of the euro's travails in world currency markets. Since its introduction in January 1999, the euro has steadily plunged in value relative to the American dollar, from a high of $1.17 to a low of 88.5 cents last month.
Two weeks ago, the euro suddenly began its first sustained recovery. Fueled largely by speculation that the central bank would intervene directly in currency markets -- speculation encouraged by veiled threats from central bankers -- the euro has climbed 10 percent to about 96 cents.
In explaining the bank's decision today, Mr. Duisenberg insisted that the bank was not trying to meddle with exchange rates. Rather, he based the decision on Europe's accelerating growth and a heightened threat of inflation.
"The outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly over the past few months," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference here today. But, he said, the risks of inflation had increased as a result of rising import prices -- for oil in particular.
But Mr. Duisenberg said he remained unsatisfied with what he called the low value of the euro and acknowledged that this played an important if indirect role in today's decision.
That is because the euro's decline has inevitably led to an increase in the prices of imports. The euro has slumped against the yen and the British pound as well as against the dollar, so Europe's imports from most of the world have been affected.
"The reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves, I believe, some potential for further appreciation," Mr. Duisenberg said. "I know that the exchange rate of the euro -- even after the recent appreciation -- does not yet reflect fundamentals, whatever they may be."
But Mr. Duisenberg also dampened expectations about additional rate increases later in the year. "One of the motives to raise the rate by a half-point is that such a move will clear the horizon for some time to come," he told reporters. "We think this move has cleared the horizon."
Tony Norfield, global currency analyst at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said those remarks might explain why the euro declined after having initially risen.
Indeed, Mr. Norfield predicted that the euro had already "peaked" and is likely to slip again.
"It did look fairly aggressive at first," Mr. Norfield said. "The thing that probably took the steam out of the euro was when Duisenberg suggested that was it and there wouldn't be any more."
Mr. Duisenberg was deliberately ambiguous and left himself ample maneuvering room for a shift in emphasis. But his implied message contrasted sharply with that of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who issued a clear warning about additional rate increases after the Fed raised rates on May 16.
Though surprised by today's move, most economists said it was justified and came merely faster than they had expected.
"It won't do much to damage growth," said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Warburg Dillon Read in Frankfurt. "I'd say the E.C.B. was a bit slow before and that this step compensates for that."
Stefan Schneider, head of euro-zone economic research at Deutsche Bank Research, said that Mr. Duisenberg was probably not reacting to the euro's weakness but that today's action could nonetheless keep the currency moving upward.
"The E.C.B. won't dislike the windfall effect of the euro," Mr. Schneider said. "In that respect, the timing is better than as if the hike had come a few weeks ago. The chances are always better if you support a market trend that has already crystallized."

In the Catbird Seat (or the Hot Seat, Like Seattle?)

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta

 BODY:
Playing on Americans' fear of the unknown, a Best Western Hotel television ad last winter showed business executives bucking an unpopular travel request down the corporate ladder. Finally, the request stopped at a hapless underling, standing wide-eyed by a photocopier as a colleague asked, "Have you ever been to -- Calgary?"
Calgarians complained and the hotel chain pulled the commercial. But many others here in the most prosperous city in Canada's most prosperous province just shrugged it off, attributing it to the provincialism of an American ad copy writer. 
 With the highest household Internet connection rate in Canada, the country's largest concentration of corporate headquarters outside of Toronto, and a brand new venture capital stock exchange incubating hundreds of new companies, people in this steel and glass city on the edge of the Canadian Rockies are too busy making money to lose sleep over outdated stereotypes. In fact, a little negative publicity might cool off a city whose population has grown by two-thirds since 1975, to 860,000 today, pushing up housing prices by one third since 1995, the fastest rate of any city in Canada.
"The traffic," groaned Alnisha Haji, a hairdresser who moved here from Winnipeg a few years ago. "Places that used to take half an hour to get to, now take an hour."
But with the lowest unemployment rate of a major Canadian city, 4.7 percent, migrants still flock here at the rate of 50 a day.
"One of the first things I noticed here were the help wanted ads," said Michelle Simick, 27, a newspaper reporter who moved here this spring from her native Vancouver. "They have signs everywhere -- in front of the 7-Elevens, in front of the restaurants, even a board up in the mall. I have never seen that in Vancouver."
"People my age here seem to be a lot further along than people in Vancouver," she said. "People in Vancouver seem to be slogging away at service jobs, waiting for jobs that never open up."
With Canada's tallest building west of Toronto, this modern city of high-rises enjoys its image of a sunny, squeaky clean city, even serving as "Metropolis" for the filming of all three modern Superman movies. But on June 11, this showcase metropolis will be thrust into the world spotlight when 3,000 delegates from 80 countries converge here for the World Petroleum Congress, a five-day event that takes place every three years.
The biggest event to hit Calgary since the 1988 Winter Olympics, the congress may not capture wide attention despite high gasoline prices.
But protesters, noting the expected attendance of 200 journalists, are gearing up for a series of photogenic protests, promising a miniature version of the antitrade protests that shook Seattle six months ago. In a genteel city where parking meter attendants wear cowboy hats to charm the tourists, it is unclear how Calgary will cope if violence breaks out.
Targets will be easy to find. Penthouse floors of downtown skyscrapers proudly bear the names of oil companies: Gulf, Husky, Mobil, Shell and Petro-Canada. But while energy sector companies occupy half of downtown's office space, appearances are deceiving in a city long labeled Canada's "energy capital."
Whipsawed by a series of oil price shocks, Alberta has diversified. The energy industry's part of the provincial economy has dropped to 20 percent today from 35 percent 15 years ago. In the near suburbs, before housing developments sprawl across shortgrass prairie to the Rockies, about 1,200 new high technology companies have sprung up in recent years, now employing 50,000 people.
Professors at a University of Calgary high technology center have licensed 300 technologies in the last decade. To lessen economic dependence on oil, Alberta's government has set up two $700 million funds, one for engineering research, the other for medical research. Last year, of Alberta's 10 fastest-growing companies, 6 were high-tech companies based in Calgary.
"People have learned," said Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier, who was Calgary's mayor during the energy downturn of the 1980's.
This year, Alberta expects to record the highest growth rate, 5 percent, of Canada's 10 provinces. The premier placed much of the credit on low taxes. Alberta has no sales tax, Canada's lowest gasoline tax and, starting Jan. 1, will have Canada's first flat provincial tax.
"When people come out here, they are amazed," said William L. Hess, a Montreal native who runs Calgary's new Canadian Venture Exchange. "The entrepreneurial drive, the quality of work available to professionals are unparalleled."
Since opening six months ago as a fusion of two old exchanges in Calgary and Vancouver, this national exchange has quadrupled its daily trades, to an average of about 28,000 today. With 2,800 small capital companies listed, it is now moving east, opening branches this summer in Winnipeg and Toronto. The new exchange replaces the Vancouver Stock Exchange, which lost credibility over stock manipulations of mining companies.
The downside of Calgary's boom has been an affordable housing squeeze. In the last year, the minimum income needed to buy the average house here jumped by one-quarter, knocking 45,000 families out of the market, according to mortgage analysts. "Homelessness has grown incredibly here," said David W. Lewry, who runs the Inn From the Cold Society, a network of homeless shelters.
But in general Calgary's success has provoked mostly envy, starting in neighboring British Columbia. Alberta, with only three-quarters of British Columbia's population of four million, expects its gross provincial product to surpass its western neighbor's this year, hitting $75 billion.
"No wonder the new Canadian Venture Exchange will headquarter in Calgary and not Vancouver," Mark Milke, British Columbia director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, complained in an essay in The Calgary Herald. "The stockbrokers are simply following the moving vans of other enterprising British Columbians."
In Edmonton, Alberta's capital, Don Ghermezian, manager of the West Edmonton Mall, the world's largest shopping mall, sniffed in an interview: "Calgary has nothing. O.K., it has a tower with a revolving restaurant. Big deal."
In Toronto, newspapers like to paint Calgary and Alberta as weird bastions of reactionary politics and lifestyles. In reality, Calgary is middle of the road by American standards. Last fall, a Calgary judge established the right for local lesbian couples to adopt children legally.
A yuppie haven in reality, Calgary has a household Internet connection rate of 60 percent, and a population that, surveys indicate, prefers skiing over hockey and bicycling over fishing. With the local National Hockey League team, the Calgary Flames, losing money, The Calgary Herald is campaigning to expand the sales of season passes with scare headlines like "No Bucks, No Pucks."
In this city of migrants, social mobility is often greater than in blue-blooded Eastern Canada. In May, Mayor Al Duerr bestowed Calgary's Citizen of the Year Award on Mitzie Wasyliw for her work preserving an old ranching homestead. A newspaper report noted that Mrs. Wasyliw got her start here in the 1970's when she blew into town and became one of the city's first "exotic dancers."
"I am sure there is a bit of Toronto looking down their noses at the West," Mr. Hess, the stock exchange president, said of intercity rivalries. "But, frankly, there is a bit of the West looking down its nose at Toronto."

Abig new Internet services company is determined to make its entry with a splash.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THERE is a riddle that used to appear in magazines like Highlights for Children and Boys' Life, asking readers to name the only day of the year that can also be a sentence. The answer: March Fourth.
Back up the calendar three days and you have the name of a recently formed company, offering a variety of Internet professional services, that seeks to solve another riddle: how to stand out amid competitors ranging from management consultants to advertising agencies to Web site builders. The company, called MarchFirst Inc., is hoping the right answer will be an extensive -- and expensive -- offline and online media campaign centered on a celebration of being, well, first. 
 MarchFirst began operations on, yes, March 1, with the completion of the merger of the USWeb/CKS Group, a Web services company, and Whittman-Hart, an Internet consulting firm. A brief "teaser" campaign ran in newspapers to introduce the name, which was created by staff members at McKinney & Silver, the ad agency unit of USWeb/CKS perhaps best known for its work for the Audi automobiles sold by Volkswagen of America.
The second, much larger, phase of the MarchFirst campaign, also produced by McKinney & Silver, is to begin on Monday with ads in daily and weekly newspapers. Ads in business, trade and lifestyle magazines will follow later in the month along with TV commercials on sports and other programming. The online portion includes a Web site to go up on Monday (www.marchfirst.com).
The budget for the entire campaign, carrying the theme "A new company for the new economy," is $50 million.
"It's tough to cut through all the clutter," said Robert Bernard, chairman and chief executive at MarchFirst in Chicago, particularly, he said, when dozens of dot-coms are striving to establish themselves in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer realms.
"It's very important for us to get the name out there, to create a strong brand awareness," Mr. Bernard said, adding that basing the campaign on "the human desire to be first" would accomplish that "because people will be attracted to the emotion, the heart."
"It's not just about crossing a finish line first," he added, "but also about tackling problems, taking risks, taking on challenges."
The device the campaign uses to gain attention is to demonstrate the effects of famous firsts rather than portray the causes. For instance, a print ad captioned "The first rock star" shows not Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley or Bill Haley but screaming, sobbing fans pressed against a chain-link fence.
"Here's to being first," the text reads. "Here's to leading."
A second print ad, captioned "The first cubist exhibition," displays not "Nude Descending a Staircase" but a gallery of men and women staring, glaring and even tilting their heads.
"It's good to be first," the text reads, promoting MarchFirst as providing businesses with "a new way of thinking."
The TV commercials are to present the effects of events like the wearing of the first miniskirt, as passers-by are seen registering shock and surprise; the first man on the moon, as a family watching television is glimpsed crying and cheering; and the first expedition to the South Pole, as penguins are shown turning their heads in unison from left to right as if they were humans at a tennis match.
"The power is in the effects these firsts had in moving society," said David Baldwin, senior vice president and executive creative director at McKinney & Silver.
"We could have said: 'MarchFirst. Integrated solutions for your many needs,' " he added, laughing. "But it's better to say we're making sure MarchFirst is always trying to win for clients and employees."
Indeed, said Sara Cavin, executive vice president for marketing, the campaign is aimed at MarchFirst's employees -- current and prospective -- as much as existing and potential customers.
"We're constantly 're-recruiting' our employees to make sure they've an understanding of what we do," Ms. Cavin said. That is crucial because MarchFirst, with 9,000 employees at 70 offices in 14 countries, does so much: creating traditional advertising; building and putting up Web sites; offering brand and corporate identity consulting and strategic positioning; and installing so-called front-end and back-end technology services.
Whether or not you like the company's unusual name, it offers one major advantage, according to Mr. Bernard: "Every year, we can celebrate our anniversary."

HEADLINE: Putin to Visit North Korea; U.S. ABM Plan May Be Target

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 8

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin plans to visit North Korea next month, a move that underscores his active foreign policy and seems calculated to counter the Clinton administration's plan for a national missile defense.
Russian officials said today that it would be the first trip by a Russian leader to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. 
 "This is an unprecedented event, a bold step, as no head of state from our country has ever been in North Korea, neither in Soviet nor in Russian times," Georgi Toloraya, an official in the Foreign Ministry, told the newspaper Vremya Novostei.
The announcement comes on the heels of Mr. Putin's meeting with President Clinton in Moscow, in which the two leaders found themselves at odds over the administration's plans for a limited antimissile system.
The Korea visit meeting will provide Mr. Putin with an opportunity to make his case that diplomacy, not missile defense, is the way to cope with an emerging missile threat from North Korea.
Mr. Putin can also use the visit to challenge the idea that North Korea is an irrational "rogue state," a description the United States has used to justify its antimissile plans.
Those Russian themes are likely to resonate in Western Europe, where the Western allies remain very anxious that the administration's plan will start an arms race and leave them unprotected.
In recent days, Mr. Putin took his campaign to Italy, where he urged Europeans to support a Russian alternative to the American plan.
American officials were caught by surprise by the Russian announcement. They said they welcomed the visit as way to end North Korea's isolation.
"We continue to believe that dialogue among all countries in the region contributes to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and beyond," a State Department spokesman said.
According to the Japanese media, Mr. Putin's visit is scheduled to take place in mid-July, just before the summit meeting of the leading industrial democracies in Okinawa, Japan, from July 21 to 23.
Russian officials said Moscow had become more interested in the situation on the Korean peninsula as a result of the summit meeting between North and South Korea scheduled for early next week.
Mr. Toloraya, who is deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Asia department, said that the Kremlin had proposed the visit and that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had issued a formal invitation.
Mr. Toloraya said Moscow wanted to assure the North Koreans that Moscow did not favor a unified Korea dominated by Seoul. Such fears have grown in Pyongyang, he said, as Russia has developed economic and political ties with South Korea.
"That is not the case," Mr. Toloraya said in his newspaper interview. "We consider it necessary for the two Korean states to coexist for a long time."
The American antiballistic missile plan is very much on the agenda, according to the Russians. Mr. Toloraya said the Russians and North Koreans would have a general discussion on "how we can act together in the world situation, including in connection with U.S. plans for ABM."
In an indirect swipe at Washington, he said Russia's new assertive role in foreign policy had the potential to upset "somebody else's cards."
Russia fears that the limited defense the United States is planning is just the first phase in a larger system that will eventually counter Russia's strategic forces. Washington's goal has been to overcome Russian suspicions and persuade the Kremlin to amend the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
That would enable the United States to develop a limited defensive system, which could include the deployment of 100 interceptors and the construction of radar in Alaska.
At the summit meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin, Russia acknowledged that there was an emerging missile threat from nations like North Korea. Still, the Russians insist that the threat is not as worrisome as the United States says. And while the Americans have insisted that an antimissile system is needed, the Russians have urged diplomacy.
The United States has persuaded North Korea to accept a moratorium on the test-firing of long-range missiles. That has precluded Pyongyang from testing its Taepo Dong-2, a two-stage missile that Washington fears might eventually be developed as an intercontinental missile.
There have been several indications of growing ties between Russia and North Korea. The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, paid a recent visit to North Korea. And a North Korean delegation arrived at Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East to discuss joint construction projects, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass said today.

Pyongyang Reports New Drought
 SEOUL, South Korea, June 8 (Reuters) -- North Korea, now dependent on food aid for survival, today reported that another drought had hit all parts of the country, devastating spring crops.
The official Korean Central News Agency said "drought and heat persist in all parts" of the country. "Because of a long spell of drought and heat, paddy fields are parched and rice-transplantation is suspended in some areas," it said.

HEADLINE: Through the Looking Glass: Europe Raises Interest Rates

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHAT would the Federal Reserve do if American inflation was running about 2 percent a year and the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent? Would Alan Greenspan have the nerve to raise rates by half a percentage point?
If that idea sounds crazy to you, then you're not in touch with reality, European style. For that is exactly what happened yesterday to Germans, for whom the above statistics apply. The European Central Bank, eager to prove its credibility as an inflation fighter, decided to confound forecasters and impose a half-point interest rate increase. 
 In this country, an unemployment rate that high would have long since become the major national economic issue -- the actual United States rate is now 4.1 percent -- and politicians would be screaming for easier monetary policy. It would take an inflation rate far higher than 2 percent to persuade anyone that tightening credit was a good idea.
But in Europe, things are different. Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president, explained that they were worried about inflation that can be traced in part to high oil prices and a weak euro, and that the European economy was growing at 3 percent anyway.
The sad thing about Europe now is that it seems to have accepted high unemployment as a virtually permanent thing. It is coming down, but the latest reported rate for the countries in the euro currency zone is 9.2 percent. The conventional wisdom is that unemployment is high because of structural problems like high wages and laws making it difficult for employers to hire and fire at will, and that a stimulative monetary policy would only revive inflation without doing much for growth. Anyway, the European Central Bank is supposed to keep inflation from going above 2 percent.
Robert M. Solow, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has suggested that idea is simply wrong. "European central banks kept the squeeze on for a long time" when fighting the inflation of the 1970's, he wrote a few years ago. "Suppose," he added, "there is a tendency for prolonged 'cyclical' unemployment to turn into something that looks like 'structural' unemployment. It is not hard to imagine how that might plausibly happen as the unemployed adapt to the unavailability of jobs." Eventually, he said, central banks wrongly convinced themselves that high unemployment was there to stay and the banks could not "afford to expand aggregate demand" by loosening monetary policy.
It is perfectly true that Europe needs structural reform, but as Mr. Solow noted, "it would be bad news indeed if this apparently structural unemployment really would not yield to the revival of demand for goods and labor." He suggested that history indicated it would. The European Central Bank should find out if he is right.
In the United States, there has been good reason to think the economy was overheating, and the Fed has been right to tighten. But the Fed's action makes it all the more regrettable that the Europeans seem scared of growth. "From the world's perspective, a surprising strength coming out of Europe gives us the best chance to survive a necessary sharp slowing in the United States," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
The euro has been weak because investors have viewed the rapidly growing United States as a much more attractive place to put money. The euro is cheap, and will recover eventually. But efforts to slow European growth are not going to help the beleaguered currency.

HEADLINE: Work Begins on Westin Hotel To the West of Times Square

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Construction workers began building a soaring 45-story Westin hotel yesterday in a once forbidding area west of Times Square, at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.
The $300 million, 858-room hotel, which would be part of the E Walk entertainment complex on 42nd Street, is the latest example of a boom in which analysts expect a record-breaking year for both hotel occupancy rates and room rates, which are the highest in the country. With many of the hotels in Manhattan effectively full, analysts expect that an additional 7,000 hotel rooms will be built in the next four years. 
 Westin, a chain owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, will operate the hotel on Eighth Avenue. And five blocks away, Starwood signed a deal on Wednesday to take over the 52-story hotel nearing completion at Broadway and 47th Street as part of its W Hotels chain.
The occupancy rate at Manhattan hotels rose to 89.1 percent in April, the highest point in the last 20 years, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting firm. During the same month, average room rates reached $245.27, 11.7 percent higher than April 1999. And reservations for the summer and fall are running unusually strong.
"It suggests that 2000 may be the best year on record for the New York City hotel business," said Sean Hennessey, director of the hotel consulting business at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Only five years ago, many hotel owners and developers said they would never venture as far west as Eighth Avenue, because 42nd Street was too seedy to support a luxury hotel. Since then, 42nd Street and Times Square have blossomed with restaurants, television studios, game rooms, theaters and office buildings. The hotels have followed.
Designed by Arquitectonica, the Westin Hotel will be split from top to bottom by a striking curved beam of light. The project is owned and developed by Tishman Realty and Construction Company, which is building the E Walk complex.
Across the street, the Hilton Times Square, with 444 rooms, had its grand opening on Tuesday on the south side of 42nd Street, next door to the entertainment complex that includes Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, a 25-screen AMC multiplex movie house and HMV Records.
The hotel industry in New York City has made a remarkable recovery since 1991, when nearly half the hotel rooms in the city were left empty by a recession and the war in the Persian Gulf. Five years later, the hotel industry cried poverty and persuaded city officials to reduce the hotel tax by six percentage points, to 15.25 percent. Since then, hotel owners have raised the average room rate in Manhattan by 54.3 percent, to more than $245 a night.
And in the process, Times Square became contested territory. Gary Barnett, an owner of Intell Investment and Management, and Madison Equities, began construction two years ago at Broadway and 47th Street with a plan to create a Planet Hollywood Hotel.
The theme restaurant chain planned to move its flagship restaurant there from 57th Street. But Intell put the hotel up for sale after Planet Hollywood tumbled into bankruptcy court last year and sold its stake in the project back to Intell for about $32 million.
Sheraton, Hard Rock and a number of other companies competed for the project, and on Sunday it appeared that the Radisson hotel chain had won out with a bid to run the hotel as a joint venture. But at the last minute, real estate executives said, Starwood jumped in and grabbed the deal with an offer worth an estimated $175 million to lease the hotel and retail space for 25 years.
Intell will retain the 300-foot-tall steel columns on the hotel that serve as a superstructure for the illuminated billboards, which are worth millions of dollars a year in rental fees.
Mr. Hennessey, the hotel analyst, said that Starwood, which owns the Sheraton, Westin, St. Regis and W chains, has been eager to open a hotel on the West Side of Manhattan, where it may be able to reap bigger profits as patrons pay higher prices.
"The room rates at West Side hotels in Manhattan have been $25 to $35 below the rates of comparable hotels on the East Side," Mr. Hennessey said. "With the development of first-class office space and the evolution of Times Square, that spread is going to narrow and represent stronger than average gains for West Side hotels."
Dan Gibson, a spokesman for Starwood, confirmed yesterday that the company had signed a deal to run the hotel under the W brand. But he declined to give any details.

HEADLINE: Government Reports Decline in Import Prices

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The prices businesses pay for imported goods, excluding petroleum, fell in May for the first time in almost a year, government figures showed today, suggesting that inexpensive imports are helping to keep inflation contained.
"It's been one of the major reasons why there's no pricing power in the U.S.," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. "The goods are coming in from overseas; they're cheap; and it keeps businesses from being able to raise prices." 
 The index of imported prices for goods outside of petroleum products fell 0.2 percent last month after rising 0.1 percent in April, the Labor Department said. May's decrease -- which was attributed to falling prices of food, some capital equipment and consumer goods -- was the first since a 0.1 percent decrease in July.
Prices of imports, including oil, rose 0.6 percent in May after falling 1.5 percent in April. Imported oil prices, which have risen 72.1 percent since May 1999, have pushed up the overall import price index 6.4 percent over the last year. Nonpetroleum imports rose 0.9 percent in the 12 months ended in May.
The report is further evidence that inflation is not about to derail the record nine-year economic expansion. Federal Reserve policy makers have increased interest rates six times over the last year, pushing the overnight bank lending rate to a nine-year high of 6.5 percent, in an effort to slow growth and keep prices in check.
The Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level in five months. First-time jobless claims rose 20,000, to 309,000 for the week, the most since Jan. 8. Still, for the year to date, initial claims have averaged 280,000 a week, down from last year's average of 298,000.
The report on import prices is the first of three measures of inflation for May. The Labor Department reports its Producer Price Index on Friday and the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Plans Tour on Prosperity Issues

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore plans to kick off a new stage of his campaign next week, making a "progress and prosperity" tour devoted to the relatively new questions of how best to guide the nation in an era of budget surpluses.
Mr. Gore said he would open the discussion on Tuesday in New York City with a speech about protecting Medicare from what he called "political poaching" and reserving it for the use of the 40 million Americans for whom it was collected. 
 "We're at a turning point in our country's history," Mr. Gore, the putative Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview here today. "We've never had a debate about how to make decisions concerning a large, continuing surplus, and there are a number of big choices that we have to make."
He added, "The decisions related to the surplus are no less difficult or important than the decisions we have made concerning the deficit."
Besides Medicare, he said he would delve into other questions, including: "How to use entitlements correctly; how to pay off the debt more quickly in order to reduce interest rates and promote more economic growth; and how to make the investments that are needed in top priorities like education, to get people access to the skills they need."
The vice president's new focus is less about Medicare than about the ongoing debate over how best to take advantage of the nation's newly found fiscal health. It is part of Mr. Gore's effort to sell voters on debt reduction as a smarter alternative to the big tax cuts advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his expected Republican rival this fall.
It is also part of the Gore campaign's effort to put a positive sheen on Mr. Gore's candidacy and to make explicit use of what his advisers say is perhaps his best argument for being elected: the unprecedented prosperity of the last several years.
Mr. Gore has not received much direct credit for that prosperity, but the tour, to highlight the economic progress in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio that will be major electoral battlegrounds, should increase his association with it.
"The American people deserve the credit for the strength of the economy," Mr. Gore said. "I think the policies of this administration, which I've helped shape, have indeed unlocked some of that potential and made it much more likely to occur."
The vice president frequently points to his association with Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and one of the nation's most respected financial analysts, as testimony to his fiscal discipline, but he said that he came up with the idea of putting Medicare into a "lock box" on his own.
"I consult with Bob Rubin all the time," Mr. Gore said today. "But this particular proposal on the Medicare lock box I put forward and I hoped that he would react positively to it, and he did."
The Medicare surplus this year is projected by its trustees at $22.3 billion, and to total $250 billion over 10 years. The surplus comes from payroll taxes levied on employees and employers to pay for hospitalization, nursing home care and other health benefits under Medicare.
Under the government's accounting rules, the Medicare surplus has been considered part of the general government surplus, unlike the surplus generated by Social Security, which both legally and politically has been segregated from excess general government revenue.
Both the Democratic and the Republican parties have agreed to use the Social Security surplus, which amounts to more than $2 trillion over the next decade, only to reduce the national debt held by the public. The public debt stands at $3.5 trillion.
Estimates of the non-Social Security surplus over the next decade range from $800 billion to nearly $2 trillion, depending on what assumptions are made about how fast government spending will increase.
Mr. Bush is relying on the non-Social Security surplus to pay for his tax cut plan, which is valued at $1.3 trillion over the rest of the decade.
Mr. Gore's Medicare "lock box" proposal would reduce the amount of money available for tax cuts by $250 billion, making it easier for him to portray Mr. Bush's tax plan as fiscally irresponsible, especially when added to Republican proposals for additional spending on programs like national missile defense.
The vice president has been determined to avoid negative references to Mr. Bush over the last few weeks. He said today that the intention of his Medicare proposal was not to make Mr. Bush's plan seem riskier, but he would not be unhappy if a voter drew that conclusion.
"If that makes it harder for someone to use the Medicare trust fund for purposes other than Medicare, then that should be one of the effects," he said.
Mr. Gore's plan would also restrict Democrats from using all of the non-Social Security surplus for additional spending.
Jim Horney, an analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, said of the Gore plan: "This is obviously an attempt to reduce the likelihood of there being big tax increases or spending that would eat up the surplus. If it helps to avoid big tax cuts or spending increases before dealing with the long-term issues of Medicare and Social Security, that would be good."
Referring to the Medicare surplus, Mr. Horney said, "It's not nearly as much as the Social Security surplus, but it's still a significant amount of money."
Mr. Gore's lock box plan would not do anything to shore up Medicare, which, without any changes, is expected to become insolvent around 2025. By earmarking the Medicare surplus for debt reduction, the main economic effect of Mr. Gore's plan would be to underscore his commitment to paying off the national debt by 2013 or sooner, a path that he says would help keep interest rates down and stimulate economic growth.
But by setting up even an indirect tradeoff between Medicare and tax cuts, Mr. Gore is returning to a political strategy that Democrats have used successfully against Republicans for years: implying that Republican tax cuts for the rich would endanger health insurance for some of the nation's most vulnerable citizens.

Hold On to Individuality, Levy Advises

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy told graduates at the College of Staten Island yesterday to take advantage of the growing globalization of the economy and the increasing interconnectedness of the world's people. But he warned them not to relinquish their privacy and individualism.
"The world has become smaller, the Internet has pulled us all together and our economies have all become one," Mr. Levy told the roughly 1,800 graduates gathered on a broad lawn at the college, which is part of the City University of New York. "How do we protect our spiritualism from the relentless march of the logical force of the future? How do we stand up and be ourselves?" 
 One way, Mr. Levy said, is to continue pursuing a "moral education" after leaving school.
"It means intellectual honesty," he said. "It means having a sense of vision. It means having a sense of creativity."
Mr. Levy, whose goals as chancellor include recruiting hundreds of qualified teachers to help turn around the city's failing schools, also stressed the importance of teaching in urban schools and compared it to volunteering in the civil rights movement or the Peace Corps. "Education, in my judgment, is the key social issue of the day," Mr. Levy said. "Education and teachers generally are the vessels by which we convey civilization."
Mr. Levy thanked the dozens of graduates who had majored in education, and in particular, Maria Gusenfitter, the valedictorian of the college's class of 2000. In a speech to her classmates, Ms. Gusenfitter told of her struggles raising her son Jack, who was born deaf, on her own as she worked toward her bachelor's degree.
"Despair can whisper lies about what will become of you," Ms. Gusenfitter said, describing her depression when her husband abandoned her after their son's birth. But Ms. Gusenfitter's family rallied around her, she said, baby-sitting for her son while she attended class and making sure she had transportation to get there.
"Somehow this love, if you let it in, can pierce the darkness and the coldness," she said, her voice breaking.
Ms. Gusenfitter, who plans to pursue a master's degree in elementary or special education, said she wanted to teach partly to help troubled students through tumultuous times.
"I will remind them that darkness is but for a while," she said, "and light will come again."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MIRCROSOFT: THE LAW;
Experts Praise Judge's Rulings On Microsoft

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks yesterday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law. 
 "It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there," said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School. "It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want."
The risks for Judge Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power. Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping "an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune."
Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft. The company's chairman, William H. Gates, said it was an "unwarranted intrusion" into "a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America."
Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as an argument to suggest that Judge Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company, said Charles J. Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Virginia School of Law.
Professor Goetz praised Judge Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style. "There has been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the public," Professor Goetz said, "to distinguish this case from traditional antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field."
"But mere fast change is not the issue," Professor Goetz continued. "What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be coming up with a 'better mousetrap' and Microsoft was charged with engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from those products."
Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said Judge Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
"It is very hard to second-guess him," Professor Elhauge said, "and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him" on his factual findings. If those findings are accepted, Professor Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears "entirely sensible" under legal precedents. Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.
Several experts said one of Judge Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.
Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt-packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.
But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Judge Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal. It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Judge Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal. But even on that subject, Professor Moglen said, Judge Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.
"He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be," Professor Moglen said, adding that he thought Judge Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.
Several of the legal experts said yesterday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.
They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products. But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.
Professor Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense. "Every industry, as it is growing," he said, "seems surprised that the antitrust law applies to it."

HEADLINE: Panama Still Failing to Stem Narcotics Traffic, U.S. Report Asserts

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 8

 BODY:
The Panamanian government has made little progress this year in its fight against drug trafficking and money laundering, according to a United States Customs intelligence report.
The report, which is expected to be discussed at a Congressional hearing on Friday, said Panama continued to be a major transshipment point for cocaine and increasingly for heroin, which are smuggled through weakly patrolled borders and ports. The reported noted that in 1999 drug seizures declined 80 percent from 1998 and no major drug arrests were made. 
 A preliminary version of the report, which was provided to a House subcommittee on criminal justice and drug policy, originally had harsh words for Panama's law enforcement agencies, saying they were "corrupt and ill trained" and "overwhelmed" by drug traffickers. The final version softened that criticism, saying they faced "difficulties dealing with sophisticated trafficking organizations."
The report said that Panama's sprawling Colon Free Trade Zone was used by traffickers not only to hide drugs in cargo containers but also to launder profits. It cited serious security problems at Tocumen International Airport, where there have been allegations that cargo and ramp workers are helping to move drug shipments.
Customs officials would not comment on the report, which they said was classified.
Nevertheless, the report's observations are sure to be used by Congressional critics and others who have expressed grave concerns about Panama's inability to secure its border with Colombia less than six months after the United States withdrew all its troops.
"The situation in Panama has taken a dramatic turn for the worse," said Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican who is the subcommittee chairman. "The information we have is pretty damaging, especially since the United States exited six months ago."
With increased unrest and violence in Colombia, more traffickers have been seeking a safe haven in Panama. At the same time, the country's lax banking laws and dollar economy have proved as much of a lure to them as the high-rise buildings they have settled into.
"It's not all about drugs," a diplomat said. "The country is built on dodging taxes, dodging bizarre exchange rates and evading court settlements." He added, "The narcos have grafted right on." As a result, the diplomat said, efforts to crack down on money laundering have been unsuccessful.
"Basically, about the entire economic elite of this country is involved in some form of money laundering, and the government is not going to crack down on that," he said. "Money is a morally neutral item in this country. It does not matter where it comes from."
Part of the problem has been that the government of President Mireya Moscoso assumed power only last September and is still feeling its way. Some critics have faulted her for not having enough of a vision for the country's future and say that she has been more preoccupied with petty politics and deciding which supporters get which government posts.
At the same time, her government has been ambivalent about what kind of relationship it wants with the United States after nearly a century of American influence on Panamanian affairs. It is also about to sign a long-awaited national security plan that will, for the first time, outline its strategy for securing its borders and the canal.

HEADLINE: Behind a Solemn Rite for Obuchi, a Burst of Politicking

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8

 BODY:
Japan's late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was remembered today in a solemn state service marked by emotional eulogies, cannonades, a parading honor guard in crisp white uniforms, and thousands of dark-suited mourners, including President Clinton.
The service for Mr. Obuchi, who died on May 14, six weeks after having suffered a stroke, began under a hot and brilliant sky with a long slow procession into the large hall. The ceremony was held by Mr. Obuchi's wife, Chizuko, and their 28-year-old son, Takeshi, who bore a white box containing his father's ashes. 
 With members of the imperial family and dignitaries from 170 countries in the hall, where a huge portrait of Mr. Obuchi hung against an illuminated powder blue background, his successor, Yoshiro Mori, remembered his friend and ally.
"I am anguished to think how deeply disappointed Mr. Obuchi must have been to have had to retire from the arena of action, felled by an unforeseen illness," Mr. Mori said. "In this moment of bereavement, I can do no more than express my heartfelt gratitude to former Prime Minister Obuchi for dedicating his all to this nation."
For all of the sobriety of the occasion, what was occurring offstage both before and after the ceremony was a burst of political activity and diplomacy of great significance for Japan's immediate future, and for the future of this region.
Mr. Mori, for one, finally had a setting in which he could enjoy the statesman's attributes of his office. And with elections scheduled for June 25, Mr. Mori's huddles with Mr. Clinton, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and senior Chinese and Russian officials provided welcome relief from the cycle of provocative blunders and tortured semiretractions that have cut deeply into the prime minister's popularity ratings.
Eager for a lift, Mr. Mori's aides made much of the meetings with Mr. Clinton; Mr. Kim; the leaders of Australia, Indonesia and Thailand; and high-ranking officials from other countries. In all, Mr. Mori and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono had talks with 33 countries in two days.
After Mr. Clinton had met Mr. Mori and Mr. Kim, his aides praised Seoul for taking the initiative in engaging its northern neighbor and hinted strongly at a relaxation of American economic sanctions against Pyongyang, many of which have been in place since the end of the Korean War. "I would expect we would have an announcement on that very soon," a spokesman for the White House, P. J. Crowley, said.
The administration had often expressed frustration with Mr. Obuchi and his government over the slow pace of reform to lift Japan out of its decadelong slump. But on this occasion, Mr. Clinton offered praise, saying history would regard Mr. Obuchi as someone who "rose to the challenge with courage and confidence."
Mr. Clinton did hint at new frustrations with Japan. Foreign Ministry officials said the president had raised, among other issues, the question of high international telephone-connection fees imposed by the national carrier, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which Washington sees as an unfair barrier to competition.
Western diplomats said Mr. Clinton's decision to attend the service -- flying a roundtrip total of 26 hours for an eight-hour stay -- and his strong praise for Mr. Obuchi should be seen in the context of the "unusually strong alliance" that links the two countries and the steady support that Japan has provided for American foreign policy.
The timing of the service, three weeks after Mr. Obuchi's cremation, was itself mired in politics. It was widely reported that the service was held as close as decently possibly to the elections to guarantee a large "sympathy vote" and help the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Since the date was announced, a string of unusually blunt nationalist statements by Mr. Mori, whose description of Japan as a "divine country with an emperor at its center" evoked imperialist prewar propaganda, undermined support for the government in the polls. Now the election promises to be a referendum on Mr. Mori rather than a commemoration of Mr. Obuchi.
Mr. Mori's time in office has been unusually troubled. Opposition leaders and editorialists have poked holes into the sometimes contradictory official explanations of how power was secretively passed from the stricken Mr. Obuchi to a brief caretaker prime minister and, finally, to Mr. Mori.

HEADLINE: Procter & Gamble Shake-Up Follows Poor Profit Outlook

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The chief executive of Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, resigned yesterday as the company announced it would suffer another disappointing quarter and its stock price fell to less than half of what it was worth just four months ago.
With the move, Procter acknowledged that it had tried to remake itself into a more aggressive company too rapidly and that its core brands, which include Crest, Pringles and Tide, had suffered as it focused on developing new products. 
 Procter's board immediately named Alan G. Lafley, a 23-year employee of the company, to succeed Durk I. Jager, the hard-charging executive who had vowed to shake up the company's staid culture and force managers to act in a more entrepreneurial style. It also called John E. Pepper, Mr. Jager's predecessor and longtime rival, out of retirement to serve as chairman.
"In hindsight, it's clear we changed too much too fast," said Mr. Lafley, 52, who was a president overseeing the company's beauty-care products and its North American operations. The cost has been steep: Procter has lost $75 billion in market value since January.
At a time when many executives are saying they want their corporations to act like small, entrepreneurial companies, largely in response to the growth of Internet commerce, Procter's struggles indicate just how difficult a successful transformation is.
Under Mr. Jager, 57, the company tried to bolster a mediocre growth rate by developing products more quickly, eschewing the many-layered approval processes and market tests for which the conservative company was famous. Mr. Jager also moved many managers to new jobs to shake up a corporate culture in which employees are called Proctoids because of their efficiency and obedience.
The initiatives have led to some success -- like Swiffer, a floor-cleaning cloth -- but the price has been too high, the company said yesterday. Costs have risen almost as fast as sales, and the money Procter spent on its initiatives left less to spend on the marketing of its largest businesses.
Earnings per share for the company's fourth quarter, which ends June 30, will be about the same as a year earlier, rather than 15 to 17 percent higher, as the company had estimated. For the fiscal year, Procter is now likely to earn $4.23 billion before one-time charges, up only slightly from $4.15 billion last year, according to Prudential Securities.
Shares of Procter fell $6.125, to $56.75.
In a conference call with analysts, investors and reporters, Mr. Lafley said he would spend the next six weeks studying Procter's spending to decide which efforts should continue to receive their current levels of investment. "We will make tougher choices," said Mr. Lafley.
Although neither he nor Mr. Pepper criticized Mr. Jager by name, they bluntly repudiated the pace with which he had tried to change the $38 billion company. The company moved executives between divisions too rapidly, they said, and it adopted new financial measures that turned out to be too optimistic. Speed, Mr. Lafley said, "is not a substitute for good business sense."
"What we thought would take about a year to complete is clearly going to take at least a year longer," he said.
As a result, many of Procter's most important brands have underperformed products made by rivals like Kimberly-Clark and PepsiCo's Frito-Lay. Crest, for example, has lost market share to Colgate and Aquafresh as Procter managers have been slow to respond to consumers' growing appetite for toothpastes that promise to do more than simply clean teeth. In the 52 weeks that ended April 23, Crest's sales grew 1.3 percent while overall toothpaste sales increased more than 3 percent, according to Information Resources, a Chicago company that tracks supermarkets, drugstores and larger retailers like Wal-Mart.
Tide is underperforming its rivals in the liquid-detergent aisle. The growth rate of Charmin toilet paper is trailing those of Quilted Northern and Kleenex Cottonelle. Zest, Ivory and Oil of Olay soaps have all lost market share over the last year. And Pringles has fallen further behind Frito Lay's best-selling potato chips, according to Information Resources.
"The focus all went to speeding new products to market," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, which owns shares in the company.
It was the earnings shortfall -- a result of slower-than-expected sales -- that led to the resignation of Mr. Jager, a native of the Netherlands who took over the chief executive's post 17 months ago. Mr. Pepper, 61, who is more popular among employees but also considered less aggressive, originally beat out Mr. Jager for the chairman's job in 1995 only to cede it to him last year after a disappointing and abbreviated term.
In January, newspapers reported that Mr. Jager was considering buying the drugmakers American Home Products and Warner-Lambert in an effort to vastly enlarge Procter's small pharmaceutical division. Investors thought the idea too ambitious and Procter's stock fell more than 10 percent, causing Mr. Jager to abandon his plan reluctantly. Mr. Jager also made overtures to buy Gillette.
In March, Procter warned that its third-quarter profit would be smaller than expected, and shares fell another 30 percent.
Yesterday's news brought the shares down to their 1997 level in what is by far the largest drop over the last two decades for the widely held stock. The decline is likely to aggravate morale problems at the company's Cincinnati headquarters because of the large portion of employee retirement savings that the company puts into its own stock.
The announcement also offers the latest evidence of the struggles that consumer-product companies are experiencing despite the longest economic expansion in United States history. Companies like Coca-Cola and Gillette have been able to push through only moderate price increases, if any. Consumers have refused to pay more for staple goods, and retailers led by Wal-Mart have gained more power through their growing size. At the same time, economic troubles in Asia and Latin America hurt sales in recent years, and the current weakness of the euro has dampened profits in Europe. The rise in oil and paper costs have not helped, either.
Although Mr. Jager said in a statement that the decision to resign was his, analysts said it was yet another example of the small margin of error that chief executives have at a time when the volatile stock market punishes companies that surprise it with bad news.
This year, the top executives at Coca-Cola, Mattel and Xerox have left after producing disappointing results. "The capital market is taking its vengeance on those who do not get great numbers," said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "And directors are much more inclined just to pull the switch."
Mr. Lafley graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and Harvard Business School, and his only full-time job outside of Procter was in the Navy. He is personable and energetic, said Sally J. Dessloch, a vice president at J. P. Morgan Securities, and has a reputation for doing a good job of motivating employees. Other analysts said his style was closer to Mr. Pepper's than to Mr. Jager's.

A Muted Reaction of Admiration and Disbelief

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 8

 BODY:
Windows and Word may be ubiquitous across Europe and Asia, but news of the court order to break up Microsoft generated a muted reaction outside of the United States today.
There was a sense of admiration -- mixed with disbelief -- among many commentators that a government would take such a step. Neither Europe nor Japan have ever seen a comparable effort to break up a large company, though European regulators have become much more aggressive about imposing big fines on companies for anticompetitive activities. 
 "The breakup of a company is impossible under German law," said Stefan Siebert, a spokesman for Germany's cartel office in Bonn. "All we can do is prohibit abuses and impose fines."
In Rome, La Republica captured the sense that the breakup was something that could happen only in the United States.
"A Washington judge with the deceptively good-natured image of a western actor has with almost hate-filled words ordered the breakup of Microsoft into two separate parts," the newspaper said in an editorial today. "The century of the New Economy begins exactly where that of the old economy began: with an America that breaks up the monopoly of the 'new oil.' "
Mario Monti, head of the European Commission's competition ministry, said through a spokeswoman today that he "congratulates" the United States government for its work but said it was too early to know whether the court order would affect European investigations into Microsoft.
Mr. Monti has raised questions about the Windows 2000 operating system, suggesting that it may hinder the abilities of computers linked over networks and over the Internet.
His office is also scrutinizing Microsoft's plan to acquire 29.7 percent of Telewest Communications P.L.C., the British cable television operator. Microsoft has teamed up with the Liberty Media Group to buy a controlling stake in Telewest from the Media One Corporation.
"We understand that there will be an appeal," said Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the competition ministry. "We will have to see what the final ruling is."
Though most European software companies said they would not be affected by the Microsoft case, several welcomed the order.
"We welcome the recognition that monopolies have never been successful or sensible," said Reiner Jung, a spokesman for Brokat Infosystems A.G. of Stuttgart, a fast-growing developer of encryption programs and other software used in online banking systems. "That doesn't mean we want a weaker Microsoft," he added. "Quite the contrary, we want a strong Microsoft. But what we don't want is a monopoly."
Suse A.G., in Nurenberg, which produces software that runs on the Linux operating system, a competitor to Windows, argued that a court-ordered breakup of Microsoft might do little to break the Windows monopoly unless the company makes its code available to rivals.
"Microsoft will have the ability after the breakup of making available applications for other platforms," said Carsten Fischer, a spokesman for Suse. "But Microsoft has to adhere to the rules of open-source software, which includes opening up its documentation."
The biggest effect of the Microsoft case in Europe could prove to be on its many alliances and partnerships. Microsoft has struck technology deals with scores of European media and telecommunications companies, and it sought to invest in both cable television and wireless networks.
Microsoft officials say their goal is a foothold in new media, from interactive digital television to advanced wireless data communications.
For the moment, companies involved with Microsoft are waiting to see what happens. "We have consistently made it clear that we welcome Microsoft as a potential corporate shareholder, and that remains our position," said Rachel Turner, a spokeswoman for Telewest.

HEADLINE: Teenage Mother Accused of Throwing Baby in River Was Depressed, Lawyer Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., June 8

 BODY:
A lawyer for a 17-year-old mother charged with throwing her baby into the Passaic River Saturday night said today that she had been forced to leave home two years ago and was recently depressed and suffering from memory lapses.
"I think this is a very troubled young lady," the lawyer, Anthony Fusco, said after a brief court hearing on the charge that his client murdered her 16-month-old son. "What's going on in her mind right now, God only knows. I'm not so sure even she knows why she did this." 
 During the hearing, in the family division of State Superior Court, Mr. Fusco conceded that the woman, whose name was not released because of her age, told Paterson detectives early Monday that she had dropped the baby into the river from a footbridge. In a move that blocked prosecutors from discussing the statement that she gave the police in open court, Mr. Fusco waived his client's legal right to learn about evidence supporting the murder charge during the hearing. He also received permission from the presiding judge, Nestor Guzman, for a psychiatric examination of the mother.
Later, outside of court, Mr. Fusco said he would consider an insanity defense if the Passaic County prosecutor attempted to try the teenager as an adult. An assistant Passaic County prosecutor, Lisa Verlardi, told the judge that her office was considering trying the mother as an adult.
Mr. Fusco's portrayal of the young woman's life today was less positive than the account her cousin gave on Wednesday.
Mr. Fusco said that the woman's life had been stormy. Her parents are divorced and her mother is being treated for severe schizophrenia, he said. In the spring of 1998, about the time she became pregnant with the baby she is accused of killing, she was told to leave home, Mr. Fusco said. He declined to explain why, but said the pregnancy was not the reason. Later, the teenager's sister became her legal guardian, and she moved in with an aunt and her cousin Wanda Cruz, he said.
The woman dropped out of high school in November 1998, two months before her son was born. She and the father of the child, who never married, dated for several months after the baby's birth, Ms. Cruz said Wednesday. In recent months, she had begun evening classes in hopes of receiving a high school equivalency diploma and becoming a nurse's aide, she added.
Former co-workers at a department store in Wayne said the woman left a sales clerk job about two months ago to take a higher-paying office job, but Mr. Fusco said she was unemployed in recent months and had been depressed, with mood swings that had become more severe. "She can remember certain things, but she doesn't remember a lot of things," he said.
He scoffed at prosecutors' accusation that she threw the baby into the river because she wanted to visit a new boyfriend and was unable to find a baby sitter.
"There certainly were people who were available for that," he said.
An autopsy determined today that the baby, named Anthony, died of asphyxiation by drowning, said Boris Moczula, first assistant Passaic County prosecutor.
Mr. Fusco said he told the woman this morning that the baby's body had been found on Wednesday, about three miles downstream from the footbridge.
"Her color in her face just left it," he said. "It was instant tears."

HEADLINE: Bank Puts Its Money, and Its Name, on Staten Island Ballpark

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A Staten Island bank is giving its name -- and $400,000 a year for at least nine years -- to the new stadium that will house the Staten Island Yankees.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, at the stadium's groundbreaking yesterday, said money from the bank, Richmond County Bank, would be shared by the city, which will own the stadium, and the Yankees. In exchange, Mr. Giuliani said, the stadium will be known as the Richmond County Bank Ballpark at St. George. 
 The city has agreed to spend $71 million for parking, roads, shoreline reinforcement and the stadium itself, which is expected to be ready for opening day in 2001.
Yesterday's ceremony on Staten Island, coming at a time when the city has also begun construction of a minor league stadium for the Mets along the Coney Island Boardwalk, provoked fresh criticism from financial analysts. Even though critics could be expected to welcome any private money for the project, the bank agreement hardly muted arguments that the city's investment is excessive, particularly in support of minor league teams.
"There is no reason to believe a city's investment in a stadium will pay for itself in terms of economic development or tax revenues," said Ronnie Lowenstein, chief economist for the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group. She said the best that could be hoped was that stadium projects "shift economic activity across neighborhoods," perhaps benefiting the long-neglected neighborhoods of Coney Island and St. George.
The city has projected that the Coney Island stadium, like the one on Staten Island, will be ready to open next year.
Mr. Giuliani said that the Staten Island project had already increased real estate values in the St. George neighborhood, as investors and retail businesses moved in.
"I am singing with joy," said Guy V. Molinari, the borough president. Mr. Molinari criticized City Hall through much of the 1980's for neglecting Staten Island in economic development projects, but he now finds his borough, and particularly St. George, among the city's biggest recipients of public projects.
The city has budgeted $81 million to renovate the St. George Ferry Terminal and $20 million for a new National Lighthouse Museum, on land just east of the terminal.
The team's general manager, Jeff Dumas, said yesterday that the sale of naming rights for the stadium was included in an agreement in which the city and the Yankees would split the $400,000 a year pledged by the bank, but he added that the bank's payments could rise in the future on the basis of factors like attendance and advertising.
For use of the stadium, the Yankees have agreed to a 20-year lease, with yearly payments of up to $510,000, based on attendance.

Traditional Hollywood Exploring Dot-Com Entertainment

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 8

 BODY:
Mika Salmi says that he is always a little cautious when venturing into the wilds of Hollywood from his Atomfilms home base in Seattle.
"It's very fast in Hollywood," said Mr. Salmi, whose company produces short films on the Internet and sells them to outlets like airlines and shopping malls. "People are always coming to us, trying to buy us. We're not anti-Hollywood. The key is just not to get caught by them." 
 Over the last year or so, the once separate and distinct worlds of old-line Hollywood and the dot-coms of the new economy have been intermingling with increasing urgency, taking their first faltering steps toward the coming age of digital entertainment, whatever that might turn out to be. While the major studios, conservative as always, are largely maintaining a discreet distance from the roiling waters of the Web, many entertainment executives, filmmakers, celebrities and talent agencies have been plunging head-first into the digital deep end.
Hardly a week passes without the announcement of a new actor or director signing a deal with a dot-com to create exclusive digital films, or of a Hollywood insider proclaiming the acquisition or creation of a new venture.
"You have so many people in Hollywood who know so much about their business that they convince themselves that they know about every business," said David Wertheimer, chairman of WireBreak.com, which emphasizes interactive entertainment on its Web site. "They look at what's on the Web and they say, 'Hey, I can make better videos. I'll start my own dot-com.' They see so much attention and so much money going to these Internet guys and they think, 'Who's that pimply faced guy on the cover of Time Magazine? That's supposed to be me.' "
Hollywood has had to dodge or absorb a steady stream of challenges over the decades, from sound to color to television to videocassettes to independent films. Each one was predicted, at the time, to be the movie establishment's undoing. Yet each time, Hollywood not only persevered, but, eventually, overcame the threat. Now, while that may well happen again, many are wondering whether the hidebound studios have finally found an adversary they will be unable to dominate.
To Joe Roth -- a longtime movie executive who left the top job at Walt Disney Studios last year to start the just-introduced Revolution Studios, an independent production company, and who is also involved in two Internet ventures -- the issue is just that stark. "When all of this resolves itself," he asks, "who will be occupying the top tier?"
In other words, will the entertainment conglomerates own the dot-coms or -- as in the case of the America Online acquisition of Time Warner -- will the dot-coms own the entertainment conglomerates?
"I think this is definitely a time of confusion and opportunity," said Larry Kasanoff, a longtime feature-film producer whose Threshold Entertainment includes a dot-com operation aimed at attracting young males with a combination of sophomoric sitcoms, video-game sagas and models in bikinis. "Is this period going to be long enough that a bunch of dot-com start-ups will have time to get established? I don't know. I think, five years from now, we'll look back and a lot of these dot-coms will have been absorbed by the big studios. Others will have been able to use this confusion time to take their place in the landscape. We intend to be one of those."
The new entertainment dot-coms fall into a number of categories. Some offer so-called streaming video, usually live-action and animated shorts on the Internet, with a smattering of games and chat rooms and varying degrees of interactivity. Others are more business-to-business sites, connecting filmmakers with agents, with projects or with each other. Some are digital laboratories, aiming for a niche audience and, through the success or failure of their programming, providing an incubator for future movie and television projects. And many are just flat-out marketing tools, dedicated to the glories of a particular film or image-conscious celebrity.
As might be expected in a business where celebrity is the hottest commodity, many of the Hollywood dot-coms have been trying to outdo one another by signing up major actors and filmmakers. Shockwave.com, which creates Web-based animation software as well as maintaining its own destination site, has signed deals with filmmakers like James Brooks and David Lynch. Z.com, among whose backers is the manager turned mogul Brad Grey of Basic Entertainment, has signed deals with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the director Oliver Stone. And there are dozens of others.
The invasion of the dot-coms has been, as far as Hollywood is concerned, a relatively recent phenomenon. "If you look back to early 1999, there were maybe six or seven Internet sites offering streaming video in one form or another," said Rick Hess, president of Propaganda Films, which makes theatrical features as well as digital entertainment for the Web. "Today, there are maybe 75, and that number is going up. But everyone figures that, down the road, when the dust settles, there will only be maybe a dozen of them left."
Those in the Hollywood mainstream who have been counseling caution feel somewhat vindicated by the failure of recent Internet initial public offerings, and the precipitous drop in high-tech stock prices. And few can contain their delight at the collapse, last month, of one of the highest-profile of the entertainment dot-coms, the Digital Entertainment Network, even though its financial troubles were largely attributed to its profligate spending rather than to a flaw in the overall strategy of streaming video over the Internet.
No one in Hollywood expects that the venture will be the last entertainment dot-com to fail, and much of the discussion in recent weeks has been about which will go next.
"I've detected a real change," Mr. Wertheimer said, as people have reacted to the one-two punch of the Nasdaq plummet in April and the collapse of the DEN. Many of the players who were poised to jump into the dot-com waters have decided to pull back, or wait a little longer, he said, and some of those who are already in up to their eyeballs are getting a lot more cautious.
"I think that this may turn out to be Hollywood's Vietnam, with a lot of people rushing into this without a clear idea of why they're getting in," Mr. Wertheimer said. "We're going to see a lot of people retreating and declaring victory."
Handicapping the field has been particularly difficult, in part because there is no clear picture of where this is all headed and because so many of these new entertainment dot-coms have shifted their strategies in recent months in the face of rapidly changing technologies, increased competition and growing investor nervousness.
Ifilm, initially based in San Francisco and one of the early leaders, began as a site where filmmakers could post their digital shorts and try to find an audience. Now, it is based in Los Angeles and offers not only its own stable of shorts but also serves as a portal with easy-click access to digital entertainment all over the Web.
Pop.com, an Internet partnership between Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine Entertainment, was announced with a lot of fanfare last October as a site that would be up and running this spring, offering original short "pops" of entertainment featuring some of Hollywood's top performers and filmmakers. But Pop.com is still not online and there are reports that its principals are retooling their Internet strategy.
When this wave of dot-coms took off, much of the initial momentum was toward building so-called destination sites, aimed at grabbing and holding an audience, preferably the 12-to-24-year-old males who drive so much of popular entertainment. Now, however, with a lot of destinations but with a scarcity of things to watch there, many of the new start-ups and some of the older ones have turned their attention elsewhere. Several companies have announced, or intend to announce soon, that they will spend more time and energy on creating content for others' sites than for themselves.
No one has a real clue where all this will end. "We are in the middle, right now, of speeding toward some future unknown environment," said Morgan Rector, president of the Imperial Bank Entertainment Group, one of the financial institutions most active in underwriting feature films.
The Hollywood establishment is worried that with the Internet offering the promise of new ways to distribute movies while also competing for eyeballs and entertainment dollars, the new order might well upset longstanding financial arrangements. And, just as significantly, there are worries that what has happened to the pop music business -- with songs being swapped and pirated on the Internet beyond the reach of record company accountants -- will happen with movies, too, if firm protections are not put in place fast.
The dot-coms, meanwhile, worry about being transformed into just another division of a profit-hungry global media conglomerate that will prevent them from expanding and exploding outdated entertainment concepts. "They always said that Hollywood runs on fear and greed, and it's definitely true," Mr. Salmi said. "The greed kicks in when they look at all the dot-com millions. The fear is, 'Oh my gosh, we'd better act quickly or we'll miss something big.' "
To some, there is a bit of a lemming-like quality to the way so many independent producers and former studio bosses have announced the formation of their own start-ups, as though having a dot-com in your roster of in-house activities is now as essential as getting the best table at Spago or the Grill.
"In a way, it's like, if you don't have that as part of your dialogue over lunch at the Grill, then you're not with it," Mr. Hess said.
Hollywood is meeting the dot-coms in a variety of ways. Each of the major studios has its own in-house Web operation. Some, like Warner Brothers Entertaindom.com or Sony's Station.com offer original entertainment and games. Others, however, are simply marketing devices for coming releases.
But the heavy action has been in Internet start-up companies.
Mr. Roth, for instance, has hired John Hegeman, one of the people responsible for the successful "Blair Witch Project" Internet marketing campaign, to create Distantcorners.com, a site specializing in horror and science fiction. And he bought a substantial interest in Mediatrip.com, which his Revolution Studios intends to use as a marketing tool for his feature films and as an incubator for new characters and offbeat stories.
Robert Cooper, former head of production at DreamWorks, recently announced the creation of a new Internet start-up, which will be aimed at creating digital content for a variety of Web sites.
Indeed, in interviews with more than a dozen top entertainment executives, every one had either started his own dot-com, bought an interest in somebody else's, or claimed he was just waiting for the perfect moment to announce a new dot-com strategy.
There is more here, they all insisted, than smoke and mirrors. "I believe it," Mr. Cooper said. "I'm betting my money on it."

HEADLINE: A Pattern of Unsolved Greek Terrorism Cases

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The killing of a British diplomat in Athens today came in the midst of a growing debate in Washington over Greece's record in curbing anti-Western terrorism within its borders.
Only on Monday, a bipartisan American commission on terrorism recommended that the Clinton administration consider imposing sanctions on Greece for failing to fully cooperate with the United States in combatting terrorism. 
 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright quickly dismissed the call for sanctions, yet officials throughout Washington expressed frustration with Greece's continued failure to solve terrorism cases, particularly actions directed at Americans.
The failure of Greek authorities to solve anti-American terrorism cases over a 25-year period has turned the group called November 17 into one of the most mysterious and most successful terrorist groups in the world.
American and Greek officials do not even know the names of the group's leaders.
Since 1975, four American officials have been killed in Greece, but no arrests have been made in any of the killings.
Greece is "one of the weakest links in Europe," the State Department's latest annual report on terrorism observed. With 20 acts of violence last year against United States government and other American targets, both people and property, Greece was second in the world, after Colombia, in the number of anti-American terrorist attacks.
"The absence of strong public government leadership contributed to the lack of breakthroughs against terrorists" in Greece, the State Department said in its annual terrorist report. "Popular opinion makers generally downplayed terrorism as a threat to public order."
November 17, the group believed to be responsible for today's killing, is the same Marxist cell that officials believe is behind a string of unsolved murders of American diplomats in the country. The group announced its existence with the 1975 killing of Richard Welch, the Central Intelligence Agency's Athens station chief. The group's name refers to Nov. 17, 1973, when dozens of demonstrators were killed as the Greek Army suppressed a student protest in Athens.
The United States was a supporter of Greece's ruling junta, and American diplomats have been prime targets of the group ever since. Among the worst incidents were the 1983 killings of George Tsantes, an American naval officer and his chauffeur, and the 1988 murder of an American military attache, William E. Nordeen.
The lack of progress by investigators has led to a perception among American officials, and even within Greece, that Greek officials have turned a blind eye to November 17's activities.
"I believe that there are people throughout the U.S. counterterrorism community who are convinced that there are some Greek officials who over the last quarter century have had important information on 17 November and have not acted on it or shared it with us," said one former senior United States government official.
But a former American intelligence official who served in Greece and investigated November 17 said the idea of a link between the group and the Greek government is a myth.
"The real story is just that the Greek police are inept," he said. "They are just incredibly sloppy."
The police failures have led the terrorists to taunt the authorities.
The November 17 attackers have used the same .45-caliber pistol in most of its killings dating all the way back to Mr. Welch, switching only briefly to a 9-millimeter in a few incidents.

HEADLINE: Death Toll in Congo's 2-Year War Is at Least 1.7 Million, Study Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 8

 BODY:
Two years of war have caused the deaths of more than 1.7 million people in eastern Congo, where people who manage to flee the fighting often die of hunger and malaria while hiding in impenetrable forests, a leading refugee agency said today.
This means that about four times as many people have died in the area since August 1998 as would be expected under normal conditions, according to a study released by the agency, the International Rescue Committee in New York. 
 Although the expected death toll in the five-province area of 18 million people would be 600,000, the actual number was 2.3 million. Of the 1.7 million additional deaths reported in the survey, 200,000 were caused by acts of violence, whereas the rest were attributed to the war-related collapse of health services and food supplies.
"Men with guns come and wreak havoc on a very regular basis," said Les Roberts, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University, who supervised the study for the agency. "Those men cause more death by making people flee their homes than actually by shooting or slitting throats.
"People flee into the forest when a village is attacked, often at night. If they get a little sick and they are not eating, they often die. One girl told us how she fled her village at night with her family of eight. Five of the eight died as they hid in the forest."
The survey was conducted in April and May, with random samplings of houses in and around Moba, in Katanga Province; Kabare, Katana and Kolonge in South Kivu; and Kisangani in Orientale Province. Researchers asked residents questions like how many people were in the family, whether anyone had died since last Christmas, a major holiday among the many Roman Catholics in the region, and how many died last year.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, where Mr. Roberts formerly worked, provided baseline statistics for sub-Sahara Africa. The results from the region, with a population of 1.2 million, were extrapolated to the interior regions and neighboring provinces.
"We have done what scientists hate to do, extrapolate from 1.2 million people to 18 million people," Mr. Roberts said. "But have very consistently made conservative assumptions. I think we have protected ourselves from the criticisms that we are being extremists or hyperbolic."
When he finished his survey, Mr. Roberts asked the United Nations relief assistance coordinator for the area and a representative of the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the region to look over his findings. They thought that he might have been conservative, Mr. Roberts recounted.
Everywhere he and his team found abandoned health clinics, local economies in shatters and families struggling without the subsistence agriculture or barter systems that had sustained them, he said. Children younger than 5, the study said, account for more than one-third of the excess deaths in eastern Congo, an area disrupted since 1994 by waves of ethnic and civil wars, sometimes indistinguishable from armed scrambles for gold and diamonds.
Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into Congo, the former Zaire, in August 1998 in support of rebels opposed to the government of President Laurent Kabila. Last summer, Rwandan and Ugandan troops turned on each other, and they have been fighting each other this week around a diamond center, Kisangani, adding at least 50 additional civilian deaths to the toll.
Today, Secretary General Kofi Annan spoke with Presidents Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and he was assured that a cease-fire, not the first in recent weeks, went into effect this afternoon. But hours later, Ugandan and Rwandan troops were fighting in Kisangani, Reuters reported.
Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United Nations and the president of the Security Council this month, said the council members "deplore the loss of life and the damage inflicted by the forces of Uganda and Rwanda on the Congolese population."
In the International Rescue Committee report, Kisangani had been found to be one of the brighter spots in an extremely bleak picture of life in one of Africa's potentially richest countries. The United Nations had hoped to make the city a neutral site where a large contingent of peacekeeping troops could be based and political negotiations begun to end the Congo war.
The study found that eastern Congo has become "an unchecked incubation zone for disease."
Mr. Roberts said malaria and diarrheal diseases, including cholera, appeared to be the leading causes of death, although meningitis and suspected cases of polio were also found.
Because blood transfusions are often needed for malaria victims, he said, "my strong gut feeling is that the prevalence of H.I.V. has increased."
H.I.V., which causes AIDS, and other deadly viruses are known to have flourished in Congo. "Congo has something like the 14th highest death rate on the planet," Mr. Roberts said. Most of the other 13 countries are in sub-Sahara Africa.
"There has been no blood tested in this region since 1998," he added.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN C.E.O. -- A special report.;
Gore Dots the i's That Bush Leaves to Others

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8

 BODY:
The vice president just was not satisfied. A team of graphic artists had labored to come up with a logo to emblazon on Al Gore's campaign buttons, bumper stickers and placards, but he felt they had failed to capture the right spirit. So he sketched an alternative, a swoosh and a star -- a simple, futuristic look with the words, "Gore 2000."
"I took several of the suggested designs and kind of recombined them and added a different approach," Mr. Gore said. "I sat down and drew that on the table with the people who had made suggestions." 
 It never occurred to Gov. George W. Bush to do that. When his staff presented him with a proposal for a blocky, traditional logo featuring an American flag and the words, "George W. Bush For President," his response was to the point.
"I just looked at it and said, 'It looks good,' " Mr. Bush recalled.
It may seem like a small thing, but Mr. Gore's keen interest in the signature of his campaign and Mr. Bush's admitted lack of interest perfectly capture the stark differences in how they are running for president.
Mr. Gore's fingerprints are on every major move or pronouncement. He prides himself on making decisions based on his judgment, built on nearly 8 years in the White House and 16 years in Congress, and not on the views of his advisers.
The vice president immerses himself in policy, and often even in logistical matters. Recently, when he was in a rush to travel from New York to Washington, Mr. Gore announced that he was scuttling Air Force Two because he would make better time on the US Airways shuttle. His stunned military and Secret Service aides knew not to try to talk him out of it.
Mr. Bush, by contrast, is far more removed from specifics. He prefers to surround himself with people he trusts. Once he feels comfortable that they understand his philosophy, he leaves them to come up with proposals for him to sign off on. Notably, it was Mr. Bush's aides, not the candidate, who plotted a course of action when the campaign was in crisis after Mr. Bush lost the New Hampshire primary.
The unmistakable contrasts in how Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore make decisions, handle pressure and relate to their advisers offer revealing insights into how they would run their presidencies. In extensive interviews, officials from both campaigns sought to play up anecdotes that showed that their candidate would operate most effectively in the Oval Office.
Mr. Gore's supporters say his impressive knowledge base allows him to comfortably make informed decisions. Mr. Bush's backers argue that his lower level of engagement is a virtue because the governor is not burdened by needless detail.
Still, it is possible to move beyond the campaigns' spin to see striking differences in the candidates' approaches.
Mr. Gore bases his decisions on devouring information and reaching a reasoned conclusion; Mr. Bush operates more on gut instinct. Mr. Gore often lectures his advisers; Mr. Bush expects his to tell him what he needs to know.
Mr. Gore happily debates policy minutiae; Mr. Bush prefers to speed through meetings to get to the heart of the matter. Mr. Gore is not bashful about sitting at a laptop and rewriting speeches; Mr. Bush prefers using a black Sharpie marker to delete sections or change a word here or there.
The vice president's aides say he sometimes sees himself as the smartest person in the room, and often he is right. Mr. Bush's aides say he likes to joke to assembled advisers about holes in his knowledge, which is a healthy sign, they say, of confidence.
Mr. Gore scours the newspapers and, often several times a day, will cut out an obscure detail or paragraph and hand it to an aide with instructions. He tries to read every word written about him. Mr. Bush's aides said the governor read about himself from time to time, but preferred to have his wife, Laura, or others sum up what was written about him.
Neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Bush is the stereotypical empty suit manipulated by handlers. If anything, both candidates tend to be stubborn, often not yielding to their advisers' suggestions. Not surprisingly, both are sensitive to caricatures: Mr. Gore as a control freak drowning in specifics who discounts others' opinions or Mr. Bush as a naive puppet.
Insisting in an interview that his artistry on the logo was "the exception rather than the rule," Mr. Gore said he tried "to avoid getting bogged down in details." He made clear that his style was not like that of President Jimmy Carter, who obsessed over the schedule at the White House tennis courts, or President Calvin Coolidge, who scrutinized guest lists at White House parties.
Even so, Mr. Gore asserted that his grasp of policy would be invaluable in the White House. "I like the broad brush strokes," he said. "But sometimes a significant detail is actually a broad brush stroke in disguise. Sometimes, a significant detail can be a fulcrum around which the rest of the issue turns."
Mr. Bush made no excuses for his gaps in knowledge. "I don't think anybody knows everything about every subject, and anyone who pretends they do is someone I don't want to be the president, because this is a complicated world," he said in an interview. "The key to the presidency is to set divisions, to lay out the parameters by which decisions will be made and to encourage really good, competent people to serve the country for the right reasons and to build a team."
 
A Force Behind Decisions
"I'm not a figurehead here!" the vice president snapped, after a cluster of aides had failed to adequately brief him about an event in New Hampshire in the primaries. "I've got to know what's going on in this campaign."
If anything, that was an understatement. The reality is that Mr. Gore is the driving force behind virtually every big decision of his campaign, and many small ones. His propensity to run things himself has not scared off talented aides. But Mr. Gore often turns to them more as resources to press forward with his own decisions rather than as principal decision makers.
At a meeting in late May of his closest advisers at his residence at the Naval Observatory here, Mr. Gore offhandedly told them he had settled on a new campaign strategy. He would halt the relentless attacks on Mr. Bush that some Democrats feared were doing Mr. Gore more harm than good.
"He said, 'That's what I'm going to do,' " recalled Carter Eskew, one of Mr. Gore's top advisers. "Then he laid out a series of things, like family issues, that became the basis of the next two weeks."
Some advisers had felt it was important that Mr. Gore stay on the offensive. But no one dared to challenge him. "When you work with somebody, you know when there's an opening -- and when there isn't," Mr. Eskew said. "He was emphatic."
Mr. Gore's aides also winced when he told them he would propose a sweeping reform of the campaign finance system. Many thought he would be ridiculed because of the questions surrounding his own fund-raising practices in 1996. Others worried that the issue was not a big vote-getter.
Repeatedly, they tried to distract Mr. Gore by saying other matters needed attention first.
"We'd divert him into some other areas and he'd say, 'What about that speech?' " said Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman.
Such delay tactics, Mr. Eskew conceded, were "a way to try to kill it."
Yet Mr. Gore persisted. "It did not give me pause," the vice president said of the objections.
Mr. Gore is similarly never hesitant about upending speeches or events. Early last month, when he was traveling on Air Force Two from Washington to Chicago, he abruptly discarded a health care speech after reading a clipping from a morning newspaper saying that the National Rifle Association was thrilled at the prospect of a Bush presidency.
Mr. Gore, who was traveling to a conference of health care reporters, summoned aides to his cabin and announced that he would talk about gun violence. The hook: that easy access to handguns is a health care issue.
His aides said they argued against it, but Mr. Gore did not budge. After Air Force Two landed, Mr. Gore kept the motorcade waiting while he worked the phones. He called one aide in Washington about statistics he remembered that had been put out by the American Medical Association.
"I asked her to quickly find out whether or not I was right in remembering that the A.M.A. had done a big statement or publication on the handgun and the health care issue," Mr. Gore said, "and find relevant statistics on it. She found the statistics that I said I needed."
He then instructed his staff to rewrite the speech.
That was hardly an exception. After Mr. Gore's advisers drafted a statement for him last December that castigated his own administration's policy on gays in the military, the vice president thought it was too weak. So he wrote a harder-edged statement himself, over the objections of several advisers. "We thought it would kill him in the South," one said.
Then, when Mr. Bush announced his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion over five years, Mr. Gore told his aides, "We need to respond quickly." Riding in a sport utility vehicle headed to Ida Grove, Iowa, from Sioux City, he began calling experts like Lawrence H. Summers, the treasury secretary, and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser.
Often, Mr. Sperling said, the vice president is "searching for his own formulation, and he's looking for you to deliver the facts he needs to make the argument the way he wants."
Mr. Sperling said Mr. Gore had quizzed him with questions like "How does it compare with the House tax cut?" and "Will this consume all of the budget surplus?"
Mr. Gore attacked the tax plan at an open meeting and then again at a news conference, saying it would squander the surplus.
Sometimes, Mr. Gore plays scheduler. On the morning after the Iowa caucuses, he and his aides were operating on virtually no sleep. Finally, his entourage made it to a hotel in Nashua, N.H., for a few hours' nap before the one scheduled event of the day.
But just as two aides, Michael Feldman and Chris Lehane, were falling asleep in their shared hotel room, Mr. Gore came banging on the door. "Go away," Mr. Lehane shouted, not realizing it was the vice president.
Finally, the two aides, wearing boxer shorts, opened the door. Mr. Gore, clad in a bathrobe with his schedule in hand, demanded, "This is all we're doing today?"
"Sir," Mr. Feldman reminded him, "there's six inches of snow on the ground."
It was no use. The aides, reluctantly, added an MTV event to the schedule and a photo opportunity: they delivered coffee to the local snow crews.
Because of his deep involvement in decisions, Mr. Gore cannot blame his advisers for ones that go awry, like how he distanced himself from President Clinton on Elian Gonzalez.
"It wasn't like we dragged him kicking and screaming," a top adviser said.
 
A Corporate Executive's Touch
Mr. Bush is not inclined to alter a speech sharply or a schedule on the fly. He behaves more like a corporate executive. His aides welcome the comparison to President Ronald Reagan, who did not dither with details and set out broad goals, despite being ridiculed as out of touch.
Even at the most turbulent moment of Mr. Bush's campaign, after his humiliating loss to Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, the governor stuck to his policy.
First, Mr. Bush made clear to his aides that he was distressed with the state of the campaign, telling them that it had to be more aggressive and not watch idly as Mr. McCain persuaded voters that he was the only reformer in the race. Then, rather than dictate remedies, Mr. Bush dispatched his aides to come up with suggestions.
"He laid out the principles of what he thought went right and wrong in New Hampshire," said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist. "Then we came up with options that were presented to him formally and informally over a couple days. He accepted them and rejected a few."
It was a far cry from what Mr. Gore did last September, when former Senator Bill Bradley began surging in polls. Without consulting his aides, Mr. Gore uprooted his listless operation in Washington and moved it to Nashville. "I announced we were going to do it," he recalled, "and that was it."
Mr. Bush's aides could not cite a time when the governor, responding to Mr. Gore or a news development, had ripped up a speech and turned a day's schedule on its head.
"We try to control our own agenda," said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director and one of his closest aides. "That doesn't mean that he's inflexible. When Cardinal O'Connor passed away, the governor wanted to attend the funeral. That's an example of something that changed."
But even the decision to attend the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor came at the suggestion of an aide, not Mr. Bush. "I don't think it initially came from him," Ms. Hughes said.
It would be unfair, though, to portray Mr. Bush as passive. He does not hesitate to overrule his advisers, and when he does he is often guided more by instinct than policy.
After reviewing a speech he was due to deliver on Social Security before a group of newspaper publishers in May, Ms. Hughes said, Mr. Bush was puzzled by the content because he was scheduled to deliver a Social Security address the next week. She recalled: "He turned around and looked at me: 'Why are we talking about just Social Security? Why aren't we talking about the importance of reforming education and rebuilding the military?' " The speech was retooled.
Before the South Carolina primary, Mr. Bush's advertising team had produced a commercial that opened with black-and-white shots of lobbyists in cigars in a smoke-filled room. The intent was to portray Senator McCain as in the pocket of lobbyists.
But Mr. Bush rejected the commercial as too harsh. Mark McKinnon, Mr. Bush's media consultant, said: "He was very affirmative about it: 'This isn't going out under my name.' It was not a debatable point."
Mr. McKinnon said he argued that because of time pressure it was not advisable to change the spot. "Listen, this was in the pressure cooker of South Carolina and minutes mattered," he said. The governor prevailed and the shots of the lobbyists were pulled.
And the night Mr. Bush defeated Mr. McCain in the Virginia primary, his aides had prepared a blistering victory speech. But in his heavy black marker, Mr. Bush deleted several pages of the most negative sections about Mr. McCain. For example, he kept the sentence, "On the next step of welfare reform, he has no plan." But he crossed out the next sentence: "His policy agenda is narrow and shallow, and it makes no place for the poor and the forgotten and the frail."
"The feeling was we needed to keep the pressure on Senator McCain," Ms. Hughes said. "I told him there was a lot of frustration at headquarters." She said Mr. Bush telephoned several aides to explain that he did not want to undermine them, but felt that the speech was too strident.
 
Candidates of Divergent Styles
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore fume when staff members arrive late for meetings. They have little tolerance for aides who are not prepared. Yet their styles are quite different. Mr. Gore is more like a sometimes overbearing teacher, while Mr. Bush often plays the impatient student.
The governor prefers oral presentations to leafing through briefing books. "I've seen the governor say, 'Why don't you close the book and tell me what you think is most important?' " Ms. Hughes said. "He gets to the heart of the matter."
Donald L. Evans, the campaign chairman and Mr. Bush's best friend, put it this way, "His classic question is, 'Have you told me everything I need to know?' "
While Mr. Bush's biggest peeve at meetings is when aides leave their cell phones or pagers on, he is also known for not abiding long-winded presentations.
"He doesn't sit there and let a briefing go on that isn't a good use of his time," said Josh Bolten, his domestic policy adviser. "You get maybe 60 seconds in. If there's a really good briefer who's doing a good job, you might get three or four minutes before he's interrupted."
Mr. Bush is not bashful about pleading ignorance, and will even joke about how he failed a reporter's pop quiz on foreign policy.
"If he doesn't know, he'll say, 'Hold it,' " Mr. Bolten said. "If somebody uses an acronym he doesn't know, he'll stop them and say, 'What does that mean?' Sometimes he says, 'Use plain English.' He's not afraid to say when he doesn't know."
Explaining Mr. Bush's aversion to too much detail about the campaign's finances, Mr. Evans said: "We talk about the budget a fair amount. All he wants to know is, 'Are we under or over?' "
While Mr. Bush has no use for flip charts, aides said, Mr. Gore often draws charts on an easel. "Some days I think he is a professor," said Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.
Even Mr. Gore acknowledged that his grasp of issues, and his certainty about how to proceed, could be intimidating. "I think sometimes a young staffer or a new staffer who hasn't gone through the process before may feel sometimes a little hesitant to speak up in disagreement," he said. "But it doesn't last long because I try to encourage it."
Still, some who know Mr. Gore worry that his vast knowledge can sometimes lead him to foreclose other points of view.
"Gore comes off to me as a guy who has absolute confidence in what should be done and really isn't all that interested in what you think substantively," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who supported Mr. Gore in the primaries. "Al is interested in getting briefed, forming an opinion and then it's settled. That reflects a political certitude: a guy who will make decisions a la Harry Truman and go home and go to sleep. Except Truman operated on a gut assessment based on a historical context. Al operates on an intellectual assessment that doesn't accommodate much input."
Mr. Gore also compared his style to Harry Truman's. But he said that was a positive attribute.
"I'm a big fan of Harry Truman's philosophy," he said. "The essence of it was: 'Go ahead and make good decisions and then move on to the next decision.' Right. You live with the consequences and you get better as you go along."
 
Two Views of Logos
The operating approaches of Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush not only reflect their experiences but also their personalities and interests. Mr. Gore had a deep interest in his campaign's logo -- as well as in helping dream up a logo for the Democratic National Convention -- because he has dabbled himself in painting and thinks political branding is important.
"I've always felt that logos and other visual symbols that are seen over and over and over again actually are pretty important," Mr. Gore said. "And if you get one that really hangs together well, it's much better than having one that's kind of mediocre."
But Mr. Bush does not share that passion. In fact, asked about his logo, he replied, "You mean what's on the bumper sticker and stuff?" Saying that such artistic endeavors would waste his time, he added, "There are people smarter than me on designing logos."

NATIONAL CITY SAYS ITSOLD $2 BILLION IN STUDENT LOANS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The National City Corporation, Ohio's largest bank, said yesterday that it had sold $2 billion in student loans as part of a move to protect earnings from rising interest rates. The sale will result in a second-quarter pretax gain of $75 million. National City, which declined to identify the buyers, will use the proceeds to make new loans at higher rates. The company, based in Cleveland, also warned that some steps being considered to lower its financing costs might mean selling some of its investments, mostly bonds, at a loss.

HEADLINE: Albany Agrees On Plan to Aid Nassau County

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 8

 BODY:
After weeks of brinkmanship, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature have agreed to spend $105 million to bail out Nassau County and impose state oversight of county spending, in an effort to avert financial collapse in one of the nation's wealthiest regions.
The lawmakers also agreed to let New York City increase its borrowing by $4 billion, skirting a legal restriction that could have put a halt to the city's construction projects by the end of the year. 
 Both the New York City and Nassau County measures were part of a broad package to aid local governments, including the troubled school systems in Buffalo and Yonkers, that had been linked to each other in the annual frenzy of horse-trading as the Legislature nears the end of its session.
Having racked up huge deficits in a booming economy, and threatened with having its bonds downgraded to junk status, Nassau County will have to make deep budget cuts in return for the state aid. It also faces the continued threat that the state will take absolute control of the county's finances. The conditions of the deal will force Nassau to pare back one of the most generous arrays of public services -- in schools, parks, police protection, among others -- anywhere in the country.
"They should be able to do it," said State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Nassau. "They have no choice. Albany has forced the local officials to end the political gridlock that existed in Nassau County, and to start meaningful, structural reform."
The county's financial troubles, and attempts last year to deal with them by imposing a tax on real estate sales, prompted a backlash against County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and the Republican machine that has governed Nassau almost uninterrupted since the county was created in 1898. Last November, Democrats took control of the County Legislature for the first time, and Republican state legislators from the county fear that the rebellion could spread to their races.
The bailout is essentially the one proposed last month by Mr. Pataki, with minor revisions. Winning approval for it is a victory for him, but it comes with potential perils. As the author of the plan and the person who appoints most of the oversight board, he stands to collect much of the credit if the county gets back on its feet, and much of the blame if it does not.
Under the deal, the state will give the county $105 million outright over the next five years, including $30 million this year. It is an extraordinary step -- New York City received only loans, not gifts, from the state during its fiscal crisis, and when Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt in 1994, it pulled itself out of its troubles with no state aid of any kind.
The state will create a Nassau Interim Finance Authority both to oversee the county's finances and to sell bonds on better terms than the county would be able to get on the market. In recent weeks, the Democrats who control the Assembly had called for two agencies, one for oversight and one to sell bonds, but in the end, they dropped that demand.
In return for the state aid, Nassau must make $50 million in budget cuts this year, and $70 million in each of the next three years. If it does not, the state will impose a financial control board, essentially stripping Mr. Gulotta and the County Legislature of much of their power.
"That's the very serious threat in this package," said Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Nassau Democrat. "It enforces a level of discipline that the local people have not been able to enforce."
Mr. Gulotta said that he welcomed the bailout package and that as soon as he had the bill in hand, would ask the County Legislature for a "home rule message," which is needed for the State Legislature to act.
In talks over the last few weeks, the State Senate's Republican majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had said his house would raise New York City's debt ceiling by $2.5 billion, and the Senate passed a bill to that effect. But that figure would get the city through barely two more years, meaning that the next mayor, most likely a Democrat, would hit the limit in his first year in office.
The Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, threatened to block the Nassau bailout unless Albany increased the city's borrowing authority by $4 billion and delivered aid to Buffalo schools.
Several Assembly members said that Mr. Silver's stance, weeks after he beat back a coup attempt by fellow Democrats, would help shore up his support among members from New York City and Erie County.
While all sides wanted a deal, lawmakers had begun to worry that the Legislature could adjourn for the year next Wednesday without a compromise.
In the end, both sides backed down, with Mr. Bruno agreeing to the $4 billion figure. Mr. Silver dropped the insistence on two Nassau agencies and compromised on his demand for more Democratic representation on the oversight board.
Mr. Pataki had proposed that the board have three members appointed by him, one by Mr. Bruno and one by Mr. Silver. Today, they agreed to add two more members, one named by the governor and one by Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat. All seven must live in the county.
New York City's borrowing problem lies with a Depression-era state law that put a ceiling on borrowing, through a formula based on property assessments.
The law is a relic of an era when the primary source of local revenue was property taxes; today, for New York City, it is the personal income tax, making the worth of real estate far less relevant to city finances. Also, the assessments tend to lag behind real-world prices, so that in good times, the debt limit rises more slowly than city revenues and the demand for borrowing.
State lawmakers raised the city's borrowing limit in 1996, but the city is rapidly approaching the new cap. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and other officials have warned that without another increase, within months the city would be unable to embark on new capital projects.
"It would have been impractical for them to undertake any kind of long-term projects," Mr. Silver said. "This gives them the ability pay for roads, bridges, schools and the like."
The city had asked for a change in the way its debt ceiling is calculated, which would require a change in the State Constitution, but that proposal went nowhere. Still, it won a reprieve of about four years until it has to ask the state to raise the cap once again.
The overall agreement reached today includes $45 million in aid to Buffalo's schools, and $10 million to Yonkers's. In each case, it is a mix of outright aid and zero-interest loans.

HEADLINE: Facing the Ghost of Summers Past;
Hope Dies Hard at Coney Island, and So Does Nostalgia

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
Even now, after all the dashed hopes and nowhere promises, the old-timers and tourists and politicians cling like rust to the distant fantasy that Coney Island will be what it once was, as if the great cultural and demographic tides that built and then laid waste to the place were merely boardwalk phantasms.
Every summer brings the same ritualistic claims that Coney Island is rebounding, that the old carny magic lurks just around the bend. With the regularity of Elvis sightings, rumors sweep through the Surf Avenue grease joints and thrift shops that scouts from Disney are sniffing about, searching with fat checkbooks for the next Times Square. 
 So it has gone this season, though Coney Island remains pretty much what it was 30 years ago -- a cliche of seedy decay, a shrunken little strip of mostly second-rate amusements set against a charmless backdrop of high-rise housing projects.
This time, there are grand plans from City Hall: a $31 million seafront stadium for a Mets farm team and $30 million more for a boardwalk face lift, including new bathrooms, information kiosks and volleyball nets. The city has carved out, subject to future budget approvals, another $30 million to build athletic and entertainment facilities in Coney Island and elsewhere in south Brooklyn.
But the prospect of $91 million in new public spending is raising provocative questions about Coney Island's past and future. Should Coney Island lash itself tighter still to the remarkable history that put it on the map? Or is nostalgia more a dead weight than an anchor?
Kevin Baker, who lovingly celebrated Coney Island's heyday in his historical novel, "Dreamland" (HarperCollins, 1999), believes that it is time for Coney Island "to move past the dream." For decades, he said, the community has been paralyzed by what it once was -- a vast, swirling kaleidoscope of a million lights, a hotel shaped like an elephant, a city of dwarfs, a young Cary Grant on stilts, Boss Tweed on the run, a Murder Inc. informer falling to his death from a sixth-floor window.
George Tilyou, the peerless entrepreneur who opened Steeplechase Park in 1897, once said, "If Paris is France, Coney Island, between June and September, is the world."
Yet on a recent rainy afternoon, after leading a small group on a walking tour of Coney Island, Mr. Baker stated what to many was painfully obvious: "I don't think it will ever be quite what it once was."
He stood before the Thunderbolt, an abandoned 1926 roller coaster that is literally being pulled apart by bushes and vines that have wrapped around the tracks like the tentacles of an octopus. "One of the great ruins in America," he called it, before asking ever so gently, "Would that $91 million be better spent building up better housing?
"The people here," he said, "they've been through a lot and they deserve better."
Thousands of low-income families live within a few miles of the Coney Island boardwalk. Many are holed up in high-rise projects that are crumbling from age and neglect, their window air-conditioners blowing a death rattle that can be heard from the street.
In the thrift shops -- most nothing more than converted cargo containers -- mothers search through mounds of musty clothes to buy $2 Superman pajamas for their sons. Russian pensioners wander discount furniture stores, gingerly trying out cheap mattresses. Panhandlers hit on the tourists lining up for their Authentic Hot Dog Moment in Nathan's, though the uniqueness of that experience seems in question now that Nathan's can be found in highway rest stops.
Among these struggling residents the wisdom of spending $91 million on recreational facilities is sometimes elusive.
"I don't get it," said Jorge Ruiz, 53, who scrapes by on modest disability checks. "I love the boardwalk and I like baseball, but what about our schools and our streets and our old people? These are real problems that we face right now, today."
In the shadow of that giant coat rack, the rusting 271-foot Parachute Jump, bulldozers are already at work on the old Steeplechase Park site, making way for the new stadium. Coney Island residents have been burned too many times to break into any victory dances. The baseball stadium idea has been kicked around since the mid-1980's, and memories are still fresh of Horace Bullard, the fried chicken king who spent a decade pitching extravagant plans for a new amusement park on the very same Steeplechase site.
There also remains strong opposition from the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, who thinks it is a waste to build a 6,500-seat stadium that will be used fewer than 40 times a year by a lowly single-A ball club. Mr. Golden's staff is scrutinizing the proposal to determine whether it can be scuttled in court. "This is a private deal on public park land with no economic return that really does very little for the people of Coney Island," said Greg Brooks, Mr. Golden's chief of staff.
Mr. Golden's criticisms no doubt have roots in his dislike of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the prime mover behind the stadium proposal. But even proponents of the $91 million package -- overwhelmingly approved by City Council in April -- confess to some ambivalence about pouring so much money into a struggling, run-down boardwalk in the face of the surrounding distress.
City Councilman Herbert E. Berman of Brooklyn, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee and a key negotiator in the deal, said he had struggled to come to grips with the issue. The thrift stores, he said, are "shabby." The Thunderbolt, he acknowledged, is "disgusting." But, he added: "Cities do not live by housing alone. You've got to have culture."
Mr. Berman, who grew up in Coney Island and still recalls the red glow that filled the night sky when Luna Park burned in 1944, argued that a revived boardwalk, Coney Island's calling card to the world, would generate jobs and growth that would inevitably trickle down to the neighborhoods. There are investors and property owners, he predicted, who are just waiting for a little nudge to jump back in.
The baseball stadium's fiercest critics acknowledge the power of Coney Island's legacy. If there is a third rail in Brooklyn politics, it is upholding a strict reverence for Brooklyn's fabled history. And so Jeannette Gadson, the deputy borough president, waxes nostalgic about returning Coney Island to the glory of her childhood even as she ridicules the stadium proposal.
"I'm not giving up on my memories because Coney Island is what Brooklyn is all about," she said on Wednesday, after leading local civic leaders on an inspection tour of the boardwalk. "Coney Island is Brooklyn. It's like giving up on the Dodgers. You can't give up on that. You can't give up on your own history."
Ric Burns, a filmmaker and a close student of New York City history who directed the 1991 documentary "Coney Island," said there was a stubbornness and resiliency about the place. He called it a product of the "completely inextinguishable" optimism of Coney Island die-hards, and he fondly quoted the late Brooklyn historian Elliot Willensky, who said of Coney Island's prospects, "When land and water meet, wonderful things always happen."
Mr. Burns warned against writing off a revival of the old Coney Island, at least as long as the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel continue to draw hundreds of thousands of people there on summer weekends. The story of Coney Island, he said, is one of cliffhangers and strange plot twists. In the 1890's, he noted, no one would have predicted that Coney Island was about to become home to three incredible amusement parks -- Dreamland, Luna and Steeplechase -- that together drew a million visitors a day. Nor, he said, would anyone have predicted in the 1920's that Coney Island had already reached its peak. Its long decline was hastened by television, air-conditioned movie theaters, corporate amusement parks, suburbs, cars, highways.
So, Mr. Burns asked, who is to say that it cannot be what it once was? And who is to say that minor league baseball, with its affordable appeal to Coney Island's traditional base of middle-class patrons, will not be the catalyst to make it happen?
"One of these dreams is going to take off," he said, asserting that what Coney Island really needs is 20,000 new parking spaces and better exit ramps off the Belt Parkway. "I'm convinced it will happen."
And on a warm May day, so is Kenny Kaufman, 27, the third generation of his family to make a living off Coney Island's boardwalk. With his father, Norman Kaufman, he has invested at least $1 million over the last decade in batting cages, two go-kart tracks and, this year, a new contraption that involves small boats, mounted guns and foamy balls. "You drive the boat and you shoot the balls," he explained with boyish glee.
On this day, Mr. Kaufman worked the token booth at the batting cages, bantering with his regulars, boasting about the speed and accuracy of his pitching machines, plotting ways to lure fans from the new stadium, discussing plans to add flowers and other touches to his go-kart tracks.
"I'm committed to Coney Island," he said. "It's in my blood. When people say to me, 'You've got the best batting cages in the city,' that makes me feel good. I'm in my dream here. This is it. But you gotta grind it out, you gotta be open, you gotta be street smart. My dream for Coney Island, I'll tell you, is to get it back to what it once was. Gotta get it back to what it once was."
As balls pinged off aluminum bats, as another Russian teenager slipped $2 through the window slot for 14 whacks, and as the sun began to set behind a bank of looming thunderheads, Kenny Kaufman's optimism seemed completely inextinguishable.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: Pursuing a Giant;
Retracing the Missteps In the Microsoft Defense

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, is certainly no judicial radical. A former Naval officer, he was an active Republican when Ronald Reagan appointed him to the federal bench in 1982.
His record before the Microsoft case suggested, if anything, that he was pro-business. In 1987, the federal government sued General Motors, contending that its cars had dangerous brake defects. Judge Jackson sided with the car company, dismissing the government's evidence as merely "anecdotal accounts of skidding events." 
 So when news reports emerged in late January that government officials involved in settlement talks in Chicago had proposed a breakup of Microsoft, Judge Jackson was alarmed.
"I should tell you, I am not at all comfortable with restructuring the company," he said in February, in a rare audience with a sitting judge during the course of a trial. "I am not sure I am competent to do that. Microsoft is a large and important company, innovative and admirable in a lot of ways. And it is an engine for the nation's economy. I just don't think that is something I want to try to do on my own. I wouldn't know how to do it."
But in another interview late last month, he sounded very different. He said Microsoft's recent behavior had helped change his mind.
"I've been astounded by some of the statements of Gates and Ballmer," he said, referring to the continuing protestations of William H. Gates, the company's chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the president, that Microsoft did absolutely nothing wrong. The remarks that so irked him came after his legal ruling in April that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws with its predatory and anticompetitive behavior.
"I'm in the midst of a growing realization," the judge added, "that with what looks like Microsoft intransigence, a breakup is inevitable."
And on Wednesday, he ordered just that: a plan to split Microsoft into two companies.
Just as Judge Jackson's thinking has evolved, so have the views of many others in government and industry who watched the case. In interviews with The New York Times over the last several months, dozens of the state and federal officials who have investigated and prosecuted Microsoft for the last four years, as well as industry executives, described many moves by Microsoft that they think backfired and led to a resounding court defeat.
At the outset, the plaintiffs and defendant seemed evenly matched.
"Microsoft and the government were the perfect opponents," observed David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer. "The government has some power, but Microsoft has at least as much. Anyone else facing either one of them would be overmatched."
And watching from the bench early on, the silver-haired, 63-year-old Judge Jackson said he was awed by the legal prowess on display in his courtroom. "It's exhilarating to watch," he said. "You'll never see better."
But over the months, the balance shifted heavily in favor of the government. In fact, Microsoft's problems began well before the trial opened in October 1998. It misjudged the legal trouble that its own e-mail and other documents could create. It chose not to reach an out-of-court settlement when the sanctions it faced were a wrist-slap compared with the breakup plan it now confronts -- though those decisions, given the company's conviction that it would win on appeal, were a calculated gamble. Whether that gamble pays off will not be known for months, or years.
In court, however, the Microsoft defense stumbled repeatedly. And with each misstep, the government was emboldened.
The prosecutors assembled and then presented their case with ever greater confidence, continually broadening it to embrace a far richer array of charges than the one that started it all: Microsoft's decision to tie a Web browser to the Windows operating system.
As the case progressed, the government presented evidence to show that Microsoft had bullied friends and competitors alike, halting innovations that threatened its Windows monopoly. And as the allegations spilled out in court, Microsoft was increasingly on its heels as it tried to argue that all the government had really shown was that the company was a rough-and-tumble competitor, not an economic outlaw.
Still, Judge Jackson remained strikingly respectful of the defendant. "There is no doubt in my mind that Microsoft is a unique, gifted, efficient and ingenious organism," he said in February.
In the end, however, the judge lost all patience with Microsoft. On the trial's final day last month, a Microsoft lawyer appealed for another round of hearings on the government's remedy proposal, saying Microsoft could not possibly defend itself "in the brief time given."
"In the brief time given?" Judge Jackson retorted with a sharp tone. "This case has been pending for two years!"
In the interview the next day, Judge Jackson, observed: "I am not aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any due process at all. The case is over. They lost." Besides, he added, "I'm suspicious that they are just playing for time, hoping they will get to deal with a new administration" that might approach the company with a softer hand.
Judge Jackson agreed to be interviewed several times after testimony in the trial had ended, with the understanding that his comments could not be published until the case had left his courtroom. The discussions, beginning last September, were friendly, informal and unstructured.
Officials from the Justice Department and the states agreed to similar ground rules. Microsoft's cooperation was first requested months ago; the company's general counsel granted a lengthy interview last week.
The goal in all of the interviews was to understand how the case started, how it grew from a technical fight over Internet browsers into a broader battle over Microsoft's dealings with its competitors and partners, how the government won so handily, and why, to everyone's surprise, Microsoft fared so poorly.
Now the case goes to appeal, where Microsoft believes it can overturn everything that happened in Judge Jackson's courtroom. As Microsoft sees it, the government's case was a grab bag of accusations based mainly on the selective use of its e-mail messages. Some of it may look bad but, Microsoft insists, none of it should add up to an antitrust violation.
"It's the kind of evidence that a skilled trial lawyer can use to make the public wonder about how tough Microsoft plays this game," William H. Neukom, a senior vice president and general counsel of Microsoft, said in an interview at its corporate campus in suburban Seattle. "But that is not the way the law is supposed to work."
Microsoft will also argue on appeal that evidence Judge Jackson relied on should have been deemed inadmissible -- newspaper articles, e-mail messages from low-level employees and the like. More broadly, Microsoft believes that its view of the computer industry -- for reasons that still puzzle the company's executives -- was never appreciated by the government or the judge. "It's clear that the whole story of Microsoft, the whole story of the PC was missed here," William H. Gates, the chairman, said during a news conference on Wednesday.
Judge Jackson, in the February interview, said simply, "I think Microsoft didn't take this seriously enough."
 
Past as Prologue
'This Antitrust Thing Will Blow Over'
Joel I. Klein, a prominent Washington appellate lawyer, joined the Justice Department in April 1995 as principal deputy to Anne K. Bingaman, chief of the antitrust division. The next year, he succeeded her.
His first task was to seek final court approval of a consent decree reached with Microsoft the previous year to settle a Justice Department antitrust suit. Microsoft had agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another.
But what Mr. Klein did not know then was that Microsoft began flouting at least the spirit of the consent decree it had just signed.
"This antitrust thing will blow over," Mr. Gates told a group of Intel executives in July 1995, according to one Intel executive's notes of the meeting, obtained by the government. "We haven't changed our business practices at all."
In 1995, Mr. Klein heard from America Online. The company complained that Microsoft was violating antitrust law by bundling MSN, its new online service, with Windows. But the department decided not to act.
In June 1996, however, Microsoft took the step that led to Judge Jackson's courtroom. For months, James L. Barksdale, the president of Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in software used to browse the Web, had been growing increasingly irritated by what he regarded as the bare-knuckle tactics Microsoft deployed against his company.
But then Microsoft did something more: it threatened to cancel Compaq Computer's license to Windows -- Microsoft's industry-standard operating system, which Compaq could not survive without -- because the PC maker planned to feature the Netscape browser, not Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
"I'm not a lawyer, but I have more than 30 years experience in business," Mr. Barksdale recalled recently. "I just knew that that was something wrong."
He calls Microsoft's threat to cancel Compaq's Windows license "the singular act" that prompted him to take his grievances to the Justice Department. To accomplish that, he asked the company's lawyer, Gary L. Reback, to write a "white paper" detailing the problem.
The 222-page paper accused Microsoft, among other things, of using its dominance in operating systems to force PC makers to take Microsoft's browser. And in August Mr. Barksdale sent a copy to Mr. Klein.
Mr. Klein said the paper got his immediate attention. "There was a big difference in my mind between MSN and this," he said. "To me, conditioning one product on another was clearly a violation of the consent decree. I authorized San Francisco to investigate."
Right away, the Justice Department's San Francisco office asked Phillip R. Malone, an up-and-coming young lawyer, to head the Microsoft team. And the next month, he and four other lawyers began faxing civil investigative demands to Microsoft for documents related to the Netscape charges and Microsoft's Internet strategy. Such demands are the civil equivalent of a subpoena.
As each new request spilled out of a fax machine in Microsoft's legal department, a Microsoft lawyer would discuss the request with Mr. Malone. Then the investigators simply waited. "The documents just arrived in the mail," Mr. Malone said.
Never once, he added, did an investigator have to visit Microsoft and look in file cabinets or hard drives for overlooked documents or e-mail messages.
Microsoft's lawyers examined all the documents before they were sent off. Several government officials said these lawyers should instantly have realized those documents meant trouble.
"You can't be a lawyer and not know these documents are lethal," Mr. Klein observed.
Microsoft lawyers say they understood that some of the e-mail messages could quicken a prosecutor's pulse. But they saw it as a tactical problem -- the fiery communications of business aggression, which might seem incriminating at first glance -- and not evidence of an antitrust violation. "No smoking gun," in the view of one company lawyer.
Yet as the boxes of papers went out the door, Microsoft's legal troubles mounted. More remarkably, the most damaging documents -- the ones that galvanized the resolve of state and federal prosecutors nationwide -- were written months after that first government request arrived, months after Microsoft's leaders knew that everything they wrote was likely to wind up in prosecutors' hands.
Judge Jackson likened the phenomenon to the federal prosecution of drug traffickers, who are repeatedly caught as a result of telephone wiretaps. And yet, he said, "they never figure out that they shouldn't be saying certain things on the phone."
But Mr. Neukom said Microsoft had been under investigation for so long, and e-mail was so essential to the operations of the company, that managers simply could not edit every thought and continue to manage effectively. "E-mail is a big part of how we run this company," he said. "And candid, frank, open e-mail communication is a big part of our efficiency."
 
A Growing Case
U.S. Finds Allies In State Capitals
While Microsoft dealt with the growing federal investigation, a new group took up the chase: state attorneys general. That compounded Microsoft's problems. In time, the company would face not just the Justice Department but 20 sovereign and independent prosecutors from the states as well.
About the time the Justice Department's first document requests arrived at Microsoft in September 1996, Mark Tobey, an antitrust lawyer in the Texas attorney general's office, read a Time magazine cover story about the browser war with the headline: "An epic battle is taking place between Microsoft and Netscape." Mr. Tobey, whose state is home to Compaq and Dell Computer, two companies highly dependent on Microsoft software, decided to have a look at the subject. He managed to get a copy of the Netscape white paper. With that and other information, on Feb. 9, 1997, the Texas attorney general's office issued its own civil investigative demand to Microsoft -- the first formal action from a state attorney general.
In April 1997, the state attorneys general gathered in Washington for their annual spring conference, and during a meeting of the antitrust section chiefs, Mr. Tobey outlined what he had been doing, hoping to recruit allies.
Mr. Tobey's presentation on Microsoft stirred little interest -- quite the opposite, in fact. Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa, chairman of the antitrust committee, said his first thought was: "Oh my God, Microsoft? We're not going to sue Microsoft, are we?"
But through the spring and summer Mr. Tobey argued and lobbied and eventually persuaded several of the larger states to have a look at the Microsoft documents. And in relatively short order, the accumulating evidence persuaded other states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin, to join the investigation because the documents had stunned them.
"I didn't know much about technology, or about the industry," recalled Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut. But as he read the documents "I was really struck by the brutal, overt tactics. You rarely see things like this written down."
In the minds of almost every federal and state official interviewed, three documents stood out as the most influential. The first was a white paper that Mr. Gates wrote in May 1995, titled "The Internet Tidal Wave."
"A new competitor born on the Internet is Netscape," Mr. Gates wrote. As the leader in Web browsing software, Netscape, he added, could set the technical rules for Internet computing and thus "commoditize the underlying operating system" -- Microsoft Windows, on 85 percent of all personal computers. In other words, Mr. Gates was saying, Netscape threatened to make Windows irrelevant.
The Gates memo, though not legally damaging on its own, pinned a motivation to what followed.
Two more documents that arrived during the fall of 1997 got all of the prosecutors excited. They were e-mail messages by James E. Allchin, a senior Microsoft executive in charge of the Windows group. He was worried about the company's Internet strategy. Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, was being given away and bundled with Windows. Still, it was not catching on.
In e-mail messages to another senior executive written Dec. 20, 1996, and Jan. 2, 1997 -- more than three months after the federal government had begun obtaining documents relating to Microsoft's Internet strategy -- Mr. Allchin wrote: "I do not believe we can win on our current path. Even if we get Internet Explorer totally competitive with Navigator, why would we be chosen? They have 80 percent market share. My conclusion is we have to leverage Windows more." He added, "We need something more: Windows integration."
To the prosecutors, this was the smoking gun. Mr. Allchin seemed to be clearly saying that unless Microsoft deeply embedded its browser into its monopoly product -- and thus made users go out of their way to use Netscape -- Internet Explorer would surely lose. When these documents arrived at the Justice Department office in San Francisco, Mr. Malone knew he had something special. He took them to Washington and discussed them with Mr. Klein and others.
"Everybody saw it; they really captured the essence of what we believed," Mr. Malone said. "They had that power."
 
An Interim Suit
Prosecutors Cite Evidence of Threats
In early October 1997, Microsoft's lawyers attended a meeting at the Justice Department to try to explain why it included its Web browsing software in Windows. At the meeting, Mr. Klein "held up two disks, one holding Windows and the other with the browsing software," Mr. Neukom said. "He said, 'You should have consulted us. It's easy to separate these.'
"That was the level of analysis," Mr. Neukom said, indicating he was not impressed.
But once again, at another crucial point, Microsoft misread its opponents.
The federal government was feeling more confident. By the summer of 1997, Mr. Malone said, "I certainly felt we had a case."
The Justice Department had not only gathered hundreds of documents from Microsoft, but had also interviewed dozens of industry executives, including crucial officers at Netscape. And by early fall, Mr. Klein said, "it was becoming clear to me that we had a larger case" beyond the browser question.
By now, the government's inquiry had gathered evidence that Microsoft had threatened Compaq, I.B.M. and Intel; essentially bribed America Online; and tried to hobble Sun Microsystems, among others -- all to protect the Windows monopoly.
On Oct. 20, 1997, Mr. Klein filed what proved to be an interim suit against Microsoft, accusing the company of violating the 1994 consent decree by forcing computer makers to take Internet Explorer along with Windows. The idea was to step in before Microsoft released a new version of Internet Explorer, due out soon, "rather than to let that event pass, waiting for the big case," A. Douglas Melamed, deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division, said.
Judge Jackson was assigned that case, and in mid-December, he ordered Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows that did not include Internet Explorer -- even though Microsoft had argued that Windows and Internet Explorer were the same product. Microsoft responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice: one version of Windows that was obsolete, or another that did not work properly.
The Justice Department reacted angrily, and, as it turned out, Judge Jackson was irritated, too. Asked what had struck him about Microsoft's defense during this case, the judge referred to this exchange in court, with David Cole, a Microsoft vice president, in January 1998:
"It seemed absolutely clear to you," the judge asked him from the bench "that I entered an order that required that you distribute a product that would not work? Is that what you're telling me?"
"In plain English, yes," Mr. Cole replied. "We followed that order. It wasn't my place to consider the consequences of that."
In the end, Microsoft agreed to offer a version of Windows with Internet Explorer hidden and partly disabled, and an appeals court was due to consider the case in the spring. But it hardly mattered any longer. Windows 98 was due out in just a few months, and Microsoft was saying Internet Explorer would be even more tightly entwined.
 
The Lobbying
A Multistate Tour Leaves Ill Will
In late March 1998, the antitrust chiefs in about a dozen states agreed on a multistate action against Microsoft. At the Justice Department, Mr. Klein still was not saying what he planned. Still, by the first week of March anyone watching closely could have guessed he was serious when he hired Jeffrey H. Blattner, a former chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as special counsel for information technology.
His actual job, Mr. Blattner explained later, was chief of staff for the Microsoft case, and as preparation for his new role he read the evidence, principally the Microsoft documents. Right away, he said, "I had a very clear sense that lawyers never get to see documents like this."
Microsoft, apparently, was paying close attention, because within a few weeks the company set out on a lobbying campaign.
In late March, Dennis C. Vacco, then New York's attorney general, got a call from Fred Foreman, a former United States attorney in Chicago. They had been colleagues years earlier, when Mr. Vacco was United States attorney in Buffalo. Mr. Foreman had been hired by Microsoft, and he asked if he and representatives of his new client could come in for a talk.
A few days later, the Microsoft contingent arrived in New York, including Mr. Foreman and David A. Heiner, a Microsoft lawyer. The atmosphere in Mr. Vacco's office was friendly -- until Mr. Heiner made Microsoft's pitch: Why was his company being viewed as a competitive threat, he asked. After all, he said, Microsoft holds "only 4 percent of the worldwide software market."
Microsoft certainly knew that Mr. Vacco was not particularly well informed about the software industry. But before meeting the Microsoft group, Stephen D. Houck, a lawyer in the attorney general's office, had given him a detailed briefing about the case. Mr. Houck said Mr. Vacco did not say much in response to the 4 percent remark. But as Mr. Vacco thought about what he had been told, he said, "I was almost derisive." After all, he added, the case was not about the worldwide software business. It was about the PC operating-system business, and Microsoft held about 85 percent of that market.
"I don't know if they were purposely playing me because they thought I had a lack of knowledge," Mr. Vacco said. "But I knew that was ridiculous." Microsoft's visit, he said, hardened his resolve.
That scene was replayed in state after state, about 12 in all.
Then, in April, the Microsoft team showed up at the Justice Department. During a meeting in Mr. Klein's conference room, they gave a demonstration of Windows 98 and the benefits that the company said resulted from the integration of Internet Explorer.
"The meeting was cordial," Mr. Klein said. "We knew all of these people. We'd dealt with them before," including "on the MSN-America Online case, when they obviously got the result they wanted."
Mr. Neukom said Microsoft spent several days preparing for the meeting. "It was absolutely in our best interests to understand their concerns," he said. But "there was very little indication of open-mindedness on the other side of the table."
"Their mentality was that there are two separate products that you forced together to crush Netscape," Mr. Neukom recalled. But by then, in fact, Microsoft had given the government hundreds of documents that would provide ammunition for a much broader case.
 
Negotiations
The Failed Efforts To Avert a Trial
By mid-April 1998, the Justice Department had produced a draft of its suit that Mr. Klein, Mr. Boies and other officials took to Attorney General Janet Reno. They met with her three times over a period of several days. Ms. Reno and her staff asked many questions, but finally she gave permission to file suit.
Right away, Mr. Klein asked David Boies to sign a contract as a special government employee so he could serve as the lead courtroom lawyer. Though he had worked for the government as a consultant since December, Mr. Boies only then immersed himself in the Microsoft documents.
"What most impressed me was the enthusiastic zeal with which they used their monopoly power," he said. "In my experience, most companies will use it, but they are nervous, uncomfortable about it. But in this case there was such clarity and baldness in the conduct. I'd never seen anything like it."
In late April, Mr. Klein and the other leaders of the antitrust division met with the leaders of Microsoft, including Mr. Gates, at the Washington offices of Sullivan & Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm, where Mr. Gates made impassioned arguments against the suit. As Mr. Neukom recalled it, Mr. Gates told Mr. Klein, "What we're doing is good for consumers, good for the industry and good for Microsoft."
"Bill just felt that if he could talk to them and not through lawyers, they'd understand," Mr. Neukom added.
The government lawyers responded by laying out their allegations. They tried to get Microsoft to respond. Now the company's chairman knew firsthand that the government had a broad and potentially serious case. But "we couldn't get them to focus on the issues," Mr. Boies said. "They just kept saying they didn't have monopoly power." Once more an opportunity to avoid the suit slipped away.
In a several phone calls in mid-May, including some between Mr. Gates and Mr. Klein, Microsoft appeared to be making a last offer to settle the case: Microsoft would allow computer makers to alter the opening screen of the Windows operating system. As the case had broadened, that issue had been added to the government's growing list of concerns.
On the strength of that, Mr. Klein agreed to meet with Microsoft and hold what antitrust lawyers call "last rites" talks, the United States government's final approach to the defendant in search of an equitable settlement before moving to court.
On May 16, 1998, the talks opened. As the two sides sat on opposite sides of a glossy walnut conference table, Mr. Boies leaned forward and looked directly at Mr. Neukom.
Everyone at the table knew his deep experience in antitrust cases; he had been the lead lawyer for I.B.M. during that company's long antitrust battle with the government. "You know, once the United States government files suit against you, everything changes," Mr. Boies recalls saying. "People are more willing to come forward and testify against you. Others are more willing to question you, resist you. The whole world changes."
Still, as Mr. Boies recalled the moment, Mr. Neukom and the company's others lawyers looked back at him with blank, unwavering expressions. "They didn't really respond other than to repeat what they'd been saying all along" -- that the government did not understand the software industry.
In Microsoft's view, it was the government that had no intention of settling the case. Mr. Neukom recalled the two days of talks ending with a senior Justice Department official telling him: "I guess we're in litigation. You have no idea how difficult we can make your lives."
The last rites talks fell apart. And today many government officials and industry executives regard Microsoft's refusal to settle the case that day, before the suits were even filed, as the biggest mistake the company has ever made.
But in another respect, the company's refusal was not surprising. During a court hearing a short time later, a Microsoft lawyer approached Mr. Boies and offered the following remark, as Mr. Boies recalled it: "The government has been making the same arguments for eight years. We always give the same responses. Our side always prevails. When is the government going to leave us alone?"
 
The Judge
Hoping to Avoid Another AT&T
As the state and federal governments were preparing to file their suits, Judge Jackson recalled last month, he watched these developments with "a fair amount of trepidation."
Because he had tried the earlier case, this new one would come to his courtroom. It was certain to be big, complex and possibly precedent-setting. But in truth, Judge Jackson had tried only two antitrust cases in his 16-year judicial career. And to say he knew little about technology was at best an understatement. His abiding concern: "Please don't let me screw this up!"
Still, "I thought I could do this," the judge said he decided. "I'd done it before, become literate on esoteric topics for which I have no background," notably as a successful trial lawyer in the 1970's defending medical malpractice cases, another highly technical area he had known little about.
A week after the suits were filed, the judge called the litigants to his courtroom to set a schedule and tell them he wanted a fast-track trial.
Later, he said he was determined to "stay away from disasters like the I.B.M. and AT&T cases" each of which had dragged on for a decade. "I'm a great believer in taking evidence, closing the record as quickly as you can and then shipping it upstairs" to the court of appeals. The very last thing he wanted, he said, was to find himself in the same position as Harold H. Greene, the judge who spent years trying AT&T and then overseeing the breakup of the company. Judge Greene died in January.
On June 23, 1998, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals handed down a ruling overturning Judge Jackson's decision in December ordering Microsoft to take Internet Explorer out of Windows 95. The ruling said Microsoft had every right to integrate new products into Windows, if there was a plausible consumer benefit.
Microsoft was jubilant, and the plaintiffs, at first, were crushed. Judge Jackson said he was "wounded" -- and angry. "I think it was wrongheaded on several counts," he said.
Mr. Boies got a copy of the appeals court decision just as he was boarding a plane for San Francisco, where he was to meet with the Justice Department's investigative team.
During the trip west, he read it and then read it again, "and by the time I got to San Francisco, I was convinced it was a good thing for us" because "it gave us a road map of what the court of appeals criteria would be." Mr. Boies could frame his case around it. Just after he landed, he explained that to the Justice Department team. But he added with a grin, "They didn't immediately recognize our tremendous good fortune."
Through the summer, state and federal officials feverishly prepared for trial, trying with little success to persuade Microsoft's supposed victims -- computer makers and others -- to testify. "They were afraid of Microsoft," said Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa. "We didn't have any particular success." But over the summer, even more useful Microsoft documents came in, and government depositions of other industry leaders gave power to the growing list of charges.
 
The Deposition
A Mumbling Gates Delights Prosecutor
By late August 1998, the trial was scheduled to begin in less than a month, and the government was still negotiating with Microsoft over the deposition of Mr. Gates, forcing Judge Jackson to postpone the opening day. Finally, in the last days of August, Mr. Boies and Mr. Houck flew to Seattle for three days of deposition interviews with Microsoft's chairman.
As he set up in a Microsoft conference room, Mr. Boies said he was apprehensive as he got ready to face the powerful corporate chief. "I was expecting him to be articulate, passionate, tough, direct, intelligent and very, very knowledgeable about everything relating to the case," just as he had been in their last meeting the previous spring, Mr. Boies said. In other words, "a very effective witness."
But as soon as the deposition opened, a very different Mr. Gates was on display. This one was mumbling, uninformed, obdurate and unaware of anything related to the government's charges. And Mr. Boies was thrilled. He knew just what he had to do.
"You want to capture as much of that as you can," he said. "If you have a witness that says 'I don't know,' you want to get him to say 'I don't know' 1,000 times." Mr. Gates obliged.
After the first two days of deposition, there was a five-day break before the third and final day. Surely, Mr. Boies concluded, Mr. Gates' lawyers would talk to their client in the interim, explain how damaging his testimony had been.
"I was really concerned that a recharged Gates would come back," Mr. Boies said. "I had two days of him in the can, and I could see its value diminishing. I almost didn't take the third day."
But he did, and Mr. Gates came back, his behavior unchanged. When the deposition ended, Mr. Boies knew he had a powerful tool.
Mr. Neukom said Microsoft never expected the tapes to be used in court, only the transcripts. Had Microsoft's lawyers known the tapes would be shown in court, Mr. Neukom said, "we would have prepared our witness differently," changing the style of his presentation, but not the substance. Yet, the Justice Department thought even the transcripts were inflammatory.
Mr. Boies was determined to play part of the Gates tape on the trial's opening day, now set for Oct. 19, and as often as he could in the days following. He said he hoped it would send this message to the judge: "The chairman of the company doesn't have any credible explanation for what they did, even though he was intimately involved. If he doesn't have an explanation, then how can you credit the explanations of his underlings?" The strategy worked.
As he watched the Gates tape, Judge Jackson said later, he was thinking, "I can't conceive of Bill Gates being allowed to testify like that on deposition."
Judge Jackson said it was an "ingenious strategy" on the part of the prosecution. "Here is the guy who is the head of the organization, and his testimony is inherently without credibility. At the start, it makes you skeptical about the rest of the trial. You are saying, if you can't believe this guy, who else can you believe? It was a brilliant move by David Boies."
 
The Trial
A Loss of Patience From the Bench
As the trial proceeded and the testimony grew ever more technical and obscure, many evenings the government legal team left the courtroom, and as they walked down the courthouse steps they would be thinking about the judge, and, as Mr. Boies recalled it, one lawyer would ask the other: "Do you think he understood?"
In February, looking back, Judge Jackson chuckled at the question and said: "By and large I was able to follow what they were saying." Still, when Judge Jackson left the courtroom many days, he would corner his law clerks and ask them to explain the technology issues he did not understand. "I had excellent law clerks," he said. "They were computer literate enough to explain things to me. We talked all the time."
Toward the end of the trial, with Microsoft's defense in disarray, the judge grew ever more abrupt. "There were times when I became impatient with Microsoft witnesses who were giving speeches," he said. In addition, "they were telling me things I just flatly could not credit," echoing the impression Mr. Boies had said he hoped the judge would take away from the trial.
When the main part of the trial ended on Feb. 25, 1999, the two sides held settlement discussions at the judge's urging. In fact, Judge Jackson vigorously pushed the litigants to settle, but this turned out to be another missed opportunity.
By now, Microsoft could have little doubt that the government held a strong hand. The post-trial mood of the federal and state government lawyers was confident. "I've never been involved in a case that went as well as this one," said Kevin J. O'Connor, an assistant attorney general from Wisconsin.
But Microsoft was not ready to concede a thing.
During several meetings that opened on March 29 and ended in early June, Mr. Klein told Microsoft for the first time that the government wanted to break up the company. The Microsoft team said they were unwilling even to discuss the idea. In an interview later, Mr. Neukom said he was not particularly surprised, but regarded it mainly as an opening maneuver in negotiations. But once again, that was a grave misreading; the government was utterly serious.
Nonetheless, during the last meeting, Mr. Klein laid out a proposal not for a breakup but for conduct remedies similar to the ones the judge approved on Wednesday. The Microsoft team listened impassively. When Mr. Klein was finished, the Microsoft lawyers said they wanted to think about it. But as Mr. Neukom said in the interview, "It was way over the top."
At the end of the meeting, "there was a clear expectation they would get back to us," said Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. "But they never did."
 
The Ruling
Overcoming Qualms About a Breakup
By fall, the trial was over; only the judge's rulings were left, and Judge Jackson looked back at the experience. A fast-paced trial schedule, he said, can produce one of two results: a settlement, or a war.
"And what we got was a war. This is like the battle that ended the War of the Roses," he said in September. "That's the way I look at this case."
He said he was separating the findings of fact in his verdict from the final ruling, the conclusions of law, because "I want to encourage a settlement." And a few weeks later the idea to ask Richard A. Posner, chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago, to serve as mediator, hit him like "a bolt out of the blue."
"I knew," he explained in February, "that the egos were sufficiently high on both sides that, with any ordinary person, they would just say, 'So, who are you?' " And when he called Judge Posner, "I was grateful that, one, he would take a call from a district court judge, and two, that he didn't say, 'I have so many things going on I don't have time.' "
After four months, the settlement talks failed; Microsoft once again rejected a package of conduct remedies prepared by the state and federal governments -- certainly knowing, given the history, that a breakup proposal might well follow. And as the time for a final ruling loomed early this year, Judge Jackson was obviously troubled.
"I have been in splendid isolation on this case long enough," he said. "I would welcome another mind studying my work product to see if I am correct or wrongheaded. I want to move this case upstairs as quickly as possible."
That, as much as anything else, prompted him to speed through the remedy phase. "The sooner this gets definitively resolved, the better it is for the country -- including the defendant."
As for his reluctance, in February, to break up Microsoft, Judge Jackson said last month, "I'm still uncomfortable." On Wednesday, however, he accepted the government breakup proposal without alteration.
"Assuming, as I think they are, that the Justice Department and the states are genuinely concerned about the public interest," he said last month, "I know they have carefully studied all the possible options. This isn't a bunch of amateurs. They have consulted with some of the best minds in America over a long period of time.
"I am not in a position to duplicate that and re-engineer their work. There's no way I can equip myself to do a better job than they have done. I think this is the best possible proposal, neither the most drastic that could be imposed or as loosely constructed as the consent decree" in 1995 "which they did not think accomplished what they intended."
As for his competence to supervise a breakup, the judge said he was certain the government would help him. Still, Judge Jackson leaned back in his chair and shook his head.
"Shades of Harold Greene," he said with a rueful smile. "I tried so hard to avoid the pitfalls he encountered in that trial."

Re "Political Turmoil in Israel" (editorial, June 8): 
 You say Shas was wrong to call for new elections because it should "subordinate its pursuit of parochial causes to the wider Israeli interest in negotiating peace."
Shas's main concern, and the reason it has 17 seats in Parliament, has consistently been to provide desperately needed social and educational services for its constituency, many of whom are on the lower economic rungs of Israeli society.
The pursuit of parochial interests has long been a cornerstone and driving force within democratic societies like, for example, the United States. Why should Shas be different?

HEADLINE: Studies Thaw The Exploits Of Undercover Cold Warriors

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
In the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the opening of its secret files, much has been learned about the accomplishments of Soviet spies in the United States, particularly in the 1930's and 40's. The still-accumulating evidence has silenced some of the truest believers in the innocence of the likes of Alger Hiss and Julius Rosenberg.
But lest Americans are left with the uncomfortable notion that their country remained passively at the mercy of traitors, new studies are drawing attention to huggermugger by the Western allies after World War II. In some ways these books are reassuring; in some ways they raise or reinforce doubts about the means and ends of Washington's undercover wars. 
 At the close of World War II, with much of Europe in economic and political disarray, Washington was troubled by what it saw as a surge of Communist influence promoted from Moscow. The Truman administration being new to the geopolitical game and the Central Intelligence Agency not yet invented, a few leaders of the American Federation of Labor undertook their own anti-Communist effort.
To direct it, George Meany, who was in effect running the A.F.L., and David Dubinsky, president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, picked Jay Lovestone to be their commander in chief for the labor wars. The result is engagingly chronicled by Ted Morgan in "A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone, Communist, Anti-Communist and Spymaster" (Random House).
Lovestone had the credentials for the job. As a young Communist in the 1920's he was deeply enmeshed in the party's incessant factional conflicts; for a couple of years he headed the American Communist Party, until he was ousted on Stalin's orders. Like other radicals of the time he wound up as an anti-Communist crusader.
Lovestone masterminded an energetic assault on European unions and parties with communist leanings. In West Germany he supported the Social Democrats under Kurt Schumacher and fostered free trade unions. In France, abetted by Irving Brown, another tough Communist hater, he helped beat back a Communist-inspired effort to derail the Marshall Plan, and in Italy Lovestone and Brown bolstered democratic parties in parliamentary elections.
Mr. Morgan credits the A.F.L. with standing alone from November 1945 to the spring of 1948 "in acting against Soviet expansion via the trade unions." Well, not altogether alone. In an audience with Pope Pius XII Lovestone announced, "We are anti-Communists without any reservations or hesitations." The startled pope replied, "But Mr. Lovestone, I, too, am anti-Communist."
Although the just-formed C.I.A. slipped $10 million to Italy's Christian Democrats when the Communist Party mounted a serious parliamentary challenge in the 1948 elections, the agency's relations with the contentious Lovestone were always testy. The F.B.I. kept close watch on an operator with so flagrant a set of Communist credentials, and he also had run-ins with Congress, the State Department and the White House, all of which he felt were insufficiently aggressive toward Stalin.
Lovestone's great years came early, but he lasted for decades, supplying worldwide intelligence to the C.I.A.'s fabled and perhaps paranoiac James Jesus Angleton. At Lovestone's death in 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he was still fighting his good fight, leaving behind the anomalous legacy of ostensibly free trade unions' consorting secretly with a spy agency. The consolation was that unlike some other cold war adventurers, they proved good at it.
How bad these others could be is chronicled by Peter Grose in "Operation Rollback: America's Secret War Behind the Iron Curtain" (Houghton Mifflin). His account of American forays into espionage in the late 40's and early 50's might be humorous, were the stakes not so serious. In a plan hatched by George F. Kennan, known for inventing the policy of containment, and backed by the C.I.A. director Allen Dulles, the supersecret Office of Policy Coordination financed a multimillion-dollar campaign of sabotage in Soviet-bloc countries. Or such was the concept, which failed wherever it was tried. Front groups with words like liberation in their titles were cobbled together. Bickering bands of emigres, including sometime fascists and Nazi hangers-on, were recruited in displaced-person camps and sent on impossible missions.
In Albania, Romania, Poland and within the Soviet Union itself the results were the same: Eric Ambler as adapted by the Three Stooges. The Soviets, abetted in some cases by information supplied by Kim Philby, the British double agent, captured and executed most of the infiltrators, and Washington was put to the trouble of denying all knowledge of its inept provocations.
In sum "Rollback" was not the estimable Mr. Kennan's most successful project. If it had served as a cautionary lesson, it might have spared the nation even more dubious adventures from Southeast Asia to Latin America in decades to come.
In a more successful and less lethal cold war assay, the C.I.A. was waging a cultural-political battle that roiled the intelligentsia of several countries and continues to stir controversy.
The revelation in the late 60's that the agency was secretly financing seemingly independent intellectuals and organizations caused a sensation, but it awaited Frances Stoner Saunders, in "The Cultural Cold War: The C.I.A. and the World of Arts and Letters" (New Press), to provide a detailed picture of who did what and how it was done.
To combat Comintern propaganda, beginning around 1950 Washington mounted a counteroffensive aimed at challenging a prevailing image of the United States as a land whose matchless wealth was matched by a paucity of culture. With C.I.A. support, known fully only to a few, a stellar collection of generally liberal and assuredly anti-Communist intellectuals were recruited for battle.
Magazines in several countries, most notably Encounter in Britain, were created and edited with distinction, and others, like the influential Partisan Review, were subsidized. Big-name forums, art exhibits and celebratory festivals were organized, and the Metropolitan Opera and the Boston Symphony were sent on European tour. The message was that the United States was a fount of cultural ferment.
It worked. The few stars of the fellow-traveling circuit like Paul Robeson, Lillian Hellman and Howard Fast were easily outgunned by an imposing array of writers, scholars and artists gathered in the Congress for Cultural Freedom. A few names: Arthur Koestler, Andre Malraux, Isaiah Berlin, Raymond Aron, Mary McCarthy, Reinhold Neibuhr, George Orwell, Robert Lowell, Bertrand Russell, Stephen Spender, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Ignazio Silone, Andre Gide. While the Stalinists tended to be middlebrow, this group was weighted decidedly toward the highbrow. Ms. Saunders gives much of the credit, or blame, for the popularity of abstract art to its promotion by the C.I.A.
She leaves little doubt that some of the players were in on the C.I.A. connection, but even this highly critical chronicler does not charge that most of the stars knew that the Congress for Cultural Freedom was an arm of the agency. (Many thought, if they thought about it at all, that the money was coming from foundations.) Nor, despite examples of C.I.A. efforts to exert pressure, does she make much of a case that the luminaries were tailoring their ideas to suit agency specifications: they were, after all, non-Communist men and women of the left to whom championing Western values against Stalin's despotism came naturally.
In the fashion of the intellectual set, there was plenty of disagreement within ranks, notably a fierce fight over how to deal or fail to deal with the rampages of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. Hard-line anti-Communists in the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, led by Sidney Hook and abetted by the C.I.A. handlers, succeeded in blocking a public statement attacking McCarthyism, lest it get in the way of their primary mission to attack Communism, while less doctrinaire liberals were distressed by the failure to act against what they saw as the McCarthyite attack on freedom. The split led to the American group's demise.
The exposure of the C.I.A. largess of course embarrassed the pro-American cause as intellectuals famed for being know-it-alls scurried to proclaim their ignorance. The sticking point was not so much the substance as the secrecy: for a group like the congress, dedicated to free and open discussion, to be revealed as a C.I.A. client, with all that implied by way of influence or control, did not go down easily. Ms. Saunders holds that there was certainly influence and possibly control.
Depending on their predilections, readers can find cause in these histories for cheering or deploring America's cold war excursions. The one sure constant is that the central issue they raise -- what principled actions a free country may take in a battle with a pronounced enemy of freedom -- will not soon, if ever, be resolved.

Swashbuckling Anarchists Try to Take the  Out of Cyberspace

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
There was some perverse pleasure to be had last month as the heavy metal band Metallica sued the Web company Napster for copyright infringement. Here is a band that invokes the hounds of hell and mocks gentility with shrieking sarcasm, suddenly championing bourgeois values by insisting on royalty payments. And here are legions of college students supposedly championing Metallican values -- undermining corporate greed, attacking propriety -- when what they are really after in downloading songs from Napster is free music.
Such is the bad faith of contemporary rebellion. But it doesn't end there. Napster itself, the creation of a 19-year-old programmer, Shawn Fanning, has already attracted $15 million in venture capital with its sly appeal to freeloading music lovers. It claims to be innocent of copyright violation because all it is really doing is arranging a match between one user who wants a song and another user who has it. 
 Napster might have been less coy and acknowledged that it is actually part of a movement challenging copyright and intellectual property. Its goals are shared, for example, by a new program called Freenet, which has been described by its creator, Ian Clarke, 23, as an example of "near-perfect anarchy." Freenet will trump Napster, also allowing free, anonymous distribution of video, software and books. But isn't this stealing? Can't information be seen as a form of property? Not for Mr. Clarke, who says that idea will soon be considered as ridiculous as witch-burning.
This challenge to copyright is made possible, of course, by advances in technological piracy, but it also grows out of a set of ideas that have been associated with the Internet from its earliest public years. Many Internet visionaries were inspired by countercultural notions of the Net's liberatory possibilities. John Perry Barlow, a Grateful Dead lyricist, later became co-founder of the influential Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization dedicated to preserving the Internet's libertarian terrain. He has argued that familiar notions of intellectual property become "towers of outmoded boilerplate" when applied to online information.
Stewart Brand, a creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, went on to found the WELL -- Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link -- in which veterans of a California commune helped build one of the first online communities. Mr. Brand famously declared, "Information wants to be free," a mantra that has become a rallying cry for copyright challenges.
This romantic vision sees cyberspace as a realm fundamentally different from ordinary life. And it has become increasingly difficult to separate this belief from important political, technological and ideological debates over copyright, privacy and security. There is a hint of its influence, for example, in the Web pages of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University (cyber.law.harvard.edu), which argue that the Internet should foster "open governance" and collaborative, public-domain "open" software. It has proposed that a counter-copyright sign, cc , be used by authors willing to reject copyright, with its more familiar .
The most important intellectual defense of these views has been made by Lawrence Lessig, a fellow of the Berkman Center and professor at Harvard Law School. His recent book, "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace" (Basic Books) includes a closely argued brief for protecting the freedoms of "original cyberspace" from the constraints imposed by commerce or copyright. Far from being at risk, Mr. Lessig argues, copyright is "protected far too well." In fact, he says, it is "more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg."
Mr. Lessig's concern is about software code that will protect copyrights by rigidly metering usage and limiting access. The danger, he suggests, is the shrinking of the "public commons," a realm in which intellectual work becomes part of a culture's shared heritage. Mr. Lessig argues that copyright law should itself be limited when applied to cyberspace.
How, though, is cultural commerce to thrive? The publishing and recording industries must be drastically recast to account for digital copying and distribution. And even Mr. Lessig acknowledges that "some intellectual property rights" are needed as an incentive to creators. This means that some form of technological control is also required.
But it is not necessary to imagine that everything will be controlled any more than it is possible to envision that nothing will be. If privacy and security can be protected, there will be a wide range of economic arrangements, just as there are now. Some cultural products will be publicly available. Some will be available only through subscription payments. And some will be available in the familiar pay-per-view or rental form that Mr. Lessig finds so disturbing in cyberspace.
None of this means the constriction of the public commons. Cyberspace will be just as fraught with complex mixtures of controls and liberties as real space. Mr. Lessig may find the prospects so grim because his fears and hopes are largely based on an idealized vision of "freedoms that were foundational" in the origins of the Internet.
That was a time (just over five years ago) when the Internet was public in concept but limited in its scope. There was no commerce or banking, little need to worry over security or privacy, minimal threat of mass piracy or viral sabotage. Mr. Lessig treats that exceptional era as the model for aspiration. In comparison, what reality won't seem threatening?
A world without a public commons, though, will not come about from copyright protection but from the opposite. Information doesn't want to be free; only the transmission of information wants to be free. Information, like culture, is the result of labor and devotion, investment and risk; it has a value. And nothing will lead to a more deafening cultural silence than ignoring that value and celebrating the "near-perfect anarchy" of Freenet and Napster running amok.

Governor? Party Chairman? He's Not Seen Anything Yet

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
SHORTLY after he decided this week to accept the offer to become superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Roy Romer called his oldest child, Mark, 47, to deliver the news. Mark wasted no time telling his 71-year-old father, a former three-term Democratic governor of Colorado, "You need counseling."
Now, sitting at a conference table in his new office, bare but for the furniture and a late afternoon lunch of milk and cookies, Mr. Romer threw back his head and laughed at the insouciance of his progeny. 
 "Look," he said, turning serious, "I've always been a risk-taker. That's something in my nature, I guess. I like tough jobs. I like new things. But if you bring skills to the table, how can you justify not using them? I can't just go back to the stream in Colorado to fish. That's not the way to go."
As a lawyer, rancher, flight-school owner, ski-resort operator, state lawmaker, state treasurer, governor for 12 years and general chairman of the Democratic National Committee for 2, when the party was reeling from debt and presidential scandal, Mr. Romer has encountered his fair share of challenges.
But nothing, he conceded, compares to the task at hand: lifting the nation's second-largest school district, with 711,000 students, out of a quagmire, practical and psychological, caused by overcrowded classrooms, crumbling buildings, falling test scores, uninterested teachers and battles among ethnic groups.
In addition, negotiations with the union representing the district's 35,000 teachers are proceeding slowly only four weeks before their contract expires, and some state lawmakers are proposing to appoint a monitor to oversee the schools.
Efforts to decentralize the bloated bureaucracy are already under way as a result of a major reorganization started by Ramon C. Cortines, who was made interim superintendent after a newly elected school board voted Ruben Zacarias out of office last year. Smaller districts are seen as a solution to problems like those at Cahuenga Elementary School in East Hollywood, which opened in 1909 to accommodate 400 children and now serves 1,300, leaving 1,400 others in the neighborhood to board 40 buses at 6 o'clock each morning to attend 15 other schools. More than a quarter of the district's 790 schools are already open year-round to relieve overcrowding.
But reorganization is only a first step, Mr. Romer said, laying out a holistic approach that he favors. He wants new pressure exerted on parents to get involved, on teachers to get motivated (or face "the f word, 'fired' "), on students to stay focused and on administrators to begin periodic testing of classroom achievement.
"You ought not to rely on this place to deliver an education to you," he warned a group of high schoolers on Thursday, implicitly acknowledging the magnitude of problems he had inherited. "You ought to go out and get it."
So why would a septuagenarian who has accomplished so much as a public servant take on a job that could require years beyond his tenure -- he expects to sign a contract for two or three years -- to show any dramatic improvement? And why would a father of 7 and a grandfather of 18 want to disrupt a comfortable life, dragging his wife of 47 years, Bea, away from a Denver home they bought six months ago and their 500-acre cattle ranch in Bailey, Colo., in exchange for a rented house or apartment in Los Angeles?
The reasons, he said, lie in his restless spirit.
AFTER leaving the governorship in January 1999, Mr. Romer cast about for a new focus and turned his energies to a priority he had set in office: educational reform through standards, goals and accountability. But speaking with community groups around the country to absorb new ideas, he had only vague notions of how to start a "national conversation," perhaps through a new research organization or maybe town-hall-style meetings. In any case, he contemplated an academic, rather than hands-on, approach.
Meanwhile, a shift in the Democratic Party leadership this January brought in Edward G. Rendell, former mayor of Philadelphia and a master money-raiser, as the new general chairman, ended Mr. Romer's stewardship after two years and moved him to a job as chairman of the party's national convention, which will be held here in August.
That required him to spend several days each week here. On one visit, Eli Broad, a prominent businessman and philanthropist, suggested that if he was really interested in improving education, he would apply for the schools job.
"It had never occurred to me," Mr. Romer said. "I could have started a think tank, but then I realized it was more important to walk the walk than to talk the talk."
As other candidates, including former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, removed themselves from consideration, Mr. Romer emerged as the front-runner. And on Tuesday the school board offered him the job, even though he had no formal background as an educator. Mr. Romer was born in Garden City, Kan., and moved to Colorado as a baby. He received a degree in agricultural economics from Colorado State University in 1950 and a law degree from the University of Colorado two years later.
"The lifestyle change will cost me a lot," he said of his new job, extending his rugged hands to explain. "Look at them. I was out ranching last weekend, working in meadows, putting in culverts, repairing ditches. I enjoy that ranch and drinking good cabernet with friends at the end of the day. This is going to disrupt that in spades."
"But I didn't treat this decision lightly," he added. "I thought very, very deeply about it. I know it's a real gamble and far more challenging than being governor. But I decided I would rather go out working than sitting."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Unchanged, But Fear of Inflation Lingers

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers showed no change in May as lower costs for energy and food offset higher prices for cars and a record jump in the cost of books, according to government figures released today.
The flat reading in the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, surprised analysts who had predicted that a rebound in energy costs would push up producer prices by 0.2 percent. 
 "I don't see a lot of serious inflation in this report," said Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting project.
Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the core rate of inflation at the producer level rose 0.2 percent last month, slightly faster than many analysts were forecasting. In March and April, core prices rose by just 0.1 percent.
Economists offered conflicting opinions as to whether the uptick in the core rate was a worrisome harbinger of future inflation dangers.
"This adds a new element of concern about inflation because a preponderance of items saw prices increasing," said Paul Kasriel, economist with the Northern Trust Company.
But Stan Shipley, a Merrill Lynch economist, said that excluding the rise in car prices, the core rate rose 0.1 percent, matching many expectations. "There is no significant inflationary pressure," he said.
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since last June. Some economists believed the producer price report reduced the odds of another rate increase later this month. Others said next week's report on inflation at the consumer level in May might help settle that debate.
So far this year, producer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 4.3 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all of 1999. The pickup in producer prices largely reflects rising energy costs.
But in May, energy prices declined 0.5 percent after falling 4.1 percent in April.
Mr. Ratajczak said he did not think the report, issued by the Labor Department, captured price increases -- particularly those involving gasoline -- occurring late in the month. As a result, the P.P.I. report in June will probably show a sizable increase in energy prices, he said.
The decline in energy prices in May was led by a 12.1 percent drop in the costs of liquefied petroleum gas, like propane. That was the sharpest decrease since January. The cost of residential electric power fell 0.5 percent, the largest decline in almost a year.
Those price decreases more than offset rising prices for gasoline and residential natural gas, which each went up 1.3 percent in May. Home heating oil rose 2.5 percent.
Food prices in May fell 0.2 percent, after a sharp 1 percent increase the month before. Falling prices for eggs, pork and chicken outweighed rising prices for fruits, vegetables and beef.
Car prices rose 0.9 percent in May, the largest gain since September, and light truck prices went up 0.4 percent.
Book prices jumped a record 2.4 percent, surpassing the previous record increase of 1.6 percent in June 1995.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Rises,but Blue Chips Decline in a Quiet Session

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed in a quiet session yesterday after a tame inflation report failed to calm investors' fears that the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates to force a slowdown in the economy.
Technology stocks rose modestly, helping the Nasdaq composite index close higher for a second consecutive week. But investors in the broader market could not shake worries that higher interest rates would cut corporate profits, analysts said. 
 "Even though corporate earnings are good, if the Fed is raising rates, there's no guarantee that they'll continue to be good," said Phil Foreman, senior portfolio manager at Evergreen Investment Management in Boston.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,614.06. The blue-chip index had been higher for most of the morning. For the week, the Dow fell 180.70 points.
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index rose 49.28 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,874.84, bringing its gain for the week to 61.46 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.72 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,456.95.
Stocks initially rose yesterday after the Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was unchanged in May. Analysts had been expecting an increase of 0.3 percent.
The flat reading was a result of a drop in energy and food prices, which more than offset increased prices for cars, paper products and books.
Excluding the drop in energy and food prices, the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level last month was 0.2 percent, slightly above analysts' forecasts. That troubled some investors and derailed the market's early attempt to advance.
"The P.P.I. was definitely a step in the right direction," said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "While it was a somewhat mixed report, it was not very inflationary looking at the bigger picture."
The producer price report followed a series of indicators over the last few weeks that have shown a moderating United States economic pace.
Stock investors have been hoping for a gradual economic slowdown, which could persuade the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. The Fed has increased rates six times in the last year in an attempt to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
Investors will be looking closely at economic reports that will be issued next week, including figures on retail sales and consumer prices, for further signs on the economy. "Next week we will really find out how hot the economy is, and the effect of those six rate hikes," Mr. Piskorowski said.
Technology stocks were mostly higher. Qualcomm and Sun Microsystems gained, both on the Nasdaq. Qualcomm rose 1 5/8, to 79 1/16, and Sun jumped 2 7/16, to 89 15/16. On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow component Hewlett-Packard and its spinoff, Agilent Technologies, were both up. Hewlett increased 2 1/8, to 128, while Agilent climbed 33 /16, to 71 1/8.
But some "old economy" stalwarts pulled the Dow lower. McDonald's fell 2 1/16, to 33 3/8, after the company reported sales growth slowed in May. Analysts said the company faced a difficult comparison with May 1999 figures, because McDonald's was running a popular Beanie Babies giveaway last year.
Lucent Technologies fell 3 3/16, to 59 11/16, hurting the S.& P. 500. Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate for the company's fiscal 2000 revenue and profit, saying the company was suffering from a decline in a leading product line of switches.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 105 2/32 and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, remained at 5.89 percent. The price of the 10-year note rose 1/32, to 102 24/32, while the yield was unchanged at 6.12 percent.

HEADLINE: One-Day National Strike Freezes Much of Argentina

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, June 9

 BODY:
Several million workers joined or were forced to acquiesce to a one-day national strike today to protest President Fernando de la Rua's economic austerity policies and Argentina's 14 percent unemployment rate.
The strike, the largest in four years, represented a rare show of unity by the fractious labor movement and the most serious challenge to Mr. de la Rua's deficit-cutting policies since he took office in December. 
 The walkout occurred at an inopportune time for the Argentine president, who is planning a trip to the United States early next week to see President Clinton and promote Argentine investments to Wall Street executives who have cooled to the country's prospects in recent years.
Major cities and much of the countryside were paralyzed as thousands of railroad, subway, bus, truck and airline workers joined the walkout. Bonfires were set, bridges blocked, and buses and taxicabs dented or otherwise damaged by workers.
More than 50 people were arrested. Thousands of stores closed, as many people decided to take a long weekend. Courts closed, and hospital emergency rooms had skeletal staffs. Uncollected garbage lined streets and shopping areas.
In small demonstrations, workers beat drums, set off firecrackers and, in a few incidents, threw rocks at the police.
"What the people want is work," said Rodolfo Daer, head of the General Labor Confederation, the largest workers' group. "What the government needs to understand is that the people are demanding a change in direction."
The government tried to limit the damage by offering to open talks with the unions, businessmen, opposition governors and the Roman Catholic Church to reach some kind of consensus on economic policy.
"In place of violence we need dialogue," Mr. de la Rua told reporters. "But in order to have dialogue, we need not have violence."
The strike was planned to protest a $938 million cut in public spending, or 2 percent of the government budget. The spending plan, announced two weeks ago, is intended to meet International Monetary Fund guidelines and retain access to a $7.2 billion emergency credit line from the fund.
The austerity package includes salary cuts for national government workers of 12 to 15 percent, reducing public retirement payments and bans on public workers' earning salaries while receiving state pensions from previous positions.
The latest round of cuts was imposed on top of $1.4 billion in cuts initiated by the de la Rua administration in its first weeks in office. All told, the spending cuts and a $2 billion tax increase are intended to bring down interest rates and keep the federal deficit under $4.5 billion this year, or one-third below the 1999 total.
The economy has responded slowly to the medicine, as the national mood grows increasingly sour over a recession that has already run for two years. Last week, Mr. de la Rua lowered projections of a 4 percent growth rate this year to 3.5 percent, an anemic comeback after losing 3 percent in 1999.
Independent economists expect this year to register an even lower growth rate, 2.5 percent, far below that of Chile and Brazil, the other major economies in the region. With its currency tied to the strong dollar, Argentina lags behind its neighbors in exports. And with unemployment reaching 20 percent or more in poorer provinces with financially weak local governments, labor and social unrest is building in the countryside. Farmers who are seeking easier credit are threatening an extensive work action this month.
Mr. de la Rua is urging patience, arguing that his policies need time to increase competitiveness on trade and investor and consumer confidence. His supporters point to recent developments that suggest that the economy might finally be ready to recover. Tax receipts, exports and imports showed signs of a pickup last month. A recent strengthening of the euro should help exports to Europe.
In a move that promises to cut government finance costs $200 million, Argentina this week completed a successful debt swap of old Brady bonds for debt with lower interest.
The general strike today was the second since Mr. de la Rua took office. But it was much bigger than the splintered work action in February, which aimed to prevent changes in the labor law that were intended to lower labor costs for businesses. Congress eventually passed changes, anyway.
The unions are also upset over a decree that promises to deregulate the health industry gradually, expanding private health insurance to the detriment of a union-based health-insurance system. The current system is a cash cow for union leaders.

HEADLINE: East Harlem Shopping Center Snagged Over Financing of Garage

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
It was supposed to bring Manhattan its first Costco and Home Depot superstores and add more than a thousand jobs in East Harlem. But now, plans to build a shopping center along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive have run into a serious snag because no financing has been found for the $30 million garage that is needed to make the project work, officials said this week.
But they say they remain hopeful that the $160 million complex, known as East River Plaza, will eventually get off the ground. "I don't think it's in anybody's interest for this project to be abandoned," said Councilman Philip Reed, who represents East Harlem. "We worked very hard to sell this project, and the community was ultimately receptive to it." 
 Approved last fall by the City Council, the shopping center, one of the largest projects planned for Manhattan in recent years, is intended to replace the long-dormant Washburn Wire Factory along the highway between 116th and 119th Streets. In addition to the superstores, leases have been signed with Old Navy, Gap and Best Buy. Other tenants are expected to include Staples, T. J. Maxx and Modell's Sporting Goods, said David Blumenfeld, a vice president of the Blumenfeld Development Corporation, which is developing the shopping center with Canyon Capital Management.
Blumenfeld is also building a smaller retail center on 125th Street, near Lexington Avenue and opposite a Pathmark supermarket that opened last year. The complex was originally expected to house a 10-screen United Artists movie theater, but United Artists has backed out of the deal and no replacement was found, said Jesse Masyr, the lawyer representing the developers.
As for East River Plaza, Mr. Blumenfeld said his tenants were unwilling to foot the construction cost of a seven-level garage containing 1,248 spaces and had insisted on free parking for the first two hours. But state officials, who would discuss the project only privately, say that the developer should not expect the public to absorb the entire cost of a private parking garage.
The garage is needed because the developers estimate that the complex will draw 5,000 cars a day -- a figure that the project's critics say is much too low. Many people in the neighborhood are concerned about the added noise and pollution from the influx of cars to East Harlem, which has one of the highest asthma rates in the country.
But opponents, including William Minic, a cabinetmaker who would have to give up the shop he has owned for more than two decades, were never able to muster a serious challenge to the project. And on Tuesday, a Supreme Court Appellate Division dismissed a lawsuit seeking to block the state from condemning property for the shopping center, saying it had not been filed in time.
Mr. Masyr said he expected the decision to stand, but Jack R. Lester, the lawyer for the project's opponents, said the ruling did not bar further legal challenges.
Pointing out that the cost of the project had nearly doubled since it was unveiled three years ago, state officials said they were working with the city's Economic Development Corporation to try to get additional financing from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city program.
One stumbling block, state officials say, is that developers would not guarantee how many jobs the project would generate, although they expect the number to be 1,200 to 1,500. Mr. Masyr said that it was impossible to get tenants to promise to hire a specific number of employees. But he said the developers were willing to pay a penalty if certain goals were not met.
Mr. Blumenfeld said he was disappointed that the state was not pushing harder to get the project going. "It's disheartening for the people of Harlem and for myself," he said. "It's rare that you have a project that has tenants, financing and approvals and still hasn't started."
C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said she would urge Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to find a way to rescue the project. And she said she was still optimistic. "This is just a fork in the road," she said. "So much has already been invested that ultimately the resources will be found."

HEADLINE: Security Council Extends Oil-for-Food Program Allowing Iraq to Import Necessities

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 9

 BODY:
With Iraqi profits from oil sales now at record-high levels, the Security Council has extended the "oil-for-food" program for another six months to allow the imports of food, medicine and other civilian necessities.
During this period, a new arms inspection system will be readied to go into action in Iraq, the chief inspector said on Thursday, challenging Iraq to take advantage of a more lenient set of requirements for suspending economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
 The oil-for-food plan was instituted by the United Nations in 1996 to help alleviate the sufferings of ordinary Iraqis under the sanctions, and must be renewed every six months. Late last year, the United Nations lifted the ceiling on how much oil Iraq could sell.
In debate before a vote near midnight on Thursday, the deadline for the oil-sales extension, the council defeated a Russian and Chinese attempt to write into the resolution language that would have identified the sanctions as the sole cause of continuing hardships in Iraq.
That argument did not convince all council members, as the Iraqis are thought to have generated $8.4 billion in oil sales in the latest six-month phase. Since 1996, $25.3 billion in oil has been sold. Some experts say that President Saddam Hussein is also pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars in illegally smuggled oil.
Not all the legal profits go to the government for purchases to improve the lives of Iraqi citizens. A third of the income is set aside for a compensation fund for victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and other sums are earmarked for autonomous Kurdish areas of Iraq and for the arms inspection budget. Even so, Secretary General Kofi Annan said in his latest report to the Security Council this week, there is now enough money to significantly mitigate civilians' hardships if the government managed it better.
"Now that increased revenues are available for the implementation of the program, the government of Iraq is in a position to reduce current malnutrition levels and to improve the health status of the Iraqi people," Mr. Annan said. He urged Iraq to increase the oil revenue allocated to health and nutrition, to order and distribute supplies more efficiently.
Mr. Annan also said in his report that the most recent surveys by Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, found that malnutrition rates had leveled, with a slight reduction in the number of underweight children, although rates for severe conditions known as stunting and wasting were still too high. As for other aspects of children's welfare, Mr. Annan's report noted some advances in education, including the rehabilitation of schools.
But Mr. Annan again warned that the practice of certain Security Council members -- primarily the United States, though it was not named -- of blocking contracts with Iraq for water and sanitation equipment will continue to harm health.
The Security Council also decided in the resolution approved Thursday night to send an independent assessment team to Iraq to study the condition of the Iraqi people.
The sanctions were to have remained in place until Iraq was certified as free of prohibited weapons -- chemical, biological and nuclear arms as well as long-range missiles. But last December, the Security Council proposed suspending sanctions if Iraq cooperated with a new team of arms inspectors.
In an interview Thursday, Hans Blix, the executive chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or Unmovic, said that the new organization has now filled most senior-level jobs and will be training inspectors over the next few months. By August, they will be ready to reopen the Baghdad monitoring center, closed by Iraq since December 1998, and prepare for resumed inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which Dr. Blix once directed and which is responsible for monitoring nuclear programs, is ready to resume its inspections at any time.
Although most of Iraq's complaints about the earlier inspection commission, Unscom, have been addressed in the new system, Mr. Hussein has shown no inclination to let inspectors return.
Dr. Blix said that after an absence of 18 months, inspectors will have to re-establish baselines for surveys, reviewing all suspect Iraqi sites to be monitored. Confounding his critics, Dr. Blix, a former Swedish foreign minister, has kept some essential experts from Unscom on his team, ignoring Iraqi and Russian demands for a clean slate.
"Then comes the question, when are we going in?" he said. "We see no sign whatever of that at the present time. However, in politics things can change, and my personal view is that the Iraqis would gain by cooperating and accepting."
"They demand that the so-called sanctions should be lifted," he said. But he added that few stringent sanctions remained, beyond a ban on air travel in and out of the country. "It was an embargo on the sale of oil first; now there are no limits on how much oil they can sell," he said. "They can use any amount they want to buy food and medicine -- but they cannot buy weapons.
"This is the Iraqi position: that they want to have all these restrictions lifted.
He said the Security Council resolution creating the new inspection commission offered some innovations that Iraq should consider if it wants to speed the end of sanctions.
"It enables the Security Council to suspend the sanctions provided two criteria: that there be cooperation with Unmovic in 120 days, and included in the cooperation will also be the resolution of some key disarmament issues," he said. "The criteria are, I would say, more lenient."

HEADLINE: Economy May Have a Soft Spot;
Swelling Trade Gap Worries Some Experts and Policy Makers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9

 BODY:
If this bionic economy has a soft underbelly, it may be trade.
As Americans gorge on imported cars, electronics, clothing and a long list of other goods from abroad, the nation's trade deficit has swollen to record proportions, leaving economists and policy makers increasingly troubled. 
 The trade deficit for March, the most recent month for which data is available, was $30.2 billion, 56 percent higher than in March 1999. Imports for March totaled $117.4 billion, up 21.9 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier.
Broader measures of the nation's international transactions have also deteriorated. The current account deficit -- which includes foreigners' profits on investments in the United States and Americans' investments in other countries as well as trade in goods and services -- reached $338.9 billion in 1999, up 53.6 percent from 1998.
The current account deficit, which amounted to 3.7 percent of total economic output for all of last year and 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, is projected by most economists to rise again this year. It is already by far the largest among the big industrialized countries. The last time trade was a big issue for the American economy, during the mid-and late-1980's, the current account deficit peaked at 3.4 percent of gross domestic product.
The main reason for the surge is clear. For the last few years, the American economy has been booming, while those of its major trading partners have been weak. As a result, the thirst for imported goods has grown even as the market for American exports has stagnated.
What is less clear is whether the trade imbalance will prove to be a substantial problem.
It could recede quickly if Japan bounces back and Europe's recovery continues, especially if the Federal Reserve also succeeds in slowing the growth of economic demand in the United States. And in any case, foreign companies and investors have been happy so far to finance the deficit by recycling the dollars they earn through trade back into the United States, where the technology-fueled boom has offered high rates of return. Indeed, some economists see the current account deficit more as an indicator of a healthy surge of foreign investment into the United States than as a sign of a sickening trade imbalance.
But there is a worst-case set of possibilities out there that haunts many economists: foreign investors lose faith in the American economy's relative advantages, investment from abroad dries up, the dollar plunges, inflation jumps and the Fed is forced to respond by driving interest rates sharply higher, endangering the long expansion.
With the American economy strong and unemployment low, the growing trade deficit so far has not produced the same protectionist pressures that previous surges in the trade gap have provoked. Yes, anxiety about competition from low- wage workers abroad was at the heart of labor's failed campaign against normalizing trade relations with China. But the trade gap itself has merited hardly a mention so far in the presidential campaign.
And in contrast to the 1980's, when the United States was plagued by a simultaneous rise in its trade and budget deficits, the federal government is currently running a large budget surplus, providing a substantial cushion for the economy.
Still, the situation has policy makers in Washington concerned. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has repeatedly warned that the rapid growth in imports compared with a much more modest increase in exports cannot go on forever. And it has been on the mind of Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary.
"When a large external imbalance reflects a period of strong growth relative to the rest of the world, and relatively high investment in our productive potential, as it does in the United States today," Mr. Summers said in a speech last month, "that imbalance is unlikely to pose an immediate threat to our economic well-being."
But, Mr. Summers added, "a large and growing current account deficit is not something that can be sustained indefinitely."
"It can also give rise to protectionist pressures," he said, "and it distorts the pattern of domestic economic activity."
The Clinton administration has shown no inclination to push down the dollar to promote exports by making American goods cheaper when purchased in foreign currencies. Indeed, calls for a weaker dollar from exporters and industries that compete with imports have been relatively muted compared with the 1980's, when auto companies, steel makers, farmers and other howled about their inability to compete with their foreign counterparts.
Instead, the administration has stressed the importance of increasing national savings by paying down the federal debt -- a step that could help reduce reliance on foreign capital -- and has pressed Japan and Europe to overhaul their economies to create more demand for goods from the United States.
"We'd see a more balanced situation if Europe and Japan were growing faster," said Ralph C. Bryant, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization. "But you wouldn't want to put the brakes hard on the U.S. economy just to get the trade and current account deficits smaller, and you don't want to put up new fences at the border. That would be far more costly than would make sense."
But as the current account deficit has grown, there has been an increasing debate inside and outside of government about the degree of the threat posed by the trade gap.
One camp views the deficit as essentially benign.
In this view, the trade gap will narrow as the American economy slows. In any case, imports so far in this economic cycle have served as a safety valve for the supercharged American economy, helping to keep inflation under control at a time when domestic producers cannot keep up with demand.
Moreover, by purchasing so much from abroad, the United States has helped many other countries rebound from the financial crisis that swept around the world in 1998. And by investing the dollars they earn back into the United States, foreign companies, governments and investors are adding to the pool of capital that American companies have used to become more productive and competitive.
"With the current account deficit at a record high, it's silly to say it can't possibly be of any importance," said John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But the current account deficit is only a sign of other developments of more direct importance, in this case the significant and sustained growth differential between the U.S. and its trading partners."
At the same time, Mr. Lipsky added, "The emergence of what is sometimes called the new economy has attracted foreign investors."
In the sense that the current account deficit is just the reverse side of a flood of foreign direct investment in the United States, "it represents something good about the U.S., not something bad," Mr. Lipsky said.
But there is a more dire view of the trade imbalance.
In this view, further expansion in the current account deficit cannot be sustained. The deficit is at a level that leaves the economy vulnerable to a sharp fall in the value of the dollar, a jump in inflation and interest rates, and a slowdown in growth or even a recession.
"You cannot continually run a growing current account deficit without ultimately facing a very sharp fall in your exchange rate, which in the current circumstances of the U.S. economy could be a killer," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The chain of events that Mr. Bergsten worries about would involve a steep drop in the dollar, a resulting surge in inflation and a determined response by the Federal Reserve to restore stability by pushing interest rates up sharply.
The current account gap, Mr. Bergsten said, is "the single biggest threat to the current expansion of the economy."
Among policy makers in Washington, there is less a sense of crisis than a gnawing concern about the long-term trends in trade. Officials at the Fed cite a theory first developed in the 1960's by Hendrik S. Houthakker, an economist at Harvard University. He found that growth in imports to the United States relative to income growth runs at roughly twice the rate it does in the rest of the world. That finding has been confirmed repeatedly over the years.
In other words, if the American economy is expanding at anything close to the rest of the world's growth rate, the American trade deficit will increase.
That was not a big problem during a lot of the post-World War II period, when much of the rest of the world experienced higher growth rates than the United States. But should growth in the United States remain as strong as it has been the last few years, and should the rest of the world not rebound, it could push the trade deficit to previously unimagined levels.
In political terms, there is also the possibility of the trade deficit with a particular country or set of countries creating protectionist pressures in Washington. Organized labor is likely to keep a close eye on trade with China, which is about to join the World Trade Organization. And any renewed effort by Japan to export its way out of its doldrums could bring a return of the trade tensions that characterized its relationship with the United States for years.
But among consumers, who have enjoyed lower prices and improved quality in many products as a result of global competition, there are few signs of worry.
"If Americans are going to want me to buy their car, then they need to offer me a good product," said Diane Spivey of Clermont, Ga., who recently bought a Volkswagen Passat. "I don't look on it as your economy and my economy. The world is a pretty small place these days."

HEADLINE: Budget Follies in New York

 BODY:
One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proudest boasts is that he has restored fiscal discipline at City Hall. Lately, however, a different story has unfolded. New York City's spending growth is running at more than twice the rate of inflation, and borrowing is spiraling so fast that the city needs state legislative approval to exceed its debt ceiling.
Now Mr. Giuliani has made the picture worse with a pension ploy announced a few weeks ago. Since the pension funds are flush because of the stock market, he has proposed tapping $800 million from contributions due this year and next. The money is to be used to close city budget deficits in the current year and the one beginning July 1. To win union permission for that scheme, he agreed to let 200,000 municipal workers cut back on their own contributions to the system, raising their take-home pay by 3 percent. That step will cost the city $300 million a year in the future. 
 State workers have won a separate agreement from Gov. George Pataki and State Comptroller Carl McCall for a cost-of-living increase for retirees. The state pension funds can afford it, but the governor and the Legislature are also planning to apply it to the city, where the Giuliani administration says it could cost $700 million a year.
Mr. Giuliani warns that without additional state aid to help pay for the state-mandated cost-of-living hike for retirees, tax cuts proposed for next year may have to be rescinded. But the mayor would be more persuasive if he had not already showed poor judgment on pensions.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Outlines Plans To Curb Militant Networks

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, June 9

 BODY:
After months of criticism from Washington of its handling of terrorism, Pakistan today outlined an ambitious campaign aimed at slowly curbing networks of militants that have taken root here and in Afghanistan.
Senior officials said the military government has decided to act not because of the American pressure, but because the networks threaten Pakistan by "fanning sectarian violence and poisoning people's minds," said Moinuddin Haider, the interior minister. 
 There has been a growing criticism of Pakistan by Washington and independent groups. A Congressionally appointed advisory panel has recommended that Pakistan be designated as a government that is "not cooperating fully" against terrorism.
In an interview, Mr. Haider said his government had made a "clear-cut policy decision" to begin controlling the thousands of religious schools, some of which preach hatred of the West and provide young recruits to the "jihads," or holy wars, in Kashmir, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya, and to other conflicts involving Muslims.
Some also channel militants to terrorist groups such as those linked to the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden, who is being sheltered by Afghanistan and whose network has been accused of repeatedly killing Americans.
At Pakistan's urging, Mr. Haider said, the Taliban in Afghanistan have expelled several Pakistanis and several Arabs wanted by their home governments for alleged terrorist attacks. He said the Taliban have also occupied Rishkavour, which Western diplomats say is a leading training camp for militants near Kabul.
In addition to providing mujahedeen, or holy warriors, for conflicts throughout the world, such camps have also produced the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center and two American Embassies in Africa, intelligence officials have concluded. Most recently, veterans of such camps plotted to attack tourist sites in Jordan and America around the time of the new year's celebrations, they say.
The United States has become alarmed about those networks, particularly those affiliated with or supported by Mr. bin Laden.
Mr. Haider, a retired general who was governor of Sindh Province until his current appointment, insisted that Pakistan made the decision based on its own security interests. "I feel this is good for Pakistan," he said. "I'm not following anyone else's agenda.
"Pakistan ought to become a progressive, modern and tolerant secular state."
He said the campaign would mark a radical departure from some of Pakistan's political and religious traditions. "It will not happen overnight, and it will upset many people," Mr. Haider said. But he added that his government was determined to enforce a "gradual rollback" of the networks.
Asked for comment on the steps outlined this week, Karl F. Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asia, said the United States welcomed them. Though Washington had not been officially informed about some of the measures, he said: "These are precisely the kinds of things we've been hoping to hear from the government of Pakistan. We hope they'll be successful in carrying them out."
Whether they will be, he added, is "the $64,000 question."
Another American official who monitors terrorism expressed skepticism about whether the Taliban were being truly responsive and whether Pakistan, which is facing strikes and growing criticism of its economic measures, would maintain pressure on the Taliban.
He noted, for example, that Washington had not confirmed that the Taliban have taken over Rishkavour. But he said Islamabad's actions reflect a "higher level of effort than we've recently seen."
Among other things, the steps Pakistan is talking about include demanding that Afghanistan shut down 18 training camps identified by Pakistan; arresting and extraditing 20 to 25 Pakistanis and an unspecified number of Arabs wanted for terrorism by their respective governments; and improving border controls.
A second part of the effort involves the potentially explosive topic of identifying thousands of religious schools, which typically have not been regulated, and imposing standards on them.
To date, Mr. Haider said, about 4,000 religious schools, or madrassas, have been registered. He has been meeting with madrassa leaders, he said, to encourage them to modernize their curriculum to include mathematics and computer skills. Such schools, he said, which often take the place of public schools, should not produce zealots, but "balanced persons."
Jessica Stern, a terrorism expert at Harvard University and a former official in the Clinton administration, said the Pakistani program could greatly reduce terrorism in the region. But she said only 4,345 schools have been registered so far, of an estimated 40,000. And, she said, most of the rural, most extremist madrassas strongly oppose government intervention in their activities. Pakistan has come a long way, she said, but it has a long way to go in preventing sectarian violence.
Zahid Hussain, a senior editor of Newsline, an independent monthly, said the military government is caught between competing pressures. On one hand, he said, it needs the West economically and does not want to be isolated politically. But on the other, he said he doubted that it could afford to antagonize the religious groups that are a core political constituency.

House Approves Measure To Repeal Inheritance Tax
The House voted to repeal the federal inheritance tax, drawing a veto threat from President Clinton even as Democrats joined Republicans in recognizing the issue's political potency. The vote was 279-136, with 65 Democrats voting in favor.
Republican leaders, who have made repeal of what they call the "death tax" one of their main priorities, said they were driven in part by a desire to help owners of small businesses and family farms, who have long complained that the estate tax made it costly if not impossible to pass their holdings along to another generation. But Republicans also said they viewed the tax as inherently unfair and even immoral, no matter who pays it. Page A1. 

Nasdaq Jumps 49 Points, to 3,874
Technology stocks advanced modestly, helping the Nasdaq composite index close higher. The Nasdaq rose 49.28 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,874.84. For the week, it climbed 61.46 points, or 1.6 percent, but is still down 4.8 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,614.06. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 4.72 points, to 1,456.95. C3.
 
Microsoft's Might Is Challenged
Whether Microsoft wins or loses its appeal of an antitrust ruling that could break the company in two, its world has changed, perhaps forever. Some of the changes are linked to a growing belief that close government scrutiny has made it more difficult for Microsoft to flex its industry might. Others are linked to the rapid emergence of new consumer markets, ranging from hand-held computing to digital delivery of audio and video, where the industry standards established by Microsoft software and Intel hardware may offer no advantage. A1.
 
Prices Paid to Producers Flat in May
Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and other producers showed no change in May as lower costs for energy and food more than offset higher prices for cars and a record jump in the cost of books, according to government figures. The flat reading in the Producer Price Index surprised analysts who had predicted that a rebound in energy costs would push up producer prices by 0.2 percent. C3.
 
For Japan, Growth but Not Recovery
The Japanese economy rebounded in the first quarter of this year, reversing the course set in the previous six months. But economists said the numbers did not necessarily signal a sustainable recovery and merely extended the pattern of alternating growth and contraction that has prevailed for many years in Japan, Asia's biggest economy. C2.
 
Shares of E.D.S. Tumble on Warning
Shares of Electronic Data Systems tumbled 26 percent after it said second-quarter sales would be less than analysts had expected. Shares of E.D.S. fell $14.8125, to $43. The stock has slipped 34 percent this year. Changes in the organization of its sales force are hurting revenue growth, and the warning is a setback for Richard H. Brown, who took over as chief executive last year. C2.
 
Amgen Loses Round in Patent Case
Transkaryotic Therapies won a round in its patent fight with the biotechnology giant Amgen when a judge ruled that Transkaryotic did not infringe on one of Amgen's patents covering its best-selling drug. A trial continues on other Amgen patents. C2.
 
Unemployment Rate in Canada Falls
Canada's unemployment rate dipped to a 24-year low of 6.6 percent in May, down two-tenths of a percentage point from April. The strong economy added more than 42,000 jobs last month and almost all were full-time jobs in the private sector. Given the strong job market and other signs of a brisk economy, economists expect the Bank of Canada to continue to match any interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the United States.

HEADLINE: Two Record Labels Settle Copyright SuitWith MP3.com

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 9

 BODY:
Signaling a new era of cooperation in the volatile world of online music distribution, two major record labels said today that they had settled a copyright lawsuit with MP3.com, in a deal that permits the music start-up to store consumers' record libraries and provide access to them over the Internet.
Under the settlement, MP3.com will pay roughly $20 million each to BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann A.G., and Warner Music Group, a subsidiary of Time Warner, along with licensing fees for use of the labels' music on the service, parties close to the negotiations said. 
 The deal hardly dispels the recording industry's pressing concerns about music piracy online, nor does it make the bulk of the music from the major record labels available for purchase and listening over the Internet. But it appears to signal a recognition by the labels and by MP3.com that the traditional and the online businesses need each other and can profit by working together.
Michael Robertson, chairman and chief executive of MP3.com, declined to discuss the amount of the settlement but said that even if the reports were accurate, the fees would not jeopardize the company's long-term viability.
He said the company, which is based in San Diego, had $380 million in cash reserves. "The reality is, cash is not an issue," he said, adding that he believed the settlement paved the way for growth of the company.
Eric Sheirer, an entertainment analyst with Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said that by settling, the music labels at once scored a victory but also signaled a willingness to embrace the online marketplace.
He said it was of symbolic importance that the record labels settled with MP3.com, which is just one of the companies that use the MP3 format to distribute music on the Internet.
"It's a huge day for the recording industry," he said. "They are embracing a business model that revolves around the MP3 format."
That does not mean, however, that the labels are embracing a mechanism for piracy, record industry officials said. The use of the MP3 format under the settlements announced today, they said, is confined to allowing consumers to listen only to music that they have already purchased, and not to download or trade music that they do not own.
In a case that could have broader implications, the Recording Industry Association of America is pursuing a suit against Napster, an online service that provides software that Internet users employ to share and trade music files, including copyrighted material. The service says it is not responsible if some people use its software to pirate music. But the recording industry disagrees, asserting that piracy costs the industry and the artists it represents tens of millions of dollars in lost sales. That case is being heard in a federal court in Northern California.
Under the deal announced today, MP3.com agreed to license, for undisclosed fees, the use of songs from BMG and Warner Music for use in its My.MP3.com service. The service allows consumers to store their own record collections on MP3.com's computers in "virtual lockers" and have access to them by way of the Internet.
MP3.com started the My.MP3.com service in January. In hopes of making the service easy to use, the company itself bought tens of thousands of commercial compact discs. Consumers who proved they owned a copy of a given disc, by inserting it into their PC while visiting the site, would thereafter gain access to that music from the MP3.com computers.
But the recording industry argued in court that MP3.com was violating copyrights by copying the music, compiling a vast database without permission or license. Although Mr. Robertson argued that his service simply extended to cyberspace consumers' legal rights to make a copy of their own music, a federal judge in New York agreed with the labels in April, finding that the practice violated copyright law because MP3.com had not received permission from the recording industry.
Three other major record labels, Sony Music, EMI and Universal Music Group, said they were continuing independent settlement negotiations and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment on the settlement. Kevin Conroy, chief marketing officer at BMG, said that "the best enforcement is the creation of legitimate alternatives for consumers."
The lawsuit was brought by the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the five major record labels. But because of antitrust regulations, the labels must settle the licensing agreements separately, industry officials said.
If the other labels also settle for around $20 million each, as industry analysts expect, the cost to MP3.com could be $100 million or more, people close to the negotiations said.
The My.MP3.com service has about 500,000 accounts, but the virtual lockers do not now include music from the major labels. Mr. Robertson said the service would continue to be free, even though MP3.com will have to pay licensing fees to the labels. He said the company would continue to rely on advertising for its revenue. The site, which also sells some items online, also offers music from independent artists.
In addition to any deal struck with the major labels, MP3.com is seeking licensing deals with music publishing groups, and Mr. Robertson said that the service would not be fully functional until both sets of deals were made final.
"This is building a foundation for creating a massive online business," Mr. Robertson said, calling the settlement a "win-win" for the two parties. "Shareholders of major record labels are getting a bite of the online apple," he said.
The deal apparently played well with investors. Shares of MP3.com rose $1.9375, to $19.1875, in Nasdaq trading today.
Industry analysts said the settlement might indeed represent a partial victory for MP3.com and for Mr. Robertson, who has ruffled many feathers in the recording industry by asserting that traditional music business models have been outdated in the Internet era.
Michael B. Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, said he was surprised that the settlement came so quickly.
"I would have thought they would punish Mr. Robertson," he said, "But what it shows me is they realize there's a lot of traffic on his site and that at the end of the day, it makes sense to work with these sites rather than oppose them."

CANADA JOBLESSNESS FALLS

BYLINE: By Timothy Pritchard 

 BODY:
Canada's unemployment rate dipped to a 24-year low of 6.6 percent in May, down two-tenths of a percentage point from April. The strong economy added more than 42,000 jobs last month and almost all were full-time jobs in the private sector. Given the strong job market and other signs of a brisk economy, economists expect the Bank of Canada to continue to match any interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the United States.

HEADLINE: A War Over Rent, on Two Coasts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While Paul Krugman and most of his fellow economists may believe that it is "obvious" that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing (column, June 7), their analysis ignores an important factor: price-controlled housing is often the only affordable alternative for low- and moderate-income city dwellers. 
 The federal government has largely abandoned its construction of subsidized housing over the last 20 years, and the private sector has consistently shown its preference for building new housing priced for the wealthiest 5 percent of our population. While the economists are probably right that eliminating price controls would stimulate construction, it's doubtful that much of this would be decent, affordable housing for the working class.
Perhaps the answer lies in a combination of new governmental initiatives and tax incentives for private builders to increase the available housing supply for all income levels.

HEADLINE: A War Over Rent, on Two Coasts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman diagnoses San Francisco's rent control problem, (column, June 7) but stops before recommending treatment. 
 The city granted rent-controlled tenants a share of the landlord's property rights without financially compensating the landlord, although the tenants enjoy the economic benefit of lower rents.
However, the obvious solution -- repealing rent control -- would be the same bad thinking turned backward. Tenants should be allowed to sell their rent-control rights for a market-driven lump sum, either to the landlord or to incoming tenants. Rents could be raised for the new tenant, but the extra cost to them of purchasing rent-control rights would force landlords to keep rent somewhat below market levels. Over time, most rent control would be bought out of existence by landlords.

 "Talking of war, there'll be trouble in the Balkans in the spring," a character mutters in Rudyard Kipling's 1899 novel, "The Light That Failed." He is a war correspondent idling his time away in London, hoping for deliverance in the Balkans, where he and all the other correspondents "will have as much as ever we can do" and "the chance to see things" that make reputations. It has been this way for a long time: We know the Balkans as metaphor, as a world where Europe (its meaning and boundaries uncertain at best) trails off and another reality begins, as a nemesis overtaking times and places of order.
Nowadays the Balkans again belong to journalists; the histories of these lands are written by war reporters or those who can sense the approaching thunder of war. By the time that rumble is heard, the fire will have eaten up the social and economic history and the truths and arrangements that held a place together will have been torched. This ruin gives a certain liberty to authors. The older history and reality hadn't held. If conquest rounds out the borders, why bother with the history of land ownership in the Balkans? If civility cracks, why bother with the literature of the place?
Eight years after the prison camps of Bosnia, five years after Srebrenica marked our age and mocked our pretensions that we have been delivered into a world beyond history's furies, we are wiser about the Balkans and Balkan legends. Few people are around now whose first acquaintance with them came from Rebecca West, the purveyor of Balkan legends, whose huge book of travel, "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon," grew out of a six-week venture into Yugoslavia in 1937. We have had enough stories about the Serbian Czar Lazar being offered, on the Field of Blackbirds in June 1389, a choice between an earthly kingdom for a time and a heavenly kingdom that would last for "eternity and its centuries." He opted for the heavenly one and we know what terrible crimes have been committed in his name. If the romance is gone, so is the moral fury with which the first round of Balkan terrors was treated by gifted authors who spoke for us. Readers now are wrung out of sorrow, out of the surprise and wonder we bring to reading.
Misha Glenny, a British journalist, made his name with "The Fall of Yugoslavia," published in 1993. He chronicled what he had witnessed on the scene. The present has clearly emboldened him, and he has come back with a big book, "The Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804-1999." It claims to be nothing less than the history of the Balkans since the rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century.
A few years ago Glenny's voice -- with its knowingness, its sly skepticism about all the competing nationalisms of the Balkans, the hints that outraged outsiders who fell for Bosnia's Muslims didn't really know the area -- could sustain a book of reportage, and his journalism. There were readers (myself included) who did not find in his writing enough of their wrath against the Serbian revanchists. But the war gave him material and confidence. He was in his early 30's. Those were the truths he brought out of the burning grounds of Vukovar and Sarajevo.
Writing a big book of history is a different endeavor. Glenny tackles Balkan history in the manner of a CNN reporter working behind history's lines -- all the way from the revolts of Serbia and Greece in the 1800's to the present. The great historian Fernand Braudel wrote of history as the interplay of "stillness and movement." He warned that chronicling events will not suffice: "Events are the ephemera of history; they pass from the scene across its stage like fireflies, hardly glimpsed before they settle back into darkness and as often as not into oblivion." Glenny doesn't have the eye for "stillness," for secrets of a people's history that aren't easily yielded up to us.
He has assimilated and rewritten a huge amount of history, but his book is weighed down by its very bulk. He relies on anecdotes, so the book hangs by a slender thread. His theme -- that interventions by the great powers through the generations have added to the ruin of the Balkans -- is hardly novel. The observation that those interventions -- the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the wars and diplomacy that ushered in and settled World War I, World War II and its resolution -- guaranteed the relative economic backwardness of the Balkans, compared to the rest of Europe" will not do as economic history. The tangled tale of new nationalisms filling the void left by the collapse of the Ottoman and Hapsburg Empires has been told by talented historians.
The explanation offered for this book is that Glenny discovered that he had carried into his Balkan reporting "prejudicial baggage" and he had been "obliged to make judgments about Yugoslav and Balkan history" when he had only "the vaguest acquaintance" with historical matters. But that can hardly justify an inquiry of this length and ambition. With Glenny's new book, we are face to face with the fate awaiting places that succumb to political ruin: the outsider's presumption that a whole, big history is there for the plucking.
In "Kosovo: War and Revenge" Tim Judah, a journalist who has covered with depth and intimacy the region for The Economist and other publications, gives himself a narrower mandate and delivers a superb political narrative of the fight for Kosovo. It is now Kosova (its Albanian name); the city of Pec goes by the name of Peja; the town of Podujevo is now Podujeva. The world has been turned upside down; two-thirds of the Serbs have left their homes behind and the old fight between Serbian claim and Albanian demography has been settled in favor of the Albanians. The place is an international protectorate; a force of 40,000 troops sent by the United Nations and NATO plays the role of reluctant imperialist. In an odd sort of way, Kosovo has been folded into a Pax Americana, a destiny prefigured by Bosnia. The rescue offered Kosovo was late and hedged; it was triggered by revulsion against the Serbs, but the troops came in subdued and wary of the Albanians. Judah covers this whole story authoritatively, so his is not a pretty book. But his instincts are good; he has no ax to grind. He recounts the Serbian horrors, but also the later massive flight of the Serbs that created a new order in Kosovo. He records the lawlessness of the new masters there, the hard boys of the Kosovo Liberation Army who emerged as the inheritors of the place.
It was perhaps destined to end this way. Edith Durham, an English chronicler who was there in 1908 and is much quoted by Judah, glimpsed the great impasse between Serbs and Kosovars: "The white castle of Czar Lazar was but a dream in the night of the past. Around us in the daylight was the Albanian population, waiting, under arms, to defend the land that had been theirs since the beginning of time." In the new American-led imperium lies the promise of a multiethnic Kosovo and the lingering juridical claim that Kosovo is still part of Serbia. But physically and morally, the Serbs have lost their hold. The NATO air campaign launched in March 1999 -- 78 days, 34,000 sorties -- delivered an astonishing reversal of fortunes. A young priest in a Kosovo monastery, the Rev. Sava Janic, one of the few clergymen of the Serbian Orthodox Church to withstand the temptations of radical nationalism, tells Judah: "Kosovo has the same destiny as Asia Minor, once full of wonderful Christian sites and now all ruins and ash."
The Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, not known for a flair with words, did allow himself one rhetorical flourish as he began a campaign to drive out the Kosovars under cover of the NATO bombing: the Kosovars, he said, like the birds, were fleeing NATO bombs. This was one of the great moral riddles at the heart of the war in Kosovo. And it is a central moral issue raised by the intervention, which Michael Ignatieff takes up in "Virtual War: Kosovo and Beyond." A talented and versatile Canadian writer based in London, Ignatieff comes to the Balkans with the gift of a family inheritance. In the Balkans he can tease out the presence of an ancestor who speaks to the present. His great-grandfather, Count Nicholas Ignatieff, a confidant of Czar Alexander II of Russia and in the 1860's and 70's a powerful emissary to the Turkish sultan in Constantinople, was one of the instigators of the pan-Slavic spirit then at play in the Russian Orthodox Church and among Slavophiles at court and in the press.
Furthermore, as a boy Michael Ignatieff lived in Belgrade in 1958 and 1959, when his father, a Canadian diplomat, served there. Such are the meandering ways of modern exile. "The bombing of Belgrade was never an abstraction to me," he writes. He recalls life there during "Tito's heyday," and his family's big house in "the leafy hills of Dedinje, near Tito's official residence"; he remembers rooting for a local soccer club and speaking Serbo-Croatian, a language that "no longer officially exists."
Those shadows across Ignatieff's path give his book -- a series of previously published essays -- poignancy and engagement. He works a seam running across our world between landscapes of violence -- Rwanda, Burundi, Angola, Afghanistan, Kosovo, places given to blood feuds and boys with Kalashnikovs -- and nations celebrating the triumph of the market and the spread of the Internet. He straddles a moral fence of sorts as well. He can't give himself over to the morality of the new interventionists; he can't sanction the indifference of the realists. Back and forth he goes between these two sensibilities, and the tension can be felt in the book.
In doctrines of just war, you can't kill unless you are willing to die. The "virtual war" in Kosovo, a "set of split-second decisions made through the lens of a gun camera," runs up against those time-honored notions, Ignatieff writes. It was fought by air crews and technicians; NATO fought "in the hope and expectation that there would be no casualties at all." Those were the terms under which the American president stepped into Kosovo. Technological mastery did the trick; the NATO leaders waged a war without mobilizing their societies. "What was new about the Kosovo war, therefore, was the impunity with which it was waged. But if impunity is required before values are defended, what exactly are values worth?"
I take Ignatieff's point about the "virtuality" of the war and the discrepancy between NATO firepower and Serbian capabilities. But Ignatieff exaggerates the novelty of this. After reading him, I picked up "The Light That Failed." In that haunting semiautobiographical work of Kipling, colonial wars have their own "virtuality"; the discrepancy between the colonial armies with the Maxim guns and native armies with primitive weapons foreshadows that between NATO and Serbia. The 1890's was a time of imperial sunset and Kipling must have intuited that: Charles George Gordon (Chinese Gordon) had lost his life in the Sudan. An army bent on revenge went up the Nile under the command of Horatio Herbert Kitchener. At Omdurman in the fall of 1898, Kitchener engaged the Sudanese. It was long ago, but a turkey shoot all the same: 28 Britons died, and 10,000 Sudanese. Over the horizon could be felt the tremors of the Boer War, which was for the world then what these wars of conscience are to ours today. Kipling lamented the distance of it all, its remoteness from England: "With the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers, and they were almost as ignorant as their companions. But it was above all necessary that England at breakfast should be amused and thrilled and interested, whether Gordon lived or died, or half the British Army went to pieces in the sands."
When Milosevic called off his bid for Kosovo a year ago, he gave his countrymen an accounting of losses by Serbia's armed forces. If he is to be believed, the Yugoslav Army lost 462 men, the police force 114. Lovers strolled on the bridges of Belgrade, so precise was the NATO bombing and so restrained. In the annals of Serbian history chroniclers lament the misfortunes of Serbia in dark times. They ought to make an allowance for another history. They ought to tell of the small price paid by Serbia when outsiders came in, against the advice of the pollsters and realists and believers in the primacy of "geoeconomics," to prosecute a just war, pulled into Kosovo as they had earlier been into Bosnia by the shame of what they witnessed, by the image of themselves they had seen in that Balkan mirror.

HEADLINE: What's Still Wrong With Kids Today?

 ORDINARY RESURRECTIONS
 Children in the Years of Hope.
 By Jonathan Kozol.
 388 pp. New York:
 Crown Publishers. $25. 
 IN the mid-1960's, when Jonathan Kozol, an idealistic Harvard graduate, taught fourth grade in Boston's inner city, and emerged with a devastating tale of social neglect, he helped define an era. Like its title, the book, "Death at an Early Age," had the unadorned brilliance of a well-conceived slogan ("Give peace a chance"). Kozol was rightly seen as a young man of courage, a symbol of his generation.
Since that time and that book, much -- and not much -- has changed. School busing has come and largely gone, civil rights has turned into affirmative action, which has come under widespread attack. Roxbury and similar neighborhoods and the schools that serve them remain beacons of despair. Concern over continuing school segregation has waned. Now the talk is of uniforms, standards and high-stakes tests.
And while other activists of his day have shifted focus or sought different challenges, Kozol has spent the past few decades producing books, articles and lectures with the same lament, the same outrage. Most recently, in 1995, he wrote "Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children and the Conscience of a Nation," a depiction of Mott Haven in the South Bronx. Such works have seemed to some critics like yet more renditions of "The Times They Are a-Changin', "without the freshness and immediacy of the first version. In other words, Kozol, while a hero to some, was viewed by others as something of a pious, repetitive scold.
The title of his new book, "Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope," has the same evocation of faith as "Amazing Grace" and the same narrative focus, Mott Haven, an area whose concentrations of pediatric and maternal AIDS are among the nation's highest. And the book has some familiarly irritating qualities. It can be pious ("The life of a child, after all, is made up not of social 'constructs' or developmental 'trends,' but of much smaller things like stomachaches or hurtful words or red Crayola crayons") and mundane ("Even with caution, I think it is accurate to say that many of the older people in Mott Haven who have talked with me at length feel contradictory emotions -- and, at times, a roller coaster of emotions -- in regard to the conditions of their lives and prospects for their neighborhood").
Yet over all the book is affecting, in places deeply moving. This is the most personal of Kozol's efforts and the humblest. It preaches only rarely. Mostly, it observes the lives and explores the feelings of a group of black and Hispanic youngsters -- and a few adults -- he has gotten to know at a local after-school program in an Episcopal church and two nearby elementary schools.
Kozol has been visiting and watching these children since the early 1990's but, as he says, he had not before taken the time to get to know them as individuals. They were objects of inquiry, tools in a policy argument. As he started to age -- he is now 63 -- and watch his own parents approach death, he says he began to look at his life and work in a new light. The result is a book of small insights into the lives of inner-city schoolchildren.
This is a meaningful accomplishment. For all the scores of books on children and education published each year, most everything about learning is still remarkably mysterious. We are confused not only about how students translate squiggles on paper into systems of language and quantitative analysis but also why certain approaches work for some and not others and how to understand the nature of the link between education and economic success.
These questions are not answered in "Ordinary Resurrections," whose title is taken from the label an Episcopal priest once offered Kozol for "the commonplace and frequently unnoticed ways that people rise above their loneliness and fear." But in an unpretentious manner, the difficulties these youngsters face are made real: the fathers who are "upstate" (in prison), the drugs on the streets, the unconscionably overcrowded classrooms, the lack of art and music in the curriculum, the endless churn of uncertified teachers and new pupils whose families move from shelter to tenement. Sometimes Kozol tells a story with a simple number or two: of the 1,900 students enrolled each year at Morris High School, 1,200 are in ninth grade; about 65 make it through 12th grade.
Kozol takes us into the classrooms and homes of the South Bronx. He notes the syntax of the grandmothers ("I'm tryin' to sustain") and the language of the children ("I have the beauty of my mother and the braveness of my father"). A girl explains how she makes pancakes for her mother's boyfriend ("You pour it on the pan and then it's cooking on the pan and then you look at it until it gets a little brown and then you start to see the little bubbles"). Kozol says that in the past he would skip such digressions, but "now it seems to be the moments of digression I remember with most interest later on."
Living alone with his dog in Massachusetts, having no children of his own and with his parents ailing, Kozol began to look upon the Mott Haven community as a surprising source of human contact and comfort. He looks at the underserved youngsters and thinks of his own father, a Jew who grew up poor in South Boston and Roxbury but got into Harvard College and medical school and became a renowned expert on seizures.
What plagues Kozol, and what, in effect, plagues American education, is why the wonderful kids he comes to love in Mott Haven, kids named Elio and Pineapple and Katrice, can't walk in his father's footsteps. His father, he said, was "educated to inherit treasures" and then adds, "Why shouldn't Ariel and Pineapple inherit treasures too? My father's mother was ambitious for her sons. Their mothers are ambitious for their children. . . . What will actually happen to these children that we know?" Unlike Kozol's earlier books, "Ordinary Resurrections" does not imply that his eloquent outrage is itself an answer. Rather, with humility and grace, it helps us more thoughtfully ponder the question.

 THE OBITUARY WRITER
 By Porter Shreve.
 216 pp. Boston:
 Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Company. Paper, $12. 
 Unhappy Gordie Hatch! Twenty-two, just out of journalism school and exiled to the obituary desk of The St. Louis Independent. Entry level doesn't get much more entry. He sits under a lead-removal fan, pulls copy off the A.P. wires and takes calls from funeral directors and bereaved relatives who can't (or won't) get the deceased's age right. And when he tries to make the job a little more interesting by writing his own "advancers" -- premature obituaries of famous people -- his editor publicly humiliates him, in a way that only older men can do. "If I had wanted the obituary desk to have an advancer file," the editor barks, "I'd have asked for it a long time ago."
Meanwhile, reporters just a few years Gordie's senior have trampolined from local police beats to overseas bureaus and are now giddily tracking the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet juggernaut. (It's 1989, the annus mirabilis of foreign-news coverage.) And if that weren't competition enough, there's the ghost of Gordie's father, who, as Gordie's mother so tediously reminds him, was among the premier newshounds of his age, one of the "lodestones of history" who witnessed the Kennedy assassination and rode it into the journalistic firmament.
Porter Shreve's disarming first novel, "The Obituary Writer," is about what happens when a potentially career-making story lands in Gordie's bony lap -- in the person of Alicia Whiting, an attractive young widow who doesn't seem to be grieving quite the way she should. "You know what happens to widows who keep their husbands' clothing in the closet?" she asks. "They keep going back in there looking for memories. Movie stubs in blazer pockets. Little notes and lost dollar bills. I'm not going to be one of those widows."
It's all the same to Gordie, whose social life has been largely confined to eavesdropping on police radio dispatches. He can't get Alicia out of his brain; he can't forget her navy crepe dress, her black cloche. "She had an unexpected quality," he realizes, "an odd combination of formality and freedom, cardigans and chiming bangles, white flowers and ticky-tack, grand observations followed by self-mockery."
And she's got something else, too: a story. It's just a little hard to pin down. There's that little unpleasantness with her late husband's relatives. And there's an unpleasant love affair in Tucson with a painter of landscapes and nudes. And possibly some very unpleasant business with a suicidal science student in Fort Worth. Alicia, it seems, has changed herself to accommodate every man she's ever met . . . and then made each one disappear. She's the poster child for self-reinvention, and just as Gordie is struggling to get a handle on the current identity, she's busy forging a new one. She wants to be a reporter. Just like Gordie.
"The Obituary Writer" has the lean, propulsive structure of film noir, and on the surface it has all the archetypes, too: the intrepid young reporter, almost too dumb to live; the mysteriously deceased husband and his embittered spinster sister; and, of course, the black widow, draining men of their essence and swallowing them whole. What Shreve does so well, though, is to break down these archetypes, to reveal them as nothing more than the characters' self-aggrandizing constructs.
Resume padding is, in fact, the central activity of "The Obituary Writer." And no one does it more determinedly than Gordie, who, to impress Alicia, pretends to be a crack investigative reporter. And whenever Gordie's powers of invention fail, other characters rush to fill the void. His mother, for instance, finds out he missed a reunion date with his high school girlfriend and instantly embroiders an excuse for him: Gordie was hiding out in a warehouse, spying on a money-laundering city official. "I hated to lie, Gordie," his mother says. "But I had to tell her something."
Tell them something. That's the Scheherazade compulsion that drives the obituary writer -- and the fiction writer -- and pretty much everyone in this book (with the exception of Gordie's levelheaded old girlfriend, who is also the least interesting character). Shreve is not a colorful stylist -- though he is nicely economical -- and he has demanded perhaps a little too much credulity from his protagonist. But he has written an involving and sneakily touching story whose twists feel less like the conventions of a genre than the convolutions of a heart -- any heart. "The Obituary Writer" reminds us that we're all writing our own advancers, minute by minute.

HEADLINE: Remote Perches In Aragon

BYLINE: By ROBERT PACKARD; ROBERT PACKARD is a frequent visitor to Spain.

 BODY:
IT looked easy on the map. But three days after I set out for northeastern Spain to explore the Maestrazgo mountain range in Aragon, I found myself alongside a complete stranger with my rental car in reverse gear. He was helping to free me from an impenetrable construction roadblock.
This volunteer had the unmistakable redolence of a sheep farmer. His assistance wasn't entirely disinterested; he needed to hitch a ride to join his flock out of town. I had bypassed a convoluted detour on my way to a road (A1702) highlighting the crags and precipices of El Maestrazgo (mah-es-TRAHTH-go). The town in question was Calanda, birthplace of Luis Bunuel. This did not seem like an appropriate moment to discuss the film director's work. 
 To get to this mud-strewn stalemate I had taken a train to Aragon's capital, Zaragoza, and driven some 100 miles southeast to Alcaniz, where the parador, in the 18th-century part of the castle, became my base. I planned to visit some of the medieval villages of the Maestrazgo, reputedly impervious to time, enclosed by walls and crowned by castles. Equally seductive to me was their setting of mountains with the deep ravines, clefts and peaks unique to the region. I am neither courageous nor daring, but I have a perverse tendency to seek out roads that test my fear of heights.
There are three mountain ranges in Aragon: the Pyrenees on the French border, the Maestrazgo and the Montes Universales. On this bright, chilly morning, the Maestrazgo, the least frequented of the three, seemed elusive. The farmer did not share my embarrassment in chugging backward on Calanda's eviscerated main street.
Aragon has an impeccable cultural lineage: occupation by the Romans, the Visigoths, the Moors and finally the Spanish who brought it to a power and glory long since diminished. But for most of us, Aragon's heritage comes into focus with the marriage of its king, Ferdinand, to Isabella of Castile, thus uniting Spain. They finally defeated the Moors and financed the discovery of an America destined to bring great wealth to Iberia. Their daughter Katherine became the first of Henry VIII's six wives.
But Aragon has become a part of Spain that people pass through rather than visit for its own sake. Its capital, Zaragoza, is about halfway between two tourism magnets, Madrid and Barcelona, which typifies the problem. In fact, Aragon -- south from its Pyrenees ski country with its seven ski resorts, down through historic towns, mountain ranges, rivers and deserts -- offers an entirely rewarding destination.
Go right, the farmer said. "Now, stop. At last." That final "Por fin" carried layers of exasperation. It was already 10 a.m. by the time he left me for his sheep on the far side of Calanda. "You'll never make it," his farewell glance told me.
I was headed for two towns, Villarluengo and Cantavieja, and reaching them demanded a climb to elevations above gorges where gray-rock pinnacles resembled giant organ pipes. The two-lane paved road was narrow, twisting, roller-coaster undulating. In two hours' journey on this road I encountered perhaps three cars.
Far below, between the road and the rock pinnacles, along the basin of a deep gorge rushes the River Pitarque. The trout fishing here is said to be the best in Spain. On this scary road, unprotected by railings, drivers need someone beside them while dexterously avoiding a slide over the cliff. That passenger could describe the serried stone spires, some of them thin and serrated, that slice the horizon. Spectacular is an entirely justified term here. But hurried glances at peaks are the best the lone driver can do.
Around noon I arrived at the village of Villarluengo, at an elevation of about 4,000 feet in the Maestrazgos. A proud sign at the entrance of the village tells of its defensive 12th-century role in Spanish history. After that, Villarluengo seems to have rested on these militaristic laurels. Leaving my car at the walled entranceway, I trudged along narrow hilly streets empty of humankind. Silence prevailed. Not a person appeared. Here were the Middle Ages stripped clean of their population. Finally I came upon a woman standing motionless by an arched doorway. I wished her good day. She whispered a muted response. The cobblestone alleyways echoed my footsteps. I don't recall any village so vacant and silent. As in one of my childhood dreams, I felt as if I were the sole inhabitant of that world.
I passed a schoolyard. At that moment a door burst open and the entire student body of perhaps 30 youngsters, all ages and sizes, began running in file around the perimeter of the building, laughing and shouting. Their joyful response to being alive in this remote Aragonese village hinted at how much was hidden from a casual visitor's eyes.
I drove three miles back to have lunch at the Hostal de la Trucha (trout), the only habitation of any kind I had passed on the lengthy road to Villarluengo. This unpretentious hostal (once a paper factory) may rank among Spain's most remote getaways. No one will ever find you here. On its broad brick-surfaced terrace, where I rewarded myself with a beer and tapas before lunch, the only sound was that of a swiftly moving stream leading through pines to a series of fish hatcheries. Immediately to the left rose one of the Maestrazgo's stark stone-ridged cliffs, while in front of me tall conifers traced the bank of the stream. To my right were a small swimming pool and a tennis court. The November sun, surprisingly intense, beat down. I closed my eyes.
Like almost every traveler, I recognize that moment in a journey enfolding and persuading you that here, away from the stress of the world, lies the answer to an unexamined quest. Even as you savor the idea, you know it is impractical and irrational. You may avoid stress by fishing at the Hostal de la Trucha, but your serenity will be hermitic.
BEYOND Villarluengo on Route A1702, I passed La Canada de Benatanduz, overlooking a fearsome treeless gorge, before arriving at Cantavieja. I saw more residents here than at Villarluengo and I was especially taken with the unpaved Plaza Mayor, kept that way should bullfights be scheduled. The town buildings are mostly whitewashed, offering a harmonious blend of arches and wrought-iron balconies.
"Are you an American?" a young boy asked me, gazing at my baseball cap. I offered it to him. What I needed on this journey to the Maestrazgo was not shade for the eyes but telescopic lenses. I had planned to continue on this demanding road, barely discernible on the map, but I knew that at nightfall the route would become pointlessly hazardous.
I returned to my base in Alcaniz, a town as old as Aragon itself. Encircled by the Guadalope River and the city walls, the town's defensive hill visible from all approaches is surmounted by a castle-convent dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, now the Parador La Concordia. Originally built by the Calatrava knights, the castle's uninviting reconstructed 18th-century facade belies its handsome interior. I stayed in one of the 12 rooms with commanding views. My room had appropriately austere but comfortable furnishings and a capacious modern bath. On one side of the baronial dining room, cutlery and crystal gleamed on a refectory table laid with 50 place settings. Alcaniz is lively and crowded, its handsome streets lined with Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque buildings.
The next day I traveled southwest, deftly maneuvering this time around the Calanda roadblock, to the town of Albarracin in the Universales mountains of Teruel province, somewhat to the east of the Maestrazgo proper. Once an independent Moorish kingdom, the town has crenelated Moorish walls that rise 36 feet to protect an architecturally eccentric interior, already enclosed on three sides by a river. Walking through the narrowest streets imaginable, you sense that the roofs are leaning toward one another to form a covered passageway. Albarracin, one of Aragon's gems and a national monument, is all angles: streets, steps, buildings, walls. Rose-colored houses are dressed with red-tiled roofs, iron grilles on their windows, fretted woodwork on their balconies. The steep cobbled alleyways have an undeniable Arabic flavor, subtly enhanced by Renaissance artistry.
Close by, the quiet and unassuming provincial capital town of Teruel hides a tormented past. Near the five Mudejar towers built by Moors under Christian rule after the Reconquest are the tombs of the 13th-century Lovers of Teruel, Spain's star-crossed version of Romeo and Juliet, as well as their mummified remains. But what haunts the town is the memory of the the slaughter of over 1,000 young men in the winter of 1937 after the Nationalists overcame their dogged resistance during the Spanish Civil War. A visit to the cemetery about three miles out of town is searingly painful.
My final day in the Maestrazgo took me through lush mountainous country as I drove from Alcaniz to Morella. Traversing dark green foothills thick with pines and spruce, the N232 had undergone extensive highway work, an unexpected bonus.
As I drove up to the walled town of Morella, over 3,200 feet above sea level (the Mediterranean was only about 40 miles to the east), a fierce wind crackled the rampart's banners. A gigantic rock topped by a crumbling castle looms over the town, of Roman and Arabic heritage. Morella has four entrance gates proudly arched in its high walls. Instinctively, I chose the wrong one in my search for Hotel Cardenal Ram.
You must enter the right gate, leave your car and walk the steep, narrow, cobblestone streets, often no more than passageways. My hotel was a 16th-century Castilian town house with creaky uncarpeted floors. In the chairless small room, a stone window alcove overlooked an alley. But it was cozy and heated, with a small bathroom and TV.
I had a 3 p.m. Sunday dinner in the nearby Meson del Pastor, filled with families. I was the only person dining alone, and assuredly the only non-Spaniard. I began with dry sherry and a bowl of sopa de bunuelos Morellense, a steaming vegetable soup with delectable small floating pastry shells, a salad, and a large pitcher of the local tinto, a red wine that persuaded me to order the rabo de buey (oxtail) -- an unlikely dish for a diner as gastronomically timid as I. The dining room was noisy with conversation and laughter and at one point a fellow diner asking for the salt called me caballero, a form of address unique to my experience.
Since the freezing wind had become particularly fierce, I abandoned my plan to climb up to the castle and instead explored the twisting, escalating streets offering window shopping for everything from hand-knitted sweaters to countless varieties of honey with stacked spoons to sample them. I remember Morella fondly even though as I was leaving the next morning I found that a prankster had jammed the lock of my car door with chewing gum.
Driving back to Zaragoza by way of Alcaniz to catch the train to Madrid, I briefly visited Calaceite, a handsome town of stone houses with heraldic shields and a porticoed Plaza Mayor. I was distracted by the air, dusty and sand-laden, dimming the cloudless sky. Later, on the open highway in the Monegros desert area, a fierce windstorm blew tumbleweed across the highway. The storm and the surrounding arid terrain recalled vintage dust-bowl scenes in the American West.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 6-11-00: On Language;
Bundling

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
The great American counterspook, Paul Redmond, left a word-news tip in the dead drop that is my answering machine: "Check out bundling."
Old-timers remember that word fondly from their spooning days. "Bundling was originally courting in bed," noted an 1874 British slang dictionary, "the lovers being tied or bundled up to prevent undue familiarities. The practice still obtains in Wales." 
 This 1781 term for an early form of what is now called "safe sex," apparently pioneered by the prudent Welsh, was derived from the Old English bindan, "to bind together," and was later applied to "men and women sleeping together, where the divisions of the house will not permit of better or more decent accommodation, with all their clothes on."
Fast-forward to the Arizona Legislature in 1956, which prohibited "bundling or combining various limited benefit insurance policies." The pejorative connotation grew when the Justice Department in 1975 accused I.B.M. of charging anticompetitive prices for bundling hardware and software services. The European Community repeated the complaint in 1981, when John Tagliabue defined the word in The New York Times: "the practice of what is called bundling -- selling the elements of a computer system as a package to prevent competitors from supplying them at perhaps better conditions."
Today the term obtains, to use the archaic verb, in the Microsoft case, as a federal judge ruled that the company illegally bundled its Web browser with its Windows software. In my legal-etymological interpretation, the company is appealing on the grounds that separate divisions wrapped up in bed together, fully clothed, are not making love.
Thus do old terms find new uses in the brave new wide Web world. The trade name SPAM, for example -- which was created in 1937 by Hormel Foods out of the first and last letters of "spiced ham" -- has, when uncapitalized, come to mean "junk e-mail," with a second sense of "the random posting of advertisements on computer bulletin boards."
A fanciful speculation about the metaphoric reason for the adoption of spamming by the computer world can be found in the excellent Newton's Telecom Dictionary, 16th edition: "the term is derived from a brand of pink, canned meat that splatters messily when hurled." (A spokesman for Hormel vociferously denies this, and tests run at the Safire Semantic Kitchens confirm that uncanned SPAM, when hurled against a wall at a normal speed, bounces rather than splatters.)
Cache, pronounced "cash," from the French verb cacher, "to hide," came to mean "a hiding place for valuables"; it was especially applied to holes dug to conceal provisions and ammunition. (One reason given by the Pentagon for the U.S. incursion into Cambodia in 1969 was to capture buried arms, causing the Nixon aide Len Garment to ask, "Can you check a cache?")
In usage by the new lingo, information is cached by placing it closer to the user to make it more accessible, which also places less strain on limited computer and network resources. The meaning has changed from the sinister "hiding place" to a more positive "nearby holding place."
A cookie originated as a small Dutch cake and became the term for a baked morsel to be passed around after the canapes have been devoured. The metaphoric origin of cookie in computerese is obscure (send speculation to onlanguage@nytimes.com), but its meaning is "a text file placed on a computer's hard disk by an Internet server to track the client's habits and tastes." Marketers say it provides convenience and unexpected choices to clients; privacy guardians warn that a cookie can follow a customer's movements around the Web to create an invasive profile.
A cookie-pusher was a term coined in World War II to be a derogation of diplomats who attended too many receptions; now it is an exponent of "targeted marketing."
Attendant began as "one who waits upon or accompanies," as in Milton's "Lest sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant, Death." After adoption by airlines of "flight attendant" when stewardess was taken as sexist, the word was snapped up by technologists and now has two meanings. The first is "an inexpensive computer that leans heavily on its connection to more sophisticated computers."
The second meaning bothers me. "An attendant is an operator of a phone system console," lexicographer Harry Newton tells me. "Typically, it's the first person in a company to answer an incoming call. That person attends the phone system; when the company's phone is answered by a machine, that's an automated attendant."
What's the matter with operator? My mother was a telephone operator and proud of it. An operator suggests an active, purposeful, hands-on person engaging with a device or system; an attendant is more passive, sometimes just hanging around "in waiting." The machine, or system, that is operated is secondary to the human in charge, but the phone system that is merely attended is the master.
Hello, Central?
 
Of Wimps and Mush
In an aside (watch out for those asides) in an article last month, I recalled a 1980 headline over an editorial in The Boston Globe that read "Mush From the Wimp," which I presumed a prankster substituted for the cliche "All Must Share the Burden." I am now informed by David Greenway, who retired last month as editor of The Globe's editorial page, that it was not sabotage but a self-inflicted wound.
"It was the late Kirk Scharfenberg, editorial writer and later editor of the page," writes Greenway, "who wrote 'Mush From the Wimp' over his editorial on President Carter's economic plan. He wrote it as a joke, never thinking that the headline would ever see print.
"As you know, the copy editors write the headlines," continues my colleague Greenway, "but in this case the copy editors let it through. The night editor caught it in midrun, and the headline was hastily changed to the cliched 'All Must Share the Burden' as a last-minute sub for the rest of the run."
Many years later, when Greenway became editor of The Globe's editorial page, the paper criticized animal rights advocates who wanted to close down dog-sled racing in Alaska. The headline chosen for its historic resonance: "More Wimps for the Mush."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 6-11-00: Counter Culture;
Dot-communist Manifesto

BYLINE: By Andrew Sullivan 

 BODY:
A sharp, unexpected twang of conscience hit me the other day. It occurred as I was merrily downloading the umpteenth Pet Shop Boys B side from another Napster user's hard drive. Was this theft? Nobody, I rationalized, was going to be without the Extended Rollo Mix of "New York City Boy" because of my actions. All Napster is, after all, is a huge database of MP3 files, a musical commune dreamed up by a college-freshman geek. And sharing a database isn't theft. If you agree to join the Napster "community," you agree to share every MP3 you have with any other Napsterite who is online at the same time you are. It's worth the tiny loss of privacy, because what you get in return is access to more free music than anyone could listen to in a lifetime.
So whom was I hurting by copying one lousy song? Sure, I'd avoided paying a record company a royalty -- but it was rich enough already. Likewise the Pet Shop Boys. And it wasn't as if I'd smuggled a disc out of Tower Records in a knapsack. It wasn't even in any meaningful sense "mine," since other Napster users could now download it from me without my even noticing. Neither had it been in any meaningful sense "theirs" -- once they agreed to pool their own MP3 collection with those of other Napsterites. 
 What exactly was going on here? The only workable definition is communism. What Marx had hoped would occur because of a new dawn in human economic relations has been made possible instead by a new form of human technology. Once we enter the Web, we become like medieval peasants entering their village commons; almost everything is shared. The only difference is that, unlike the Middle Ages, our modern ability to duplicate everything instantly means that property isn't even "shared." It's possessed simultaneously by everyone. By turning physical property into endlessly duplicable e-property, the ancient human problem of "mine-thine" has been essentially solved. There was once the parable of the loaves and the fishes; there is now the parable of copy and paste. For the first time since Plato first dreamed of it in "The Republic," communism is actually feasible. And for the first time since Marx christened it, it makes sense.
By this I don't mean that the real world has changed. We live at a time when the market is the closest thing we have to a civic religion. Money has rarely been as important in determining prospects in life, and economic inequalities are mounting. But the online world is different. Admittedly, even dreamy start-ups like Napster hope to make millions one day -- and the Web promises to be an unparalleled way to buy, sell and market products. But alongside this growth of e-capitalism, and inextricable from it, is the tenaciously communistic nature of the Web itself. What the Web is best at, after all, is transmitting information -- and what the fledgling years of the Internet have proved is that, in this context, free information has an edge over its pricey competition. Apart from pornography sites and a few business sites, the Web is still largely free to anyone with a modem and a phone line. Many information sites that once charged subscribers (Slate.com comes to mind) have subsequently capitulated to dot-communism. Moreover, virtually any site's content can be copied and pasted by subscribers and sent immediately to nonsubscribers in ways that destroy the tollbooth almost as soon as it is constructed. Private property in this world is about as fashionable as public property outside it.
This is surely good news. Left-leaning intellectuals have long worried about the way in which our public space -- shopping malls, urban parks -- have become increasingly private. Other liberals have emphasized the dangers to civic life of pervasive economic inequality. But the Web has provided small answers to both of these conundrums. As our public life has shrunk in reality, it has expanded exponentially online. Acting as a critical counterweight to market culture, the Web has made interactions between random, equal citizens far more possible than ever before. In the virtual city that the Web is quickly becoming, you can walk unimpeded into hundreds of thousands of apartments and play any music or read any book you find there. You can pick up almost any publication at the sidewalk newsstand and read it free. You can chat with the best gossip in town and hear the dish as soon as anyone else. There are very few cops, no taxes and, except for a tiny handful of exclusive salons, no keys, locks, tolls or security guards. This is what Marx dreamed of. It is what Plato fantasized about. It's what Thomas More dreamily satirized in "Utopia" -- or "nowhere land." Except that E-topia is both nowhere and everywhere at the same time.
Recall Marx's essential gripe about capitalism. It was that by converting everything into money, the market alienated human beings from one another and themselves. Rather than relating directly to one another, we related to money. Rather than doing something meaningful with our lives, we became specialized units of economic production, valued not for what we were but for what we produced and consumed. Part of the dream of communist consciousness was that by abolishing this system, by liberating human beings from the tyranny of being instruments of wealth creation, we would become more fully human. We would finally be ends, not means. We could farm, write poetry, fall in love, make music and listen to Santana -- all in the same day! We would be authentic again, valued not for our monetary worth but for our human capacities, which we would share freely and spontaneously with anyone else.
Of course, we know now what the consequences are of actually trying to turn this utopia into reality. Unlike easily copied software, physical property tends to be missed when it's pilfered or shared. So the only way of ensuring that human beings commune with one another with sufficient enthusiasm is to create a government big enough and terrifying enough to compel them. Millions of murders later, Marxism has rightly been junked. But this is where the Web comes in. Having dissolved property into thin air, the Web has no need of a police force, and by preying on curiosity and mischief, it harnesses human nature rather than fighting it. Unlike communism, dot-communism is enforced through the impulsive decisions of millions of users. Try charging and you'll wait a long time for traffic; give it away free and they'll come running.
The Web does something else only dreamed of by Marx. It goes further than any previous innovation in alleviating the problem identified by Marx as "bourgeois alienation." For many, market democracy still means that people are being valued for their capacity to generate wealth, not their intrinsic human dignity. For many more, it means jobs they long to leave on Friday afternoon for brief glimpses of pleasure on the weekend. For more still, class and money are never left behind. Wherever they go, their clothes, accent and credit rating subtly keep them in their place.
But on the Internet, a simple screen name will get you almost anywhere free. Suddenly, motives other than the profit motive begin to come into play. People give you music because they actually want you to hear and enjoy it. People set up their own Web sites because they actually want to communicate with others. Chain e-mails pass along jokes for the sheer hell of it. Favorite columns get traded around -- and databases are linked together -- purely for mutual enlightenment or mutual mischief. By abolishing mine-thine, the Web also helps abolish the alienating, propertied distance between one person and another.
Apart from churches -- and even they take donations -- the Web is one of the few truly powerful private organizations that does not have money at its core. Again, consider Napster. It sells nothing. It asks nothing but a few personal particulars from its subscribers. You make up a name to join. It's just a means for people to communicate, share, copy. Napster is the favorite of college students everywhere because, like them, it's still dreaming. Eighteen-year-olds may be the last people on earth to still believe in communism, but unlike every previous generation of dreamers, these kids have figured out the technology to make it possible. So what if there's no money in it? That's the point! Indeed, if Napster ever starts charging subscription fees, some teenager will surely invent a rival method for distributing free music.
Sure, more and more Web sites want you to shop, not dream, but as their profit margins increasingly show, this is not what the technology is most comfortable doing. As more and more experiences -- musical, literary, erotic -- get translated into downloadable, postphysical entities, what scant profits there are now will dwindle away. This won't be as tragic as it sounds. Eventually, musicians will remember that the real reason they started their careers was to express themselves and communicate, rather than actually do it all to make money. And since money will no longer be required to access other artists' music, they will be less desperate to get rich. Dot-communism will help artists get back in touch with their authentic aspirations. Take that, Metallica!
The only drawback, of course, is that many of us quite like our bourgeois individualism. I am somewhat fond of the fact that I will actually get paid for writing this column, rather than sharing it free. So you can see the ideological battle ahead: greed on one side will face a feasible high-tech commune on the other. Big corporations will take on plucky teenagers. But given the track record so far, the teenagers and the commies may well win. Indeed, they already have. Take journalism. I can see the attraction of dot-communism in my own profession -- you could call it Hackster -- but I'm not sure I want to sign up. But then the more I think about it, the more I realize I already have. Almost every newspaper now gives away online what it used to charge for on paper. The proliferation of links, cybergossip and cyberhype means that articles online soon lose their point of origin, and, like orphaned MP3 files, Love Bug viruses and Al Gore jokes, move around the world with lightning speed. Eventually, even journalists may get used to the Marxist idea of writing for more than a bourgeois readership -- and writing for more than a check. Before too long, we may find ourselves setting up a Web site, penning bons mots each day and giving them all away for free! Come to think of it, AndrewSullivan.com will be up and running by Labor Day. I'm serious.
A specter, to put it bluntly, is haunting America: the specter of dot-communism. Of course, the deep problems that Marx identified -- the problems of alienation and inequality -- are not solved by dot-communism, but they are certainly salved by it, and in ways we are only beginning to appreciate. No revolution is required; and the bourgeoisie doesn't even have to be liquidated. In fact, capitalism made the whole thing possible, just as Marx suspected it would. And what, after all, could be more enticing at the dawn of the new century than a high-tech world solving a very low-tech human problem? So let the capitalist classes and the Recording Industry Association of America tremble. The dot-communists have nothing to lose but their chains. And they have a Web to win.

HEADLINE: FILM;
In Search of a Way to Put Proust's World on Film

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI; Leslie Camhi, a writer based in New York, writes about film, art and books.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
IN his 3,000-page monument to lost time, Marcel Proust barely mentions the cinema. Writing in the decades immediately following film's invention, he appears to have been largely uninterested by the medium in which so many memories of the 20th century would be stored.
"I think he saw very few films," said Jean-Yves Tadie, a professor at the Sorbonne, over tea recently at his home here in a graceful fin-de-siecle apartment building. The English translation of Mr. Tadie's biography, "Marcel Proust: A Life," will be released by Viking in August. "Perhaps a few newsreels, or some light Gaumont comedies. He went out very little toward the end of his life, fearing attacks of asthma. He died before Abel Gance's 'Napoleon,' and probably never knew the films of Chaplin. And so he must not have understood that film was an art." 
 Still, in "Remembrance of Things Past," the narrator's memories of childhood in the village of Combray -- with its black-steepled church and all its inhabitants -- which unfold like a Chinese paper flower from the fragrant cup of tea in which he's dunked a madeleine, seem an apt metaphor for film's remarkable power to revive the past and make the dead live again.
"Film is a very Proustian medium," said Raul Ruiz, the director of "Time Regained," during an interview after the film's premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival last year. This remarkable adaptation of the final volume of "Remembrance of Things Past" opens in New York on Friday. "At any given moment, you can be kidnapped by the past."
But "Remembrance of Things Past" does not lend itself easily to film adaptation. Filmmakers must cope with the novel's extraordinary length, and its strangely porous nature.
"In most novels, you have action, dialogue and commentary," Mr. Tadie said. "But in Proust, the commentary takes up so much space. A few lines of dialogue are followed by five pages of the narrator's observations. And if you reduce things to action, there just isn't much of it. He's no Sir Walter Scott."
Then there is the question of finding a cinematic equivalent for those interminable sentences, which seem to explore every shading of erotic ambivalence or gilt Sevres porcelain, and in which one can almost hear the asthmatic author gasping for breath.
And finally, there is the problem common to all literary adaptations, but extreme in Proust's case, of reconciling cinematic time with the experience of reading. Film's gratifications are relatively speedy and immediate, while Proust's novel preaches the infinite pleasures of deferral. Months or even years may separate the reading of the first volume from the seventh and last. How can all those intimate, solitary hours of enchantment be translated into a marketable 120 minutes on screen ?
Mr. Ruiz explained his working method. "For a long while, Einstein thought that, if time were a dimension, it should be visible," he said. "In making this film, I wondered how I might play with that idea. I approached it in the most naive manner possible." Using flashbacks, repetitions and visual refrains, he created a film as intricately structured as a symphony, where each part refers back to another in an infinite play of mirrors. He cast a mother and daughter (Catherine Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni) as Odette and Albertine, figures who are unrelated in the novel but whose roles as loved women echo each other across generations. Within the continuous flow of his film's two-and-one-half hours, time seems to expand exponentially.
EARLY on in Proust's novel, the narrator describes the long afternoons he spent in his room at Combray, amusing himself with a magic lantern, a pre-cinematic device something like a slide projector, whose glass negatives could be changed to create the illusion of motion. The luminous images swallowed whole the forms of the doorknobs and curtains onto which they were projected, and took on extraordinary life for him. So every director who has adapted Proust's work for film finds his own vision of cinema reflected in that impossible project.
Late in life, Luchino Visconti, the poet of smoldering, suppressed passion among Italian aristocracy, planned a screen version of Proust's middle volume, "Sodom and Gommorah," but the work was never realized. Near the end of his career, Joseph Losey commissioned a screenplay called "Proust Scenario," based on the novel and written by the playwright Harold Pinter, but no film emerged from it.
Percy Adlon's "Celeste" (1981) was inspired by the memoirs of Celeste Albaret, who worked as Proust's maid during the last eight years of the author's life. Proust, a notoriously big tipper in restaurants, was also known for his extravagant kindness toward servants. Mr. Adlon's film, a strange combination of reticence and caricature, follows a woman living in the antechamber of greatness, rising at 3 p.m. each day to bring Monsieur his "morning" coffee, and remaining on call for most of the night -- a portrait of the intimate bond between the invalid artist and his servant.
Still, one had to wait until 1984 before a filmmaker tackled the novel directly. For "Swann in Love," Volker Schlondorff cast Jeremy Irons as the cultivated Jewish art collector Charles Swann and a remarkably fluffy Ornella Muti as Odette, the courtesan he eventually marries. There's lots of lingerie, with heavy emphasis on a pulchritudinous orchid tucked into Odette's swelling breast. But by eliminating the crucial position of narrator, Mr. Schlondorff sacrificed the novel's philosophical dimension, which transforms Proust's account of aristocratic decadence and erotic despair into a highly evolved work of art.
Last month, Chantal Akerman's "Captive" had its premiere in the Director's Fortnight at Cannes. Ms. Akerman's Proust draws upon passages from "La Prisonniere," the novel's darkly minimalist fifth volume, which describe the relation between the narrator and his lover, Albertine -- a complex and ever-changing equation whose key elements are jealousy, domination, sequestration and flight. To render this bond, Ms. Akerman returned to the claustrophobic style of "Jeanne Dielmann, 23 Quai de Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles," the monumental film she made in 1975 when she was just 24 years old, about three days in the life of a Belgian housewife, mother and prostitute.
"For 'La Captive,' I worked a lot in interior spaces," Ms. Akerman said in a cafe on the Place des Vosges. "The town houses, the cars. Through them, the viewer is projected into a mental universe. At the same time, you escape all psychological explanation. You're just caught in a machine that moves forward." Ms. Akerman's signature style is the long traveling shot. In "La Captive," it tracks the movements through Paris of a young woman in a floral print dress, and evokes the narrator's libidinal fixations.
Proust's iconic stature in French culture may explain why to date there have been no French film interpretations. Mr. Adlon and Mr. Schlondorff are German; Ms. Akerman is Belgian, though she has lived in France for decades.
OVER the course of some 60 films, Mr. Ruiz (a Chilean who moved to Paris in the 1970's) has cultivated a surrealist sensibility far removed from the conventions of period drama and the salons of the Belle Epoque. But "Time Regained" is a summation of themes that have preoccupied him throughout his career, from the theoretical rigors of "Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting" (1978) to more recent thrillers like "Genealogies of a Crime" (1996): a fascination with doubles and the uncanny, memory and childhood, the visual arts and philosophy.
His Proust is imbued with a narrative self-consciousness that owes much to the author Jorge Luis Borges. But Mr. Ruiz also is able to train an almost ethnographic eye on Parisian habits and manners. Among his reference points for "Time Regained" were Edward Curtis's sepia-toned, early-20th-century portraits of Native Americans, in which grandeur combines with the threat of extinction.
"I wanted to explore what it's like to be a member of a tribe," he explained. "These French aristocrats, with their boredom and their rituals. I tried to describe the behavior of that tiny part of society."
"Time Regained" opens in 1922 as Proust (played by Marcello Mazzarella, an Italian actor who bears a striking resemblance to the writer) lies on his deathbed, attended by the faithful Celeste. He regards a series of photographs of figures in his life through a magnifying glass.
Subtly, the furniture in his room starts moving, and we are carried back in time to Parisian soirees during World War I, where, far from the front lines where men were dying, the upper classes drank Champagne and listened to Beethoven. The infidelities of Robert de Saint-Loup (Pascal Greggory), who betrays his wife Gilberte (Emmanuelle Beart) with both the actress Rachel (Elsa Zylberstein) and the arriviste violinist Morel (Vincent Perez); the ghosts of the narrator's childhood love for Gilberte and his adult passion for Albertine; the social ambitions and artistic pretensions of Mme. Verdurin (Marie-France Pisier); the lingering vanity of Odette; the strange sexual proclivities of the Baron de Charlus (John Malkovich); and the stench of death which hangs equally over soldiers on leave from the trenches and le tout Paris arrayed for an elegant matinee concert; all these memories swarm around the narrator. The effect is like a piece of music, a gradual building of a sense of loss and time's passing, combined with a fanatical devotion to detail and a gently ironic regard for human frailty.
Mr. Ruiz reflected upon the author's perennial fascination. "There are Proustians who have nothing to do with the world of Proust," Mr. Ruiz said. "Myself, for example. But also, Taiwanese dentists, African economists, rock stars, and others. One of the characters in Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road,' either Sal Paradise or Dean Moriarty, is continually reading Proust while he's working in a parking lot. You can apply a Proustian vision to almost any context. My explanation is that Proust teaches you a way to look at your own life, and that the life of any human being is incredibly rich."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
A Sudden, Facile Flowering of American Song

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
FOR 20 years or so, the composer Ned Rorem went around grimly asserting that the art song was languishing, especially the American art song. As he saw it, American singers of recent decades, lured by the potential for fame and fortune in opera, were giving only token attention to song. Nor were current singers cultivating relationships with living composers of songs, as did many important American artists of earlier generations.
Mr. Rorem is famous for his "everything is going to hell" pronouncements, but this one was hard to discount. Although he won a Pulitzer Prize for an orchestral work, Mr. Rorem is arguably America's foremost composer of songs. His catalog includes more than 500 songs, and at 76, he does not seem close to stopping. 
 But last month at the 92nd Street Y on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Rorem admitted that he had been quite wrong. While he was predicting the demise of the American art song, he said, a whole generation of song composers emerged right under his nose. Important singers had been commissioning songs and performing them prominently for appreciative audiences.
Indeed, the concert at which Mr. Rorem made these comments presented the premieres of song cycles by three noted members of the new generation, Ricky Ian Gordon, Daron Hagen and John Musto, and concluded with a performance of Mr. Rorem's 1969 song cycle "War Scenes" by the baritone Kurt Ollmann and the composer at the piano. Moreover, this was just one of an unlinked series of recent song recitals in New York, by Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, Sanford Sylvan and Barbara Bonney. Taken together, along with an Alice Tully Hall concert devoted to songs of the San Francisco-based composer Jake Heggie, they offered a de facto citywide festival of new American songs.
They also provided a chance to assess the character and quality of American songs today. And here the news was more problematic. Among the current generation are talented composers with real understanding of how to write for the voice and with interesting tastes in texts. Almost all are pianists who can ably accompany singers performing their works.
But in courting singers and audiences, many of these same composers employ a warmed-over neo-Romantic musical language and borrow heavily from pop and musical theater genres in an attempt to give their works an appealing American hipness. The resulting songs can seem dated on arrival. Few of the composers have truly distinctive, confident compositional voices. Many of the songs are pleasing to hear but terribly slight.
What is going on? Why should a group of essentially conservative song composers suddenly be in such demand by audiences and singers?
Perhaps the pendulum swing that has long been noted in other areas of classical music is finally affecting the art song. A backlash has set in after a long period during which composers who wrote in atonal, hard-edged contemporary styles alienated many singers and song fanciers. And song buffs, though generally the most literate of listeners, have seldom been musically adventurous sorts. Because of the nature of the singing voice, and because the whole point of a song is to support and transmit words through music, a certain degree of directness and accessibility has always been valued in the genre. Early in the 20th century, American composers responded in kind to the most radical trends of European modernism in their instrumental works but not, typically, in their songs.
The first great flourishing of American art songs came in the years between the wars, when Aaron Copland was trying to rally a generation of fellow composers to the task of creating a contemporary style that would somehow be recognizably American. Countless fine songs were written by composers like Paul Bowles, Ernst Bacon, Virgil Thomson, Quincy Porter, Samuel Barber and David Diamond as well as by Theodore Chanler, who is sadly neglected today, and the remarkable Israel Citkowitz, who is virtually forgotten.
The current song composers clearly see themselves as successors in this tradition. The problem is that their predecessors set a standard for originality and elegance that is seldom met today.
Mr. Gordon, for example, has won popularity with audiences and the loyalty of important singers for his many songs that blend breezy, voice-friendly melodies with milky, pop-tinged harmonies. But his work could be seen as an object lesson in the dangers of crossover: music that tries to bridge popular and concert styles. Perhaps his best-known song, one of Ms. Fleming's favorite encore pieces, is a setting of "Will There Really Be a Morning?" by Emily Dickinson. Mr. Gordon's lushly lyrical tune, in which every foursquare phrase ends with a prolonged high note (ideal for Ms. Fleming's sumptuous upper range), and the pop-ballad-like accompaniment combine to make Dickinson's acute, unflinching poetic reflections seem like sentimental pop lyrics.
IN a revealing interview in Opera News recently, Mr. Gordon described how he typically composes a song. Often, he said, "it's like I become emotionally ready to write it, and it explodes out of me." In terms of "any kind of intellectual process," he added, "that's just not me." He is not a composer who plans "the architecture of a piece," he said, "like John Corigliano."
So John Corigliano, who is not exactly Elliott Carter, is Mr. Gordon's idea of an intellectual, architectural composer? Songs apparently do explode out of Mr. Gordon. When Ms. Fleming was planning the recital she gave in February, devoted to settings of Dickinson poems, she asked Mr. Gordon to send her something. Before she knew it, she said at the time, she received an entire cycle of new Dickinson settings in the mail. In the second of Ms. Fleming's New York recitals, she performed another new work by Mr. Gordon, a setting of a monologue from Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," which indicated he could write music with some punch to it. But he should probably slow down and compose less. Often, his piano parts are not appreciably more interesting than, say, the improvised playing of a tasteful, jazz-trained cocktail pianist.
It's fashionable today to applaud creative artists who blur categories and blend elements of popular and serious traditions. But there is no inherent value in doing so, and there are a lot of pitfalls, as a telltale moment in Ms. Fleming's second recital made clear.
To end the program, the composer Andre Previn accompanied her in the premiere of "The Giraffes Go to Hamburg," his setting for voice, flute and piano of an excerpt from a memoir of Isak Dinesen. Mr. Previn turned the text into a compelling musical monologue. The work's harmonic language was effective if not particularly striking.
Then, for encores, Mr. Previn switched into his jazz pianist mode and improvised accompaniments to songs by Ellington, Arlen and Van Heusen, which Ms. Fleming, who used to sing with jazz combos in college, performed winningly. Mr. Previn's playing showed incomparable taste and imagination. The precision and pungency of the harmony revealed a keen ear at play.
So what happens to that keen ear when Mr. Previn composes his "serious" vocal works? Surely, the elegance of his jazz playing comes from his knowing the style intimately. Paradoxically, by working within a tradition, Mr. Previn "composes" more boldly.
AS a critic, one wants to support the composers who have embraced the art song genre anew. Mr. Musto, Mr. Hagen and Mr. Heggie are serious and gifted musicians clearly enthralled with the singing voice and engaged by the practice of setting words to music. Mr. Heggie works especially hard to tailor his songs to the specific qualities of the artists who sing them. This diligence has won him powerful supporters, many of whom he first met while working in the press office at the San Francisco Opera.
"The Faces of Love" is the rather saccharine title of an RCA Red Seal recording of Mr. Heggie's songs, steeped in Ravel and Barber, performed by such vocal luminaries as Ms. Fleming, Sylvia McNair, Jennifer Larmore and, his greatest admirer, Frederica von Stade. "Jake Heggie is my Mozart," Ms. von Stade gushes in a quotation that Mr. Heggie's publicists have widely circulated. Mr. Heggie and his backers understand that star performers, not composers, hold the power in the classical-music industry. On the covers of the three published volumes of his "Faces of Love" songs, the names of the singers, "as heard on the RCA Red Seal CD," are listed in print the same size as Mr. Heggie's.
Yet for all the pleasure Mr. Musto, Mr. Hagen and Mr. Heggie have given singers and audiences, there is an eerie similarity to their work: each writes in some variation of a pungently chromatic, sometimes modal, neo-Romantic harmonic idiom, with varying echoes of pop songs, or outbursts of chunky cluster chords, or even brief fragments of tone rows, depending on how intense the particular song is supposed to be. The significant differences in their work come down to their choices of texts and the degrees to which their vocal lines showcase the specific voices of intended interpreters.
For comparison, song enthusiasts should check out a New World Records disc, "But Yesterday Is Not Today: The American Art Song, 1927-72," first released in 1977, which includes insightful liner notes by Mr. Rorem. On it, the great baritone Donald Gramm sings songs by Chanler, Bowles and John Duke, and the soprano Bethany Beardslee sings songs by Copland, Sessions, Chanler, Barber, Citkowitz and, finally, Robert Helps, who is also her pianist here. The music is stunning in its variety and excellence.
Though Chanler, who died at 59 in 1961, sometimes showed questionable taste in texts, he was a master of musical economy. "Chanler's genius of brevity was extreme," Mr. Rorem writes. "No one in history, not Dowland or Satie or Webern, ever more convincingly carried a hearer from doubt to heartbreak to resolution in a span of five bars."
Citkowitz's Five Songs From "Chamber Music" (1930), settings of texts by James Joyce, are a revelation. Although he died at 65 in 1974, Citkowitz had a mysteriously short composing career. His songs are few but extraordinary. While his contemporaries were working in various strains of a harmonic language that has come to be called Coplandesque, Citkowitz was trying something harder. His piano accompaniments are highly linear and contrapuntal; the voice and piano lines mingle daringly. The music has an almost abstract quality. And the flecks of astringent harmony leap out at you.
Another record that puts the current generation in context is a recital by the soprano Lucy Shelton on Koch International, presenting the complete songs for voice and piano by Stravinsky and Elliott Carter. Mr. Carter, who wrote his first opera at 90 ("What Next?," which received its premiere last year), has never been known as a vocal composer. But the songs from the 1940's performed here are scintillating. Imagine Copland's modal harmonies studded with feisty notes and threatening to burst at the seams with atonal riffs, and you will get some idea of what the music sounds like.
A long work from 1994, "Of Challenge and Love," on texts by John Hollander, finds Mr. Carter in his complex, knotty mature style. But the rigor of the idiom and the jagged vocal writing provide a refreshing break from the pandering neo-Romanticism that has become the style of choice.
THE baritone Sanford Sylvan came to Weill Recital Hall recently with a new work by another young American, the Cuban-born Jorge Martin. "The Glass Hammer: Scenes From Childhood Kept Against Forgetting," a 60-minute song cycle, sets 15 searing and painfully honest poems by Andrew Hudgins about his troubled youth as an Army brat in the Deep South with an abusive father. Mr. Sylvan's performance was a shattering tour de force. Yet, though Mr. Martin's music had tensile strength, declamatory sweep and often poignant lyricism, it did not always captivate the ear. Perhaps he lacks depth; or perhaps in this work he chose to "illustrate" the poems, in a sense, to keep the listener's attention focused on the words and the storytelling. Still, at a time when so many song composers are placating audiences, Mr. Martin's ambitious and challenging cycle stands out.
Then, of course, there is Mr. Rorem. During the 1960's, when the most hard-edged atonal composers claimed intellectual primacy in American music, tonal composers were condescended to. Mr. Rorem, in particular, was treated by many peers as some derivative disciple of Poulenc.
Yet "War Scenes," Mr. Rorem's cycle on texts freely selected from Walt Whitman's diary of the Civil War, comes from that decade, and in retrospect, especially in the context of the program at the 92nd Street Y, the music seemed pungent, lean, spiky and utterly contemporary.
Two recent recordings demonstrate the range of Mr. Rorem's achievement: the superb mezzo-soprano Susan Graham offers an entire Rorem program, 32 songs, on an Erato disc, with the pianist Malcolm Martineau. Every song -- even the most modest ones, like the ambling, tender setting of Robert Hillyer's "Early in the Morning" -- abounds in refinement and grace.
Last year, New World released a two-disc album of "Evidence of Things Not Seen," Mr. Rorem's self-described magnum opus, a concert-length cycle of 36 songs for four singers and piano. Poems and letters of 24 authors are arranged by the composer to create a text of narrative sweep dealing with themes of youthful optimism, coming of age, war, failed love, disillusionment, death and faith.
The pianists Steven Blier and Michael Barrett, who direct the New York Festival of Song, which helped commission this cycle, perform it here with Mr. Ollmann, Monique McDonald, Dolores Ziegler and Rufus Miller. Each song is an intimate and masterfully shaped gem. But the entire work has the impact of an opera. This work affirms Mr. Rorem's place in the tradition.
The general climate for American songs is more receptive than ever, and the current generation of song composers deserve credit for fostering it. That audiences are getting into the habit of hearing new songs is an important development. Now, it's up to audiences and singers to demand more challenging fare. And it's up to composers to work harder to provide it.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Ebullient Cubans Make a Lot Out of a Little

BYLINE: By ANNETTE GRANT; Annette Grant is the art editor of Arts & Leisure.

DATELINE: SANTIAGO DE CUBA

 BODY:
SANDRA LEVINSON, the director of the Center for Cuban Studies in Manhattan, was exhilarated as she stepped into the elevator of her hotel here one afternoon in February. Luis Rodriguez Ricardo, a young naive artist, had finished the painting he had promised Ms. Levinson to illustrate a brochure for a tour sponsored by the center. She balanced the work, "The Arrival," a jubilant view of the Santiago de Cuba harbor in full fete, on her hip, moving aside as a French group entered.
"What a beautiful painting!" one Frenchman exclaimed. "Where did you get it?" 
 An address was provided (there is no phone) and that afternoon the party dropped in on Mr. Rodriguez and his wife, Luisa Ramirez, an art historian, at their studio-home to view more of his work. Throughout Cuba, art aficionados and artists connect in such casual ways.
If asked to name a Cuban artist with an international reputation, most people would probably say Wifredo Lam, the great modernist who died in 1982. In the United States, only a handful of contemporary Cuban-born artists (most now expatriates) are known outside art circles: Jose Bedia (Miami), Manuel Mendive (Havana), Tomas Sanchez (Miami), Ernesto Pujol (Brooklyn) and Alexis Leyva, called Kcho (Havana). Far more are recognized in Mexico, France, Italy, Scandinavia and especially Spain, where many Cuban artists regularly exhibit and travel.
While every year a few more Cuban artists have shows in galleries and museums in New York, only Ms. Levinson's Cuban Art Space on West 23rd Street has continuous exhibitions, as well as an upstairs room packed to the gunwales with paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, collages, papier-mache, decorated shopping bags and cigar boxes, sculptures and carvings. Even this profusion represents only a fraction of the work in all mediums that is being made in Cuba, in spite of severe shortages of basic materials like paint, brushes, canvas and paper.
Like artists everywhere, Cubans are producing installation and performance pieces, a trend at the 1997 Havana Bienal that will surely continue at the next one in November. Yet most artists throughout the country still make representational paintings and sculptures that investigate subjects like religion (Roman Catholicism, especially Christ figures, and wildly popular Santerian saints and ceremonies), interior monologues akin to magical realism, history and daily island life. Iconic heroes like Jose Marti, Fidel Castro and the charismatic Che Guevara appear frequently (though not as agitprop), as do depictions of the human heart, the Cuban flag and the shape of the island itself, speaking of both pride and isolation.
The five artists profiled below came of age about a decade ago, around the time the Soviet Union collapsed and pulled out of Cuba, throwing the country into an economic crisis that persists. Yet little art seen in a recent visit protested this condition. Aided by the United States' exempting art from the trade embargo in 1991, many artists can earn a reasonable living while maintaining a studiously neutral political posture.
Luis Rodriguez Ricardo, 31, lives in Santiago de Cuba and the village of Mella, the home of an art collective called Grupo Bayate. The eight artists who form the group include his father, Luis Rodriguez Arias. Banding together in times of crisis makes sense economically and aesthetically, for it helps communities preserve their cultural patrimony. The group's ideal was not to sell their work, but to do it for the soul. Hard times changed that. As a result, the younger Mr. Rodriguez has become a modest commercial success and lives well, though not extravagantly, in a sparsely furnished old house belonging to his wife's parents, with two refrigerators, "one American, one Russian," he explains.
The Grupo paints in a naive, narrative style and takes rural life as its subject. The work of the Rodriguezes is riotously colorful and stacked like a rush-hour train, with a few ghosts as outriders. Neither father (a baker) nor son (a sometime construction worker) has studied art, and the younger man signs himself "El Estudiante," to distinguish himself from his father, whom he calls "el maestro."
FAR from this prelapsarian world, physically and philosophically, is the rarefied universe of Carlos Estevez, who lives and works in old Havana and keeps a motorcycle in his studio entrance (along with a sculpture of Jesus with a hole in his midriff). Just inside the studio is a three-tiered CD-tape deck, the nearly ubiquitous symbol (along with the personal computer) of a connection to a larger cultural universe.
Mr. Estevez, 30, has always known he wanted to be an artist and went to art school at 13. He is the son of an engineer, and it shows in the elegant craftsmanship of his work, which is largely concerned with metaphysical transformation. In drawings and installations, he has recreated the medieval bestiary in a modern anthropological fable, and examined history through figures like Joan of Arc, Isadora Duncan, Karl Marx, Jose Marti and Abraham Lincoln. He has also produced elaborate metaphors for creativity: the brain represented by coils of music staves, for example. Mr. Estevez is practiced at making statements about art. In one catalog interview he said, "Creating is an act of faith, an attempt to project this world inhabiting us," and, "We are all making our own history while also making reference to every other person."
While Mr. Estevez's work has intellectual roots, it is also highly accessible, which has made him popular at the Havana Bienal (he's working on a piece involving 100 notes in 100 bottles for the forthcoming one) and abroad, where he has had many shows and won several residencies, including one in upstate New York. Currently he is in Norway, where, he says, "I'm getting rich in my soul, and famous in a very small village."
Across town in the Vedado neighborhood, Elsa Mora, 29, pursues her own kind of alchemy, working out of the apartment she shares with her husband, Yamel Alvarez Duran, a specialist in the use of psychology in marketing and his wife's agent. "She works all the time," he says, "without regard to day or night."
Ms. Mora's subject in paintings, drawings and photo-collages is the female body and soul, and she seems to serve her observations directly from her own subconscious. "It interests me to take woman as universal data," she has said. "This way I can talk about a thousand things: life, death, loneliness, sickness." Ms. Mora's mother moved to Miami three years ago, and much of the pain in Ms. Mora's work seems to derive from the sorrow of separation, a common situation in Cuba and one exemplified by the Elian Gonzalez story.
Ms. Mora had a show of hand-shaped cutouts last year at the Cuban Art Space. She has also shown at the Phyllis Kind Gallery in New York. Ms. Kind, who is interested in outsider and self-taught art, is attracted to Ms. Mora's work because, she says, "like a true artist, she doesn't always know where it comes from, so there is no self-consciousness." Ms. Kind goes on to point out that, in her opinion, while Ms. Mora went to art school, "it didn't ruin her."
In a way, Lester Campa, 32, is a political artist, his subject the politics of the environment. Mr. Campa lives in Las Terrazas, a planned town built in the 1960's and 1970's near the ruins of a coffee plantation in the Sierra del Rosario mountains an hour west of Havana. Las Terrazas is part of an environmental center and botanical garden that specializes in nearly extinct indigenous plants. Overlooking the town is a hotel, La Moka, that is one of the leading tourist attractions in the area, not least because it is built in the forest around a tree no one could bear to cut down.
Mr. Campa sometimes travels to Havana, but he doesn't particularly like to leave home or studio, where his windows look out on a paradisiacal landscape. He paints lavishly detailed versions of what he sees, often with coronas of clouds. But a closer look reveals trouble in paradise: the clouds are smoke from burning logs; the forest of palms with their fat fronds is suffocating from pollution; the jutting rocks are upheavals of scorched earth. The message is clearly that man and nature do not cohabit easily, and it is no accident that a series of these works is titled "Life and Death."
Las Terrazas has a store that sells original art on recycled paper and silk-screened T-shirts. Profits support a collective of local artists organized by Mr. Campa.
Environmental elements are used in a nostalgic way by William Perez, 34, in an interactive installation he is preparing for the Havana Bienal. In it, he harks back to his childhood, when charcoal was prepared in an oven on a beach near his home in Cienfuegos. In the work, he will reproduce the process, using actual workers, who will make the charcoal and then put it in bags to be carried away by visitors to the exhibition. Mr. Perez will sign the bags. "It's a very large project," he says. "It'll need a lot of space. But I want to make art out of an ordinary pastime and use everyday labor to make a dialogue between art and the public."
Mr. Perez is mainly a sculptor, and a recent exhibition at the Cuban Art Space mounted 18 of his smaller sculptures and 12 drawings. He takes inspiration from Renaissance art, especially da Vinci's perfect man (sometimes with Guevara's features), and explains that he wants to "transmit the idea of mysticism or religion through images that are concrete and have nothing to do with religion."
When Mr. Perez and his wife, Dalila Lopez, arrived in New York on a last-minute visa to install his show, he brought his own price list, thumbnail sketches of all of the works on two precious sheets of typing paper. He is accustomed to doing everything himself and to finding ways to make art in a time of shortages. "Wood is easy," he says, "but metal is hard, so the big projects are sometimes made of a lot of little pieces," which are often donated by factories or individuals. Like most Cuban artists, Mr. Perez gets by with a little help from his friends.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
The Heart Was Their Guide, in Love and the Arts

BYLINE: By MICHELE WILLENS; Michele Willens's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about Academy Award nominations for supporting actors and actresses.

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THEY are American-born women who fell in love with radical Latin American men. Each has lived close to four decades in Cuba, and while their husbands spent time in prison or in the mountains with Fidel Castro, they carved out distinctive artistic lives.
Lorna Burdsall, a charismatic white-haired figure, is now in her early 70's and the director of the modern dance company AsiSomos, which combines dance, image theater, poetry and music. Today she mostly performs in her home for visitors ("Where else do I get to hug my audience?"). But since arriving in Cuba in 1955, the wife of a revolutionary who went on to become a top intelligence official, she has held high positions in both Cuba's world of dance and its culture bureaucracy. Along the way, she was a pivotal figure in establishing modern dance in Cuba. 
 Estela Bravo, in her late 60's, has made 26 documentary films since arriving in 1966. Many are about Cuba, and all are about Latin America; one depicting North Americans living in Cuba included Ms. Burdsall. Her latest, "Fidel," was shown at the Latin American Film Festival in Havana in December. It was commissioned by Channel 4 in Britain and has been shown there as well as in Canada, Argentina and Chile. She is hoping to have it distributed in America.
Currently she is making "Operation Peter Pan," about the 14,000 Cuban children who were sent to the United States by their parents to escape the Cuban revolution.
Each of these women has a love story. Ms. Bravo, one of three sisters raised largely by union organizers (her mother died when she was 12), was a leader of Students for a Peaceful World at Brooklyn College when she attended a meeting of the Student Congress in Poland in 1953. There, she met Ernesto Bravo, a medical student and activist from Argentina who was receiving medical treatment after having been tortured and tried under Juan Peron on charges of organizing anti-government student activities.
The chemistry was instant, but he returned home to Argentina and she to Brooklyn. The next year she made a trip to Brazil for another student conference, this time as a reporter for the periodical Latin America Today. "I decided I should stop by Argentina and see Ernesto," she said. He was being hidden by anti-Peronists, but she managed to spend a week with him. "We decided then and there to get married," she said.
She eventually took a monthlong journey on a cargo boat from New York to Argentina, where the two were married in January 1956. Over the next eight years, they had two children (a third would come later) and Mr. Bravo became a professor of biochemistry. "One day," Ms. Bravo recalls, "he told me he'd been invited to Cuba to teach biochemistry in medical school and I said, 'Great, it's closer to the States.' I thought I'd be visiting my home country more, but little did I know that the move would turn out to be closer only geographically."
When Ms. Bravo arrived in Cuba, Ms. Burdsall was already well entrenched. Raised in New London, Conn., she had trained with Martha Graham and Anthony Tudor and was studying dance at the Juilliard School. In 1953 she went to a dance at the International House in Manhattan, where she noticed a young man doing the mambo. "He had the most intense eyes," she said. "I asked someone where he was from and was told Cuba."
Manuel Pineiro, the son of a Bacardi Rum executive, was studying business administration at Columbia University. The two were married in New York, but soon after, Mr. Pineiro, who was talking a lot of socialism and politics, said he needed to go back to Cuba for a vacation.
"I knew he was going to the mountains to fight with Fidel, but he never really said it to me," said Ms. Burdsall. "He kept saying he'd be back, but finally I got a call from him, while I was at a dance summer program in Michigan, and he said, 'Do you think you could come here instead?' I went straight from Detroit to Havana."
There, she raised a son -- now with a daughter of his own -- and saw her husband only intermittently until the revolution succeeded in 1959. Sometimes, they met under almost comically dire circumstances, as when she visited him secretly in the mountains.
"I wore this beautiful yellow dress," she recalled, "but as I was going up to the mountains, it started pouring and there was mud everywhere. By the time I got to his location, I was entirely filthy. Still, his comrades were in on the surprise and they told him, 'The commandant wants to see you.' And when he walked in, there I was. We got only an hour together before he was called into action. That night I slept on a pile of something very cold, which I later discovered was grenades and ammunition."
When Mr. Castro came into power, her husband -- known in the revolutionary world as Red Beard -- became Deputy Minister of the Interior, in charge of state security. After his death in a car crash in 1998, an obituary in The New York Times described him as the "ruthless but urbane spymaster who for more than 30 years led Cuba's intelligence apparatus and directed its efforts to export revolution to the third world."
In their marriage, serving Mr. Castro always came first. Fortunately for Ms. Burdsall, there was dance, and in 1959, she helped found the Compania Danza Contemporanea, for which she performed and choreographed for 15 years. In 1977 she became national director of dance and modern dance adviser to the Minister of Culture. Ms. Burdsall's marriage lasted 20 years before she decided she wanted her independence. She remained on good terms with her ex-husband, and is especially close to her granddaughter, Gabriela, 11. who often performs the witty and provocative dances her grandmother choreographs. "Gabriela is like my other self, a younger version," said Ms. Burdsall.
Ms. Bravo's marriage remains intact. Her husband is now a consulting professor on bioethics at the University of Havana. Both women live well by Cuban standards. The suggestion that such good fortune may have colored Ms. Bravo's recent documentary about Mr. Castro (it is generally flattering in tone) infuriates her.
"I'm very independent, and I think Castro has only recently seen it," she said. "I originally asked for his cooperation and got back the reply, 'Why don't you do it after I'm not here anymore?' I decided early on that this was to be a piece about the man himself, not his politics."
The film includes observations from people like the director Sydney Pollack, who made the film "Havana"; the author Alice Walker, who calls Mr. Castro "the great redwood"; and the writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who tells of going fishing with Mr. Castro.
Ms. Burdsall's artistic impact has not been political. She brought in influences from Western dance that have since been taught to many young Cubans. "By mentoring and inspiring scores of careers, Lorna has opened Cuba to the world in a very special way and also brought the outside world somehow closer to Cuba," said Jon Lee Anderson, a New Yorker writer and author ("Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life").
Ms. Burdsall explains: "As part of the choreographic process, I have always demanded active creative participation on the part of the dancers. It's important for me that they reveal their cultural identity through movements, gestures and sensations."
Although she cites Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey as her main creative influences, she said her greatest influence came from a more personal place: "The personality of my very creative and humorous mother influenced me the most in shaping my personal style." Ms. Burdsall has saved all the journals her mother (who died in 1978) wrote over 80 years. "She was a frustrated everything," she added. "All her life she was creative and had nowhere to put it."
While both Ms. Burdsall and Ms. Bravo have traveled back to the United States, they remain committed to Cuba. That commitment was tested during what the Cubans call the Special Period, in the early 90's, when the Soviets pulled out their support and left a shattered island economy behind.
"It was so terrible in the beginning," Ms. Bravo said. "There were no lights, no air-conditioning, no gasoline. I remember taking a walk by the sea with my husband and we asked ourselves, 'Should we leave?' Some of our friends had left. But we decided that we'd been here so long, we had roots. And things slowly got better. People don't talk enough about the sacrifices Cubans made then, how they bonded together."
MS. BURDSALL said of the same period: "I remember looking out my window and seeing people leaving on rafts. I remember performing for a group from Canada in 1993, and there was no light on in the whole neighborhood. I greeted them with a flashlight and then made flashlights part of the performance.
"But you know, I came to Cuba for love and in a way I stayed for love -- this time for a country and the people, not one man."
Both Ms. Bravo and Ms. Burdsall say their art has had a far greater impact in Cuba than it probably would have had if they had not followed their men. "I have made 26 films and won many awards at film festivals around the world, but in America nobody knows who I am," said Ms. Bravo. Yet on a recent visit, her phone rang constantly with calls from people like her friend and fellow documentary maker Rory Kennedy. And the longtime documentary maker Sol Landau, while questioning her independence, nevertheless said: "I can't say anything bad about her. She does good work."
Ms. Bravo said: "If I'd stayed in New York, I may or may not have gone to film school and made films in a more formulaic way, one of so many. Here I learn by intuition, and I think the style is more raw, straightforward."
Ms. Burdsall found a similar freedom: "What would I have done if I'd been just another dancer in New York? I'd have gone to auditions with 900 other dancers and been forced to retire at 40. Here I've had so many opportunities and the audiences so appreciate my style of modern dance. I look at the dancers around the country and I think, 'They've almost all been my students at one time.' "
Last year, she attended her 50th high school reunion, making the trek back to Connecticut. "A lot of the people did not know what to make of me," Ms. Burdsall said, laughing. "But eventually they warmed up when I performed one of my dances. Most of them had stayed small, closer to home. We looked back over things we'd written when we were graduating and mine said I was going to travel, write a book and live in the country. Well, I didn't say what country!"

HEADLINE: In Chicago, From Printing Plant to Technology Hub

BYLINE: By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
A LANDMARK building that once housed the country's largest commercial printing facility is now being converted into a mammoth "carrier hotel" housing multiple telecommunications and Internet companies.
When renovation of the onetime R. R. Donnelly & Sons Calumet Plant into the Lakeside Technology Center is completed this fall, it will hold what the developers say is the country's largest planned carrier hotel. It will offer more than 1.1 million square feet of space devoted to the technical needs of telecommunications providers and Internet companies. 
 The eight-story, English Gothic-style Calumet Plant has been a fixture on Chicago's lakefront since it was built in the early 20th century as part of the historic Lakeside Press printing complex that was once owned by R. R. Donnelly. Publications including Life magazine, Sears, Roebuck & Company's Big Book catalog and the Yellow Pages were printed in the complex before operations there ceased in 1993.
Donnelly relocated its corporate headquarters from the complex to downtown Chicago in 1992 following the city's condemnation of part of the complex to expand the McCormick Place convention center. The company also moved most of its remaining printing work to other of its printing facilities throughout Illinois.
Developers of the Lakeside Technology Center say that the market for these kinds of facilities is strong.
"We felt that this was a relatively underserved market in general and in Chicago specifically," said Robert Stuckey, managing director of the Carlyle Group in Washington, which is developing the property in a joint venture with Core Location of Bethesda, Md. "We felt that Chicago is a tier-one telecommunications hub, along with New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and that there was pent-up demand here that was not being served."
The onetime Lakeside Press complex, he said, "had certain physical and technological features that set it apart from others."
Carrier hotels have unusual operational requirements, including multiple power sources, numerous ventilation outlets and floors capable of bearing heavy loads. Tenants of these facilities need to have self-contained heating, cooling and ventilation systems as well as extraordinary amounts of electric power and individualized security systems, said David B. Larson, a senior project architect for McClier Construction in Chicago, which reconstructing the building.
Because the Calumet Plant was built as an industrial facility, the building was ripe for transformation. It offered 14-foot ceiling heights, floors capable of bearing 250 pounds per square foot and approximately 30 existing shafts to allow McClier to adapt them as vertical risers for chilled water, electric wiring and exhaust, Mr. Larson said.
More important, the plant is just blocks away from the North American fiber-optic long-haul route, a major transcontinental fiber-optic cable route. The proximity will allow the building's tenants easy access to the fiber optic infrastructure that they need to run their businesses, said Michael Jacoby, president of Core Location, a developer of carrier hotels, data centers and other high-tech buildings.
The developers say that the renovation of this fabled building into the largest carrier hotel in the country is somewhat ironic, given that it was built as the largest producer of a different kind of communications. Built in four stages between 1912 and 1929, the Calumet Plant -- named for its location at the intersection of Calumet Avenue and 22nd Street on the South Side of Chicago along the Illinois Central Railroad tracks that follow the Lake Michigan shoreline -- doubled Donnelly's printing capacity. It also contained Donnelly's executive offices, an art gallery and a library.
The developers plan to restore the building's Gothic-style executive offices and library and will allow tenants to use them for meetings. Some 600 printers' marks, decorative stone shields depicting printers' tools that once decorated the facade of the building over the main entrance, will also be restored, Mr. Jacoby said.
THE Calumet Plant remained an active printing press plant for Donnelly until 1993, when Sears discontinued production of its Big Book catalog and company executives decided that operating the plant, which was spread over eight floors, was no longer economically feasible.
In 1997, Donnelly sold the rest of the Lakeside Press complex, which included the Calumet Plant, to Landmark America, a Portland, Me., development company. The company originally planned to develop the property into a mixed-use development, though construction has not begun on any of the buildings.
Landmark America sold the Calumet Plant to Core Location and the Carlyle Group last year for an undisclosed sum.
Chicago officials, who once worried about the vacant Lakeside Press buildings, are applauding the transformation of the Calumet Plant because it has helped propel an ambitious plan by Mayor Richard M. Daley to position the city as a leader in technology. To spur that growth, the city provided the building's developers with a $3 million energy grant to help subsidize the costs of construction. An additional $1 million in tax abatements was given to the building's anchor tenant, Global Center of San Jose, Calif., a Web-hosting Internet services company. as an incentive to cement the deal, said Jimm Dispensa, assistant commissioner of the technology development unit of the city's Department of Planning and Development.
Stephen Johnson, vice president of design and construction for Global Center, a unit of Global Crossing, a fiber optic network, said that the tax-increment funds had little to do with the company's decision to lease space in the carrier hotel, however. The company, which leased the center's 135,000-square-foot third floor, had been looking for a carrier hotel to house its operations in Chicago for some time. "We have studies that tell us what particular arenas in the world we should be in," Mr. Johnson said. "Chicago rated high in terms of what we could get for a customer base and for its proximity to fiber."
Mr. Johnson said Global Center would like to double the amount of space it leased in the carrier hotel but would be unable to because the 1.1 million-square-foot building was already 75 percent leased. Rentals in the building range from $26 to $40 a square foot.
Other tenants include 360networks, a fiber-optic network, and Qwest Communications and Level 3 Communications, both telecommunications companies, according to Mr. Jacoby.
David Love, senior vice president of network operations for the Vancouver-based 360networks, said that his company decided to lease space in the building because of its proximity to its own cable network. The company said that it would use its space to drop off its voice and data traffic and pick up other traffic.
"The fact that a number of other carriers like us are in the building" was a plus, Mr. Love said. "It makes it so easy to share traffic with them," he added.
Even though the developers' research had shown a need for this kind of space in Chicago, they say they were being taken by surprise by the demand for the space. "We thought it would take three years to lease this much space," Mr. Stuckey said. "It looks like it will lease up in one year."

HEADLINE: The Haves and the Have-Nots

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
TWO old men chatting on a street outside the Larchmont Post Office could occupy the same turf in Garden City. The sweet aroma of cafe con leche drifting out of a Mexican restaurant in Port Chester could be coming through the entrance of a Salvadoran eatery in Hempstead. A diner in Hastings-on-Hudson could be a diner in Oyster Bay, the same hungry eaters with their sport utility vehicles nosed to the curbs outside.
The weekend tag sales that proliferate each spring could be in Levittown or Tarrytown, Roslyn or Rye, any of the scores of bedroom communities that make up Nassau and Westchester Counties. 
 To casual observers, the two counties are nearly indistinguishable. Westchester is larger in land area, Nassau larger in population. Westchester was recently ranked the 7th wealthiest county in America; Nassau placed 17th. They share Long Island Sound and a state government. Both have fabulous mansions and pockets of poverty, Lyme ticks and West Nile mosquitoes and a border with New York City.
Yet one glaring difference sets them apart. While Westchester's government is the picture of economic health, awash in a surplus, with a credit rating that is among the best in the country, Nassau is in a budget crisis that will probably require help from every New York State taxpayer, with a deficit that has pushed its bond rating nearly to junk status.
How such similar counties evolved financially -- "like night and day" in the words of an aide to the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall -- is a tale of philosophically opposite methods of budgeting and taxing set against very different political landscapes.
In Nassau, one-party politics let Republican leaders make some disastrous financial decisions. For years, county officials forged a steady record of underestimating costs and overestimating revenues. They held the line on property taxes but paid employees handsomely, while selling county property or borrowing mountains of cash to keep government chugging along.
But their luck ran out last year as the deficit reached $300 million. An apathetic electorate was energized, humbling a legendary G.O.P. machine and creating a Democratic legislative majority for the first time. At the heart of the election was the budget mess.
In Westchester, more conservative budgeting grew out of years of competition between Democratic and Republican elected officials who held one another in check. Westchester's legislative branch was overhauled 26 years before Nassau's, a move that gave lawmakers more responsibility and provided needed checks and balances in government, officials on both sides agree.
Westchester leaders never got into Nassau's habit of using one-time revenues, like money from the sale of a hospital, for example, to pay continuing costs. They did little borrowing. And, unpopular as it was, they increased property taxes a bit each year to cover spending increases.
"The problems in Nassau have been a reflection of politics and history," said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of the Nassau County Legislature, which replaced the Board of Supervisors in 1996. "One-party government controlled a part-time legislature that was able to rubber-stamp the executive branch of government. When you put the politics and history together, it was a recipe for disaster."
A comparison of the counties found the following:
*In Nassau, each resident's share of the county's debt is $2,065, more than twice as much as in any other county in New York and more than six times the state average. By contrast, Westchester's debt is $627 per resident.
*Nassau spends $520 million a year -- nearly a quarter of its $2.2 billion budget -- on a police department whose rank-and-file officers are paid $90,000 a year. Westchester has a much smaller police force, representing a mere 1.8 percent of the county's $1.17 billion budget, and the average officer is paid only $63,500 a year.
*When Nassau sold its hospital last year for $82 million, it used the windfall to help plug the deficit. When Westchester transferred its hospital to a public benefit corporation in 1997, it did it for $1, not seeking to make money off the deal. Similarly, Nassau used $170 million in tobacco-settlement money to pay for ongoing costs and to help balance its books. Westchester used $63.4 million of its tobacco money to erase hospital debts through 2005.
*The biggest share of Nassau's debt -- $100 million a year -- goes to repay homeowners and merchants who successfully challenge their property tax assessments. Westchester paid $9 million in such refunds last year. And unlike Nassau, which borrows to pay, Westchester pays with money budgeted for that purpose.
*In Nassau, property taxes are collected by towns and cities that first take their share and then forward the remainder to the county. If there is a shortfall, it is the county's responsibility to collect. In Westchester, the towns and cities collect the money but pay the county first.
Taken together, the effects of such procedural differences are staggering, experts say. Today, Westchester has the highest credit rating given by Standard & Poor's, while Nassau's rating is hovering just above junk status, with a downgrade threatened this month.
"I would say that if Nassau had used Westchester as an example of how to run a county over the past 10 years, Nassau's taxpayers would be in much better shape today," Comptroller McCall said.
But the tale of the two counties is also a story of residents whose lives are playing out differently.
While Westchester's 900,000 residents are gliding along on one of the nation's longest economic expansions, there's a recession mentality among Nassau's 1.3 million people, who are nagged by a daily sense of fiscal chaos, by the prospect of tax increases and layoffs of police officers and by cutbacks in services that are punctuated by protest marches.
Still, both counties boast of hordes of retail stores filled with shoppers with ready cash. Both have high per-capita income and low unemployment.
"The fact that Westchester didn't have Nassau's problems doesn't mean it's more affluent than Nassau," said Anthony A. Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace University in White Plains. "It was just managed better than Nassau and didn't get involved in all the political games."
In Nassau, the problem comes down to one simple truth: there is not enough money flowing in to cover the amount streaming out, as County Comptroller Frederick E. Parola, a Republican, has been warning Republicans and Democrats since June 1996.
In Westchester, because the math adds up, deficits are unheard of and the cost of governing is balanced, said Kathleen M. Carrano, Westchester's budget director, who grew up in Nassau and was once controller for Glen Cove.
Nassau's fiscal tailspin started long before its deficit hit $300 million last summer. The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, took office in 1987. While he oversaw spending increases for things like keeping parks pristine and ensuring that salaries for county employees outpaced inflation, he held the line on property taxes for most of his tenure. Feeling no pain, the voters for years rewarded him at the polls.
In Westchester, tax increases came in frequent small steps, keeping county income high enough that County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, was able to cut taxes 3 percent this year.
"I think the reluctance to raise property taxes incrementally is a major cause to where Nassau stands fiscally today," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, Long Island's largest business group.
One beneficiary of Nassau's lavish spending has been the police department, where costs have shot up 64 percent in the past decade, and where lucrative provisions in police contracts -- one negotiated, in 1992, and the most recent one decided by an arbitrator -- have seen payouts for retiring officers reach the six-figure mark, with the average supervisor retiring last year taking home $207,000.
Westchester's spending on its police force is much lower, just $19.6 million out of this year's $1.17 billion budget, Ms. Carrano said.
The Westchester force, the Department of Public Safety, was established by voter referendum in the early 1980's, merging the sheriff's department with what used to be the parkway police. Today there are 273 budgeted positions, including 222 uniformed officers. That compares with 4,100 positions, including 3,100 officers, in Nassau.
To Todd A. Whitestone, managing director of public finance ratings at Standard & Poor's, it is not the cost of such things as police services that is alarming, as much as it is Nassau's inability to pay.
Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the Legislature, said Nassau must rethink what it can afford. "Nassau has always had the Cadillac of programs and everyone else has had Chevys and Fords, and we have to get to that," he said. Politicians in Nassau need the "political will" to cut costs, he added.
Of course, cutting jobs or salaries of any sort in Nassau has always been politically unpalatable because appointed commissioners, deputy commissioners, secretaries and others have been the lifeblood of a strong Republican machine, one that has held a grip on the county government for almost the entire century of its existence.
And Democrats in Nassau, hampered by their own internal squabbling for more than a decade, were often left on the sidelines by an electorate that "tolerated wasteful spending and governmental mismanagement," said Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an advocacy group.
Dr. Cupaiuolo, of Pace, said: "In Westchester, for quite a few years, both parties held active roles. Both parties have been healthier, and that is healthier, when you have two parties that are competitive. The impression I get is that Nassau is just riddled with patronage, and outrageously so, and the political culture was, 'Let's keep bringing people on, giving them good salaries, and this way we can stay in office as long as we want.' It certainly exists in Westchester, but I don't believe to that extent."
Nassau's problems are aggravated by its debt.
In addition to loans for roads and buildings, Nassau borrows just to keep government going. To cover operating costs, Nassau's projected cash-flow borrowing this year is $485 million, compared with just $75 million for the same purpose last year in Westchester, municipal analysts said. Westchester has no short-term borrowing scheduled in 2000.
"That is a big difference with Westchester's AAA and Nassau's BBB," said Diane P. Brosen, director at Standard & Poor's, discussing the bond ratings. "One big warning sign of fiscal problems is an escalation of debt and cash-flow borrowing."
Overall, Westchester has been closer to the mark in estimating its cash flow for items like sales-tax receipts, and its expenses for things like employee overtime. Only once in recent history, in 1998, has Westchester overestimated the money it would get in sales taxes, Ms. Carrano said.
Nassau, on the other hand, has consistently underestimated overtime costs and, at least since 1995, it has overestimated sales-tax receipts. Last year, receipts were $9 million short of estimates and the year before they were $33 million short, according to Standard & Poor's.
When gaps occur, Nassau has been slow to make budget adjustments, Ms. Brosen said. "They just wait and say, 'Whoop, you know, there is a big gap here,' " she said. But in Westchester, there is "ongoing budget monitoring, both expenditures and revenues," said Robin Prunty, the Standard & Poors analyst who monitors Westchester.
Michael P. Jacobson, a former budget official in New York City who helped the former Republican-controlled Nassau Legislature prepare a fiscal plan last fall, said he was left feeling that Nassau's financial management was "completely nonexistent." A key problem, he said, was that Nassau's budget office was understaffed, though adding people was a "heavy lift politically, if you are in financial straits."
"There was not a centralized, powerful budget office that was able to know immediately, on a real-time basis early on, what problems were coming down the pike, what to do about them, how to avert problems," Mr Jacobson said. "There was absolutely no multiyear budgeting. My sense is Westchester probably has a better management system. They keep closer track."
Most of those interviewed said political will had been missing in Nassau for years, especially because budgets must be passed just before Election Day, making tax increases that much more difficult politically.
Arthur J. Kremer, a former Democratic state assemblyman who is now a lawyer at Rivkin, Radler & Kremer, one of the Island's largest firms, said that in Nassau, "the government was sound asleep and failed to follow any of the warning signs" of a fiscal wreck down the road.
But unlike New York City in 1975, or Troy, N.Y., which nearly went bankrupt in 1994, or Orange County, Calif., which lost $2 billion in a risky investment scheme, Nassau threatens to crumble in the midst of a soaring national economy.
To Edward Glaeser, professor of economics at Harvard University, the case for a state government bailout of Nassau is hard to make, even though the first steps are in place with a plan by Gov. George E. Pataki to combine $100 million in grants to Nassau with a fiscal control board that would monitor the county's efforts to get its act together, and impose its own plan if it cannot.
"This is not a city like Detroit that is mired in poverty," Mr. Glaeser said. "It is a healthy place that if it were run with any sense of fiscal responsibility, should be very healthy."
But, he said, the comparison to Westchester is even more startling, given the two counties' many similarities: "In one area, fiscal responsibility reigns, and in the other place they are playing games."

HEADLINE: A New Effort to Protect the Sound

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
WITH millions and possibly billions of dollars in financing in the balance, a plan to create a reserve for Long Island Sound is being advanced in Connecticut and New York, which are bound together by the 110-mile-long estuary.
The reserve would protect shoreline and underwater lands, restore habitats and increase public access to the Sound, which is severely limited for the 25 million people who live or work nearby. Though the Sound lies in the most densely populated region of the country, it has attracted less federal support than other estuaries, like Chesapeake Bay. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and others said the designation would improve the chances of federal financing by providing a conduit through which money could flow to the states, municipalities and groups involved in carrying out reserve programs.
"The Congressional climate seems positive for an increase in conservation funding," Senator Lieberman said. "Creating a reserve system might help the Long Island Sound region receive some of that money."
Potential federal funds include a share of $900 million in fees from offshore oil drilling. In addition, a bill passed in the House in May would provide $80 million annually for four years to clean up the Sound; the Senate version would provide $10 million a year for five years.
The reserve would begin a second phase in efforts begun by the two states and the federal government in 1985 to reverse a decline of water quality in the Sound.
A 1994 agreement between the states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency cited low levels of dissolved oxygen, a condition known as hypoxia, as the leading threat. It set goals for a reduction in nitrogen, which is generated by sewage-treatment plants and causes the overgrowth of algae that consume oxygen, causing hypoxia and killing marine life.
The nitrogen-reduction programs, paid for principally by state and local governments, have had some success in limiting the spread of hypoxia. But an assessment by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection last August estimated that an area more than five times the size of Manhattan was still hypoxic, mostly in the western Sound.
New York City, whose four sewage plants account for nearly 40 percent of the treated sewage discharged into the Sound, is being sued by the state and by a private group, the Soundkeeper, for exceeding agreed nitrogen levels.
Most of the $200 million earmarked for the Sound under New York State's Clean Air and Clean Water Bond Act, and the more than $200 million budgeted by Connecticut for the Sound, is intended to lower nitrogen levels by upgrading treatment plants.
To date, federal involvement has been limited to annual allocations to the Long Island Sound Office, which administers the 1994 plan. Mark Tedesco, the director, said the program had received about $18.5 million in federal money since 1985. He estimated that fulfilling the 1994 agreement would cost $2 billion over 15 years.
Mr. Tedesco said that while hypoxia had been contained, there was no decisive evidence that it had declined as a result of sewage-plant upgrades, even though they had reduced nitrogen discharges by 25 percent since 1994. "I'm hesitant to say we have significantly reduced the problem," he said.
But he added that there could be a lag before a cut in nitrogen resulted in higher levels of dissolved oxygen.
Proponents of the reserve said it would move beyond upgrades of treatment plants to address acquisition of shoreline properties, measures to restore wetlands and related programs.
To involve greater numbers of people, increasing access would also be a high priority.
"We're spending billions of dollars cleaning up the Sound, and most of the people living around it can't get there," said Robert D. Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group. "It's probably the least accessible piece of coastline in the United States."
Mr. Yaro said shoreline acquisitions could also limit development, a kind of "insurance policy for water quality."
Save the Sound, which represents environmental and civic groups in the Long Island Sound Watershed Alliance, has identified 450 sites, private and public, that could be preserved or restored. William P. Shadel, a habitat ecologist for the group, said the group's goal was to preserve 2,000 acres of shoreline and strengthen protection along 1,000 miles of riverfront in Connecticut by 2007.
John Atkin, president of Save the Sound, agreed that land acquisition would "potentially have a very high price tag," but he and others said the cost of degradation from overdevelopment would be more costly.
The Long Island Sound Office has estimated the annual contribution that the Sound makes to the regional economy at more than $5 billion, with boating and recreation in the lead, despite limits on access.
David Sutherland, director of government relations for the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said development pressures would make land acquisitions challenging. But though "the prices may seem high," he added, "in the end it will be a bargain."
Mr. Atkin, of Save the Sound, said a reserve could also set aside surface and underwater areas for research into restoring marine habitats and understanding how contaminants affect marine life.
Proponents of the reserve cited the extensive lobster die-off last fall as a dramatic example of the need to learn more. Researchers said the lobsters might have been attacked by a parasite, but uncertainty remained.
Some lobster and fishing groups fear that pesticides used in mosquito spraying were washed into the Sound and killed the lobsters.
William N. Smith, the executive director of Fish Unlimited of Shelter Island, said dumping in the Sound of material dredged from Mamaroneck Harbor could also have played a part. Mr. Smith said the dredged material contained pesticide residues and other contaminants.
There are four dumping sites in the Sound. The E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers are conducting an environmental study to assess the suitability of the sites.
David J. Miller, the executive director of the National Audubon Society of New York, said hearings in 1990 helped define issues addressed in the 1994 management plan. "We want to turn the corner and get the people behind this new initiative," he said. "Now let's look at the natural coast and how to connect people to that natural coast."

HEADLINE: Woolens to Backpacks, Textiles Stay Alive

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
SURVIVORS and newcomers to Connecticut's once-prominent textile industry have specialized, diversified and pumped large investments into high-tech, computer-driven operations.
"The textile industry in Connecticut peaked in the middle of the 20th century and, to survive, the companies remaining have had to make significant changes in their operations," said Peter Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association in Hartford. 
 "None of the companies could have survived without a lot of innovation," Mr. Gioia said. "Companies that are still viable have had to make significant changes and run streamlined and equipment-intensive operations."
According to the association's membership, the state's textile industry consists of manufacturers in 13 categories. Most of the companies, Mr. Gioia said, produce specialty products ranging from sailcloth to armored vests.
The textile specialty of one manufacturer, Warren of Stafford, originates with the Kel goat in China. The goat's silky cashmere fleece makes the long journey in bales to Stafford Springs, where it is woven into high-priced fabrics worn by the well to do. More than a dozen framed, commissioned photographs of the pampered goat, which is native to Kashmir, give an artsy, sleek decor to Warren of Stafford's headquarters in the center of town.
It's a dramatically different atmosphere from the one engendered by the century-old mill's former life in the rural, eastern Connecticut town, where Italian, German, Polish and other immigrants first ran the looms, and where the company's original specialty was camel's hair cloth.
Warren of Stafford, whose origins parallel the birth of the textile industry in New England, has been reborn as the only United States affiliate of the Loro Piana company. Loro Piana, a family-owned textile empire, is headquartered in northeastern Italy, near Biella, which is considered the high-end textile center of Italy. After buying Warren of Stafford in 1988, Loro Piana retained the mill's name in appreciation of local history. The site works well because of its closeness to New York City, the heart of the fashion industry and the site of one of Loro Piana's marketing offices. By the time Loro Piana arrived, however, Warren of Stafford's operations, like those of many textile mills in the Northeast, had shrunk.
According to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, in Washington, D.C., the industry remains dominant in the southeastern United States, where eight states produce some 75 percent of the United States gross domestic product in textiles.
Like the Connecticut mills, the entire United States textile industry went through peaks and valleys during the 20th century as a result of wars, economic booms and downturns, trade agreements and foreign competition. "The last gasp in Connecticut was really the 1980's, when the last of the big mills gave up the ghost," said Bruce Clouette, a lecturer in history at the University of Connecticut in Mansfield who compiled the list of historic textile sites published in the National Register of Historic Places.
The United States textile industry today is a $69-billion-a-year operation, representing 8 percent of all manufacturing jobs, and employs 600,000 people in 26,000 companies in virtually every state. In Connecticut, which is still considered a manufacturing-intensive state with some 270,000 manufacturing workers, the textile industry has a tiny percentage, with 2,400 employees. Warren of Stafford represents 10 percent of that textile work force.
The company's fine quality woolen and worsted fabric is turned into expensive apparel -- suits, jackets and coats -- for clothiers like Hickey-Freeman, Joseph Banks and Brooks Brothers. Ninety percent of Warren of Stafford's business is directed to United States markets, and a high percentage of that is in men's wear.
"Our custom division sells to the tailor industry in the United States, and their customers include many wealthy businessmen and sports figures," said Roberto Modica, the company's 37-year-old vice president of operations. "Often sports figures have a difficult time finding suits in a retail store, and some of the tailors we sell to make suits for basketball players."
Loro Piana has invested $40 million in modernization of its Warren of Stafford affiliate, most in computerized machinery.
"The investment was necessary, so we can better compete with the textile mills in Europe and Asia," Mr. Modica said. "Our annual sales are $30 million, but we have the capacity and potential today to double that figure." For Bill Horowitz, 47, president and chief executive officer of Amerbelle Corporation, a specialty textile manufacturer and local landmark in Vernon, serving the customer, especially the international customer, is a high priority.
"We're seeking to grow partnerships in Europe, South America and Asia," Mr. Horowitz said. "It's important to these different cultures to know and feel comfortable with their business partners.
"Many U.S. business people are growing up with e-mail as the culture of communications," he continued. "It's important to understand that other cultures, such as the European, seek to break bread to develop personal relationships and gain trust. This requires the personal contact and rapport that so many Americans have lost the skills to develop."
Mr. Horowitz, whose grandfather was the senior founding partner of Amerbelle in 1936, has seen a dramatic change in the company's product line over the last six decades. Historically, the company dyed fabrics used primarily as linings for apparel like women's dresses and skirts, hats and men's outerwear. In the 1960's and 1970's, as those products became more sensitive to import competition, the company shifted to industrial fabrics for products like backpacks, bulletproof vests and parachutes.
"The company has once again reinvented its product line," Mr. Horowitz said. "Today, we service companies that need specialized colors, finishes and coatings for high-end fashion uses."
Those uses range from high-performance outdoor apparel for sports like skiing, mountain climbing and kayaking, to sailing gear and soft luggage.
Throughout the 1990's, Mr. Horowitz said, the company made significant capital investments in computerized dyeing equipment. "When many New England textile companies closed or chose to relocate in the South, we remained committed to the people in our local community," Mr. Horowitz said."The textile heritage of New England is still alive here."

HEADLINE: Loggers Look at a Tree and See a Boat

BYLINE: By DAVID MONAGAN 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S 570 licensed loggers are an independent lot, mostly hewing an unseen living in one- or two-man bands from the forests that dot the two northern corners of the state. But the 70 million board feet of timber they harvest each year is thought by the state to contribute about $414 million to the economy, in large part because the state still holds many stands of prime hardwoods that are valued throughout the world.
One of the most storied is the white oak, quercus alba, because it grows straight, hard, and clear grained, with superb rot and water resistance -- qualities all long esteemed by shipwrights. A Cornwall logger named Charles (Duke) Besozzi has found his way into the same market, supplying select timbers for the grand schooner restorations and one-of-a-kind wooden yachts that are being brought to life in boat yards up and down the New England coast. 
 "Connecticut white oak was once known as the best white oak of all," said Mr. Besozzi, 50, of Collinsville, who looks more like a prep school English teacher than a logger with his tousled chestnut hair, clear blue eyes, and sleight but taut frame.
"It is really good and slow-growing and especially free of dead knots in the Northwest Corner and just across the line in the Southern Berkshires and New York."
He was standing beside a 30-foot length of white oak from a tree whose first milling revealed hints of rose in its milky grain. The seven-inch thick timber, which Besozzi estimated was 175 years old, will soon be refined into the tapering contours of a yacht's keel by a seventh-generation Massachusetts shipwright.
"Naval architects will fax me the dimensions of a keel or sternpost or whatever they need, and I'll go out to find the right tree. I can tell straight away if there's a keel in a tree from the trueness and height and upper edge defects, or a natural sweep waiting for deck planking. Other loggers will also set aside what they think I might like," Mr. Besozzi said, pointing towards some behemoths with the name Duke painted at the end, "and I go around collecting the best stuff like truffles."
Jon Wilson, the founder and editor-in-chief of the Maine-based Woodenboat magazine, said there is strong demand among ship builders for the white oak of Connecticut.
 "If boat builders had to depend on commercial lumber yards, they'd go out of business," he said. "There is no question that Connecticut white oak is among the most highly prized stock.
"Wooden boat builders are extraordinarily dependent on the eye of a timber harvester like this," he said. "It's as if you were a gourmet cook and the ultimate meal depended on absolutely perfect ingredients; you'd soon realize that if you don't have those you cannot express your art."
Mr. Besozzi, who studied history at the University of Connecticut and spent his boyhood summers in Maine, first spotted the possibility of combining his love of water and wood after a mast hunting excursion to Cornwall by Mystic Seaport representatives in the early 1980's. At the time, he was harvesting upward of a half-million board feet per year -- typically, the more predominant red oak, cherry, ash, and sugar maple that are central to Connecticut's forest industry.
"I was just going like a demon, cutting a huge volume and not really that satisfied. I could visualize this continuing forever, producing millions of board feet without a real point. I wanted to do something for myself," he said.
Gradually, he began to sell raw logs and then saw out fine lengths for keels and planking for schooners and cutters, yawls, dories and Chris Craft motor launches. For the last four years, he has concentrated solely on his business, New England Naval Timbers. Mr. Besozzi and his assistant, Alex Ware, a wood technology graduate of the University of Massachusetts, have since supplied major portions of the sterns, stems, gunwhales, planking and decking for numerous grand projects such as the United States Park Service's 104-foot reproduction of the Friendship, an 18th-century trading vessel out of Salem, Mass.; a 60-foot Maine schooner that will soon be transporting cargo to and from the Caribbean; and now the elaborate restoration of the 1885 schooner Coronet just beginning at the International Yacht Restoration School in Newport, R.I.
"He may be the only guy I've ever seen restrict his business to naval white oak timbers," said Clark Poston, program director at the Newport school, who noted that some good oak can be found in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. "He's finding really large old trees that a lot of common sawyers are not necessarily going to locate."
Mr. Besozzi spoke with love of the redolent timbers by his side. One piece was worth about $800, roughly three times more than its value at a mass production mill. Stacks of white oak trunks awaited his 50-foot band saw in a glen below Cornwall Village where he works.
"When you steam white oak, you can bend it like a noodle. Then when it dries, it just retempers itself and is as strong as ever. It has stringy, interlocking fibers that make it flex beautifully, which is just perfect for wooden boats, because they are flexing and living things."
But trees do not always reward the logger's affection. Mr. Besozzi himself had the middle three fingers on his left hand severed into stubs eight years ago by a log ripping chain. Chronic shoulder and arm tendinitis have also come with the job. In April, the highly experienced Winchester logger, Richard Hayes, was killed by a falling tree. Recently, another logger with a spinal injury had to be evacuated by helicopter from a nearby forest on Cornwall's Cream Hill.
"Logging is very dangerous," explained Douglas Emmerthal, who handles the state's certification and safety programs for the State Department of Environmental Protection. "The only occupation more so is commercial fishing."
Increased safety is another reason Duke Besozzi is delighted to be cutting only a fraction of the trees he once did. "Production logging wears you out. I am so much happier," he said, eyeing a massive trunk and seeing the shape of some ship to be.

HEADLINE: White Faces at the Blackboard

BYLINE: By REGINALD JOHNSON 

 BODY:
THREE years after the state announced a program to increase racial diversity in Connecticut schools, there has been little progress in achieving one of the key goals -- hiring more minority teachers.
The objective of hiring more black, Latino and Asian teachers came about as part of the state's response to the landmark Sheff v. O'Neill desegregation case of 1996 in which the State Supreme Court ruled that students in Hartford and suburban schools were racially isolated and were therefore being denied equal educational opportunity. 
 But four years after the court decision in the Sheff case, figures show there has been little change in a fact of life about Connecticut schools: white teachers do almost all the teaching. In the 1998-1999 school year, the latest year for which figures were available, 6.9 percent of all teachers in the state are minority, including blacks, Latinos, Asians and American Indians, up from 6.3 percent in the 1992-93 school year, according to the State Department of Education. Meanwhile, the number of minority students statewide has risen to 28.5 percent, up from 26.1 percent in 1992-93.
"I think it's a very serious problem," said State Representative Cameron Staples, a Democrat from New Haven and co-chairman of the Legislature's Education Committee. "Our supply of minority teachers has still not increased, and a number of us feel it is important to do that."
In cities like New Haven and Hartford, the percentage of minority teachers is much higher, 31 and 33 percent, respectively; in Bridgeport, it is 25 percent, based on data from the 1998-99 school year. In suburban school districts, the lack of minority instructors is striking -- in many towns, less than 2 percent of the total certified staff, which includes teachers, administrators and instructors, are minority. In Fairfield, for instance, the certified staff is 1.6 percent minority; in Suffield, outside of Hartford, the certified staff is 2.2 percent minority.
After the Sheff decision, Legislative leaders and Gov. John G. Rowland agreed on measures to improve the numbers. There would be increased magnet schools, charter schools, more interdistrict services and giving students in urban school districts the choice of going to a school in a suburban district, and vice versa.
The mandate also said that each district had to make an effort. School systems had to come up with a plan for hiring a more racially diverse work force, and the state said it would pay for regional recruitment services to help.
Today, school officials on the state and and local level said they are still trying hard to attract more minority teachers, but they insist that the process is difficult in a booming economy when many potential applicants are opting for better-paying jobs in other fields.
The progress in diversifying the teacher work force is alarming legislators and others, and the Legislature in the past session passed a bill setting up a special commission to study the issue of minority teacher hiring.
Civil rights leaders are also demanding that the state has to take a more aggressive role in dealing with the problem of minority teacher hiring.
Officials such as Roger Vann, president of the Connecticut N.A.A.C.P., said the state may have to consider some kind of financial rewards, such as signing bonuses, to recruit more minority applicants.
While Mr. Vann said he feels that most school officials around the state are making a genuine effort, some are not.
"There are some districts that have no interest in recruiting minority teachers, and local officials think it is offensive to suggest that there should be more diversity among teachers in the classroom," he said.
Mr. Vann said there have been complaints in Bridgeport and Waterbury about discrimination in hiring and a lack of support by white administrators for minorities. A parent in Westport -- where there's a handful of minority teachers -- filed a complaint with the State Labor Department this year charging that school officials weren't doing enough to create a more diverse teacher staff.
Many school districts said they want to hire minority teachers, but have difficulty finding candidates. Ralph Burke, superintendent for personnel at Fairfield Schools, said he's always looking for minority teachers. Fairfield advertises job openings in minority publications, lists jobs on a Web site and takes part in job fairs. But the results have been disappointing, he said. A recent job fair, put on by a number of school districts in the region, few minorities candidates attended.
"We had about 1,000 applicants show up, and you could count the number of minorities on two hands," Mr. Burke said.
The same goes for the number of minority students graduating with teaching degrees. Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven said of the 135 students who graduated with a bachelor's degree from the School of Education last year, 7 were minorities. Of the 195 students who received a master's degree, 5 were minorities.
Mr. Burke and other education officials said that minority college students, who might think about going into teaching, are sometimes drawn to corporations, which can offer a lot more money.
"An IBM or a Microsoft may knock at the door of a college student who's strong in math or science and say, 'We know you can start in teaching at $33,000 and have your summer off, but if you come with us, we'll start you at $55,000, you'll get four weeks off, and you'll be in six figures in four years.' I hear that's happening," said Tom Murphy, a spokesman for the State Department of Education.
Rodney A. Lane, dean of the School of Education at Southern Connecticut State, said there is a deeper problem.
"A lot have gone through urban school systems, so they have in their mind what their schools were like, where a whole lot of people didn't want to come," Dr. Lane said. "We've got to overcome a cultural and socioeconomic gap that is large and growing."
Maria Lyons, who until recently was the school personnel director for Bridgeport, said that the stronger economy, combined with a greater willingness of employers to hire people without regard to gender or race, means less women and minorities are going into teaching.
"When I was in school, women had certain roles," said Ms. Lyons, who is Puerto Rican. "You went into nursing, secretarial work or teaching. But now there's so many more options for young people and other careers that pay more than teaching."
Also hurting poorer school districts like Bridgeport sometimes is that they can't pay as well as some of the better-off communities. Bridgeport's starting teacher salary for someone with a bachelor's degree is $32,500, below nearby communities like Fairfield, or Norwalk, which pay $34,000 to start. "We have lost some people to other towns like Norwalk," said Marilyn Ondrasik, director of the Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition, which has worked on a teacher recruitment advisory committee in Bridgeport.
The percentage of minority teachers in Bridgeport, whose student population is 88 percent black, Latino and Asian, has actually dropped a bit from the early 1990's, from 26 percent to 25 percent.
Laura Williams, a teacher who is Puerto Rican, said she jumped from Bridgeport to Fairfield for better pay and benefits. Although she wouldn't say how much she is earning, she said she is making several thousand dollars more. She teaches Spanish and Latin American culture to fourth, fifth and sixth graders in Fairfield. She said she likes the job security that teaching offers.
"It's not very often that a public school is going to fold, but companies fold all the time," she said.
 There are some who say that money is not the only issue in Bridgeport's efforts to recruit minority teachers.
Gregory Bracey, who is black, is suing the Bridgeport Board of Education for discrimination, after he was turned down for a teaching job. Mr. Bracey, who has a master's degree in education from the University of Bridgeport and has taught in New Haven and Stamford schools, got a strong recommendation from a principal in the Bridgeport school where he gave a classroom demonstration as part of the hiring process. But he was not given a job and never given a reason. He said he found out later that it may have been because of his hair, which is in dreadlocks. "I had all the credentials for the job," he said. "I believe this was racism."
Ms. Lyons would not comment on the case since the matter is in litigation, but she denied that hairstyle would ever be a criterion for hiring.
Erik Brown, who is also black, said he got fed up and left Bridgeport for the New Haven school system in 1998 after he said he was harassed by supervisors. Even though he had previously been given high ratings for his teaching work in his first year at Bridgeport, everything changed his second year when he questioned a mixed evaluation given by his supervisor. After that, he said, supervisors came to his classroom every day to observe his work. Eventually, he complained to the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. Mr. Brown claimed there was an "old boy network" of white administrators in Bridgeport who were creating a hostile work environment for black teachers.
Nancy Geter, the chairwoman of the Bridgeport Board of Education, who is black, said she had seen "no direct evidence" of bias in city schools.
"I knew there were problems there, but I can't say that it was definitely discrimination," she said about the Brown case. "It was a matter probably of professional disagreements."
The issue of discrimination has also been brought up in Westport, where Joel Freedman, a parent, complained to the state about Westport's progress in hiring minority teachers. Mr. Freedman said he had urged the hiring of more minority teachers at a town forum last year on racial tolerance. The event was held after racist graffiti was found on school lockers.
Elliott Landon, the Westport Superintendent of Schools, said there was no basis to Mr. Freedman's charge. While he admitted that the school system had only about a half dozen minority teachers, his office was making an effort at hiring black, Latino and Asian teachers. Mr. Landon agreed with officials in other districts that the pool of minority candidates is limited. He added that even though Westport pays the relatively high amount of $38,000 to start, the steep cost of housing in lower Fairfield County deters many people from moving to the area to teach.
"I don't think we have anything to be ashamed of here," he said. "If anyone wants to come in and check to see what we've done, they can do so."
Ms. Geter said it is critical that schools, especially those with high populations of black and Latino students, have enough minority teachers. For the minority youngster, she said, "They serve as role models. They motivate you to succeed. It's very important to have a role model to aspire to."
Carolyn Nah, president of the Greater Bridgeport Chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., said said more minority teachers are needed because they bring a cultural sensitivity to the job that white teachers may not have, that allows them to handle students better in the sometimes difficult environment of inner-city schools. She said that while Bridgeport's 25 percent minority teacher profile may look good compared with the figures in the suburbs, it's still less than it should be.
"More minority teachers are needed to better reflect the racial composition of the students in the schools in Bridgeport," Ms. Nah said.
Mr. Staples of the Legislature's Education Committee said minority teachers were important for the majority, too.
"'It is vitally important to introduce students to people of different backgrounds," he said. "There is educational value to integrate people of different ethnic and cultural groups as part of a well-rounded educational experience."
Mr. Vann of the N.A.A.C.P. and others believe the state is going to have to lead the way if Connecticut is to increase teacher diversity. The problem comes at a time when there is a shortage of teachers in general, particularly on the secondary level.
Mr. Vann would like the new task force set up by the Legislature to look a number of possible solutions. First is to develop a coordinated, statewide plan to deal with the issue.
"The burden of dealing with this problem is too much for one district," he said.
Mr. Vann also said he thinks the state may have to consider offering financial incentives for people who want to teach in Connecticut, such as signing bonuses. (California is considering tax breaks for new teachers.) Another would be relaxing some of the stringent certification requirements for veteran teachers from out of state, who want to teach in Connecticut.
Mr. Staples said he agreed that the state has to get more involved financially to recruit teachers. He saidtwo ideas that the task force will look at are providing funding to forgive some student loans and mortgage assistance for minority teachers willing to locate in areas where the shortage of minority teachers is most acute.
Alma Maya of Bridgeport, who is the executive director of a community organization that offers programs to help Latino youth, added that new bilingual certification requirements and other rules also have to be reconsidered, because they are making it harder to recruit Latino teachers.
"I'm not against strong standards," Mr. Vann said. "But we have to look at all the additional hoops we have put into the process, and how they may mitigate against getting quality teachers here. We've lost people."

In Plainfield, Houses Will Rise on Foreclosed Lots

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE 400 vacant lots and abandoned buildings that pockmark the streets of Plainfield are a sign of the difficulties experienced by this Union County city. Hurt by the exodus of residents and businesses in the 1960's, it has been struggling back ever since.
Now the city is proceeding with a plan to rescue some of the 197 properties it has taken back or is taking back through foreclosure by designating a private developer to recycle 69 of them into 117 residences in 21 one-family and 48 two-family houses. New Century Homes of Westfield will develop the homes, which will be built in a factory in Scranton, Pa., and assembled on site. 
 Last month, development started on the first home, a two-family house at 675-77 West Front Street. It will be used as a model to market the rest of the homes, which will be built as they are sold, said Arthur Fefferman, a partner in New Century Homes with Peter Weissbrod, Stuart Fuchsman and Richard Goldberger.
Most of the lots, averaging 40 by 100 feet, are in the western part of the city, which suffered over the years from abandonment. The new two-story homes will blend with their neighbors in scale and price. The one-family houses will range from 1,366 to 1,489 square feet and sell for $129,900 to $139,900; the two-family homes will have 2,090 to 3,190 square feet and cost $169,900 to $179,900.
"This is a public-private effort to produce housing for and bring the middle class back to Plainfield," Mr. Fefferman said, noting that he and his partners hoped to build similar projects in other cities.
To keep the cost of the homes down, the city is selling the lots at a reasonable cost, he said. Also, market-rate mortgages with low down payments will be available to qualified buyers through several banks, including Fleet and Summit, Mr. Fefferman added. He said that Summit was providing construction financing for the $11 million project. The company also got a $500,000 grant from Union County.
The project, said Albert T. McWilliams, Plainfield's mayor, will return the lots to the tax rolls, as well as remove "eyesores from and improve the quality of life" in the neighborhood. The added hope, he said, is that it will encourage property owners to improve their buildings and other developers to invest in the city.
"Our dilemma is the rising cost of providing services in a city with a declining tax base," he said, adding that the way to close that gap was to raise taxes or bring in tax revenue. The sale of the lots is expected to generate $500,000 and their redevelopment to bring in $450,000 a year in tax revenue, said Patricia Ballard Fox, the deputy city administrator for economic development.
OF the remaining 128 lots, the developers are in talks with the city for 10 more lots for 10 more homes, as well as for a four-acre parcel to develop a building with up to 60 apartments. Ms. Ballard Fox said the city planned to sell some of the rest of the lots to nonprofit developers for housing and keep some for open space. Still others are zoned for commercial use and will be redeveloped for that. There are 234 more lots in various stages of foreclosure that if taken back by the city will be brought into the redevelopment plan, Ms. Ballard Fox said.
Mr. Fefferman said he was hopeful that his company would develop 300 residences in Plainfield. Ms. Ballard Fox added that "if the city works well with New Century Homes on the initial lots," it is likely that other sales would follow.
The current 69-lot phase is the first sizable housing development in Plainfield in almost 15 years. And as part of the larger plan to recycle city-owned lots, the project is the first of nine redevelopment efforts planned to infuse new economic life into the city.
Through the 1950's, Plainfield was the commercial hub of central New Jersey. In the 1960's, it, like other cities in the state, was hurt by racial riots, residential and business flight and crime. The city's redevelopment history, which focused mostly on reviving its downtown, also has been checkered, leaving it seeking new residential and commercial uses.
It is hoped that the nine redevelopment projects, which will produce 500,000 square feet of commercial space and at least 700 new and renovated homes by 2005, will change that.
"We want to set the stage for redevelopment before these economic boom times end," Ms. Ballard Fox said. Along with the New Century Homes development, the next two projects will be in the city's downtown and are expected to start by this fall, she said.
One is the redevelopment of a four-acre tract bounded by Park and Madison Avenues and Front and Second Streets. The site has been used as park for the last decade after several earlier attempts at its redevelopment never materialized.
The current plan is to fill the tract with a 130,000-square-foot, three-building office and retail complex, plus a garage for up to 320 cars. The state and county have agreed to lease much of the 80,000 square feet of office space in one of the buildings.
The other project will be the reuse of the 90,000-square-foot, five-story former Tepper's department store on West Front Street at the corner of Somerset Street, which has stood vacant since 1976. The proposal calls for transforming the building's upper floors into 80 apartments for the elderly, and its lower floors to 20,000 square feet of stores as well as 17,000 square feet of community space to be dedicated to the city.
Mayor McWilliams said he was confident this time around that the redevelopment projects would be realized. The difference, he said, is that "we have the support of the City Council and have dedicated an appropriate amount of staff resources to get the job done."
Discussions between the city and New Century Homes began in 1998. Mr. Goldberger, a partner in New Century, said while the city focused on redeveloping its retail base "this plan focuses on bringing in middle-class families who will become shoppers."
Mr. Fefferman added that the partners were drawn to Plainfield because "there was support from local officials and property values in the city were increasing."
Carl A. Reed, the owner of ERA Reed Real Estate Inc., a residential brokerage company in Plainfield, said the average sales price of comparable homes in the city ranged from $105,000 to $115,000. That represents a 10 to 15 percent rise over the last two years, said Mr. Reed, who is the project's leasing agent.
To make the numbers work, the city and New Century Homes hammered out a redevelopment agreement over the last two years. Under the agreement, which was signed in January, the city declared each of the 69 lots an area in need of redevelopment, allowing Plainfield to sell the lots to a private developer rather than selling them at auction. The parties then agreed to a sales price for the lots, which equals 5 percent of the sales price of the homes, to be paid to the city in two installments.
Home loans will be 30-year fixed market-rate mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent, Mr. Goldberger said. There will also be loans with no down payment requirements, he added.
Mr. Reed, the broker, said the monthly cost of owning one of the two-family homes would be close to what people would pay in rent. For example, buyers of a $170,000 two-family home, using a 30-year mortgage at 8.5 percent with 3 percent down, will have a monthly cost of $1,950, including mortgage payment and taxes.
That is expected to be offset by the rent from the three-bedroom second-floor rental apartment, he said, adding that three-bedroom rentals in the city cost $1,000 to $1,100 a month. The monthly cost of owning one of the single-family homes comes to $1,350, he said.
There will be three models for each of the one- and two-family houses, which are being built by Simplex Industries of Scranton. All of the homes, which are expected to be built and sold over the next year, will have a personal computer, Mr. Goldberger said.

Next Step at Former State Hospital: Law Offices

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP

 BODY:
AN eight-story brick building here on Carleton Avenue that once served as the medical and surgical building for the old Central Islip State Hospital is being converted into 175,000 square feet of office space by the Arlen Contracting Corporation of Garden City, which bought the property earlier this year from New York State.
The $12 million project, called the Courthouse Corporate Center, will add the office component to a master plan adopted in 1989 by the Town of Islip for the 788 acres along Carleton Avenue that were once occupied by the state hospital, a vast psychiatric center that at its peak in the mid-50's had as many as 10,000 patients. 
 The New York Institute of Technology has recycled 24 of the smaller hospital buildings for its Central Islip campus. State courts and offices, 800,000 square feet of industrial buildings, 487 town-house condominiums and 125 subsidized apartments for the elderly and a recently opened 6,000-seat baseball stadium, owned by Suffolk County and leased to the Long Island Ducks, have been built on the grounds of the old hospital.
A federal court and office building, designed by Richard Meier & Partners, working with the Spector Group of North Hills, is scheduled to open in August, and a 268,000-square-foot shopping center called Town Center is under construction by J. D. Carlisle Development of Manhattan and will be ready for occupancy early next year. Touro College in Manhattan is planning to start construction of a 167,000-square-foot building before the end of the year, to be completed in the fall of 2002. This will replace the college's law school, now in Huntington.
The Courthouse Corporate Center is within a few minutes' walk from the 495,000-square-foot John P. Cohalan Jr. Center, the state court complex, which opened in 1992, and from the almost-completed 822,000-square-foot federal building. It is expected to attract law firms and related businesses as well as high-technology companies.
Arlen Contracting bought the medical and surgical building on Feb. 9 for $2.2 million as part of a package that included 52 acres and 845,000 square feet of space in six buildings. In addition to the medical and surgical building, the other five buildings are the former hospital's power plant, laundry, a food distribution center and two administration buildings. All six buildings on the property were vacated about five years ago.
The property went to Arlen after it submitted the high bid to the state's Economic Development Corporation, which is selling off surplus state-owned psychiatric hospitals. This was the last piece of the Central Islip hospital property that was still state-owned. The hospital began discharging or transferring patients starting in the 1960's. Its only remaining presence in Central Islip is a small group home on nine acres fronting on Carleton Avenue. This is now part of the Arlen property, and Arlen is now leasing it back to the state. Its 25 residents will be transferred to the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood in about two years when a new group home is completed there.
BEFORE Arlen can convert any of its buildings, rezoning for each must first be approved by the Islip Town Board, and state environmental reviews must also be satisfied. Rezoning for the medical and surgical building, from education use to offices, was approved last week. The project still needs approvals for landscaping and parking plans. Arlen intends to submit separate rezoning applications for each of its other buildings, said Alvin Benjamin, the company's president.
Arlen has tentative plans for its other five buildings, Mr. Benjamin said: converting one of the 200,000-square-foot administration buildings into a nursing home or housing for the elderly; converting the 60,000-square-foot former power plant into a gymnasium and day-care center; using the 80,000-square-foot former laundry as an industrial and research-and-development site, and leasing the 130,000-square-foot former food distribution center for classrooms. The second 200,000-square-foot administration building directly behind the Courthouse Corporte Center will be demolished to provide parking for 700 cars. The nine acres surrounding the group home are being viewed by Arlen as a potential site for a 140-room hotel. Mr. Benjamin said Arlen would take four to five years to complete the redevelopment of the 52 acres.
Arlen has placed CB Richard Ellis, an international brokerage company with offices in Garden City, in charge of leasing the office space. Annual asking rents at the Courthouse Corporate Center are $20 a square foot. Utilities and taxes are expected to add about $4 a square foot to the rents.
Two leases, one for 2,500 square feet and one for 4,000 square feet, are already being negotiated with two law firms, said Raymond A. Ruiz, the vice president of CB Richard Ellis who is in charge of leasing at the courthouse center. Tenants can lease space as small as 1,500 square feet.
Asbestos removal and demolition of interior partitions have begun as a first step in creating three furnished model offices of 1,500 square feet to 4,000 square feet. The models are expected to be ready for showing within 45 days, said Russell A. Mohr, Arlen's director of sales and leasing, and the renovated building will be ready for occupancy "by the fourth quarter."
Strong interest in leasing has already come from law firms, abstract companies, court reporters and mortgage groups, Mr. Benjamin said. "Originally, the question was, 'Would there be enough demand?' " he said. "Now the question is, 'When will the building be ready for occupancy?' "
From a designer's point of view, the major challenge in converting the building from institutional to office use was changing "the image of the building," said Louis P. Giacalone, the partner in charge of the project at Ehasz Giacalone Architects in Farmingdale.
The brick facade is being left intact, but two metal-roofed penthouses, each 4,000 square feet in size, will be added to the eighth floor. New windows will be installed, and a porte-cochere will be added to the entrance facing Carleton Avenue. A rear lobby will lead to the parking lot. Both lobbies will have granite floors, and the front lobby will have skylights. The building will be equipped with high-speed data and telecommunications connections.
THE building, which is 68 feet wide and 273 feet long, lends itself easily to an office conversion, Mr. Giacalone said. The elevator core -- two banks of two elevators each, facing each other -- creates spacious lobbies on each floor, he said, and floors can be easily divided into individual offices suites that range in size from 1,500 square feet to 8,000 square feet.
A series of formal gardens will be created on one and a half acres of sloping land leading down to Carleton Avenue. They will be planted with flowering shrubs, seasonal flowers and trees indigenous to the area. Outdoor seating will be added. The landscape architect is William W. Johnson of Southold.
Tenants leasing space in the building will be able to benefit from its location within the Town of Islip's 1.7-square-mile Economic Development Zone, which covers portions of the former hospital property. Companies relocating to the zone get credits on their New York State taxes if they provide new jobs, and they receive a 40 percent discount on their energy costs, among other benefits, said William G. Mannix, Islip's director of economic development.
The turnaround at the former hospital site from largely vacant buildings to thriving commercial and residential hub began in 1982 when the New York Institute of Technology, whose main campus is in Old Westbury, responded to a proposal by Michael A. LoGrande, then the Town of Islip planning director and later town supervisor and Suffolk County executive, that the hospital property would make an ideal college campus. The college purchased 31 buildings and 564 of the 788 acres from New York State for $5.5 million. The Central Islip campus, now reduced to 175 acres because the college has sold off or donated part of its property, now has 1,000 students.
Most of the college-owned buildings are smaller two- and three-story structures. Arlen Contracting bought the larger hospital buildings, and its plan to turn the former medical and surgical building into offices has been welcomed by community leaders.
"We are very supportive of the office building because there was concern that some of these big buildings might be difficult to recycle," said Nancy Manfredonia, the executive director of the Central Islip Civic Council, a coalition of civic associations that has played an active role in the planning process at the hospital site. "This will be a very attractive facility in a very visible spot."
The fortunes of Central Islip, whose economy was heavily dependent on the hospital where many residents worked, declined as the psychiatric hospital began shutting down in the 1960's. Now with the opening of the baseball stadium, the presence of the county court complex, a 50,000-square-foot King Kullen and a 20-screen Loews movie theater as the anchor tenants at Town Center, and the soon-to-open federal building, "the community itself has awakened and become excited about what is going on here," Ms. Manfredonia said.
"We believe we are on the leading edge of what suburbia can be," she added. "People have the idea that suburbia is boring. Central Islip is definitely not boring. We're a very exciting town right now."

HEADLINE: The Republicans Are Coming, The Republicans Are Coming,;
For the State's Rank-and-File, It's Spit and Polish

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
KATHY ROACH practices her best handshake and smile in a simple exercise she and 25 other eager participants act out during an orientation session for the "Philadelphia Friends," a select corps of volunteers who have agreed to be on call 24 hours a day when Republicans converge on Philadelphia next month for its quadrennial national convention.
Ms. Roach, a longtime Ocean City resident who now lives in Philadelphia and a self-described "staunch Republican," sees the convention and her assignment as destiny. 
 "Everything I do, everything in my background has led me to this point," said the 41-year-old corporate legal assistant during a break at the Philadelphia Convention Center. "It gives me goose bumps just to think about it."
Clearly, she is not in need of a five-hour intensive Dale Carnegie training course on smiling and being a cheerful ambassador for the region, as many volunteers are.
In the meantime, across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge -- one of four spans over the Delaware River connecting the convention city with the Garden State -- a fresh layer of macadam has been laid across a large stretch of land between the New Jersey State Aquarium and the base of the bridge.
Over the next several weeks trees and flowers will be planted, grandstands and garden tables will be set up, and this expanse of waterfront -- until recently strewn with rubble from demolished RCA manufacturing plants -- will serve as the first official gathering site for the Republican delegates after they have arrived in the Delaware Valley. The welcoming event, a lighted boat parade followed by fireworks and a laser light show, will feature Governor Whitman as host.
Not every place revels at being a welcome mat. But when the governor started bulldozing liquor stores, strip clubs and hot pillow joints along the Admiral Wilson Boulevard here, that was precisely what she had in mind.
For months, New Jersey Republicans have been gearing up for their party's biggest event, being held in close proximity for the first time since 1948, when the Republicans -- as well as the Democrats -- came to Philadelphia. Then there was the Democratic Convention in 1964 in a badly deteriorated Atlantic City, which that city is still trying to live down.
From the governor to vice presidential hopefuls (which in this case, may be one and the same person) to future gubernatorial or Senate candidates, to Republican party leaders to local Republican clubs to South Jersey Girl Scouts, having the convention across the river is rich in potential.
Landing the convention's opening event was a major coup for the state, even if it was partly by default -- construction work along the Philadelphia waterfront is planned for this summer -- and largely designed to shine the spotlight back onto the City of Brotherly Love, since the waterfront here offers one of the best views of the city's skyline.
Still, New Jersey officials see it as a great chance to give the delegates an early glimpse at their state as well as provide an excellent platform for Governor Whitman, who remains among the handful of names being discussed for the vice presidential slot.
"The governor wants to be very active at the convention," said Rick Mroz, who recently stepped down as the governor's chief counsel and is her designee to the convention host committee. "If she's asked to give a speech, she'd be happy to. She has always believed very strongly in supporting the party, so no matter what the candidate asks of her, she'll be there."
Mr. Mroz added that while his boss had not engaged in the speculation about herself as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, "she has said if she is asked, she would love to do it." It would not be the first time Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Bush shared the stage at a Republican National Convention; at the 1996 gathering in San Diego, they were co-chairman and chairwoman.
In addition to the July 30 boat parade, Mrs. Whitman plans to conduct tours showcasing such economic development sites as state-financed housing projects in Atlantic City or the faith-based housing projects in Camden where New Jersey has gotten them grant money as well as play host of one other large event during convention week, Mr. Mroz said. She has had her eye on the Philadelphia Zoo, but this being one of the most popular venues, she might have to get in line.
Just behind Governor Whitman are other party leaders, many of whom have had their presence at the convention assured by virtue of their "at-large" delegate status. While each of New Jersey's 13 congressional districts elect 3 delegates and 3 alternates, another 15 at-large delegates (and their alternates) are chosen, the ranks of which are filled with names like State Senate President Don DiFrancesco, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and former Gov. Tom Kean.
Of course Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins, both of whom are expected to seek the office Mrs. Whitman will be vacating next year, will be looking at the convention as a place to raise their political profile.
Then there is the state Republican Party chairman, Chuck Haytaian of Hackettstown, who has his work cut out for him, not only trying to organize events where New Jersey party leaders can shine, but also making arrangements for the state's delegation.
Although the official delegation consists of 54 delegates and 54 alternates, Mr. Haytaian has requested 385 hotel rooms -- an increase of 100 rooms since the last convention in San Diego, when New Jersey showed up with the second-largest delegation. He said they needed that many rooms because of the large number of "honorary delegates" -- those who want to attend the convention but were not elected -- and requests from the media.
But while Mr. Haytaian may be able to arrange accommodations, getting everyone into the convention itself is another story. The 20,000-square-foot floor of Comcast-Spectacor's First Union Center will be largely dedicated to the convention's 2,066 delegates. Much of the remaining space in the sports arena, which holds 21,000 people for sporting events, will be taken up by the 2,066 alternates and 15,000 members of the media who have requested credentials. Each delegate and alternate gets one guest pass each day, which, by the time of the convention, will be the most sought-after tickets in town.
"People just want to go down there and get on the floor," said the harried state chairman. "That's great you want to do that, but it's not possible. We'll try to get as many people as possible in. It's very limited, and not easy, but since I'm on the badges and credentials committee, maybe we'll have a little easier time doing that this year."
Then there are the volunteers, who have almost no chance of getting on the convention floor but are signing up in droves nonetheless. Allison Grove, director of community outreach for Philadelphia 2000, has already lined up close to 12,000 volunteers, whose jobs will range from checking credentials to greeting people at the airport to manning booths at PoliticalFest, a public fair with politically themed exhibitions that will run during the convention.
Ms. Grove estimates 20 percent of those volunteers are from New Jersey, making it the second-largest feeder state after Pennsylvania. She cited two South Jersey Republicans clubs as among the earliest and most enthusiastic about getting involved.
After having Ms. Grove as a luncheon guest with club members last December, the Burlington County Republican Women's Club has processed 500 volunteer applications, said the club's president, Rosemary Nichols.
And the Cinnaminson Republican Club had so many people eager sign up that the Republican municipal chairman, Richard Stroebel, decided to register the club as a corporate team, giving club members shuttle transportation to various volunteer posts, plus on-site training. Dale Carnegie is providing training for all volunteers, focusing on customer service skills and team building, as well as providing a crash course on Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.
"We want to make sure people are confident in their ability to act as ambassadors of the region, said Angela Brown of Erial, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia 2000. "They'll be told things like, never say 'I don't know' when asked a question and always smile -- things like that."
In addition to organizing his own club's participation, Mr. Stroebel has signed on to be one of the estimated 100 "Philadelphia Friends." He is taking two weeks off from his law practice to serve as tour guide, advisor and Philadelphia ambassador to the members of whichever state delegation he is assigned.
"It's so close, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said the 36-year-old lawyer, who got his start in politics as the head of the college Republicans at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. "I was born and raised here. I know a lot about the area and I can help make us look real good. I can help the party this year too."
Although he has worked as an assistant counsel to Governor Kean and chief counsel for the Burlington County Board of Social Services, Mr. Stroebel is realistic enough to know he and he fellow club members may not be connected enough to get on the convention floor.
"From the beginning I was told that the reason for getting involved is to have a lot of fun," he said. "I tell everyone who asks about volunteering that no matter what they're assigned, they'll get a good taste of what a convention is all about."
About 60 cadette and senior Girl Scouts from Camden County will join Philadelphia girls later this month to begin cleaning up parks and helping make Philadelphia shine. During the week of the convention, they will also be on hand to greet visitors coming to Philadelphia. For their efforts, they will receive an "election connection" patch to add to their sashes, and a sense of being part of history.
"As Girl Scouts, we wouldn't ever endorse one political party over another," said Rona Whitehead, membership director for the Girl Scouts of Camden County. "This way we can get involved, and support Philadelphia and the election process without getting too political about it. How often are we ever going to have a convention in a neighboring city? It's a great learning experience."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS: FOR JOSEPH E. BACHELDER III;
Engineer of the Executive Pay Express

BYLINE: By STEWART KAMPEL

 BODY:
AS shareholders gather for annual meetings, many are finding in their proxy statements further evidence that executive pay continues to soar. Even severance packages for top executives can mount into the millions, or tens of millions. As a leading executive compensation negotiator, Joseph E. Bachelder III, head of a Manhattan law firm that bears his name, may deserve a share of the credit, or the blame.
Mr. Bachelder has negotiated employment contracts for Louis V. Gerstner Jr. at RJR Nabisco and I.B.M.; Lawrence A. Bossidy, the former chairman at AlliedSignal; and George M. C. Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak. He has also negotiated the severance package for David A. Coulter, who left as president of BankAmerica in 1998. For James Dimon, he negotiated both his severance from Citigroup and his pay as chief executive of Bank One. 
 Mr. Bachelder agreed recently to discuss whether he was doing too good a job. Following are excerpts from the conversation. STEWART KAMPEL
 
Q. What justifies these enormous pay packages?
 
A. Actually, they haven't gone up so dramatically. Over the last 50 years, the salary packages of C.E.O.'s have grown at a rate of about 2 percent over the Consumer Price Index, and in the 1950's and 60's the growth was actually lower than workers' pay rises.
Bonuses, however, are up dramatically. And so are stock options, as part of pay packages. Over all, major U.S. corporations are doing very well. Equity has gone up over 10 times since the 80's and 90's, largely because of the dramatic growth in the markets. And shareholders have benefited greatly. That's wonderful.
The U.S. economy has been growing, and the C.E.O.'s are the chief custodians for extraordinarily growing basic assets. This has been an extraordinary period, but it was just like at the turn of the last century. Just look at all those big houses in Newport.
What has also fueled the rise is momentum. There is a very competitive market for top executives. Executive search firms hardly existed years ago. Now they're so big that some have even gone public. That created a dynamic that didn't exist. So the corporation reflects the general prosperity of many companies.
 
Q. If the value of a company's stock drops, should executives with large contracts give something back?
 
A. What is compensation? It's pay for services over the long term and the short term. If I worked for 10 years and the company had 2 bad years, how should we look at it? The C.E.O. was responsible for the enormous wealth and growth of the company as well as the opportunity everyone had to ride with its good fortune. Except for a Michael Jordan, who never had one, C.E.O.'s can have a bad year. They do get fired. Some may "retire" at a young age, but a significant number are really being fired.
 
Q. Many chief executives are getting lavish perquisites like the personal use of company planes, country club memberships, a car and driver and services like secretarial help even after they leave or retire. Are you doing your job too well?
 
A. I would attribute these unusual perks to unusual circumstances. First, extraordinary C.E.O.'s win special arrangements. Second, precedent is very important. Then those precedents become the standard. Say Charlie Snoggs wants the same perks as Jack Welch. So he becomes a competitor. He's competing for profits. And he wants a competitive salary, pension and bonus.

 Q. Your experience is mostly with old-economy companies. What should an executive of one of these businesses focus on: wages, perks or stock options? And what should an executive look for in a new-economy firm?
 
A. For an old-economy firm, pensions are very important. C.E.O.'s move so frequently today that they don't build up pensions. So it's important to have the company ensure your pension. And it's vital to have it funded.
At new-economy companies, one strategy is to purchase stock with a promissory note, which qualifies for long-term capital gains, and then have the note forgiven. Stock options will allow you to buy when the company is private and to cash in when it goes public.
 
Q. More generally, how can an executive get the best deal?
 
A. Don't exaggerate or misrepresent your salary. You'll be found out. If you're going to work for a new company, look at their proxy statements, see what they are paying their top people. Examine the form and nature of payment. Try to get credit for your service at your present company.
What happens if there is a change in control of the company? Be protected.
Check the proxy statement to see the range of bonuses that senior executives can expect. And don't quit Company A till you get what you what you want at Company B -- in writing.

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Claims on Property Reclaimed by Nature

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: SOUTH ORANGE

 BODY:
Set atop a hill in the exclusive Newstead section, overlooking this township's quaint downtown and much of Essex County and New York City beyond, is a 30-acre quarry that resembles a vast, overgrown crater stretching a quarter-mile across. Jagged man-made cliffs rise about 60 feet above a small stream that feeds a shallow pond.
Deer, chipmunks and other wildlife dart in and out of the bushes and trees that seem to sprout from the rock itself, and hawks soar on the updrafts of the quarry's miniature palisades, level with the back windows of the houses perched on the quarry's perimeter. 
 "I hear owls at night, I've seen foxes," said Joel Levin, who lives across Underhill Road from the quarry.
But now 198 housing units are proposed for this area occupied by the abandoned rock quarry, which has been largely reclaimed by nature to form an extraordinary landscape set in the middle of this densely populated suburb.
As surreal as this setting may be, opposition to the development -- in the form of the 150-member Coalition to Preserve South Orange is relatively prosaic: traffic would be a nightmare; runoff would be ruinous; the schools would get even more crowded. Nor would Canadian geese stop off here on their seasonal migrations.
The coalition and its allies want to preserve the quarry as one of the few vestiges of open space in South Orange, a racially and economically diverse township of 16,000 residents whose income levels seem to rise with the topography, from the cracked sidewalks near the Newark border to the manicured lawns surrounding the spacious homes in Newstead.
In making their case, however, members of the coalition decline to mention the neighboring South Mountain Reservation recreation area, which stretches across five towns in Essex County and includes 2,040 acres of parkland.
Moreover, the quarry is private property, and is zoned for housing. It was also involved in a 1993 court settlement to satisfy the township's affordable housing requirement. In a proposed deal stemming from the court settlement, John Gross, the township administrator, said the quarry developer would provide $100,000 to rehabilitate housing in South Orange, and another $480,000 to finance what is known as a regional contribution agreement in which the City of Orange would create 40 units of affordable housing.
The owner of the disputed property is Gerald Turco, a developer based in Lyndhurst whose family bought the quarry in 1979 with the intent to develop the site. But plans to develop the property were put off after the death of Mr. Turco's mother and then the collapse of the housing market. Consequently, the family continued to operate the quarry until 1989, Mr. Turko said, noting that the gravel used for most of the Continental Airlines Arena parking lot came from there.
Mr. Turco is now under contract to sell the site, for an undisclosed sum, to Trammel Crow Residential, a large developer based in Rockville, Md., contingent on Trammel Crow's receiving site plan approval from the South Orange Planning Board. But Mr. Turco, 43, who grew up in Nutley, said he was still open to other offers, including a deal to preserve the site as open space.
"Nobody approached me with any figures," he said. "If I get something in my hand I'll respond to it."
Mr. Turco laughed as he recounted that some of the same people opposing the housing development had fought to shut down the quarry operation. "I can't win," he said.
For his part, Mr. Levin of the prservation group said that as open space -- perhaps with the addition of walkways -- the quarry property would be accessible to everyone, whereas housing would merely demand additional police, fire and other township services. In addition, said the 54-year-old neighborhood activist, more housing would mean more children and place a greater demand on the school system, resulting in higher taxes.
In November, residents voted to tax themselves a total of about $100,000 a year for the purpose of acquiring and preserving open space, joining 116 other municipalities and 17 counties in New Jersey that have adopted similar local levies. Proponents say the open space revenue, combined with matching funds from Essex County and the state's new Garden State Preservation Trust created by Governor Whitman and the Legislature, are obvious sources of money to buy the property, estimated to be worth about $5 million.
But the quarry, which is peppered with no-tresspassing signs, also presents some problems as publicly owned open space. Its cliffs and rocky terrain are hazardous, and some clean-up work is needed. Two aging yellow earth movers are parked outside a big metal maintenance shed near the quarry's locked gate. The rusted hulks of a felled crane and a dump truck containing corroded 40-gallon drums litter the middle of the quarry, where the ground is blackened and smells of fuel oil.
"A big hole like that is certainly going to be a nuisance, because some day somebody is going to get hurt in there," said William Calabrese, president of the South Orange Board of Trustees, the township's ruling body. Mr. Calabrese's house on Hoskier Road looks out over the quarry, and he has abstained from voting on any board decisions concerning the site.
Mr. Calabrese said he liked the open space behind his house, but his comments did seem to reflect what coalition members said was a lack of official enthusiasm for preserving the quarry site.
"If somebody invests $5 million in a property, they have the right to develop it, or at least get their money out of it," Mr. Calabrese said. Preservation of the quarry also faces potentially competing efforts, including plans for a $10 million arts center downtown.
Nonetheless, in March the township applied for $6.6 million in state open space money but did not specify what it might be used for.
Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, who has visited the quarry, said it would provide not only badly needed open space, but a fascinating example of the resilience of nature.
"People forget, if you leave nature alone it will start healing itself," Mr. Tittel said. "Trees are growing, wetlands are forming. It shows all the values of a good piece of open space. The other part is, this is what the community would like to see. They voted to tax themselves to buy this property. That was part of the whole campaign."
So far, Trammel Crow has not submitted a site plan application, said the township's lawyer, Edwin R. Matthews, adding that in two informal meetings with local officials in March and April, company representatives outlined a concept involving 198 housing units around a loop road. They would include 58 single-family houses of varying size, 80 town houses and 60 apartments. Six large houses would be for sale, and the rest of the units would be rental properties ranging from $1,800 to $3,000 a month, Mr. Matthews said.
Jonathan Epstein, a lawyer for Trammel Crow, declined to discuss details of the project.
"The plan is evolving," Mr. Epstein said.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
For Some, Prep School Follows High School

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
Brian Lyons finds himself in an enviable position. On Friday, Brian will graduate from Hamilton High School West, outside of Trenton, second in his class.
The 17-year-old straight-A student scored 1570 out of a possible 1600 on his College Boards and he has been accepted at some of the country's top universities. But he won't be going to any of them in September. 
 In what is a longstanding but little-known phenomenon, a relatively small number of students -- usually boys -- choose to undertake a year of additional study at an exclusive prep school, including those in New Jersey, before heading off to college.
In Brian's case, he will attend the Lawrenceville School in the fall, where he will be one of a group of students who want to polish their academic or athletic resumes. Each year, schools like the Peddie School and the Hun School of Princeton as well as Lawrenceville take on from 6 to 25 postgraduate students. As good as the students may be, many come to improve their chances of getting into a better school. In addition, students headed to military academies, foreign students wanting to improve their English and others who simply need another year to mature make up some of this group.
"People take the postgraduate year for a number of reasons," said Ian Gracey, associate dean of admissions at the Lawrenceville School. "Often, they feel that they aren't ready for the rigors of college life, and they want a year to mature. It does a world of good for most people. My younger brother did a postgraduate year and he just blossomed."
The programs are not usually advertised or pushed by guidance offices, so many students hear about them through word of mouth. Most will live on the campus and, while about 30 percent receive financial aid, the year will be as costly as college with tuition and board -- about $25,000.
Mr. Gracey said that the Lawrenceville School usually got 90 applications each year from students seeking to do postgraduate work, of which it accepts about 25.
"We look for someone with a great sense of initiative, and we like to see them adding something to the community in arts, athletics or having students from around the world," Mr. Gracey said.
The median combined College Board scores are over 1220, he said.
Marty Mooney, associate director of college counseling at the Peddie School in Hightstown, which takes from 15 to 20 such students each year, said these programs were not for students "who bombed out in high school."
"You look for a spark in these kids," Mr. Mooney said. "This is a nice steppingstone for them."
But it's not an easy step. Mr. Mooney said that most students were shocked by the rigorous academic demands and campus regulations. At Peddie, students have a required study time from 8 to 10 p.m. every weeknight. If they are going out on weekends, they must sign out and go where they said they were going. Smoking is taboo, and students are expected to participate in community service projects.
Drew Biemer, 19, of Haddonfield just completed his postgraduate year at the Peddie School and plans to attend the University of Richmond, where he will play football.
Drew said that when his parents first suggested the year at Peddie, he balked. Now he's glad he put in the time.
"It did a lot of good for me," he said. "At times it drove me crazy, but the end definitely justified the means."
Mr. Biemer said he also felt that the school's diverse student body broadened him socially. "I feel more attached to some of these people than the people I knew in high school," he said. "It's a lot more of a melting pot."
For students from middle- and upper-middle-class suburban districts, the postgraduate year often proves to be a time to live in close quarters with students from totally different cultural and economic backgrounds. Last year, Mr. Mooney said, an athlete from Cranbury was rooming with a very academically oriented student from Thailand who always stood up when he studied, and it was a learning experience for both of them.
"Lots of times this was the first time they've lived and worked with kids of such multicultural backgrounds," Mr. Mooney said.
Dr. James Byer, headmaster of the Hun School of Princeton, which takes 6 to 12 postgraduate students each year, noted that the schools also gained by the presence of the postgraduates.
"We expect them to be leaders," Dr. Byer said. "They add a degree of leadership that enhances the school environment."
For Michael Chiusano of Medford, who attended Shawnee, a large regional public high school, his year at Lawrenceville meant admission to Princeton University in 1999, where he is playing football.
"I always wanted to go to Princeton, and I got rejected and I wasn't happy about that," Michael said. "I was young and would have been 17 starting college. It was the greatest year of my life so far, and it prepared me for Princeton."
While the year helps some students get into Ivy League schools, they should not assume that they are buying an automatic ticket to admission. Harvard University, for instance, gets applications from 2 to 20 candidates a year who are completing a postgraduate term.
"A good year is a help and better is always better," said Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions for Harvard College, but it is by no means a guarantee into a school where fewer than 11 percent of the applicants are accepted. "Every case is different, and there's no formula for this."
Still, Mrs. McGrath Lewis said she has never met a student who regretted taking the extra year, even if he did not get accepted by his first choice for college. "I've never heard people say it was a mistake," she said.
Daria Guelig, 16, who recently graduated from Wellsboro High School in a rural area of north-central Pennsylvania, was accepted by William and Mary College, but she has decided to spend next year at Lawrenceville.
"I thought I wouldn't really be prepared for college right away," Daria said. "I think I could handle college, but Lawrenceville will be a good way to really prepare me. When I went there, I just fell in love with it."
As for Brian Lyons from Hamilton High, he realizes that a lot of people do not understand why he is going to Lawrenceville this fall even though he was accepted by seven colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins and Cornell. But the 6-feet-2-inch, 235-pound lineman said his dream was to play varsity football for Harvard, Princeton or Cornell. He hopes to add 20 pounds to his frame and show an excellent academic record.
"I'm young, so a year of maturing would be good," he said.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATIRON -- BUZZ;
At a Dot-Com Mixer, Ideas And Money Seek Partners

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- First Tuesday, a dot-com mixer held monthly in scores of cities around the globe, arrived last week in New York, which one organizer called "the dot-com center of the world." Despite the dripping rain, about 600 prescreened participants crammed into Ohm, a restaurant-cum-nightclub at 16 West 22nd Street, in the heart of Silicon Alley.
At a registration desk up front, a dozen helping hands issued laminated name badges with color-coded stickers: red for venture capitalists, green for entrepreneurs and yellow for everyone else, including service providers, lawyers and hangers-on. The basic idea is to allow people with ideas (green) to identify people with money (red). Farther inside, past endless trays of hors d'oeuvres, attendees lingered under a mirrored disco ball, swapping business cards, talking shop and hunting for untapped e-commerce fortunes. 
 THE BUZZ -- "New York is a big step for us," said Julie Meyer, 33, who founded First Tuesday with several friends two years ago in a London bar. "People are operating at a higher clock speed here."
Allison Britz, an associate with Easton Hunt Capital Partners, a $100 million investment fund, said, "It reminds me of a singles party."
Even so, not all of the matchmaking was easy. "I'm making more effort than I thought I had to," Ms. Britz said, proudly displaying her red sticker. "I thought I could stand here and people would come."
Michael A. Porges, a partner with Andersen Consulting, one of the evening's corporate hosts, was unapologetic about the stratified glad-handing. "This is the 21st century way of networking," he said, standing next to a television set tuned to CNBC. "It's part social, part business."
John Marchant, chief executive of Business360.com, was equally upfront. "I'm talking to people so I can get money," he said. "We're looking for first-round investment."
Much of the conversation centered on "ultrahigh net worth individuals" or "angels," financial backers with more than $1 million to offer.
But there was also the usual rivalry of the new economy. "Everything is off the record," said Elie Poltorak, an entrepreneur with a cigar hanging from his lip. "I don't want my competitors to learn about my idea."
First Tuesday organizers said their events, held on the first Tuesday of each month, have garnered more than $100 million in seed capital throughout Europe and South America.
As the three-hour marathon ended, it was unclear whether any big deals had been struck. But Douglas Grieco, owner of a startup branding company, Take, left hopeful.
"I finally made a good connection," he said, heading back to the office with a fresh stack of business cards. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: NOTICED;
Dressing Up Mini-Me

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA 

 BODY:
ANNABELLA CACIOPPO is a creature of fashion. She wears bonnets and rustling silk onesies, spoons her Pablum from a vintage silver porringer and exudes the soapy fragrance of Bulgari Petite Maman. She is trundled down Madison Avenue in a Silver Cross, the Rolls-Royce of English perambulators.
Her mother, Jennifer Cacioppo, a freelance publicist for Ralph Lauren, can't do enough for her 7-month-old. "I bring her to the swings each day in her dressy outfits," she acknowledged cheerfully. "It's a thing of pride. You wash your car, you polish up your baby." 
 Six-month-old Tate Dubilier, another high-maintenance baby, lets his mother, Minnie Dubilier, buff and shine him like a pair of Prada boots. A former accessories editor at Vogue, Ms. Dubilier, who is married to an investment banker and lives in Greenwich, Conn., says she spends about $2,000 a season decking her son out in rompers and smocks and other traditional togs. "My husband complains, 'You dress him like a girl in all these little bubble outfits,' " she reported unconcernedly. "But my theory is, I'm going to dress him how I want to dress him until he has an opinion."
Like other new mothers in styleland -- a breed that includes Aerin Lauder Zinterhoffer of the Estee Lauder cosmetics empire; Cindy Crawford; Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designer; and Kate Betts, Harper's Bazaar's editor in chief -- Ms. Dubilier might be expected to turn her infant into a doll-size fashion statement.
What is surprising is that many of her contemporaries from all walks of life have lately followed suit. Women, enamored of fashion but without access to personal stylists or inflated wardrobe budgets, insist just the same on dressing their newborns like modern infantas or, likelier still, Lilliputian versions of themselves.
In the last year or two, the lust for chic luxurious infant wear has spawned a boom in designer bibs and booties, toys and toiletries, home furnishings and, in particular, fashions.
In the late 1980's, when Gay Empson went to work as the fashion editor of Child magazine, "infants wore pink and blue, and there it ended," she recalled, adding, "Now, there is such an explosion of everything."
What began with a trickle of posh merchandise from shops like Bon Point and Jacadi on Madison Avenue, has become a deluge, flooding upscale stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue and filtering into the mass market as well. In the last few months, upscale designers began offering layette, a wardrobe for first year babies. Now, new moms of means can stock up on DKNY cashmere cardigans ($60), Baby Dior jumpers ($165), Ralph Lauren velvet frocks ($110), Tommy Hilfiger khakis ($26), Jay Kos cashmere dresses ($395) and booties emblazoned with Gucci double-G's ($145).
More rarefied types can also choose from sumptuous knits designed by Stella Tennant, the patrician English model. Princess Marie Chantal of Greece says she plans to come out with a layette collection.
Or they can buy from the Gap. The chain, which pioneered the concept of adult fashions scaled to infant proportions and then added a luxury baby line in a handful of stores, now sells cashmere twin sets and receiving blankets in all of its Baby Gap outlets.
The appetite for high-style, high-end baby wares is partly the outgrowth of a vibrant economy. "People have more disposable income, and they want to represent their wealth in full," from the baby on up, said Evan Tawil of Tawil Associates, which manufactures Baby Dior, a licensee of Christian Dior in Paris.
Last year, consumers spent $7.9 billion on infant and toddler apparel, up from $7.1 billion the previous year, according to the NPD Group, which tracks spending in the apparel industry.
The increase reflects the tastes not just of affluent consumers, but of middle income mothers. Women at all income levels have become increasingly style-conscious, thanks to the influence of marketers and the fashion media, said Tracy Mitchell, the editor of Children's Business, an industry monthly.
"Naturally, they want their children to express that," she said. "Even at the discount level, there is a sense that merchants are catering to consumers' increasing fashion awareness. Everyone wants something special for their money."
Often that something is a scaled-down version of what the mother might wear. "If she looks good in capris, she will probably reason that her baby will look just as good in a small-scale version of the same thing," Ms. Empson said.
And buy accordingly, it seems. Baby capris, featured for summer at Target, sold out well in advance of the season. The store is currently stocking tiny denim jackets and drawstring mini skirts, and chambray jumpsuits for boys.
Macy's, which recently expanded its infant and layette department to accommodate an infusion of sportswear by Nautica, Guess, Polo and Tommy Hilfiger, also sells racer-back swimsuits and terry cloth robes scaled to an infant's proportions.
E-commerce sites have pounced on the trend. Babystyle.com, a favorite site, recently weighed in with DKNY onesies in denim blue and thistle, and a snakeskin diaper bag, the latter a recommendation from Cindy Crawford, a Babystyle columnist. Online or off, some of the most-coveted goods carry a whiff of nostalgia. At Best & Company, a new incarnation for children of the classic store and which opened recently in Greenwich, Conn., Susie Hilfiger, a co-owner (she is married to Tommy Hilfiger), sells traditional English garden dresses by Anthea More Ede, alongside hand-knit booties, antique bibs and handpainted garden furniture by the socialite C. Z. Guest.
Saks, too, has tapped its heritage, reintroducing a baby staple of the 1950's and 60's, a white beribboned bassinet filled with an infant's first-year wardrobe. Priced from $150 to over $10,000 (for a basket including a $1,000 christening dress), some 1,000 of the baskets were sold within two weeks of their arrival on the sales floor.
White wicker baskets, seersucker bibs and sailor middies conjure a world so sugary and fey you expect Mary Poppins to come drifting into its midst. Which is fine with Lillian Wang von Stauffenberg, a publicist for Verdura, the purveyor of fine jewelry, who likes to dress her 9-month-old son, Sebastian, in traditional blazers and Gap pocket T's. Abigail Daley, a Greenwich homemaker, shares Ms. von Stauffenberg's penchant for the conservative baby styles of the postwar years, insisting that her three sons, who range in age from 2 weeks to 3 years, all wear tailored shorts.
"Babies are so fair and sweet -- they belong in old-fashioned clothes," she said.
Consumers' current love affair with nostalgic products and packaging extends to toiletries, as well. One of the most popular infant items at Sephora and at Zitomer Pharmacy, the upscale destination on Madison Avenue, is Bubbe's Special Cream for Special Tushies, sold in a gingham-patterned tube on whose label a Gerber baby look-alike grins.
Such items are a hit with moms who groom their offspring to compete with the British royal family or, better yet, with the celebrity tykes exhibited in the pages of In Style. "There's a heightened level of rivalry when it comes to dressing your baby," observed Jill Sorkin, the buyer of infant and toddler styles at Bergdorf Goodman. "It's who has got the best, who has got the newest, and it's coming not just from the grandparents, as you might expect, but from the parents themselves."
At the Monogram Shop in East Hampton, N.Y., where the Lauder family buys its infant wear, Hadley Smith, a part owner, has seen it all. "If your are tracking down the jacket Aerin Lauder Zinterhoffer's child is wearing," she said huffily, "you are obsessive and you have a problem."
Noting that she had seen more than her share of overstyled, overgroomed infants on Manhattan's streets, Nancy Tuckerman, a co-author of "The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette" (Doubleday, 1999), chided: "It's really a sad commentary when people are dressing their children up to make themselves feel more important. It sounds like the parents are very insecure."
Or simply style-besotted. There might not be much sense in spending $400 for a cashmere dress likely to be soiled or outgrown after just one wearing. But since when did sense have anything to do with fashion? "You know that if you walk around Manhattan in your Manolo pumps, the heels will get stuck in a grate," Ms. Sorkin of Bergdorf Goodman said. "But you wear them anyway."
The same law applies, for many, to dressing your tot. So what if she drooled on her designer denims? "At least you know," Ms. Sorkin said, "that she looked good while she wore them."

HEADLINE: CAREER ARC;
At Midcareer, Unlikely Segues Into Dot-Commerce

BYLINE: By AMY ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
IF you called Central Casting looking for some dot-com-founder types, they wouldn't send you these people: the head of a quasi-governmental agency, a college professor who founded a nonprofit group, an industrial quality maven -- all past 40 and
well established on traditional career paths.
Yet each of them has taken a sharp turn into territory that the popular imagination reserves for 20-something nerds in sneakers and pizza-stained shirts. 
 Or maybe it's not so sharp a turn. What Sergio Mazza, Mary Furlong and James Harrington have in common are a knack for synthesis and an open mind about packaging their knowledge and experience in new ways -- characteristics that may matter more as prerequisites for new-economy success than technical wizardry or tolerance of 100-hour workweeks. Each started a Web-based business that extends and amplifies what he or she had been doing before.
They also have in common an entrepreneurial itch, of course, and they share hopes of big profits online. But world-conquering riches do not seem to be the main point.
"I'm more of an entrepreneur at heart," said Mr. Mazza, 41. "I like to make things happen." His previous incarnation was as chief executive of one of the most nuts-and-bolts organizations in the old economy, the American National Standards Institute, which represents the United States in world forums that set technical standards for a wide array of products and processes.
Impatient with the glacial pace of the regulatory arena, he left the institute last winter to invest in and advise two Internet start-ups: Revbox.com, which offers consumers service contracts on big-ticket Internet purchases and helps keep track of warranties and arrange service, and WorldWideTesting.com, an industrial marketplace that matches business customers with testing and certification laboratories. Both ideas grew out of his time at the institute, which highlighted the importance of assuring product quality in a global marketplace.
"I've returned to the for-profit world because I wanted growth and opportunity," said Mr. Mazza, who was president of the computer supplies division at Memorex before joining the institute.
He said he did not choose Internet commerce for its own sake. "I'm interested in changing the way commerce takes place, particularly changing the speed, breadth and accuracy of information that is delivered," he said, adding that the Web is just "a convenient tool."
RAISING start-up capital was a struggle for Mr. Mazza, but he also found he had to wrestle with a bit of a generation gap. Being "born old," as he described himself, sometimes made it difficult for him to work with fresh-faced youngsters in the dot-com world "who don't have a clue about running a business." The challenge, he said, is to help the two start-ups make the most of his experience while "working on not being condescending."
For his own part, he often reminds himself, however swept up he may be in entrepreneurial fervor, to pass up "good business ideas that involve bad people."
Instead, Mr. Mazza said, he is content with his current partners and keeps his focus on nurturing the two fledgling companies "until I'm certain they're successful."
"Maybe at 51 I won't like it so much," he said, "but I'm happy where I am right now."
MRS. FURLONG, the professor, gravitated to the Web as a kind of global classroom -- "a place to be empowered, and to learn and create as we get older."
Throughout her career she has made a habit of spinning off her three decades of academic experience into new ventures. In the mid-1980's she took a leave as an education professor at the University of San Francisco, where she taught teachers how to cope with new technology, and started a nonprofit organization called SeniorNet to do the same thing for elderly people.
Four years ago, watching the evolution of the Internet and "realizing the boomer generation would be quite different" from the seniors she had been working with, she founded ThirdAge Media, whose Web site, www.thirdage.com, aspires to be an online community and shopping site for first-wave baby boomers like her.
Mrs. Furlong, 51, says her teaching experience is central to her business. "I've learned to take in the hearts, minds and souls of my customers and make a plan for them to grow, just as I did for my students," she explained. Still, she said, she had to swallow hard and summon her tenacity and courage to make the leap from the security of academia to the risks of a new company. "I had to let my hair down," she said. "I had to learn new skills and make changes. Most of all, I couldn't fail.
"My father was an entrepreneur, so I've always been interested in taking an idea and bringing it to an international level," she said. "I want the business to be successful, to get a return for our team and shareholders, but I also want to make a difference in the world."
NOW in his mid-60's, Mr. Harrington is further still from the prototypical dot-com demographic, and he occasionally feels the tug to go fishing with his many retired friends. But he finds that tackling new challenges and learning new skills keeps him young. "There's always something interesting that I want to do that I haven't done yet," he said. "There's a continuous need to accomplish."
He spent most of a long career in quality management at I.B.M., where he worked for 30 years. He had the makings of a Big Blue lifer: as a boy of 12, his first job was setting pins at the company bowling alley.
But two years as the volunteer chairman and president of a professional group, the American Society for Quality, showed him wider possibilities. He left I.B.M. and remade himself as a consultant on quality management and business processes. As a consulting principal at Ernst & Young, he developed software related to his work, and software took him to the Web.
"Technology is changing so fast, it's opening a whole new world of business," Mr. Harrington said. "The excitement of being tapped into this new world is invigorating." Today he is tapped into three technology companies: he is chief operating officer of Systemcorp, which makes business process software; chairman of TQnet, an online quality-services provider; and chairman of Performance Improvement Network, a global group of consultants and information-technology service providers. The only link among the three companies is Mr. Harrington and his drive and energy.
This latest career turn required "some reassessment of my priorities and beliefs," he said, "For years I found myself in the teacher's role, but in dot-coms there are no teachers; we are all learners."
He is not complaining. "Putting it on the line, win or lose -- that brings me to life," Mr. Harrington said. "I see guys struggling around Pebble Beach -- they get older every day. I get younger."

HEADLINE: Who Gets to Tell a Black Story?

SERIES: HOW RACE IS LIVED IN AMERICA: Fourth article of a series.

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
David Simon was white but he knew he could write black people. Maybe not all black people but the ones he had known in Baltimore, where he had been a crime reporter for 14 years. He had spent a year on a Baltimore drug corner and written a book that had done something almost unheard of: It had shown black inner-city drug addicts as complex and startlingly human.
So Mr. Simon was not thinking much about his whiteness when he walked into the Los Angeles offices of HBO in January 1998 and set about trying to interest three white programming executives in the improbable idea of making the book into a television series. 
 No one talked about race at that meeting. At least, not directly. No one remarked upon the fact that Mr. Simon was white and that nearly everyone in his book was black. Nor did anyone mention that HBO was not about to make a series about black drug addicts created by, as one HBO executive put it later, "a bunch of white guys."
Instead, the executives asked Mr. Simon a lot of questions. How did black people in Baltimore react when his book, "The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood," came out? What did the mayor, who was black, say? What would happen if HBO were to make the series, and shoot it in Baltimore, and protests broke out?
Then they asked him to suggest a writing partner. He offered two names. One was James Yoshimura, an Asian-American playwright and television writer he had worked with on "Homicide: Life on the Street," the NBC series based on Mr. Simon's first book. The other was David Mills, an African-American writer and friend of Mr. Simon's since college, who had recently been nominated for two Emmys for episodes of "NYPD Blue."
Mr. Simon suggested Mr. Yoshimura and Mr. Mills for the same reason, he said later: He liked working with them. He did not feel he needed a black writer to help him tell a black story. He had spent his career as a white reporter in a mostly black town. He had a good ear and had paid attention in a way he knew most white people did not.
He was not unaware, however, that Mr. Mills might have special appeal for HBO. It was apparent from the line of questioning that a black writer was high on HBO's priority list. And, as Mr. Simon put it, as soon as the bait was dangled in the water, the fish leapt onto the hook.
At the mention of Mr. Mills, a look shot between two of the executives, Kary Antholis and Anne Thomopoulos. Mr. Antholis had been following Mr. Mills's career. He had even mentioned him to Ms. Thomopoulos -- as a smart writer who had worked at the highest levels of television, and who also happened to be black.
Do you know David Mills? one of them asked Mr. Simon.
Yes.
Could you get him to work on this project?
Sure.
Within minutes, Mr. Simon had a deal, HBO had a mini-series and Mr. Mills had a new job as Mr. Simon's writing partner and fellow executive producer.
 
The Risk and the Buzz
A mini-series about drug addicts was risky television. But it appealed to Chris Albrecht, the president for original programming at HBO, because HBO defined itself by doing what broadcast networks would not. That approach had earned HBO the admiration of critics, lots of Emmys and an expanding audience of subscribers, a fifth to a quarter of them black.
"The Corner" would not need a mass audience on HBO, because HBO did not make its money off commercials. What HBO wanted was attention and buzz. If the series could be shot quickly in the summer and fall of 1999 and put on the air the following April, it would be in Emmy voters' minds when they voted in June.
But no matter how good "The Corner" might be, Mr. Albrecht said later, there would be black people who would want to know why HBO was doing it at all. They would forget "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge," "Laurel Avenue," "The Tuskegee Airmen," "Miss Evers' Boys." The question would be, Why are you portraying black people that way?
HBO needed African-Americans involved for two reasons, Mr. Albrecht said: for creative reasons and for public relations.
"I really still wanted to find somebody who would be my . . . " Mr. Albrecht recalled later in his office in midtown Manhattan, choosing his words, "who would be an additional, uh. . . . " He paused, then used a vulgar expression for a person capable of detecting pretentious nonsense. "You know?"
He wanted Charles S. Dutton to direct "The Corner."
If anyone knew Baltimore's corners, it was Mr. Dutton. He had grown up in the city and spent his early years on its streets, where rock fighting -- snowball fighting, except with rocks -- earned him the lifelong nickname Roc. His only sister was a recovering cocaine addict. His only brother, who died of AIDS in 1993 at age 44, had been a heroin addict for nearly 25 years.
What had saved Charles Dutton was prison. He dropped out of school at 12 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter at 17, after stabbing a black man who had pulled a knife on him in a fight. He served two years. Then he was sent back for weapons possession, fought with a white guard, and ended up serving another seven and a half.
The tale of his redemption is well known. He grabbed an anthology of plays by black playwrights on his way into solitary confinement one day. By the light under the cell door, he read "Day of Absence," a social satire by Douglas Turner Ward. He was so taken with it, he organized a production, starred in it and discovered what he had been put on earth to do.
He formed a drama group that performed Shakespeare and Arthur Miller. He got his high school equivalency certificate and a junior college degree in prison, went to Towson State University in Maryland and Yale Drama School while on parole, and won his first Tony nomination for his performance in the August Wilson play "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" on Broadway in 1984.
After a performance of "The Piano Lesson" by Mr. Wilson in 1990, Mr. Albrecht introduced himself to Mr. Dutton. He then lured him to Los Angeles to star in his own television program, "Roc." The sitcom, in which Mr. Dutton played a garbage man, Roc Emerson, appeared on Fox for three tumultuous seasons starting in 1991.
Mr. Dutton was not overjoyed with Hollywood. On stage he had felt he could change the world, he said earlier this year. He had found the closest thing he knew to a utopian, race-neutral place. But he arrived in Hollywood suspicious of half-hour television and determined, as he put it, that no one would make a monkey out of him in prime time.
To accomplish that, he spent much of his three years "stomping, kicking and being a despot," he recalled. Then he moved on to movies, everything from "Cry, the Beloved Country" and "Alien 3" to "Cookie's Fortune" and Spike Lee's "Get on the Bus." And he became an outspoken critic of racism in Hollywood.
"There isn't a single black person in Hollywood with any power," he said last fall. "This isn't paranoia. Because if I stood in a room with every major black star, just talking, then I would hear the same things out of their mouths that are coming out of mine. Multimillionaires. The main thing you'll hear is, 'Whenever I take a project, I can't get it done unless I have a white partner.'
"In other words, if Denzel Washington, Danny Glover, Morgan Freeman, Wesley Snipes, Laurence Fishburne, if they went to a studio and said, 'I want to do the movie of Hannibal.' They'll say, 'Yeah, well, we have to call in Al Pacino or the latest young Italian actor to play Scipio,' the guy who defeated Hannibal many years after all his conquests. And, damn it, that's who the story will center around."
In the world beyond Hollywood, Mr. Dutton, who is 49, was widely admired. A striking figure with a stocky build, shaved head and eloquent face, he often traveled the country, speaking at small black colleges and in prisons. He was respected by working-class and upper-middle-class blacks alike, and by many whites.
HBO sent the scripts to Mr. Dutton and no one else.
At first he said no. He had directed just one movie, an HBO film called "First-Time Felon." But he was not interested in another urban drama, especially one about drugs. "I had a certain bitterness and anger with family members who allowed themselves to be destroyed that way," he recalled. "I had to ask myself, do I want to take this emotional journey through this world?"
Yet the scripts intrigued him. What he admired about the story was that it was told from the addicts' perspective, not some glamorized dealer's. It made clear what he had long seen as the hypocrisy of the war on drugs. And it could serve, he said, as a raw reminder of an element of society that Americans chose to forget.
HBO offered him two episodes. Then four. Then all six. The shooting schedule would be a killer, but doing all six might give him a degree of control that television directors rarely had. He would take a bath financially, he said later, because he made his real money as an actor. But he wanted to prove he had the stamina and the concentration to pull it off.
In what he would later call a momentary lapse of sanity, he said yes. He had come to respect Mr. Simon and Mr. Mills, he said shortly after accepting the job. But, as he also said, there would not be one moment when he would forget that "it's a white writer and a white producer and it's HBO and a black director."
And no matter how many supportive black people HBO would line up, the job of defending the mini-series would fall to him. "I'm going to have to be the person saying, 'Hey, y'all, it's cool,' " he once said, chuckling at his impersonation of himself. " 'Ain't no sense in gettin' upset. This is a goooood movie. Go watch it. Order HBO!' "
 
The Crew Is Too White
On July 22, Mr. Dutton laid eyes on his crew for the first time.
They were gathered at the intersection of Montford Avenue and Oliver Street, a broken-down place with a bar, a corner store, a boarded-up deli and little else. Three weeks before they were to start shooting, the heads of the various departments, newly hired by the producers, had come with the producers and several HBO executives to scout their principal location.
Mr. Dutton arrived separately. He slid out of his car and focused on the stream of men and women emerging from a couple of vans.
They weren't all white. But almost.
It was not as if the producers hadn't known that he wanted a racially mixed crew. He had brought up the subject with the unit production manager, Nina Kostroff Noble, on his first day in Baltimore: I'm not going into the ghettos of Baltimore city for a whole damn summer with an all-white crew, he would remember saying. And if you guys were smart, you wouldn't either.
What makes you think it's going to be all white? she had responded.
It was always the same, Mr. Dutton said later. The business was "full of nepotism and cliquism." Italians hired Italians, Asians hired Asians. "So why is it a problem when it's a black project? Every black project that I've worked on, with the exception of the Spike Lee movies, you've got to go through this every time. You've got to say, 'Why can't we have some more black folks on the crew?' "
Not that Mr. Dutton wanted an all-black crew. Having healthy black representation was a matter of pride and fairness, but he also believed it was more fun when a crew was truly diverse. For a series about black addicts, filmed in East Baltimore, he thought the right percentage of African-Americans was their percentage in the city, roughly 65 percent.
Affecting an earnest white voice, he mocked the response he got in Hollywood whenever he complained: Are you saying the studios are deliberately not hiring black people? No, he said, they didn't go into a room and say: "You know, we ain't hiring no damn black people. Everyone agreed? And here's the story if we get questioned about it."
It just came naturally, without thinking. And if you confronted them, they would say: "Hey, my next-door neighbor is black. My best friend is black." You could throw racism two inches in front of white peoples' faces and they still wouldn't see it, Mr. Dutton said. Or they'd deny it and say you were the one causing the problems.
"There isn't a black actor in Hollywood, on the star level or the lowest level, who doesn't in private vehemently rail against the industry," he said. "The biggest stars. The hugest stars. Because somewhere along the line they are still reminded, 'You know something? You're a big star but you're just another nigger.'
"And so either you succumb to it and you roll over and you grin and you bear it and you shuck and you jive and you laugh when it ain't funny and you scratch when it ain't itching. And you go about being a good little boy and you're patted on the head and they give you the next little movie. And you look around and there ain't no black folks on that one, either."
He paused, then added: "But those that do that will probably rot in hell somewhere."
At Montford and Oliver, he could hear the first assistant director starting to introduce him: "This is the director, Charles Dutton." Instead of walking over and shaking hands, he turned his back on them all and crossed the street.
It would have been phony, he said later, to shake hands and grin and act as if everything were all right. So, flanked by his black bodyguard and his black driver, he went to work studying the location. He figured everybody got the message: I'm not doing this with a white crew. Sorry. Nothing personal.
Nina Noble, the unit production manager, was upset. She recognized the problem immediately. But Mr. Dutton was not behaving like the captain of the ship, she said later. Some of the black crew members felt like tokens; some whites felt slapped in the face, she said. They told her so.
Ms. Noble was white, but she prided herself on being colorblind in her work. In the case of "The Corner," she had intended to go farther than usual to hire a racially mixed crew. She and Mr. Simon and the other producers had discussed it at length. None of them wanted anyone in the community, cast or crew feeling exploited or degraded.
But there were not many black technicians in the business, especially in Baltimore, Ms. Noble said later. And it was expensive to bring them in from other cities and house them. When she had asked one of the unions if it had a minority roster, she had been warned against trying to violate seniority rules.
Even so, the crew she had begun putting together already included a number of African-Americans. Unfortunately, some of them were not there that day, because they were not department heads. And one of those who were there might have been mistaken for white. "O.K.," Ms. Noble said later. "It's not enough that we have people who are black. We have to hire people with dark skin."
She had been hoping that Mr. Dutton, after several weeks on the job, had begun to deal with everyone on what she called "more a personal level and less on a racial level."
"I guess I was wrong about that," she said.
Later that day, Mr. Dutton spoke with one of the visiting HBO executives, who then spoke with Ms. Noble and Robert F. Colesberry, the third executive producer. Along with Mr. Simon, they all agreed they had to try even harder to hire more African-Americans onto the crew.
In the following weeks, they hired a black script supervisor, hairdresser, director's assistant and production assistant, all of them from out of town. The Teamsters came up with three black drivers. By the end of production, the shooting crew consisted of 41 white people and 33 black people, by Ms. Noble's count.
Many crew members said it was the most racially mixed crew they had ever seen. It was a source of satisfaction for many people, including Mr. Simon, who believed that the white people had learned from the experience. He said later: "If Charles wanted us to be 65 percent, and if inertia would have made us 10 or 15 percent, somewhere in between is where we ended up. And I don't know what perfect is."
Mr. Dutton thought he did. And where they had ended up was not perfect.
That day would remain a defining moment for him. "I didn't see anything but white people, white people, white people," he said later. " 'Hey, we're making a movie about these black people and we're the experts.' Absolutely, I felt like, well, hold it. The way to impress me with your liberalism or your humanity or your honesty or your integrity where the black community is concerned is to share the damn pot."
Something lingered after that day, Mr. Simon remarked many months later. A few people told him they felt that whiteness was a liability on the set, he said. If they got their feelings hurt, it could be a hard shoot. But he believed the wrong move at that moment was to get offended. It solved nothing.
"There are white people for whom that moment of having somebody be standoffish or curt or unpleasant, or even the veiled suggestion that race is a barrier, that ends it," Mr. Simon said. If there was one thing that being a white reporter in a mostly black city had taught him, it was what could be gained by not walking away.
 
A Long Way From Silver Spring
Mr. Simon, who is 39, grew up in a mostly white world, the youngest of three children in a liberal Democratic household in Silver Spring, Md., in which books and newspapers were revered and argument was sport. He went to suburban public schools that were heavily white. He recalls as a child having heard a racial epithet used only twice, but having known enough to be indignant.
Race was rarely discussed at home, but equality was a given. Mr. Simon's father was the director of public relations and a speechwriter for B'nai B'rith. His mother worked for several years for a group called the Negro Student Fund, which helped underachieving public school students move to independent schools.
Mr. Simon learned about race in Baltimore. The Sun hired him out of the University of Maryland in 1983. Race was out in the open in Baltimore in a way he had never seen before. It was no big deal, he said, to walk into a bar in Highlandtown and hear white people talking about black folks, or to meet a black person and be told everything that was wrong with white people, no offense.
Race seemed to permeate everything in Baltimore: housing, education, politics, criminal justice. It was as if the city had swallowed whole every other trend but had choked on race, he said. The biggest crime story was drugs, and intravenous drug use in Baltimore occurred predominantly among African-Americans. To be a decent reporter, he had to learn to listen to black people.
In 1988, Mr. Simon spent a year with the Baltimore Police Department's homicide unit, doing the reporting for what became his 1991 book, "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets." Waiting around at crime scenes and in people's houses, he ended up shooting the breeze for hours upon hours with people the police encountered on cases.
"So then the trick becomes: can I just be patient enough not to ask every question at once, to laugh only at the jokes that they tell when they're funny, and not to laugh at the ones that, if you laugh at them, they know you're full up with it, and to venture your own joke about something," Mr. Simon recalled.
At The Sun, he made a specialty of turning obscure murders into full-blown dramatic narratives. Gregarious, voluble and funny, he believed he could talk to anybody. And every time someone rendered himself or herself human, he said, "it was an argument against whatever racial simplicities you've constructed in your mind."
In 1993, he took a leave of absence and went to work on "The Corner" with a former police detective named Edward Burns, also white, who believed that the drug war had led the police badly astray, and who shared with Mr. Simon the impulse to demonstrate to the credit-card-carrying world that the people the drug war had demonized had lives and sensibilities and deserved understanding.
Mr. Simon and Mr. Burns picked the intersection of Fayette and Monroe Streets, one of a hundred open-air drug markets in a city said to have the highest rate of heroin use of any in the country. They went every day. They talked, joked, hung around, listened, eventually winning the confidence of dozens of people whose stories would become the soul of the book.
When "The Corner" came out in 1997, The New York Times chose it as one of the notable books of the year. The Rev. Frank Reid, pastor of the largest African-American church in Baltimore, based sermons on it and held a party to celebrate it. Five hundred people showed up.
Mr. Simon had leapt a chasm few white people cross, Mr. Mills, his friend and writing partner, believed. He had written about black addicts not through a microscope but by sitting next to them. He had learned the language, sensibility and sense of humor of the ghetto, a sensibility Mr. Mills knew from his childhood. And he had gotten more intimately involved with his subjects than Mr. Mills could imagine doing himself.
Mr. Simon's newspaper articles, meanwhile, looked less and less like what normally turns up in a newspaper. They began with paragraphs like " 'You don't look so good,' says the cop, smiling. 'You look like death.' " Then an editor at the Sun accused him of ennobling criminals. Disgusted, he left in 1995. He went to work as a writer and producer on "Homicide."
That the subjects of his journalism were often black was not what drew Mr. Simon to them, he insisted earlier this year. Race had simply made the territory seem less accessible, so their voices had not been heard. There were things he missed because he was white, he said. But there were other things a black writer from that world might have missed because he or she was too close.
Occasionally, he found himself accused of exploitation.
"I'm losing patience with the idea of it being exploitive," he said. "Except to acknowledge that in one sense all journalism is exploitive. Janet Malcolm was right. We're all selling used cars. And any journalist who tries to say we're not is lying through his teeth.
"The only ethic that I can find that you can hang your hat on says: Now that I have the material, how do I treat my subjects? Do I accord them all the humanity they deserve, or do I write a crude and simplistic expose?"
 
Faces From the Old Days
The shooting schedule in Baltimore was relentless: 12- and 13-hour days, five days a week, no end in sight. By early October, Mr. Dutton had not slept eight hours straight since August. The production was on time and under budget. But at times the film was being written, cast, shot and edited almost simultaneously.
It was emotionally grueling, too. Day in and day out, they were shooting in the depths of the world they were depicting, in the decaying row house neighborhoods that in Baltimore seem to stagger on forever, with the drug corners, tumbledown bars, boarded-up windows, rumble of demolition trucks, shriek of sirens. Everywhere, there were children.
Every day people would turn up to watch, a shifting collection of neighborhood residents, acquaintances of Mr. Dutton, survivors from his prison drama group, aspiring actors and hangers-on -- more than a few of whom found their way into small parts in the series, blurring the boundary between the film and the street.
For Mr. Dutton, being back in the old neighborhood was not necessarily fun -- the handshaking, embracing, hearing sob stories, shelling out money, seeing people he had once idolized who had gone nowhere. He kept waiting for someone, he said, just someone, to arrive by car, not on foot, and get out with kids and a wife and everyone looking healthy.
Mr. Simon was around, too, along with many of the people from his book. Of those who had not died, some were clean and turning their lives around. Mr. Simon had remained close to them. Now he found joy in helping them get small roles, for which those in speaking parts could rake in the princely Screen Actors Guild rate of $596 a day.
Mr. Mills visited the set rarely. What he loved was the solitary process of writing, so he passed his days in the office, writing and fine-tuning scripts. Mr. Simon let him try anything, and relied on him. But there was a well-defined hierarchy, Mr. Mills observed without resentment. "The Corner" was Mr. Simon's project; he was there to serve Mr. Simon's vision.
They had first worked together on the University of Maryland student paper and Mr. Mills, like Mr. Simon, had gone into journalism. They had written their first television script together, for "Homicide," in 1992, winning an award from the Writers Guild of America. Mr. Mills had then quit his job at The Washington Post to become a television writer. Their friendship, they both said, had long ago moved well beyond race. And that appeared to be the truth.
For the first few weeks of production, Mr. Simon was on the set every day, often in the background, watching or talking with Mr. Colesberry and Ms. Noble, and occasionally Mr. Dutton. Then, after a few weeks, he began coming less often. At the time, he said he had pulled back because he was confident that all was in good hands. But later, he said he had also begun to sense that Mr. Dutton responded better to Mr. Colesberry than to him. Mr. Dutton seemed distant, more curt. Mr. Simon said he figured Mr. Dutton was feeling the pressure, like everyone.
In fact, Mr. Dutton had come to distrust Mr. Simon.
"As good as some of this material is, I'm wondering where his real heart is in this," he said in October. "Is this really and truly an effort to do something about this?" No matter how sincere Mr. Simon was, he was "taking somebody else's misery and making a dollar off of it. Which can't be denied, whether he's the most sincere goddamn white man in the world."
Where the distrust had started, Mr. Dutton could not say for sure.
Early on, he had gotten the impression through HBO that Mr. Simon and Mr. Mills had doubts about having him direct all six episodes. Then, the initial encounter with the crew had badly soured his enthusiasm. He blamed Mr. Simon, in part; if his niche was going to be writing about black people in Baltimore, then he should have made sure there were more behind the camera.
From the first days of the shoot, Mr. Dutton said, Mr. Simon was getting on his nerves. Mr. Dutton was not accustomed to having a writer on set, and he was not interested in hearing how Mr. Simon had envisioned particular scenes. There always seemed to be people, like Mr. Simon and Ms. Noble, whispering in corners.
He hated to say he felt unappreciated. But he did feel monitored, judged and second-guessed. The only reason he had not cussed somebody out was because he had to get through the shoot. If he had gotten angry, it would have been intimidating and disruptive. To keep the peace, he let things go.
He was suspicious of white writers, he said at the time. Every aspect of black life had been distorted by white people, he said, and the series was about an element of society that he knew white people detested. He would have felt more comfortable, he said, if the writer had been black. As for Mr. Mills, Mr. Dutton felt he knew little about him; when they had first met, he had not even realized that the light-skinned Mr. Mills was African-American.
"I know that David Simon can visit and sit with as many black folks in this city as he wants to," Mr. Dutton said one day in late September, standing on a crumbling stretch of sidewalk in the rain. "They can pay the families to get the stories. They can listen and walk around with dope fiends. They can write about murders, and they still won't know a damn thing about black people. Not this, you know. Not this."
He added: "I know the pulse of this. I know what people think the minute they walk out them doors. I know what mothers feel when their sons and daughters walk out of the house to go to school. I know what it feels like to kill somebody. I know what it feels like to get shot. I know what it feels like that people be looking to kill me. I don't have to show up as a crime journalist after the fact."
 
A Painful Scene
The scene on the schedule for Columbus Day was especially difficult.
Mr. Simon had watched firsthand the event it was based on, back in 1993. Two addicts he had been following had emerged from a courtroom, accompanied by their mothers. Suddenly, one of the mothers had exploded at the other, raving and hurling obscenities in the crowded corridor.
Mr. Simon had considered leaving the scene out; it had been painful to witness and painful for the mother on the receiving end. But it had seemed essential, showing the way the corner world kept intruding on people's attempts to lead ordinary lives. Mr. Simon and Mr. Mills had ended up including it, but toned down the language.
The performance could not be cartoonish, the producers had agreed; it could not be an eye-popping, head-rolling, sitcom stereotype. But the actors who had auditioned for the part had leaned in that direction. So the producers had gone to the expense of importing a New York actor to play the part of the angry mother.
Privately, Mr. Dutton found the scene embarrassing. "There was something about it that was so ghetto, so stereotypical ghetto," he said later. Not that he doubted that it had happened. But there would be black viewers who would ask, Why did you have to show that? And there would be white people who would think, Oh, yeah, that is just how they are.
When HBO had first approached him, he had had reservations about exposing the world of the corner. Not just those aspects that were embarrassing but those that felt intimate and precious, he said later. Now, he said, he sometimes felt he was giving Mr. Simon more than he could have imagined. He felt he was giving away secrets.
He remembered a performance of "The Piano Lesson" on Broadway. Dionne Warwick had been in the audience and had walked out during the second act. Months later, she told him why. "She said she couldn't take it anymore," Mr. Dutton remembered. "Because we were letting white folks in on all of our sacred little things. It was almost like that's all we had, or have."
On Columbus Day Mr. Simon was on set, a courthouse in East Baltimore. He was standing near the corridor where Mr. Dutton, intense and absorbed, was having the actors repeatedly rehearse the scene. The corridor was crowded with extras hired for the day to mill around in the background.
Mr. Simon was watching the extras. They kept failing to react to the commotion between the mothers. A couple of women looked so oblivious and white-bread, it was funny. A man playing one of the bailiffs kept going to great lengths to make sure he would be in the shot. Mr. Simon, who knew him, would remember later that he had shared a laugh with the man about that.
Meanwhile, the actor playing the raving mother was dead on. It was the moment Mr. Simon had witnessed in another courthouse corridor six years earlier, reinvented by a television production crew, transformed by artifice. He was elated. He laughed again.
Out of the corner of his eye, at one point, Mr. Dutton caught sight of Mr. Simon laughing. It made him furious.
He shot Mr. Simon an angry look. Mr. Simon seemed to turn away.
Maybe he had misinterpreted that laugh, Mr. Dutton said later. But he didn't think so. One of the actors had noticed it, too. "Why has he got to be laughing at this scene?" Mr. Dutton would remember the actor asking.
Mr. Dutton never mentioned the moment to Mr. Simon. But he said privately that a black writer would never have laughed. Not even a snicker. "Because they would have even felt a little bit of shame in it. It boils down to nobody wants to look in the mirror and see ugliness. Nobody wants to look in the mirror and see ignorance."
Months later, Mr. Simon would remember an angry look. He said he had assumed Mr. Dutton thought he was meddling, because he had asked one of the assistant directors to get the extras in the background to react.
Maybe he should have been more sensitive, he said. But how could he have been? The moment between the mothers had been painful to witness, but its power was attenuated six years later. If it had not been that moment, it could have been 10 others. He had laughed at 10 other things that were not funny in reality but were funny in the process of representing them.
"I know what I wasn't laughing at," Mr. Simon said earlier this spring. "I wasn't laughing at somebody who was black and poor and uncouth making a spectacle of themself in a hallway. That's the one thing that wouldn't have been funny to me, and wasn't when it happened."
 
One Connection
If there was one thing Mr. Simon and Mr. Dutton could talk about, it was Baltimore street lore. Mr. Simon loved the crime history of Baltimore the way other writers loved stories about the mob. Baltimore's organized crime was its black drug trade. The most enjoyable conversations Mr. Simon and Mr. Dutton had were about that world.
For years, Mr. Simon had believed there was a great story to be told about the period in the early 1960's in Baltimore when men who had made their money as hustlers and gamblers moved into drugs. It was a moment of reckoning, he thought. That story, perhaps wed to the War of the Roses, as in Shakespeare's history plays, had the makings of a classic black gangster film.
At its center might be the character of Melvin Williams, who was said to have risen from the pool halls of Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore to lay the groundwork for the heroin industry that then engulfed the city. Mr. Simon had written a five-part series about Mr. Williams's drug empire for The Sun in 1987. Mr. Dutton, it turned out, had known Mr. Williams since childhood.
Looking back, Mr. Dutton would marvel that Mr. Simon had first mentioned the idea to him not long after they met. And it had come up again and again in the following months. Just in passing, Mr. Simon said. But Mr. Dutton believed he knew what Mr. Simon was getting at. In late October, he mentioned to Mr. Simon that he liked the idea of the project, too.
So, four days before the end of the "Corner" shoot, Mr. Simon made his way over to Mr. Dutton during a break. He gave him a copy of the newspaper series and laid out his idea in detail. On the sidewalk outside the fast-food restaurant where they were shooting, they fell deep into conversation, then continued inside, squashed side by side in undersized plastic chairs.
Mr. Simon believed he would have a hard time selling the idea to a studio without Mr. Dutton, he said later, and an easier time persuading Mr. Williams to cooperate if Mr. Dutton's name were attached. Mr. Dutton knew that world, had the draw to get the project made and would even be great in the role of a police lieutenant colonel who was key to the story.
Similarly, Mr. Dutton believed that Mr. Simon would have the screenwriting reputation needed to win over a studio, he said later. Mr. Simon had the passion needed to get the project off the ground. He would have access to older police officials. And, Mr. Dutton said, he might be the only person Mr. Williams and others would open up to.
"I'm going to be the first one to admit, the idea is very, very, very clever," he said later, referring to Mr. Simon's choice of the War of the Roses as a frame for the story. "If more writers would think of those kinds of clever devices, a lot of those so-called black films in that genre would be a lot more interesting."
By early November, the editors had pieced together the first episodes of "The Corner." Seeing those rough assemblages, Mr. Dutton thought he and Mr. Simon and Mr. Mills were on the same page about many things after all. He was struck by how distinct and memorable each character was. Watching a scene in which an addict was stabbed to death, he had found himself weeping.
Maybe he had not given Mr. Simon enough credit, he had begun to think. "All the credit from the literary point of it, but from the humanity point of it, I was a little guarded," he said. On the other hand, it was a two-way street, he insisted; he remained convinced that Mr. Simon had had doubts about him, too.
In the final days of shooting, Mr. Dutton said, he took a step back and watched Mr. Simon with some of the "real people" from the book. Mr. Dutton was impressed by the emotional bond between them, and by Mr. Simon's commitment to remain involved. "If he has the patience for it," Mr. Dutton said, "I envy him."
Mr. Simon was truly fascinated by the world of the corner, Mr. Dutton believed. "There are times when he's been around the real people in this, I would look at him from afar and he'd be totally enraptured," he observed one day. And Mr. Dutton would be sure that the person Mr. Simon was listening to was full of it. Without hearing a word, he said, he could tell.
"So, in that regard, I have a soft spot for David," he said, adding: "Sometimes I shake my head and I say, 'Poor boy, if he's going for that.' But then other times I'm wary. Because, wait a minute, is this guy as nonchalant as he seems?"
 
Editing by Committee
When the shoot ended, Mr. Simon, Mr. Mills and Mr. Colesberry moved to Manhattan and set up shop in an editing studio in TriBeCa to work on their cuts. Mr. Dutton kept his distance, often working on his own cuts in a midtown hotel. His creative juices flowed better there, he said. But it also felt awkward in TriBeCa, "those guys tiptoeing around me."
Under the rules of television, the producers had the power to overrule Mr. Dutton on cutting the series. He submitted his director's cut of each episode, then they took it and made theirs. Mr. Dutton disliked many of the flashbacks that had been shot: "I'd say 3 percent work. The other 97 percent don't," he said one day. He took some out -- and the producers put some back.
He also chose particular takes of certain scenes, only to have the producers replace them with selections of their own. They were eviscerating one of the characters, Mr. Dutton complained privately. He hated their musical choices, too. Using blues music for the title theme was, to him, "the typical white-boy idea of what black life is like."
Still, he kept his complaints to himself. The producers had the right to do what they were doing. So why bother objecting?
By late December he was not sure he would be showing up in Pasadena in mid-January to help promote the series at a semiannual meeting of television critics. "I could say, 'I wish you guys well, but I'm unavailable,' " he said. "I could be shooting a picture in London." Or, he said, he could be on his farm in Maryland, shoveling manure.
But on Jan. 19, there he was in Pasadena. Minutes before the preview, he stalked into the room at the Ritz Carlton where the HBO contingent was waiting. He seemed barely able to bring himself to say hello to Mr. Simon, Mr. Colesberry and Mr. Mills. "I didn't know why Charles was so mad," Mr. Simon said later. "I thought it was the cuts."
Mr. Simon resolved not to let the day end without inviting Mr. Dutton to have a drink and talk things over. Mr. Dutton had plans but took Mr. Simon's cell phone number, just in case. It felt as though the ice was cracking, Mr. Simon said later. Then Mr. Dutton never called. When they bumped into each other the next morning, Mr. Dutton explained cheerfully that he had been out late.
Back on the East Coast, HBO asked Mr. Dutton at the last minute to film a personal preamble to the series, describing his reasons for making it. The idea worried Mr. Simon and Mr. Mills; they did not want HBO apologizing for the series in advance. They shipped a draft script to Mr. Dutton. But he sent back a message saying he would write the preamble himself.
Then, two days before it was to be shot in Baltimore, an HBO executive informed Mr. Simon, Mr. Mills and Mr. Colesberry that Mr. Dutton did not want them there. They were stung but complied. So, on a cold Saturday in early March, Mr. Dutton returned one more time to Montford and Oliver and filmed his 90-second introduction, alone.
"I didn't need two cents from anybody," Mr. Dutton said later. "I didn't want five opinions on how we should shoot it or any genius ideas for rewriting. I don't even know why anybody wanted to be there. If they wanted to be there because they were worried about what Charles Dutton was going to do, then that's indicative of the entire shoot."
"The Corner" had its premiere at 10 p.m. on Sunday, April 16. Apart from a few lukewarm notices, one in The New York Times, the reviews were unanimous in their admiration: "ferociously written," "superbly directed," "spectacularly acted," "unblinkingly honest." In The Washington Post, Tom Shales called the series "an act of enlightenment, raw and shattering and strangely, inexplicably, beautiful."
Week after week, the ratings were unusually high for HBO in that time slot, especially in African-American households. There was none of the black backlash everyone had feared. Sales of Mr. Simon and Mr. Burns's book surged. People seemed stunned by the series' realism. Watching it at home, Mr. Dutton found himself struck again by the writing.
"I have to say the writing is absolutely brilliant," he said, looking back on what Mr. Simon had accomplished. "Without a doubt, he captured the hell out of those lives. Whatever painstaking efforts he had to go through, to sit and live for a year on those corners, it is totally a credit to him to have put it down on paper in the noncompromising way that he did.
"That's what makes the piece as beautiful and strong as it is. That he didn't take any weak shortcuts to appease a certain element of society, that he presented it just as it was told to him and just the way he observed it and just the way he analyzed it. In a nutshell, it's absolutely remarkable what he did."
With distance, Mr. Dutton believed he had let the strains of the production cloud his judgment. He had failed to see that Mr. Simon had been as nervous about the project as anyone, maybe more so, he said. Mr. Simon was probably worried about career, life, limb, everything, if it had come out badly.
Mr. Simon, meanwhile, continued to raise the Pennsylvania Avenue idea with Mr. Dutton when they saw each other. He had been rereading Shakespeare's history plays and had begun trying to contact Melvin Williams in prison. He was planning to write an outline and send it to Mr. Dutton. It had begun to seem possible that they might eventually work together again.
"I can't express to you how minimal whatever problems Charles and I had were compared to how I felt when I went onto that corner in 1993," Mr. Simon said. "People were a lot more direct about not wanting us there on that corner than Charles was when I was on set. The trick was coming back every day. Most people's opinions changed. To an extent, I had 60 days with Charles. I think by the 60th day his impressions might have been different. If not, I would suggest 60 more might help. Or 120.
"Now, racially, in this country, you don't usually get that kind of prolonged experience. Either people bend over backwards to get along or they don't and they steer clear. But I've sort of been trained -- and you could call it crassly manipulative, because I want the book or I want the movie to be better -- to stay put."
"If he thinks I was a bastard to work with, I don't think he was so easy to work with, either," he said a couple of days later. "But I would still do it a second time, based on the quality of the work that occurred. I know this: This time directing for him, he has directed something that's better because I wrote it, and I've written something that's better because he directed it.
"If we come out of it the second time and we've managed not to acquire some degree of understanding of our own foibles and insensitivities and misunderstandings, if we wind up in this exact same moment, then we're idiots. We ought to be able to learn."
 
About the Series
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates-over Civil War flags, for example, or police profiling. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted by a full employment economy and by a sense, particularly among many whites, that the time of large social remedies is past. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace. These encounters-race relations in the most literal, everyday sense-make up this series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by a team of Times Reporters.
 
This series will continue intermittently, concluding with a special issue of The New York Times Magazine on July 16.
 
The articles in this series can also be read at The New York Times on the Web. The site offers forums in which visitors can discuss the articles and racial issues in their own lives and respond to a questionnaire.

HEADLINE: Journey to an Overlooked Past

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
MICHAEL KORIE, a lyricist, has nothing against the plaque in Greenwich Village marking the site of the former Stonewall Inn. At that spot, on Christopher Street, gay men battled police in June 1969 and began the modern movement for lesbian and gay rights.
But when Mr. Korie walks the streets of New York, he sees many other places where gay New Yorkers gathered in the decades before the now-legendary Stonewall rebellion. There is no plaque on Columbus Circle to commemorate a Childs Restaurant where gay men created a "cafeteria society" in the 1920's and 30's. No engraved words mark the Bowery's turn-of-the-20th-century "fairy resorts," the nightclubs where rouged men mingled with brawny laborers and uptown swells. And how many tours to Harlem point out the site where men in sequined splendor competed for prizes at an annual drag ball that drew thousands from the early 1920's into the late 30's? 
 In fact, few New Yorkers realize such places ever existed.
"There's a lot of mythology about the contemporary gay rights movement," said Mr. Korie, a slim, professorial-looking 45-year-old whose credits include the libretto for the 1995 opera "Harvey Milk," a work based on the life of San Francisco's first openly gay city supervisor. "That it began with Stonewall, that gay people were in the closet until then. There have been books and articles about gay life before Stonewall. Nevertheless, that mythology persists."
Tomorrow night at 7:30 in Carnegie Hall, a new choral work with lyrics by Mr. Korie and music by Larry Grossman will try to do what the history books could not. The New York City Gay Men's Chorus will offer the premiere of "A Gay Century Songbook," a collection of songs that traces the evolution of lesbian and gay culture in New York during the first half of the 20th century. The hourlong piece, which will include a narrative read by the actor Joel Grey, explores how earlier generations of New Yorkers transformed restaurants, parks and streets from Harlem to Brooklyn into places for themselves, despite deep-seated prejudice and legal prosecution.
The song collection is intensely site-specific. "It is so related to New York and has kind of a New York attitude," Mr. Korie said. "I don't know if it will play in Dallas," he added. "I can't see them singing about Dora on the Bowery."
Songwriters have mapped New York for the world beyond its borders, saying the Bronx is up and the Battery's down, that the lights are always bright on Broadway. This work is a Baedeker to a less-well-known city.
Some of these places survive, but many were demolished decades ago. They were urban ephemera, unremarkable parts of the street vernacular, or situated in vice-ridden areas that have since been sanitized, thanks to economic upturns and civic improvements. But they made an indelible mark, said Mr. Korie. Learning where others met for nickel coffees or bootleg gin, he said, gave him a sense of his "own gay roots."
"Gays made such an impact on history that continues to linger in New York's buildings and its spirit," said Mr. Korie, who wrote for The Village Voice and edited a weekly, now defunct, called New York Guide before turning to songwriting in the 70's. His songbook follows a fictional Irish immigrant named Macklin Moran, from his arrival in New York in 1900 until 1948, the year the Kinsey report told Americans that gay men were more common than most people thought.
Seen through Moran's eyes, the Hudson piers of 1900 are where gay veterans of the Spanish-American War sing of their plans to abandon their hometowns and find lodgings in rooming houses. Gramercy Park in 1910 is the setting for lesbian "marriages," like the one between the novelist Willa Cather and Edith Lewis. By 1915, gay-only refuges had emerged in the form of Turkish baths, including the Everard Baths on 28th Street near Sixth Avenue and the Ariston Bathhouse at 55th and Broadway.
Mr. Korie's lyrics are laced with the argot and codes of an earlier subculture, in which gay co-workers found one another by discussing the Ziegfeld Follies on breaks; lesbians endured tweed suits till May; and a red tie worn on Riverside Drive was a sexual semaphore. Many tunes are joyous, reflecting what Mr. Korie calls "windows of tolerance" during which antihomosexuality laws were sporadically enforced. Before the 1930's, the point at which political change led to a sharp escalation in arrests, a bemused or indifferent public allowed visible lesbian and gay enclaves to develop in Greenwich Village, Times Square and Harlem.
But there are also musical reminders of the clouds that hung over the same-sex dance partners in the ballroom of the Hotel Astor near Times Square, the campy kaffeeklatsches at the Horn & Hardart Automat near Bryant Park, and the winter encampments of gay hobos on the Lower East Side. At the prompting of antivice groups, the police occasionally raided even cafeterias.
Still, Mr. Korie said, the point of the songbook is that even in the New York of a century ago, "gay people had an existence that wasn't reflective of fear. They weren't all routinely arrested."
 
When the Bowery Was In Flower, Resplendently Gay
Certainly the phrase "only in New York" could find no greater relevance than in the Bowery of 1905. One recent morning, Mr. Korie took a visitor to Cooper Square in Lower Manhattan -- home to Cooper Union and the offices of The Village Voice -- a place where gay life flourished at the turn of the 20th century.
An auto parts store that faces a strip of well-groomed commercial buildings is a reminder of the days before the most recent wave of gentrification. But nothing remains to suggest the time when the Third Avenue El rattled over bars, dance halls and other pleasure palaces for workingmen. These included "fairy resorts," nightspots whose attraction was the presence of effeminate men. Known among themselves and to others as "fairies," these entertainers tweezed, powdered and perfumed themselves, fashioning their hair into stylish marcelled waves. Women's apparel -- low-cut dresses and high boots -- sometimes completed the look, although strict laws against cross-dressing made full drag a rarity.
For profit, or sometimes just pleasure, these men sang and danced with each other and with male patrons, offering sex in rooms behind the bar. At their zenith in the 1890's, at least half a dozen such establishments lined the Bowery, and an equal number could be found in the area known as the Tenderloin, along Sixth Avenue and Broadway between 23rd and 40th Streets.
Crowds of society folk, both men and women, came from all over New York to gawk. "The whole idea of slumming originated not in Harlem but here," said Mr. Korie, "because it was chic to come down here and see the fairies dance."
He lingered in front of 32 Cooper Square, a six-story Georgian-style brick building that now houses several film companies. No. 32 was the site of Columbia Hall, one of the most notorious fairy resorts and one that earned the nickname Paresis Hall, after a medical term for a disease caused by late-stage syphilis.
Mr. Korie's bouncy song "That Way" is set in Paresis Hall. It is a catalog song, containing a seemingly endless list of humorous topical references about Alice B. Toklas, the Ziegfeld Follies' men's lounge and a strip of Coney Island beach along which gay men sometimes paraded in dresses and hats fashioned from beach towels.
"The Committee of 14 would lead 'fleshpot tours' to Paresis Hall and tell people how bad it was," Mr. Korie said, referring to a moral-purity society of the era. Tongue-clucking, he added, was probably accompanied by sexual titillation.
 
Just a Bar With Patrons Named Truman, Tennessee and Rudolf
The Bowery was also temporary home to the gay hobos who wintered in the cheap lodgings during an era in which crowds of transient workers moved in and out of New York by rail. Older and younger men often paired off in couples of "wolves" and "lambs" The older man helped the younger one find shelter in a Skid Row hotel, and the younger one performed "wifely" domestic duties. Mr. Korie recalls this world in the moody and wistful song "Nothin' Is as Open as the Road."
Whither goes the railway track,
South with Johnny or north with Jack,
Nothin' owned is nothin' owed,
And nothin' is as open as the road
Mr. Korie's next stop was Julius', a bar at Waverly Place and 10th Street. It is not far from the site of the Stonewall Inn and in some eyes nearly as legendary; it played itself in the 1970 film "The Boys in the Band." In the 60's, it was the site of a challenge to state laws forbidding gay bars from obtaining liquor licenses.
"It's well known that Julius' is the oldest gay bar in the city," said Mr. Korie, who learned of the place when he was growing up in Teaneck, N.J. Soon after moving to New York in 1974, he made a pilgrimage to the famed saloon.
The bar dates from 1864, said Tracy O'Neill, the current bartender. Ray Silvano, 74, who was having an early drink, recalled stopping by as a child in the 1930's to plunder the cracker bowls. With its spartan decor, wagon wheel fixtures and chalkboard notices detailing practice schedules for the Barbarians, the bar's softball team, Julius' looks more sports bar than shrine.
But one wall of this nontrendy neighborhood gay bar is plastered with newspaper clippings recalling its days as a gay speakeasy, a favorite of Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and Rudolf Nureyev. Another wall is a gallery of yellowed celebrity photographs with faded signatures. The hardwood bar is carved deep with generations of initials and messages.
Mr. Korie chose Julius' as the setting for his song "Kieran McHugh Remained Abroad," in which gay veterans of World War I who gathered at the bar during Prohibition describe their return from the battlefield.
Merrily played the marching bands
Welcoming home the straight.
Avenues teemed with patriots
Who now crusade for hate
Saturday nights at Julius'
Drinking to comrades lost --
Our hairy-chested widowhood
Gets sentimentally sauced
But the age of Julius', Mr. Korie said, "doesn't jibe with the popular lore, that we were all closeted until 1969."
Two other famous outposts of early gay society, the Life Cafeteria and a low-priced restaurant called Stewart's, faced each other across Sheridan Square. (The building once occupied by Stewart's, on Seventh Avenue South between Christopher and West Fourth Streets, now houses a General Nutrition Center.) Men with long hair, light makeup and stylized mannerisms used to meet behind the large plate-glass windows, observed like tropical fish by curious tourists.
It was an era in which the city abounded in rooming houses -- several in Manhattan, as well as the St. George Hotel in Brooklyn Heights, were rumored to be predominantly gay -- whose single tenants took their meals at inexpensive restaurants like these. Word soon spread about which cafeterias were tolerant of gays, at least at certain times of day.
"They worked on shifts," said Mr. Korie, referring to the late-night hours during which gays could safely gather at certain branches of Childs and Horn & Hardart, two major restaurant chains.
Horn & Hardart Automats were distinctive for dispensing food from little metal compartments. Their outposts were largely unsupervised, and thus attractive to gays.
In some cafeterias, owners tolerated only gays who did not draw attention to themselves. In others, customers were allowed to let their hair down. Notable for its permissiveness was the Childs on 59th Street near Columbus Circle, nicknamed "Mother Childs" because of its prime location on the gay compass, between Central Park and the theater district.
Another freewheeling Childs, at least in the wee hours, was in the Paramount Theater Building at Broadway and 43rd Street. Mr. Korie owns an illustration of a man decked out in what the lyricist imagines as the "Childs look": peroxided hair, a brightly colored tie and a little lip rouge. In a narrative that is part of the Carnegie Hall program, a middle-aged character describes the Childs crowd:
"At midnight, when I am in bed with a book, they 'drop hairpins' and 'camp' on the tabletops at Childs Restaurant in Times Square. I go only to order pancakes. I must lose weight."

Harlem Takes the Drag Ball To New Heights
In the 1920's, a daring new form of masquerade party was becoming popular in Greenwich Village, Midtown Manhattan and the area near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But the most spectacular and celebrated of these events, a resplendent annual drag ball, was held in Harlem.
"These made Wigstock look like an Off Off Broadway show," said Mr. Korie, as he headed north by cab in search of 280 West 155th Street, the former site of the Rockland Palace, where the Hamilton Lodge of the Odd Fellows fraternal society held annual drag balls in the 1920's and 30's. At their height in the late 30's, the balls drew 8,000 dancers and onlookers, blacks from Harlem and whites from throughout the city.
The site is now a parking lot beneath an overpass leading to the Macombs Dam Bridge. A sign advertises parking for Yankee Stadium, just across the Harlem River. Mr. Korie inspected the asphalt for vestiges of the past. "There are no tiaras lying around," he reported.
"This must have been a glamorous location, near the river," he added. In the gospel-tinged number "Sister Hallie Lujah," he imagines the grand entrances made at these events:
Sister Hallie Lujah
You're quite the nun tonight
There in your sequined wimple
You've got that 'inner light'
Another Harlem landmark in the history of gay New York is the Salem United Methodist Church. Now 97 years old, the brick building with a magnificent arched front window still stands at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 129th Street. It was there, in 1928, that the poet Countee Cullen entered into a brief marriage with Yolanda Du Bois, daughter of W. E. B. Du Bois. (Cullen then went on a honeymoon with the best man.) Cullen, like several members of the Harlem Renaissance, felt compelled to hide his sexual identity.
 
Well Before Bette Midler, The Baths Were the Place to Be
Mr. Korie's tour reached its coda as he stopped for a bite at the Broadway Diner at the southeast corner of 55th Street and Broadway. The building, mostly occupied by a Best Western Hotel, has no gay historical significance, but its lost twin, the Ariston apartment hotel just to the north, has a rich past. Its basement housed the Ariston Baths, which served an all-gay clientele in the early 20th century. As described in the song "Lunch at the Turkish Baths," this gathering place was a key stop:
My dining club isn't Ivy League,
Although it's exclusively male.
A haven of health and athletics
Devoted to manly aesthetics
Since one has to lunch,
I lunch with the bunch
Who lunch at the Turkish Baths
Commuters contentedly doze off.
A number I know with their clothes off.
How many men hide a nature belied
At lunch at the Turkish Baths?
Pleasantly passes the working day
Rested of body and brain.
Stopping to pick up a rose bouquet,
I race for the Westchester train.
A chap on the opposite aisle
Exchanges a sad little smile
Averting our eyes we assume our disguise
With our newspapers raised in denial
Over a salad at the diner, Mr. Korie recalled that his interest in New York's gay past intensified while he was writing "Harvey Milk" (with the composer Stewart Wallace) and interviewed Scott Smith, one of Milk's lovers, who died of AIDS in 1995. Mr. Smith told Mr. Korie that in the 50's, when Milk was a teenager living in Woodmere, N.Y., he had been arrested for cruising in the Ramble in Central Park. In Mr. Korie's eyes, ordinary gay people, as well as martyrs like Milk, are worthy of attention.
"When I walk the streets here," Mr. Korie said, "I feel that history, that those who came before me, engaged in the same issues that are still important to me today. There's hope for an answer here, and that's what entices other disenfranchised people, not just gays, to come to New York.
"It's in the air, even if the buildings aren't there anymore. That's why I'll always live in New York."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
The New Economy As Wired Catastrophe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Alan Cowell is the London-based financial correspondent for The Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE new economy is here, and its emblems have become the commonplaces of a wired world. It is as if history itself has been compressed in the rush to enhance efficiency and wealth.
Only a decade after the decline of the Filofax -- remember it? -- there is no longer any surprise that hand-held computers and cellular telephones offer e-mail and Internet access, even from sidewalk cafes. Devised for scientific research, the Internet has enfolded much of the industrialized world, supplanting the human interface. 
 A younger breed may embrace the networked society. But amid the scramble for riches that accompanies economic upheavals -- from the Industrial Revolution to the stirrings of a technological revolution based on electric power more than a century ago -- there are always those who say that humanity will pay a high price for its inventiveness.
If Jeremy Rifkin's "Age of Access" (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, $24.95) is anything to go by, then that price will outweigh the benefits for most people.
For the entrepreneur, the new economy, with its stress on marketing and electronic access, yields capitalism's final victory over the basic Marxist notion that ownership of the means of production is the font of all power. But Mr. Rifkin argues that for Western consumers, it is the ultimate defeat, transforming them into ciphers of "lifetime value" whose every act, 24 hours a day, will be based on a commercial transaction.
Books like "The End of Work" (Putnam, 1995) and "The Biotech Century" (Putnam, 1998) have established Mr. Rifkin, a fellow at the Wharton School's Executive Education Program, as a leading techno-pessimist. His latest book is no exception. For today's wired generation, he argues, the results represent nothing less than the victory of materialism over traditional society.
"Imagine a world," he says, "where virtually every activity outside the confines of family relations is a paid-for experience, a world in which traditional reciprocal obligations and expectations -- mediated by feelings of faith, empathy and solidarity -- are replaced by contractual relations in the form of paid memberships, subscriptions, admission charges, retainers and fees." He calls it "the crisis of postmodernity."
Mr. Rifkin's starting point is that the central principle underpinning a market economy -- ownership of property exchangeable in the marketplace -- is giving way to the idea of access to that same property for short-term, paid use.
Put bluntly, it is the basic mechanism of car-leasing invented many years ago: rather than owning an automobile, the motorist leases it for a while, gaining access, Mr. Rifkin says, to what is increasingly depicted as "the driving experience."
Within a networked economy, where outsourcing of work has come to replace full-time staff and where factories and physical capital may be accessed more easily than owned, the old, industrial principle "becomes increasingly marginal to the economic process."
But the transformation goes deeper. "While the industrial era was characterized by the commodification of work, the Age of Access is about, above all else, the commodification of play -- namely the marketing of cultural resources including rituals, the arts, festivals, social movements, spiritual and fraternal activity and civic engagement in the form of paid-for personal entertainment."
The nightmare, especially for an older generation, is that the individual becomes no more than a "lifetime value," defined as "the theoretical measure of how much a human being is worth if every moment of his or her life were to be commodified in one form or another in the commercial sphere."
It could be argued that it has always been this way. People in the developed world have long been ensnared in financial transactions, their every move from hospital delivery room to funeral parlor followed by large bills.
But the parallel drawn by Mr. Rifkin is the impact of industrial change on American homes when the wage economy transferred basic activities -- the baking of bread, for instance -- from the home to the marketplace. In the cyberspace revolution, he contends, the social impact will be greater, transferring much broader segments of human existence into a commercial arena far more pervasive than the corner bakery.
"What happens to the essential nature of human existence when it is sucked into an all-encompassing web of commercial relationships?" he asks.
THIS is a luxurious quandary, however, reserved for those with the wealth of the developed world. In one of the most stunning nuggets of information in the book, he points out that "more than half of the human race has never made a phone call." That is to say that technology has widened the gap between the haves and have-nots -- increasingly synonymous with the wired and the unwired.
The broader implication of Mr. Rifkin's book is that the ultimate losers are the individual and the open society. The winners are what he calls the gatekeepers who control access to "the popular culture and the geographic and cyberspace networks that expropriate, repackage and commodify the culture in the form of paid-for personal entertainment."
In this world, the survivors are "the new men and women" who have adjusted to the headlong pace of a wired society. For them, "being disconnected is death," he says. And the winners -- the new moguls replacing the oil and steel and railroad barons of a bygone era -- will be a handful of global media companies.
As a token of how rapidly his prophecies are being fulfilled, the Time Warner-America Online merger was announced as his book was awaiting publication, an event apparently too late for inclusion.
If there is a leap of faith, or rather pessimism, in Mr. Rifkin's study, it is in the conclusion that, while humanity has more or less coped with previous economic revolutions, from the Middle Ages onward, this time the challenge from cyberspace, from the wired world, will be too great.
Certainly, any regular Internet user is more than aware of the way that cyberspace has undermined traditional ideas of geography and supplanted judgments linked to physical space: an e-mail address is a far more nebulous concept than a street address with all its material and social implications.
But in a way, some people would argue, cyberspace also adds a dimension, broadening rather than narrowing the human experience in the quest for knowledge, information and connectedness with fellow humans.
Far more hazardous is the enormous commercial pressure that builds with the idea of an individual's lifetime value. One basic economic rule, as Mr. Rifkin points out, has not changed since Roman times: caveat emptor. In the brave new wired world, it will be ever more difficult for the buyer to beware of technology speeding forward in nanoseconds, controlled by global giants.

HEADLINE: The World;
After the Fall, Traffic In Flesh, Not Dreams

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE

 BODY:
IF anybody has borne the brunt of the changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union since the fall of Communism, it has been women. While the picture varies wildly from the relatively developed countries of central Europe to the huge, impoverished swaths of the Balkans, Russia and central Asia, women have not benefited from any economic gains as men have. At the same time, they appear to have disproportionately shouldered the stresses brought by a total change of life style.
Health care and child care have all but collapsed in many places. In some, fewer girls are finishing high school than 10 years ago. Between 1985 and 1997, a recently released United Nations study found, the transition to a market economy meant that the number of working women fell by 40 percent in Hungary, 21 percent in Russia and 24 to 31 percent in the Baltic states. Of course, men have lost jobs, too, and they often sink into apathy and alcoholism, women say. Women who might have hoped for a clerical or professional job under Communism find themselves forced into menial work -- frequently in the unprotected realm of the black economy -- to make ends meet while caring for children and keeping their family together. Some, indeed, are forced into prostitution, often after being trafficked abroad on the pretense that they will work as a maid or waitress. 
 "Women take the role of savior -- they try to save themselves, their family," said Olga Gerasymyuk, the host of a popular television program on social affairs in Ukraine. Women's magazines there promote what may seem to the West an idiosyncratic message of empowerment: "They teach them to save the gentle spirit of their husbands, who are at a loss," Ms. Gerasymyuk said.
Zina Mounla, who coordinates programs across the former Soviet bloc for the United Nations Development Fund for Women, said that statistics are hard to come by on how poorly women are doing compared to men in this shifting environment.
One area in which east European women have clearly regressed is in political representation. Under Communism, quotas ensured that one-third of the seats in the often nominal parliaments went to women. "Even now," said Gulmira Asanbayeva, an activist from Kyrgyzstan who promotes women's leadership, "we remember the names of famous women from the Soviet period," women who had the kind of political sway now exercised almost exclusively by men.
Ms. Asanbayeva, 22, was one of the 10,000 women estimated to have attended a conference in New York last week titled Beijing Plus Five, which examined the worldwide status of women five years after a giant gathering in Beijing that was attended by, among others, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who inspired heated debate in the United States over the wisdom of a first lady visiting China, with its poor human rights record. In hundreds of meetings, formally and informally, women discussed the gains made toward equality and set goals for the future.
Although Ms. Asanbayeva and several other eastern Europeans spoke out on women's causes, there was little indication that they would succeed at home any time soon. Lenka Simerska, 24, who works with the Gender Studies Center in Prague, said she feels far removed from the stresses of poverty described by women from the Balkans or the former Soviet Union. In the Czech Republic, she said, men were so long frustrated by the deadening hand of Communism that they took over everything after its fall in 1989. As a result, educated women seeking a good job often fall prey to chauvinist prejudices about leaving work to have children (paid maternity leave in the Czech Republic lasts up to three years) or taking time off to rear them; above all they lack mechanisms for righting perceived wrongs.
"Women's consciousness and solidarity are not great," Ms. Simerska said, predicting change only when "young women will slowly get angry, and something will happen."
FOR some women and girls, particularly the poor and undereducated, notions of power are unimaginable. Indeed the poorer and more uneducated the women are, the more likely it is that they will become involved in prostitution. Irene Freudenschuss-Reichl, Austria's delegate to Beijing Plus Five, estimated that half a million women from central and Eastern Europe are shipped abroad each year as part of the worldwide trafficking in prostitutes. A recent American study shows that an increasing share of the 45,000 to 50,000 such women traveling to the United States each year come from the former Soviet bloc.
Selma Gasi, 20, an activist with the Women to Women group in Bosnia, tells a particularly chilling tale of pimps, accompanied by older women, scouring the war-devastated villages, ostensibly for sitters or housemaids, and taking girls as young as 14 to strip-dancing bars where they become prostitutes.
Ms. Mounla said this is not unique to the Balkans; it is seen in Ukraine and Russia, where pimps have been known to take teenagers from orphanages that release them at age 16. Some women know they are going to work as prostitutes, she said, but that doesn't mean they should forfeit all their rights.
Yasmina Dimiskovska, of the Union of Women in Macedonia, said Russian and Ukrainian women are trafficked through her country to Italy, or their passports seized locally and they are sent to strip-dancing bars. Again, statistics are hard to come by, but 40 women came from Ukraine last month alone, she said.
"We can talk to them, go to the police," Ms. Dimiskovska said. But "there is no shelter willing to help" women who lack official identity papers. If they are shipped home, she added, they risk repercussions from the criminals who first sent them abroad. "It's a circle which can't be stopped," she said. "I think they cannot do anything."

The Quiet Allure of Coupon Clippers

BYLINE: By Alex Berenson

 BODY:
COUPONS. Cue-pons.
No matter how one says the word, it does not exactly send shivers down most investors' spines. For chat-room tyros who expect to make their first million day-trading by age 27, paging through the Sunday newspaper with a pair of scissors just to save a couple of cents on Cheetos seems so, well, old economy. 
 Which brings us to Valassis Communications, a quiet favorite of Wall Street analysts and some mutual fund managers, including Mark Greenberg of the the $550 million Invesco Leisure fund. Valassis is Mr. Greenberg's third-largest holding.
"It's a very good business, a very good company that no one on Wall Street cares about," Mr. Greenberg said. But he expects that to change over time, as Valassis turns in steady growth. "It's an absurdly cheap stock," he said, noting that shares trade at less than half the price-to-earnings multiple of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Based in Livonia, Mich., Valassis has about half the market for printing and distributing the coupon inserts that fatten Sunday newspapers nationwide. Valassis splits the coupon distribution market about evenly with News America, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and neither company is particularly aggressive on price, analysts say.
"It's competition, but it's not ferocious competition. It's not too much of a price-competition business," said Troy Mastin, an analyst at Raymond James, a brokerage firm based in St. Petersburg, Fla. "I think they both understand that if they get aggressive on price, there's a response from the other."
Yet the business remains extremely difficult for new entrants to crack, because it has relatively high fixed costs that cannot be recouped without a critical mass of advertisers, Mr. Mastin said. And most potential advertisers are tied to Valassis or the News Corporation by contracts more than a year long. So since the early 1990's, when a would-be competitor lost more than $50 million trying to enter the market, Valassis and News have had the coupon industry pretty much to themselves.
As a result, Valassis' gross profit margins were almost 40 percent of sales last year, and its net income was 15 percent of sales. The company earned $121 million, or $2.04 a share, on sales of $794 million. Even better, that per-share profit figure was up 35 percent from 1998.
This year, analysts expect the gains to continue. Officially, most analysts expect Valassis to earn $2.43 a share in 2000, but Valassis has a habit of beating posted estimates, and their unofficial consensus is closer to $2.50. Valassis shares closed on Friday at $35.0625, so even if the company does nothing more than meet official estimates for the year, it is trading at just over 14 times earnings.
"They've got a very strong track record of growing earnings in excess of 20 percent," said Edward Atorino, an analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities. "It's been one of my favorite stocks."
In addition, the nature of the coupon business means that Valassis is likely to prosper whether the United States economy is strong or weak. "In recessionary times, coupons are used to move product," Mr. Mastin said. "In good times, there tend to be more new product rollouts."
Then there is the Internet, which is both an opportunity and a threat to Valassis. So-called reverse auction companies like Priceline WebHouse Club, which theoretically enable consumers to "name their own price" for groceries, have the potential to take business from Valassis. On the other hand, Valassis is testing Internet coupons at its majority-owned Web site, save.com, and the results so far have been promising, Mr. Mastin said. Because Internet coupons have no printing or distribution costs, gross margins on them could top 90 percent for Valassis, he said.
It is still too early to tell whether Valassis will be a winner in the Internet coupon business, Mr. Greenberg said. However, given the health of the company's core printed coupon business, he is not worrying unduly about the matter.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
A Cable Company With a Multimedia Shield

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
HAVE you checked your cable bill lately? Average rates have risen 33 percent over the last five years, and the pace shows few signs of letting up. That may irk the nearly 70 million cable subscribers in the United States, but it would seem to be good news for cable stock investors.
So why is the Paul Kagan Associates index of cable company stocks down 21.8 percent this year through Friday, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is flat? Investors see problems for the industry, especially in the growing popularity of satellite television providers like Hughes Electronics' DirecTV and EchoStar Communications' Dish Network. Not helping is a recent poll by the Yankee Group, a research firm, that showed 46 percent of satellite subscribers rated their service as excellent, versus just 15 percent for cable subscribers. 
 But none of that should dissuade investors from ponying up for the shares of one cable company, according to some analysts and money managers. They say Cablevision Systems, the Bethpage, N.Y., company that provides service to 2.9 million people in the New York area, should bear up better than most cable companies under the satellite onslaught.
"They're one of the least-vulnerable cable companies out there," said Tom Eagan, a PaineWebber analyst who recently upgraded his recommendation on the stock.
The number of Cablevision subscribers grew 2.4 percent in the first quarter, versus 2 percent growth for the industry, even as satellite companies were heavily promoting their services in the metropolitan area.
Cablevision benefits because good satellite reception is relatively hard to get in urban areas like New York. But the company has also been rolling out enhanced analog set-top boxes that allow subscribers to receive as many as 110 channels, versus about 50 with its old boxes. And it is converting its network to digital, which will improve picture resolution, and plans to introduce Sony digital boxes later this year that provide still more channels.
"They're going to be the first cable provider that converts to 100 percent digital, which will give them an enormous amount of capacity that will really dwarf every other network," said Ray Katz, an analyst at Bear Stearns.
Mr. Eagan expects Cablevision's pro-forma earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization to hit $1.3 billion in 2001, up 18 percent from this year. At $68.9375, its shares are down 8.7 percent this year, trading for just 10 times his estimate of 2000 cash flow, low enough to prompt takeover talk.
Cablevision itself is selling its Cleveland system to Adelphia Communications for $1.53 billion. In April, it agreed to swap its Boston system with AT&T for 125,500 customers in the northern suburbs of New York City, plus $878 million in AT&T stock and $284 million cash. Mr. Eagan values the deals at roughly 20 times cash flow, far higher than Cablevision's own multiple; he notes that the swap will strengthen its grip on the metropolitan market.
FOCUSING on one market is a risky strategy, one that could set up Cablevision for a tumble should the New York City economy -- dangerously dependent on Wall Street -- falter. But the New York market is the most lucrative in the nation, and Cablevision's geographic focus has let it develop a kind of vertical integration that is unprecedented in the cable business, allowing for profitable synergies. No other company has tried to build the type of multimedia network -- cable, entertainment, telephone and Internet access -- that Cablevision executives are seeking.
The synergies come in part from Cablevision's 74 percent interest in Rainbow Media Holdings, owner of Madison Square Garden, its cable network and the three professional sports teams -- the Rangers, the Knicks and the Liberty -- that play there. Rainbow also owns Radio City Entertainment and holds stakes in the American Movie Classics and Bravo cable channels.
Cablevision itself owns some high profile New York properties, including Clearview Cinemas and the Wiz, the electronics retailer.
The benefits of its intertwined holdings can add up. Knicks games, for example, are often shown exclusively on the MSG Network, allowing the company to avoid paying for expensive broadcast rights. The Wiz sells cable modem systems at a steep discount, fostering the galloping growth of Cablevision's high-speed cable Internet service, which has more than 70,500 subscribers. And Lightpath, Cablevision's fledgling local phone company, could provide more of the cross-pollination that has already impressed analysts.
"They're really leveraging their properties off one another," said Robert G. Routh, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann. "They're basically becoming New York's entertainment company."
Jim Jundt, portfolio manager at Jundt Associates, a money management firm in St. Louis Park, Minn., said: "New York is a unique situation, and they own some unique properties. I think they are doing a smart thing." He has about 2.5 percent of his firm's assets in Cablevision, which he says is worth $123 a share.
 THE company is planning to shuffle more assets. It expects to issue a tracking stock in August to represent the earnings stream of its Rainbow Media stake, but Cablevision does not expect Madison Square Garden or its sports teams to be included in the deal. That would let Cablevision monetize some of the programming assets it controls, which typically trade for far higher multiples than cable systems.
Still, it is unclear how long Cablevision will remain independent. AT&T already owns more than 30 percent of its stock, and has been buying cable systems. Time Warner controls the most profitable piece of New York's cable market, Manhattan, so it has also been mentioned as a possible acquirer.
Charles S. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, and his son James L. Dolan, chief executive, together with their family, control 80 percent of its voting shares. They have declined to comment on any possible sale.
"If they want to sell it, you won't have to worry about buyers because there will be a line of them," said Mr. Katz, the Bear Stearns analyst. He figures that Cablevision would probably fetch twice its current price if acquired. Absent a buyout, he has a 12-month target of $85 to $90 on the stock.

Making 'Easy' Stand for 'Budget'

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
STELIOS HAJI-IOANNOU is the first to admit that he likes the finer things in life. "My ideal hangout would be a gentleman's club," he said, laughing, during a $70 breakfast for two here at the One Aldwych Hotel, where he stays when he is not home in his Monaco penthouse. "I'm not the typical person like my customers. I come from a wealthy family."
Indeed, Mr. Haji-Ioannou (pronounced HA-ji-oh-AHN-oo) is very rich. But he also happens to be the founder of the EasyGroup, a feisty London company that has spawned a bevy of brands here representing all things on the cheap. 
 There is EasyJet, his first creation, which in Europe mimics Southwest Airlines, the rollicking low-cost carrier in the United States. Then there is EasyEverything, a chain of huge Internet cafes, most in Britain but spreading across Europe, that each boast upward of 500 computer terminals offering cheap Internet access. He has just announced that he will take the concept stateside, to Times Square, this fall. And then there is his latest idea, EasyRentacar, taking the low-cost concept to car rental in Europe. A Web site called easy.com, intended to be a discount portal for his own and other companies, is also in the works.
The son of a Greek shipping tycoon, Mr. Haji-Ioannou, 33 and single ("I never have time. I'm always working."), did not exactly have it difficult. So how does such a loaded man relate to his budget-conscious customers? "It's difficult when you have so much money," he lamented.
IN fact, he comes across less as a pampered heir than as an ambitious but irreverent man on the move. Mr. Haji-Ioannou has steadily evolved into a Greek version of Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, championing consumer rights as an underdog fighting the establishment. Both have the same favorite corporate pinata: British Airways.
When British Airways started its own low-cost carrier, Go Airlines, two years ago, Mr. Haji-Ioannou went to court seeking, without success, to ground it. He contended that British Airways was unfairly using market dominance to pressure airlines like his.
Like Sir Richard, who painted "No Way B.A./A.A." on the tail fins of his planes to protest British Airways' proposed alliance with American Airlines, Mr. Haji-Ioannou has found offbeat ways to needle his rival. On the home page of EasyJet's Web site, he challenges customers to "guess how much money B.A.'s low-cost clone has lost this year and win a pair of free flights!"
Also like Sir Richard, Mr. Haji-Ioannou has become a celebrity of sorts here, appearing regularly on television and staging elaborate publicity stunts. On the day Go started flying, for example, Mr. Haji-Ioannou and his colleagues booked tickets on the inaugural flight, wearing EasyJet shirts in the company's customary bright orange, and handed out free plane tickets for his airline to other passengers.
While Mr. Haji-Ioannou may not need to count pennies -- or even have his businesses turn a profit -- he says EasyJet is profitable; he is planning an initial public offering in London this July. In his latest published financial statements, for the year ended September 1998, EasyJet flew 1.7 million passengers and earned $3.5 million. The airline has recently added 15 planes to its fleet, for a total of 33.
Mr. Haji-Ioannou confirmed that his other businesses have yet to show that they can become profitable, saying that for now he was spending heavily to expand them. But his management style is clearly not about the dowdy details, like making money.
"You don't need to be hands-on," he said. The reason he expanded his empire, he added, is that, in the airline business, "I was delegating myself out of a job." "I was more interested in starting companies and the concept than being hands-on," he said.
Mr. Haji-Ioannou wasn't always on the maverick entrepreneur path. "I was meant to be a successor to my father," he said, explaining that he became interested in business as a child, "as soon as I stopped believing I could be a footballer" -- or soccer player, in British terms.
After graduating from the London School of Economics in 1987, he returned to Athens to work for his father's company, Troodos Shipping. Unfortunately, his father's business was, as he put it, "a one-man show," and he was not that man. So he persuaded his father to let him start his own shipping company in 1992. "This was considered major rebellion," he said.
That company, Stelmar Tankers of Athens, which is still in business, soon became successful, and he began looking for other investment opportunities.
During a visit to the United States in 1994, he took a flight on Southwest Airlines and became hooked. "I used to always travel business class," he said. "But I contracted the aviation bug. It was totally irrational."
His father lent him the $7.5 million he needed to start EasyJet in 1995; his older brother, Polys, and his younger sister, Clelia, also have stakes.
Mr. Haji-Ioannou almost single-handedly created the budget airline niche within Britain by resorting to out-of-the-way airports like Luton, outside London, and offering fewer amenities than even Southwest. Now he has set his sights on the Internet, where he got a taste of its potency by selling EasyJet tickets.
ORIGINALLY, he wanted to create a pure dot-com but concluded, "I couldn't get myself around a completely virtual business." So he resorted to building a gigantic new breed of Internet cafe. With EasyEverything set to cross the Atlantic this fall, Mr. Haji-Ioannou and New York will get their first real tastes of each other. But then he has been traveling there for decades, business class -- though no longer on British Airways.

HEADLINE: U.S. vs. MICROSOFT: Microsoftat the Razor's Edge;
From Experts, Advice on an Amicable Split

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
IMAGINE Microsoft's top officials sitting down with an agitated William H. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, their fuming chief executive, moments after the headlines reporting the unthinkable start crossing computer screens at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters: "Last Appeal Turned Down."
They never believed it would come to this when Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled so long ago that the company had violated antitrust laws and should be split in two. They still feel, as the company's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial, that breaking the company up is not only unjustified but also a "hopelessly complex" assignment. They fear that skilled employees, Microsoft's main asset in the fast-evolving software business, will abandon the company in droves. 
 But there is no point in whining when the challenge at hand is to transform this disaster into a launching pad for future prosperity. The cliche on everyone's mind is making lemonade out of lemons. They look at one another and wonder how many in the room will decide it is not worth the trouble.
Of course, if such a meeting ever occurs, it will not be Microsoft's first discussion of the unthinkable. Although Microsoft says that it has not done so yet, the company will certainly have begun serious planning for the court-ordered breakup before its last legal card is played. Painful as it might be for Mr. Gates and the other senior managers who have led Microsoft's 23-year ascent from start-up to colossus, their obligations to shareholders, employees, suppliers and customers will not allow them to assume until the bitter end that the company will emerge whole from its antitrust nightmare.
Indeed, if Microsoft heeds the advice of many experts, it might conclude long before the appeals process is exhausted that the best course is to hasten the split -- especially if it can negotiate more favorable terms in a consent decree.
"They need to move forward at Internet speed," said Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason, a professor of information economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. "Even if they win the appeal, they'll face further lawsuits if they continue doing business as they did."
Moreover, uncertainty about the future could spur the exodus of talent that Microsoft fears most. "The worst thing you can do is spend months studying the optimal plan," said Patricia L. Anslinger, a corporate strategy consultant with McKinsey & Company, summing up her research on divestitures.
The absence of deadlines allows battles to fester over intellectual property, key people and other assets. Employees fret about their compensation, job security and where to focus their effort. Recruiters love such turmoil -- and raid with a vengeance when they see it, Ms. Anslinger added.
"I think they should embrace the breakup concept," said Roger McNamee, a partner at Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "These are really talented people. It will unleash a creative energy that is good for customers and employees."
IF the day comes when Microsoft follows Mr. McNamee's advice -- or simply runs out of legal maneuvering room -- the company will not have to look far for pertinent lessons from other corporate splits.
"There are hundreds of divestitures each year," noted David I. Levine, an economics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. "There is nothing historic, in an organizational sense, in dividing a large company."
Recent examples include Hewlett-Packard's spinoff of Agilent Technologies, the divestiture by General Motors of its Delphi parts subsidiaries, and AT&T's 1996 spinoffs of Lucent Technologies and NCR, the largest voluntary breakup ever.
That same year, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing divested Imation, which included data storage and imaging businesses with well over $1 billion in annual sales but scant profits.
"We were a start-up, a turnaround and a large company all at the same time," said William Monahan, Imation's chairman and chief executive, recalling the company's tough early months.
One of 3M's first steps was to address what experts say could be Microsoft's biggest challenge -- calming employees -- by sorting out within just two weeks of the spinoff announcement who would go with Imation and who would stay with 3M.
Mr. Monahan said he felt it was crucial to quickly recruit a strong, independent board of directors -- including Marvin Mann, who had led Lexmark, the printer manufacturer, through its spinoff from I.B.M.
He brought in outside executives to round out his 3M-bred team, including Robert Edwards, a chief financial officer experienced in mergers and acquisitions from his days in the railroad industry, and Brad Allen, an investor relations executive known on Wall Street from his days at Digital Equipment and Cray Computer.
Another early priority for Mr. Monahan was benchmarking against other companies, including Lexmark, to establish an appropriate set of best practices. "Management has to have a good idea of what's possible," he said.
But the single most important lesson that Mr. Monahan learned was the need to aggressively focus the newly independent business on serving its customers.
"You are busy establishing new reporting systems, a new supply chain and many other things that impact a lot of your people," he said, projects that can easily divert attention from customers' needs.
Because of Microsoft's heavy reliance on stock options, revising pay packages would be one of the trickiest problems that Microsoft would face in any breakup.
"Most companies don't have so many people with enough wealth to matter tied up in options," Mr. Levine said.
Past practice at other companies suggests that Microsoft options would be rewritten so that employees ended up with most of their wealth tied to the stock of whichever Microsoft offshoot they joined. But that would redistribute risk in ways that could quickly become painful, if the stocks moved in different directions.
"There's no easy answer," Mr. Levine said.
Compensation is closely related to another key divestiture issue: the creation of new corporate cultures. Experts say one of the most common mistakes in corporate split-ups is that both parties maintain their familiar methods of communication, evaluation, training and promotion, along with benefits and behaviors that make up a company's spirit.
"If you don't try to create a new culture, employees see no change other than being smaller," Ms. Anslinger said.
The involuntary nature of the Microsoft breakup and the limits on its future conduct imposed by Judge Jackson would present special challenges.
"Both sides will still be monopolies barred from a lot of things other companies do every day in forming strategic alliances," said Benjamin Gomes-Casseres, a professor who studies such cooperative ventures at Brandeis University's Graduate School of International Economics and Finance.
The best response, some experts say, would be for each side of the business to examine aggressively all the technical options that had been closed off by the need to support the old, integrated company.
"Stressing the new opportunities should energize the employees," said Willow Sheremata, who teaches technology management at Tulane University. For example, she said, Microsoft software applications like Word might blossom with a range of useful new attributes if programmers were pushed to develop versions for Linux and other operating systems, instead of maximizing their fit with Microsoft's Windows operating system.
But other strategists said the applications arm, like any other business, should make its major markets its priority. That would mean working as closely with Microsoft's operating arm as the government will allow.
 THAT does not mean, though, that the two companies should continue to live side by side on the sprawling suburban campus headquarters that is home to nearly half of Microsoft's 38,000 employees.
Physical separation is an important aid to a successful divestiture, said Mr. Monahan, who moved Imation from 3M's campus in St. Paul to Oakdale, Minn., several miles east.
"Where we stayed put in 3M buildings overseas for economic reasons, people were slower to move on emotionally," he said.
Which company gets the Microsoft name, which keeps the Redmond campus, how the patents and other intellectual property are divided up, how Microsoft's cash ($21 billion as of March 30) is distributed -- all are issues that would have to be resolved before a split.
But a decisive question for many of Microsoft's constituencies, from Wall Street to the lowliest programmer -- and, therefore, one of the first that ought to be settled in any breakup -- is Whither Bill?
"Bill Gates may be a convicted monopolist," Mr. Levine said. "But he's the world's most famous executive, and arguably the most successful."

High-Priced Humble Pie

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

 BODY:
When President Clinton moved from Portugal to Germany to Russia to Ukraine on his European tour, he tried to dispel the notion of the United States as a global bully. In Aachen, Germany, he said that if it hadn't been for Europe, "there never would have been an America in the first place." In Moscow, he promised that the United States would never dictate to Russia how it should behave.
But he has learned the hard way that Europeans don't like it when America fails to lead on critical issues -- as it failed, for example, early in the Bosnia war. So even as Mr. Clinton laced his oratory with humility, he was also telling his audiences precisely what America wanted them to do -- in trade, in defense, in nuclear security and, in the cases of Russia and Ukraine, in political and economic reform. 
 Indeed, one thing Americans were telling others to do was to underwrite most of the cost of the major arms control achievement of the Clinton trip: an agreement for the United States and Russia to each dispose of 34 metric tons of their surplus weapons-grade plutonium. Only a small fraction of the $5.75 billion cost has been raised and unless other countries contribute, the agreement will not be implemented. ELAINE SCIOLINO

What a Year This Has Been! But Which One?

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is an argument to be made that modern politics and science fiction have a great deal in common, from unusual life forms to freaky and largely inexplicable phenomena. But they are perhaps most similar in this regard: both exhibit a peculiar fascination with time travel.
For example, you probably think you are watching the presidential race of 2000. Wrong. It is really 1988, or at least that is where many political scientists and Democratic strategists will transport you. They cite the familiar dynamic of a vice president (George H.W. Bush then, Al Gore now) who belonged to a successful administration and whose apparent disadvantage against a heavily promoted governor (Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts then, George W. Bush of Texas now) turned out to be temporary. 
 Or perhaps it is 1960, as other political scientists and Republican strategists would have you believe. The vice president (Richard M. Nixon then, Mr. Gore now) cannot trade on his administration's high regard in the face of an upbeat, arguably more charismatic challenger (John F. Kennedy then, Mr. Bush now), who ultimately prevails.
Any takers for 1992? That was when the administration in power was challenged and eventually defeated by an intermittently folksy southerner (Bill Clinton then, Mr. Bush now), who was attacked as both a foreign policy know-nothing and the chief executive of a state (Arkansas then, Texas now) with abysmally low national ratings on several important issues.
"Pick any year," conceded Allan J. Lichtman, chairman of the history department at American University, "and you're going to find some similarities."
That is what a plethora of prognosticators are doing, to the point where the first presidential election of a new millennium is being presented as deja vu all over again.
Maybe, as Mr. Lichtman theorized, it is because the 2000 presidential election hasn't proved terribly interesting so far. The economy is peachy, we're not at war and the two principal candidates have overlapping pedigrees (sons of famous politicians, graduates of prep school and the Ivy League).
Or maybe the very difficulty of predicting the outcome makes rummaging through the past for a vision of the future more seductive.
Whatever the cause, the practice is rampant. At a briefing for reporters in Austin, Tex., last week, Mr. Bush's advisers variously mentioned 1960, 1968, 1980 and 1988 as providing omens favorable to their candidate. One of the advisers dwelled for a bit on 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter, the incumbent. By this example, a Republican governor tarred by opponents as risky and extremist defeated a nationally known quantity who was regarded as perhaps a little dull and pious.
Karl Rove, the Bush campaign's chief strategist, has been known to derive inspiration from as far back as 1896, when William McKinley, a Republican governor, united a divided party and reached out to new groups of voters. He was reaching out to immigrants; Mr. Bush is making his appeal to minorities.
Martin P. Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine, is not buying it. "It's definitely not 1896," he said, "because that was a realignment election. Although, if Bush does win big, then I guess it could be 1896." Then again, he added, "1988 sounds pretty good to me."
But it does not sound good to Henry F. Graff, a retired professor of history at Columbia University who has written extensively about the American presidency.
"I'd have to say 1960, when you had a vice president running against an upstart," said Mr. Graff, who played down 1988 for several reasons. Mr. Dukakis's period of ascendance in polls, he noted, was briefer than Mr. Bush's has been, and it came when he was less familiar to voters than Mr. Bush is now.
Then there are the scholars who do not look for any one year but rather devise a timeless recipe -- a teaspoon of economic growth, a soupcon of the current president's approval rating, a dash of voters' appetite for change -- that explains and predicts the outcome of every election.
"It's much more informative," said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University whose mathematical model augurs a victory by Mr. Gore.
THAT, of course, would violate the example of 1960, but it would confirm the lessons of 1988, and maybe even 1908 and 1928, when the departing president's designated successor -- in each case, admittedly, someone other than the vice president -- succeeded him.
Mr. Graff acknowledged that it is all just a guessing game, with no year exactly like any other, for an exceedingly simple reason: "History does not repeat itself."
His scientific proof? "These candidates running around now, in their dress-down clothing, don't look like anything in the history books."

Oligopoly

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A nice irony of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision last week is that he rejected the suggestion of smashing the world's most powerful software company into a bunch of "Baby Bills," and instead proposed to split Microsoft into two behemoths that would dominate their respective markets.
In fact, a major legacy of the Clinton administration will be that it encouraged one of the greatest periods of industrial concentration in American history, affecting old and new sectors ranging from oil and pharmaceuticals, to telecommunications, broadcasting and the Internet. Call it the Age of Oligopoly. 
 Corporate mergers have grown so frequent and so large, said Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, that "there's not a week that goes by that we're not called upon to review a big merger that has significant implications for the marketplace."
The Seven Sister oil companies have shrunk to five (or even fewer if you consider the joint marketing and production agreements between them); the seven Baby Bells are now four; and American and foreign car producers, once great rivals, are now intertwined to the point where it is difficult to figure out who actually manufactures the Mercedes, Chrysler, Nissan or Volvo next to you at a traffic light.
As last week's headlines made clear, no corner of the economy seems untouched. Executives from the parent company of American Airlines were in talks about possible mergers with Delta or Northwest, prompted by United Airlines's decision to acquire USAir. The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&T's acquisition of MediaOne, troubling consumer advocates by clearing the way for the emergence of a company that will control about a third of the cable television market, large television programming units, and the biggest high-speed Internet service.
There may be a new round of packaged food mergers, set off after Unilever, the maker of Lipton Tea, Ragu tomato sauces and Breyers ice cream, offered $20 billion to buy Bestfoods, producer of Skippy peanut butter, Mueller's pastas and Thomas' English muffins.
While there are undoubted economic benefits to consolidation -- cheaper goods, more uniform quality and better distribution -- economics and antitrust theory cannot measure the fundamental changes in the character and quality of life that comes with size. For example, economic analysis won't tell how to deal with, say, the merger of banks and insurance companies and the potential privacy threats that result when one company holds both your medical and financial records.
The gospel that bigness is not necessarily badness has been preached on both sides of the political aisle for about 20 years. During the 12 years of the Reagan and Bush administrations, an era widely remembered for frenzied merger activity and devotion to a laissez-faire regulatory approach, there were 44,518 mergers and acquisitions in the United States, with a combined value of $2.17 trillion, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. By contrast, the seven-and-a-half years of the Clinton administration have witnessed 71,811 corporate deals valued at $6.66 trillion.
"We live in perhaps the most dynamic economy in at least a generation or more," Mr. Pitofsky said. "There are many firms trying to adjust to new economic circumstances and global competition, striving to find new efficiencies. That's all fine with us. It's the relatively few mergers that present problems."
Over all, however, the days of Small Is Beautiful, the title of E.F. Schumacher's 60's paean to smallness of economic scale, now seem a quaint relic of an earlier age. "We can't go back to a Jeffersonian world or a literal Brandeis concern about human-sized institutions because we'd pay a terrible efficiency price in terms of technological innovation and global competitiveness," said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust expert at Columbia Law School. "The trick is take account of the modern needs for efficiency but still use antitrust to give us workably competitive markets."
When is a marketplace sufficiently competitive in the minds of regulators?
"Antitrust authorities don't worry about consolidation per se, they only worry about it when it gets to the tipping point," said Robert Litan, a former antitrust official in the Justice Department and now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. That point, in many cases, is reached when a market is effectively controlled by just one or two players, he said.
There have been some notable instances when the Clinton administration has blocked or restructured mergers that would have passed unscathed under the Republicans. Still, more than 95 percent of the cases reviewed have encountered no resistance from Federal antitrust officials.
Thus far, only a handful of critics and lawmakers have raised concerns about the increasing size of corporations and concentration of markets, though some are questioning whether antitrust law is able to factor in the non-economic costs of all the dealmaking.
When the F.C.C., for instance, approved AT&T's merger with MediaOne, only one of the commissioners expressed any significant concern about the declining number of media voices that will result from the deal.
Noting that the commission's approval means that five companies will control 40 of the 59 viable cable networks, the commissioner, Gloria Tristani, wrote, "It's time for the FCC to realize that we are not dealing with bottled water or sneakers, but with the dissemination of news and information -- the lifeblood of our democratic way of life. In the last few years, the number of entitles that control what people watch on television has dwindled to alarming levels. With this decision, the F.C.C. has failed yet again to stem this crisis and ensure a robust marketplace of ideas."
Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership and a professor of media studies at New York University, said current antitrust tools fail to recognize what is actually lost by all the mergers.
"The danger of media concentration lies not in the risk of prices getting higher, which is what antitrust measures," Professor Miller said. "The real danger is much subtler. You're talking about the disappearance of alternative views. You're talking about an exponential increase in conflicts of interest. You're talking about fewer interests having greater market power. You're talking about the rise of trivial programming. These are consequences that are extremely troubling, that worry most Americans, but that don't attract any kind of sustained political or judicial attention because they are not simply economically quantifiable."
At present, the march to oligopoly seems irreversible. Microsoft, if broken up into separate operating systems and applications companies, will hardly be high-tech start-ups in a garage. They will cover the world with their products. "Technology will not go backwards and the integration of markets will not go backwards and the growth of the global shareholder, putting more and more countries and companies under the microscope of investor scrutiny will not go backwards," said Daniel Yergin, whose book, "The Commanding Heights," is about the changing balance between governments and international markets.
But the same forces that have helped propel growth could slow it down, if not reverse it. Globalization has been financed largely by the world's investors, particularly institutions like pension and retirement funds, which relentlessly seek higher returns for their money. This has put enormous pressure on companies to find new markets and produce ever stronger quarterly earnings.
An economic downturn could cause investors to pull their money out of stocks, and lead governments to erect barriers to free trade. This would make it harder and less profitable for multinationals to sell their products around the globe.
Still, the world shouldn't hold its breath waiting for businesses to shrink. There is just too much commercial logic on the side of size. The real job ahead is for governments and individuals to learn how to benefit from and to some extent control the vast corporations the age has spawned.

The Last Refuge

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Wednesday Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered a breakup of Microsoft along the lines proposed by the Justice Department. In so doing he in effect dismissed concerns about the economic impact of such a breakup, and accepted the claim by Justice that splitting up Microsoft would accelerate innovation.
On the same day, technology guru Nicholas Negroponte, speaking in London, bitterly attacked Britain's recent auction of licenses for next-generation mobile telecommunications. Although selling the licenses to the highest bidders has enriched Her Majesty's Treasury by $35 billion, he argued that they should instead have been given to firms that would do best in "stimulating innovation, stimulating the economy, stimulating the whole telecommunications process." And last week the French decided not to emulate Britain's auction, instead allocating licenses in a "beauty contest" (their phrase!) based on "merit." 
 What do these stories have in common? In each case conventional economic analysis of costs and benefits has been brushed aside, in favor of guesses about the effects of policy on technological innovation.
In the case of the Microsoft decision, textbook economics says that a breakup of the kind now ordered, aside from disrupting the firm itself, will actually exacerbate the problem of monopoly power, raising prices and increasing market distortions. But Justice has argued -- and convinced Judge Jackson -- that these conventional costs are outweighed by what it expects to be increased incentives to innovate.
In the case of telecom licenses, textbook economics says that the way to ensure efficient use of a scarce resource is to sell rights to that resource to the highest bidders. But Mr. Negroponte and the French government have argued instead that governments should try to judge on other criteria who will do the most good with those rights, even if this involves an implicit multibillion-dollar handout of taxpayer money.
Now in both cases the opponents of conventional economic reasoning might be right. But on the other hand they might be utterly wrong -- that is, instead of offsetting the well-understood conventional costs of their proposals with unconventional benefits, they may be compounding them with unconventional costs. The truth is that we don't know very much about what promotes innovation, and even some of what we think we know may not be true. For example, advocates of the breakup of Microsoft like to point to the breakup of AT&T, which everyone thinks was purely positive in its effects on innovation. It's a bad parallel in many ways, but still it is interesting to notice that next-generation telecommunications is not yet a hot issue in the United States, because thanks to the fragmentation of our cellular system we are lagging well behind Europe and Japan in mobile phone technology. And that fragmentation is in part a legacy of the AT&T breakup.
My point is not that it is wrong to consider the impact of policy on innovation; it is that because the determinants of innovation are not well understood, clever advocates can invoke technological progress as an all-purpose justification for whatever policy they favor. In times past the case against Microsoft might have been overtly populist, with Rooseveltian tirades against "malefactors of great wealth." But these days we're supposed to approve of entrepreneurs who get rich. So even though much of the real animus against Microsoft involves fear of its power and wealth -- remember the T-shirts showing Bill Gates as a Borg, with the caption "Resistance is futile. Prepare to be assimilated" -- the official argument for breakup claims that splitting Microsoft will be good for technology.
And everyone knows that France's "beauty contest" will, not incidentally, give an advantage to French companies over other European firms that would have been able and willing to pay more. In times past the French would have openly admitted their preference for "national champions," but in these days of European unity such language would be diplomatically incorrect. So officially this policy, too, is all about promoting technology.
In short, the promise of technological benefits has become the universal policy justification. Does a proposal seem to cost taxpayers billions or raise prices to consumers? Never mind -- it will promote innovation! And maybe it will; or maybe in the 21st century, technology, not patriotism, has become the last refuge of a scoundrel.

HEADLINE: How Well-Read Should a President Be?

BYLINE: By Michael Beschloss; Michael Beschloss, the author most recently of "Taking Charge," on the Johnson White House tapes, is writing a history of the Lincoln assassination.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Lyndon Johnson was no great reader. But his handlers thought he had better look like one. Thus when Life's Hugh Sidey questioned Johnson's staff about his reading habits, all swore that L.B.J. was a voracious reader. But when pressed for examples, aide after aide mentioned the same book -- Barbara Ward's "The Rich Nations and the Poor Nations."
Johnson's former press secretary, George Reedy, observed years later that his boss's I.Q. "took a back seat to very few others." "But," Reedy said, "he simply could not see a concept without an immediate, pragmatic objective." 
 Among the modern presidents, Johnson was hardly alone. If an intellectual is defined as someone passionately interested in ideas for their own sake, then in the past century, we have sent exactly one intellectual to the White House -- Woodrow Wilson. Yet it seems that in every presidential campaign season, we demand that our candidates prove their depth. They are asked to tell us the books they've read, what presidents they've been influenced by, how they did in school. This campaign season has proved no exception, and attention has been focused on the presidential finalist George W. Bush.
Certainly no one would argue that intellectual curiosity is unimportant in a president. But much as a historian who writes books might prefer to argue otherwise, it is harder to make the case that great leaders must be great scholars.
Wilson was a political scientist who had spent his career imagining what presidents must do to influence Congress and the people. Wilson's great achievement as president was to persuade Americans, with impressive subtlety, to accept radical economic reforms and internationalism.
In those days, before the age of mass media and mass participation, a president had to convince the elites that owned newspapers and ran political organizations of his cause. This allowed and even encouraged the nuances of a political philosopher. But Wilson was so much more a man of theory than of action that he resisted compromise and sabotaged his own effort to win American participation in the League of Nations.
Ronald Reagan's presidential persona was almost the opposite of Wilson's. Mr. Reagan was a puckish booster for Calvin Coolidge and Franklin Roosevelt (he admired F.D.R.'s dramatic style, not his ideology), and he was conversant with the ideas of Russell Kirk and some other conservative thinkers of his day, which he used to buttress his preconceptions about big government.
But Mr. Reagan rarely showed interest in the historical precedents for what he was doing. In a way, this nonintellectualism helped him. In the age of the mass market, had Mr. Reagan spoken with the complexity of a Wilson, he might not have been so successful. Instead, it was the simplicity of his convictions, repeated over and over again, that helped him oversee a transformation of American political thought -- to the conservatism of the 1980's. (Mr. Reagan's Olympian approach could also blind him, as in the Iran-contra scandal.)
Two of the 20th century's most commanding presidents -- Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson -- exercised strong leadership without being much more than casual students or readers. Roosevelt was a gentleman's "C" Harvard student with a short attention span. As a presidential candidate, he was derided by Walter Lippmann as the "Prince of Pap."
Lyndon Johnson was painfully sensitive about his modest education at Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He was always searching for gimmicks -- White House symposiums, intellectuals-in-residence -- that would give him the scholarly patina that John Kennedy had enjoyed.
They didn't work. After a meeting with the president, one historian blustered, "Doesn't that man know what I do? He asked me to write a speech for him on foreign affairs. . . . My specialty is the desert!"
Yet Roosevelt's and Johnson's nonintellectualism seldom got in the way. They enlisted legions of scholars in and out of government in the effort to build both the New Deal and the Great Society.
Yes, presidents should read books, and a host of modern presidents have been changed by what they have read in office. Barbara Tuchman's "The Guns of August," which traced the miscalculations that brought World War I, emboldened Kennedy to avoid similar errors during the Cuban Missile Crisis. After reading Robert Blake's "Disraeli," Richard Nixon emulated the 19th-century British leader by surprising enemies with liberal policies (like the opening to China).
As we assess Al Gore and George W. Bush in this campaign, we must also remember that appearances can be deceiving. As president, Dwight Eisenhower was content to let Democrats lampoon his "lowbrow" tastes in music and literature (Lawrence Welk and Louis L'Amour). But, as we now know, Ike had both a formidable command of military history, gained through decades in the Army, and an intellect that allowed him, more than anyone realized, to manage the peace and prosperity of the 1950's.
Eisenhower's two-time opponent, Adlai Stevenson, was revered on the Upper West Side and in Cambridge, Ann Arbor and Berkeley as the "thinking person's candidate," an egalitarian lover of literature, history and ideas. Only long afterward did those outside his circle discover that, while Stevenson had a pleasing respect for academics and the humanities, and while he took impressive care to write many of his own speeches, he could go quite happily for months or years without picking up a book. Indeed, on his nightstand, on the day he died, was but a single volume -- the Social Register.

To the Editor:
As a 20-something, fully and forcibly indoctrinated into the New Economy, I found Harold Bloom's article to be a breath of fresh air. I have seen my greatest teachers, from Chaucer to Milton, left at the wayside by an increasingly insensitive technology-biased generation. I have many colleagues, highly "educated," who know myriad programming languages but possess scant familiarity with the English language. Oh, how our values have changed! An electronic book is no more a book than a chat room is a conversation, or an e-mail can be a love letter. If the time does come that the bound volume is relegated to antique shops and flea markets, I hope that I am long gone.

HEADLINE: The World: Britain in Africa;
Colonialism's Legacy Becomes a Burden

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN recent weeks, Britons have been treated to two conflicting, almost puzzling, sets of images. In Sierra Leone, an African leader pleads with British troops to stay on, after they arrive there to protect the capital from rebel forces who had kidnapped hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers. Across the continent in Zimbabwe, another African president reviles just about everything that smacks of the British and tells them to be gone.
Binding the two images is Britain's colonial past and, with it, a message that has some resonance for the United States in its own new imperial age: Once power is extended, it creates a stubborn, messy and enduring legacy. And even when influence recedes, the tangle of obligation, expectation and resentment survives. 
 "What's left after you've gone is a very deep imprint," said David Anderson, chairman of the Center for African Studies at the School for Oriental and African Studies here. "And it dictates cultural links, investment flows. All these things have substantive meaning in the way things are done."
The circumstances that motivated Presidents Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe could hardly have been more different, and neither could Britain's responses.
In Sierra Leone, a chaotic assemblage of rebel and pro-government forces has turned the nation into a patchwork of armed fiefs competing for the country's diamond riches. A United Nations mission to make peace had collapsed, leaving a dangerous vacuum. This threatened to propel the war-weary nation into further mayhem -- mayhem that had already caught the world's eye through the singular cruelty of rebels who hacked off the limbs of innocents.
But Britain's sense of post-colonial obligation went further. Its gunboat diplomacy in Sierra Leone also reflected a broader readiness by Tony Blair's government to pursue the same ethical -- if somewhat selective -- crusade as had led it to promote last year's NATO bombing of Kosovo.
In Zimbabwe the fight is different: After 20 unchallenged years in power, Mr. Mugabe is facing elections this month that he is afraid of losing. And he has seized on the emotional issue of racial discrimination left over from colonial days -- in this case, unfair patterns of land distribution -- as a pretext to order a campaign of bloody intimidation of his principal opponents. These include white farmers and workers on the farmers' land. Hundreds of white-owned farms have been occupied by so-called veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war in the 1970, and at least 25 people have died.
In other words, Mr. Mugabe is assailing the very legacy that Britons feel links them to the land. And Britain's choices are circumscribed, illuminating both the ambiguities of its colonial history and the limits on its modern influence.
While Sierra Leone was established in 1787 as a coastal settlement for freed black slaves, white British settlers were encouraged to migrate to Rhodesia -- as Zimbabwe was then known -- in the late 19th and early 20th century, simply seizing vast tracts of land from the indigenous people.
When British officials started to protest Mr. Mugabe's behavior, that inescapable history clouded the moral issue and gave Mr. Mugabe the ammunition to defy the onetime colonial ruler. The collision left Britain's standing in Zimbabwe at its lowest in decades, even as its star rose ever higher in Sierra Leone.
So what drives a small nation with shrunken influence to project its influence with such Victorian zeal?
WHILE Britain's initial intervention in Sierra Leone was depicted as a mission to rescue British passport-holders, it was quickly seen here by a broad swath of the populace as something more: an opportunity to unravel chaos that has at least some roots in earlier British initiatives.
In Zimbabwe, by contrast, the presence of some 15,000 white Zimbabweans entitled to British citizenship revived a far more ambiguous legacy. Successive British governments may have voiced support for the aspirations of Zimbabwe's black majority, but, on the right wing of British politics, there remains an insistence that Britain should look after its so-called kith-and-kin in Africa -- a view that invariably leads Zimbabweans, and some Britons, to argue that British policy is racially biased.
The deeper reality in both Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone is that colonialism does not have an easy cut-off point, or a simple close-of-sale date. When the flags are furled, the colonial power maintains a vast array of commercial and other involvements.
Just as colonialism itself was propelled by the economics of Europe's industrial revolution with its need for raw materials and markets, so the post-colonial era has been driven by Lord Palmerston's 19th-century dictum that nations do not have eternal allies, but they do have eternal interests.
In Zimbabwe, for instance, by insisting that this month's elections be free and fair and by offering increased financial aid for land redistribution, Britain is signaling its broader interest in the stability of a region that encompasses vast British investment, particularly in South Africa.
Of course, the same self-interest also creates a web of commitment and expectation, as Americans know well from their nexus of relationships from Latin America to the Middle East, from the rim of Asia to the heart of Europe.
Britain's military intervention in Sierra Leone, moreover, has led to the same worries as dogged American forces in Vietnam, Beirut and Somalia : Once committed, troops may well have to stand their ground at the risk of unwelcome casualties -- or contemplate withdrawal in humiliation.
That is why Britain has given clear notice that its 600 combat troops in Sierra Leone will be withdrawn by mid-June. But, already, the potential for bloody chaos has obliged Britain to station 200 military advisers there when the combat troops leave -- an eerie echo of the beginnings of American embroilment in Vietnam.
"The whole idea of mission creep is inevitable," Dr. Anderson said. "It isn't a problem as long as you draw a line in the sand." But those lines in the sand, of course, are what the players of the post-colonial era have found so elusive.

HEADLINE: Hafez al-Assad, Who Turned Syria Into a Power in the Middle East, Dies at 69

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Hafez al-Assad, the air force officer who ruled Syria for three decades, transforming a Middle East backwater into an introverted regional power that endured as the center of unbending Arab hostility toward Israel, died yesterday in Damascus. He was 69.
Mr. Assad, a survivor of several assassination attempts and at least one heart attack, died of a heart attack, according to medical officials quoted by Agence France-Presse. 
 Among the Arab autocrats who became stock players in the perpetual drama of negotiating Middle East peace, none was more courted, nor more aloof, than the Syrian leader. No lasting peace could hold without him, but none could be negotiated with him either. A treaty remained elusive largely due to his stubborn role in demanding back every inch of Syrian territory.
At home, Mr. Assad's longevity in office rested on a rigid intolerance of dissent, most starkly illustrated by the slaying of thousands of residents of Hama in February 1982 to end a swelling Islamic insurgency. His was a suspicious police state, limiting access to modern instruments like the fax or the Internet that might somehow become tools to help undermine his government.
Mr. Assad rarely traveled, even within Syria, and as he aged his public appearances were limited to religious ceremonies on major holidays. But his withdrawn life was also devoid of the lavish trappings common to other Arab rulers. His home and office, where he often worked 18-hour days, consisted of two modest villas that faced each other in a residential neighborhood in Damascus.
The stream of American presidents, secretaries of state and other officials who crossed his doorstep over the years, hoping to keep the latest peace effort from foundering there, emerged with a grudging respect for Mr. Assad. He was at once courteous and calculating, professorial and persistent, unleashing flashes of self-deprecating humor during marathon negotiating sessions. The length of the sessions were as legendary as they were nerve-racking.
When Henry A. Kissinger arrived in 1973, becoming the first American secretary of state to visit Syria in 20 years, their initial meeting lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes. The waiting press, uninitiated in the ways of the Syrian leader, wondered aloud if the American had been kidnapped.
"His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear," Mr. Kissinger wrote in "Years of Upheaval," the volume of his memoirs published in 1982. "He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the Israelis, much as both of them would hate the comparison.)"
The lengthy exchanges got to the point that one task of the American ambassador was to brief visiting dignitaries before any meeting with President Assad to pace themselves on the constant offerings of coffee, tea and lemonade lest they bruise protocol by interrupting the Syrian leader to ask for a bathroom break. "We dubbed it bladder diplomacy," said Edward P. Djerejian, the American ambassador from 1988 to 1991.
Mr. Assad was most renowned for lecturing foreigners, even American presidents, about the unfair colonial fragmentation of the Middle East. In case anyone missed the point, his reception hall was dominated by a large painting depicting the Arab armies under Saladin defeating the Crusaders during the battle of Hittin in 1187, a not-so-subtle reminder that he considered present circumstances temporary.
"Even in his bitterness toward Israel, he retained a certain wry humor about their conflicting views, and he seemed to derive great patience from his obvious sense of history," President Jimmy Carter wrote in "The Blood of Abraham," a 1985 study of the region.
Syria was a young nation adrift before Mr. Assad's rule. The government had been a revolving door swung repeatedly by coups after independence from France in 1946, resulting in little development and a population weary of chaos.
The bloodless power grab he staged in November 1970 brought stability and the first modern construction of roads, schools and hospitals. Mr. Assad followed the Soviet model of a single-party police state, constructing a network of 15 competing intelligence agencies that spied on his own people.
It was in regional politics, however, that Mr. Assad most sought to create a legacy, remaking Syria into a power among the Arabs rather than a political football. He was inspired by the Arab nationalism preached by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and like many of his generation, he sought to inherit Nasser's role as the voice of Arab unity.
But Mr. Assad, more than most, experienced the bitter chasm between the vaunted oratory of unity and the constant scheming and back-stabbing that marked actual relations between the Arab states in watershed events like the wars against Israel. He often told negotiators that he would face assassination if he negotiated a separate peace.
"Nobody expects us to raise banners of happiness and pleasure with such a clandestine agreement held behind our backs," he said in an American television interview in October 1993, right after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasir Arafat, announced a peace agreement worked out in secret under Norwegian auspices. "The Arabs are one people. If I were to sign an agreement similar to that signed by Arafat, I would have faced great problems. You all know that there are Arab leaders who paid with their lives as the price for such separate behavior."
Mr. Assad's roots in an isolated, impoverished religious minority made him an unlikely candidate to become leader of Syria. But for a man who spent his lifetime railing against the legacy of Western colonization, its waning years brought unprecedented change to sleepy villages like his.
 
The Brilliant Son Of a Mountain Family
 Hafez al-Assad was the ninth of 11 children, born on Oct. 6, 1930, to minor notables in the village of Qurdaha, in the Ansariya Mountains, which rise sharply from the Mediterranean coast. (The adopted family name, sometimes transliterated Asad, means lion.) The mountain redoubts were a secure home for his ethnic group, the Alawite sect, a tiny branch of the Shiite school of Islam and a sect often branded as heretical by the Sunni Muslim majority that dominated Syria.
The mountain tribes had been all but ignored during the 400 years that the Ottoman Empire controlled Syria, left to their subsistence farming in villages consisting of small stone hovels. Patrick Seale, in his 1988 biography, "Asad of Syria: The Struggle for the Middle East," said that at the time of Mr. Assad's birth, Qurdaha consisted of about 100 houses at the end of a dirt track. It had neither mosque, nor shop, nor cafe. His father and two wives lived in a two-room, flat-roofed stone house.
The Arabs had expected independence in exchange for their rebellion against Ottoman rule during World War I, but in a secret 1916 pact known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, the British and French divided the Levant. Their action is still vividly remembered in Syria, and a long commentary on the perfidies of the Sykes-Picot accord was a perennial favorite of Mr. Assad's lectures to foreigners.
The French, seeing the Alawite clans as potential allies in the old divide-and-rule method of colonial government, introduced schools to their villages.
In 1944 Mr. Assad became the first member of his family to be sent down to Latakia, on the coast, to start his secondary education. He was soon caught up in the debates among Communists, Arab nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists, which intensified as Syria gained independence in 1946.
Mr. Assad joined the new Arab Baath Socialist Party, which preached that a secular, socialist state encompassing all the Arabs would revive their past glory and undermine Western dominance. When he was elected to head his high school's student affairs committee, he used the position to try to foment nationwide student protests against other parties and the government.
By the time he finished high school in 1951, at the age of 20, his interest in politics was cemented even as he embarked on an air force career. Fees for military school were abolished with independence, so he enrolled in the new Air Force College in Aleppo. The Alawites, like the underprivileged throughout the Middle East, used the military to gain an education and then to supplant the elite that scorned them.
His years at Aleppo, from 1952 to 1955, when he graduated as a lieutenant, coincided with Nassar's rise in Egypt. In 1958 Syria's government rushed to join Egypt in the United Arab Republic, imagining that the idea would prove so seductive that all Arab governments would either join or be swept aside. The union collapsed in 1961.
Mr. Assad missed most of the first year of the union, having been sent to the Soviet Union to learn how to fly the MIG-15's and MIG-17's being delivered to Syria. Soon after he returned his squadron was transferred to Egypt. He and a fellow group of officers, dismayed by the degree to which Syrians had been marginalized, formed a secret committee to plot to take control in Damascus.
The years after the union brought turmoil. The highly politicized officer corps jockeyed for control of the country, with each faction taking power thinning the ranks of its rivals through execution or exile. By the time the Arab-Israeli war erupted in June 1967, Syrian military officers were ill-prepared to do battle.
 
Two Disastrous Wars Pave Way to Power
Mr. Assad was minister of defense during that war, having gained that position in February 1966 when the group of officers he helped found in Cairo seized power in a violent putsch. He was 35, serving in his first Syrian government, the most extreme the country had yet known. It was repressive at home, seeking to topple the old Sunni Muslim elite, and radical abroad, funneling aid to Palestinian guerrillas to attack Israel.
The 1967 war, over in a week, was as much a military as a mental blow to the Arabs. All their exaggerated oratory about the bankruptcy of the Zionist cause proved fruitless, and the Arabs suffered the embarrassment of losing the eastern sector of Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights in Syria.
Mr. Assad came to power in the wake of another debacle, in September 1970, when Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan sought to topple King Hussein. Syria sent tanks over the border to support the guerrillas, then retreated under Jordanian air attacks, and King Hussein kept his throne. Mr. Assad used the disarray to stage a bloodless coup called "the corrective movement."
Mr. Assad ruled through the Baath Party, using its secular ideology as the cover for bringing the Alawite minority into key positions. Eventually the commanders of the special forces, intelligence, the armored corps and key divisions were all Alawites, a remarkable achievement for a group that used to produce the servant class.
His first priority as president was trying to erase the stain of the 1967 defeat. In that he had a ready ally in President Anwar Sadat of Egypt. The two profited from the superpower competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Moscow pouring billions of dollars of weaponry into both their arsenals and stationing thousands of advisers in both countries.
They struck on Oct. 6, 1973, with the Egyptian forces crossing the Suez Canal and the Syrians advancing into the Golan Heights. The Israelis, while monitoring the troop buildup along their borders in the days preceding the attack, were caught unaware, seeing the massive mobilization as more bluster than threat.
For days it seemed the survival of Israel was at stake, but it gradually gained the advantage. The Egyptians had basically captured the eastern shore of the Suez Canal and dug in, their two top generals at loggerheads over how much of the army could advance into the Sinai. President Assad believed bitterly that Mr. Sadat had betrayed him. He thought Mr. Sadat had crossed the canal and then deliberately stopped, seeking a limited victory that would both restore the image of the Egyptian Army and, more important, attract American patronage. By the time of a shaky cease-fire at the end of October, it was clear the Arabs had again been defeated.
The United States attempted to build a comprehensive peace settlement, Secretary Kissinger shuttling between Arab capitals and Israel. Mr. Kissinger was the first of many American officials to have their hopes dashed by the Syrian leader, discovering at the end of lengthy negotiations about a peace conference that Syria had no intention of taking part.
Still, Mr. Assad felt that the Americans got the upper hand because the talks paved the way for Egypt to forge a separate peace. The cease-fire negotiated then on the Golan did stick, however, and it became Israel's quietest border despite the upheaval that followed.
 
Playing Both Sides In Lebanon's Civil War
 The conflagration of 1973 was barely extinguished when the next crisis erupted, in Lebanon. Its civil war pitted the Lebanese Christians, whose power was enshrined in the Constitution despite their shrinking population, against the Palestine Liberation Organization and more economically deprived communities like the Shiites and the Druze. As the army and government fractured along sectarian lines, the Christian defeat by the more numerous Muslim factions seemed a foregone conclusion.
Although Mr. Assad acknowledged that Syria and Lebanon were sovereign nations, Syrians had long viewed Lebanon as a natural part of their country that had been unfairly severed by European colonial meddling. Mr. Assad intervened with his army to preserve the status quo.
Critics said his defense of the Christian minority reflected his own insecurity that majority rule in Lebanon might inspire attempts to unseat his Alawite minority. The intervention in Lebanon, though sanctioned by the Arab League, also gave Mr. Assad a chance to try to reassert control over the P.L.O. He had long been at odds with Mr. Arafat, even jailing him briefly in Damascus in 1966 for trying to dilute Syrian influence over the Palestinian movement.
But the Lebanese chaos gave an opening to a deadlier conflict, providing Syria and Israel the space to fight another war. After Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, the Syrian Air Force performed poorly, losing 79 MIG's, plus tanks and missile batteries.
But Mr. Assad retained his influence over his neighbor. In September 1982, Syria was apparently the hand behind the assassination of the Lebanese leader Bashir Gemayel, which effectively aborted the attempt to negotiate a separate peace between Israel and Lebanon.
Mr. Assad nonetheless put renewed emphasis on his doctrine of "strategic parity" with Israel. He believed that the Arabs would always be hindered unless they could use military aid from the Soviet bloc to build a credible force to face the high-tech weaponry that flowed to Israel from the United States. The Soviet Union poured an estimated $2 billion into the Syrian arsenal after the war, including about 160 fighter aircraft and 800 T-72 tanks.
 
An Attempted Coup And Violent Suppression
As the proxy war in Lebanon had been simmering, a more threatening rebellion was brewing at home.
The first hint of the impending attempt to overthrow Baath Party rule came in June 1979, when the Muslim Brotherhood massacred 50 Alawite cadets in the dining room of the military academy in Aleppo.
Then in June 1980 extremists lobbed at least two grenades at the Syrian leader. President Assad kicked one grenade away while a bodyguard flung himself on the second, losing his life. In revenge, the military unit controlled by Mr. Assad's headstrong younger brother, Rifaat, descended on a desert prison near Palmyra and gunned down at least 250 religious dissidents in their cells.
The Muslim extremists next rose up in 1982 in Hama. They killed Baath Party officials and broadcast appeals from the mosques for a nationwide insurrection.
In pursuing the rebels, the Syrian military leveled half the city, killing at least 10,000 residents. The carnage brought widespread condemnation in the West, but it was the kind of act that insured Mr. Assad's utter control. When the choice came down to spilling blood or preserving his hold on power, there was really no question.
"He wouldn't be apologetic," recalled Ambassador Christopher Ross, who served as American envoy to Damascus for most of the 1990's. "Assad would justify it entirely by saying it was the necessary price to end years and years of Muslim Brotherhood terrorism."
His alliance with Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution there brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power was based on similar calculus. Although Iran's attempts to export its revolution quickly made it anathema in the Middle East, Mr. Assad cared little that the Damascus-Tehran accord provoked his fellow Arab leaders.
For one thing, the Iranians were at war with Iraq, long Syria's competitor for supremacy in the larger Arab world. For another, Iran was willing to arm and train the increasingly radical Shiite militias in southern Lebanon who engaged Israel's occupying army in guerrilla warfare.
Syria could use the guerrillas to pressure Israel while at the same time denying responsibility. Instead Mr. Assad could blame the violence, or acts like the kidnapping of Western hostages, on the anarchy of Lebanon that Syria's 30,000-strong troops were ostensibly trying to suppress.
Syria was also linked to brutal attacks carried out by notorious terrorist groups like the Abu Nidal organization, whose targets included Israelis and Jews, Syrian dissidents, Jordanian diplomats and pro-Arafat Palestinians.
Mr. Assad's ability to distance himself from the worst violence collapsed in 1986, when a man attempting to blow up an El Al airliner leaving London was given refuge in the Syrian Embassy before turning himself in. Britain broke relations and other Western nations temporarily withdrew their ambassadors.
Syria, which had been identified by Washington as a sponsor of terrorism since 1979, became firmly entrenched on that roster. Though Mr. Assad's government was not linked to directly supporting terrorism after about 1986, it continued to give safe haven to the political leadership of the most radical Palestinian organizations.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union after 1989, Mr. Assad realized that he could no longer harvest military or economic aid in the Kremlin, and he began looking West.
 
Iraqi Invasion Pushes Syria Toward West
For that, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 proved a godsend, with Syria joining the gulf war coalition pieced together by the United States. Only a few thousand Syrian troops deployed in Saudi Arabia facing Iraq, but the presence of soldiers from such a staunch Arab nationalist country carried symbolic weight. The gulf Arab states responded with billions of dollars in new aid.
The momentum from the war coalition carried into another American effort to build an Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and Syria for the first time set aside its refusal to sit face-to-face with the Israeli negotiators.
The difficulty in negotiating with Syria was underscored under the Clinton administration, when Secretary of State Warren Christopher began shuttling around the Middle East trying to build on the agreement that the Israelis and Palestinians worked out themselves in Oslo. Mr. Assad was appalled that Mr. Arafat had become yet another Arab leader making a separate peace with the Jewish state.
However, with broad if nebulous assurances from the Israeli government of Yitzhak Rabin that a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights could be negotiated, Mr. Assad too indicated that Syria was willing to talk peace. Mr. Christopher made more than 20 trips to Damascus, and President Clinton met with the Syrian leader twice in 1994, once in Geneva and once in Damascus, becoming the first American president to visit since Richard M. Nixon.
Yet another attempt to revive the peace effort with Syria collapsed this spring after Mr. Clinton had a failed meeting with Mr. Assad in Geneva.
Despite the absence of clashes on the Golan Heights after the 1974 disengagement accord, the peace talks between Syria and Israel ultimately foundered on their mutual suspicions. The Israelis had no plans to withdraw to the 1967 lines, which would put Syria in control of a chunk of the shoreline of Lake Tiberias, their main water source.
For his part, Mr. Assad apparently felt he could not make peace without regaining every inch of lost territory, and he resisted Israeli attempts to tie peace to completely normal relations with free trade and open borders. Mr. Assad feared that Israel, having fought the Arabs to a stalemate, wanted to dominate them economically.
Inside Syria in the 1990's, Mr. Assad was consolidating his position and preparing for his eldest son, Basil, an army officer and an equestrian champion, to succeed him.
In a December 1991 plebiscite on a fourth seven-year term as president, Mr. Assad got 99.9 percent of the vote. As one Syrian writer noted wryly, "Even if Allah had run, he wouldn't have done as well."
But Mr. Assad's dynastic plans were threatened when Basil died in an automobile accident in 1994. Then, Mr. Assad picked his next son in line, Bashar, who had been training in London to be an eye surgeon, as his heir apparent. Bashar was made a lieutenant colonel, given a top military post and referred to publicly as "the hope" of Syria.
To emphasize his own line for succession, Mr. Assad in February 1998 stripped his brother Rifaat of the largely ceremonial title of vice president.
In late 1983, when Mr. Assad was hospitalized with a heart attack, Rifaat had tried to use his control of the military to assume power. As the president recuperated, Rifaat proved reluctant to back down and brought the country to the brink of civil war. Mr. Assad checked his brother, who spent the years from 1984 to 1992 in exile.
Mr. Assad is survived by four of his five children.
Although he set up the dynastic guidelines so his son would succeed him, it is unclear whether the second generation has the clout needed to control the competing security and intelligence agencies. Mr. Assad was the lone Syrian who had sufficient influence to make peace with Israel and to make it stick, but he never found the formula for getting the Golan back.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd, in his 1995 memoir, "The Politics of Diplomacy," quoted Mr. Assad as saying: "The land is important. It connotes dignity and honor. A man is not chosen to go to paradise unless he can do so in a dignified way."

HEADLINE: Yeshivas of Traditional Orthodoxy Flourishing

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
Down a narrow lane near the western outskirts of this city, wood-framed country houses and arching trees impart a rural feel, giving no hint that nearby is a place where a special kind of intellectual intensity rules the day.
But past a park can be seen the functional beige buildings of Ner Israel Rabbinical College, where the study hall reverberates with the voices of scores of young Orthodox men, debating one-on-one, across tables stacked high with books of Jewish law and tradition. It is an activity that occupies students here morning, afternoon and evening, Sundays through Fridays, before the start of the Jewish sabbath. 
 "The goal is not how much ground you cover," explained Isaac Greenberg, 21, a pile of well-thumbed texts at his elbow, "but how you understand it and how you incorporate it in your life."
Such a scene would have been a staple of Eastern European Jewish life a century ago, when yeshivas -- traditional academies for the study of Judaism's authoritative texts -- flourished. But rather than reflecting the past, what is happening here is part of a growing trend within Orthodox Judaism's right wing, its most rigorously traditional sector.
The number of collegiate and graduate students pursuing religious studies in these all-male institutions "has probably almost doubled" since 1980, to about 18,000 nationwide, writes William B. Helmreich in a new edition of his book "The World of the Yeshiva" (Ktav Publishing House, 2000).
Mr. Helmreich, who teaches sociology at City College of New York and the City University Graduate Center, said in an interview that the growth is primarily because of a high birthrate among the strictly Orthodox, and greater economic prosperity that allows them to provide more financial support to these institutions.
The Orthodox account for about 7 percent of the nation's 5.5 million Jews, but within that area of Judaism, a shift has been occurring. As yeshiva enrollments have grown, so, too, has the religious influence of the right wing -- at the expense of Orthodoxy's once dominant modern wing, which holds that Jews can be fully observant and highly involved in wider American society.
While modern Orthodox young people have become doctors, lawyers and other white-collar professionals, sociologists like Mr. Helmreich say, the right wing has been turning out a high number of rabbis and religious-school teachers, who in turn help shape the religious lives of many in Orthodoxy's next generation.
At Ner Israel, many people see growth around them.
Yaakov Feinstein, 26, of New York City, a student of Talmudic law, said he has seen the college add a dormitory and faculty housing over the past dozen years.
"I think it's more than Ner Israel, I think the total community is growing," Mr. Feinstein said.
As for the college, he said, "We're really here to be God-fearing Jews."
Ner Israel was founded in Baltimore in 1933 by Rabbi Jacob I. Ruderman, a Lithuanian immigrant, who began with 15 students. Now, 800 boys and young men attend the high school, collegiate and graduate programs. The college's enrollment has grown by 50 percent since 1985.
Among yeshivas, Ner Israel is unusual in that it has always allowed students access to secular, professional education. The college is accredited by the state of Maryland and has agreements with public and private universities at which its students can major in law, business and other subjects.
The roster of recent alumni includes bankers, accountants and psychologists -- as well as rabbis and religious-school teachers, who college officials say make up 50 percent of graduates.
Ner Israel's mission statement makes clear its priority is religious studies. Students pursuing secular degrees are asked to limit their work to nights or summer. The college's purpose, the statement says, is to preserve "a rareified environment" for dedication to "intense Torah study."
At the heart of that study is chavrusa, students working in pairs, each young man selecting a partner based on intellectual and social compatibility. In the daily debate over religious texts lies educational growth, college officials say.
How long do they spend in this kind of study? "I'd say you've got to figure eight hours a day, at least on average," said Rabbi Ezra Neuberger, dean of the graduate school. "The more diligent would be a lot more."
Down the hill from the academic buildings is a residential area called Yeshiva Lane, where modestly dressed women with head coverings supervise flocks of children outside the six-bedroom town houses and three-bedroom apartments, built for faculty and graduate students.
The sight suggests a self-contained community, but the college has built ties to Orthodox Jews worldwide. Since the revolution in Iran two decades ago, it has taken in Iranian Jewish refugees. Nearly 50 study here now, said one of their rabbis, who asked not to be named out of concern for relatives in Iran.
But there are others from overseas, too. "There are a lot of South Americans here, a lot of Europeans, a lot of Australians," said Rafael Mael, 20, of Baltimore. "I've roomed with people from Chile and Panama."
A person who has helped foster ties to Latin American communities is Moshe Filler, 34, who came from Mexico City and enrolled in Ner Israel to study as a teacher some years ago. Now he runs programs that bring young Latin American Jews to study for the summer on campus, while maintaining the college's links with Jewish communities in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Peru and elsewhere.
"This has become like a center for all these communities," Mr. Filler said.
His job involves considerable travel. "Last week I was in Chile," he said. "Today, I go to Guatemala."
Tuition at Ner Israel is $9,000 a year, but only a minority of students pay full fare. The college considers its applicants first, then finds out if those it accepts can pay, said Rabbi Herman N. Neuberger, the president. "We feel we do make a contribution to the spiritual life of America through training of our young men," he said.
Many students have come here from Orthodox day schools. But some have taken a different route.
Among the latter is Gil Neuman, 31, who arrived in October after two years' study in Israel. Before that, he worked in Hollywood, producing and writing films.
But his life changed one Friday evening when he attended a Sabbath dinner at the home of a Ner Israel graduate, where, he said, he was deeply impressed with the religious lives of those he met.
"People had a sense of purpose and a sense of meaning that nobody has in today's world," Mr. Neuman said.

HEADLINE: City Unions Warn of Unrest If Talks on Contracts Stall

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Union leaders representing 300,000 New York City municipal workers say their members are growing increasingly angry about the lack of progress in labor negotiations that could be one of the last big tests of Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoralty.
The contracts of half the city's work force have already expired, and the leaders say their unions may hold large demonstrations outside City Hall if the negotiations do not show significant progress soon. 
 The municipal unions have taken the position that Mr. Giuliani should be especially generous in this round of negotiations because the city has projected a $3.2 billion budget surplus and because city workers had accepted a two-year wage freeze in their previous contract.
"Clearly there is economic prosperity in the city," said Lee Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, the umbrella union representing 125,000 municipal workers. "Our members sacrificed in the past when the city was experiencing financial difficulties. Our members made sacrifices in their wages and pension funds, and now that the city is in strong financial shape, we should be rewarded with increased wages and benefits."
In interviews, the leaders of the city's largest municipal unions said they saw one major obstacle to progress in the talks: Mr. Giuliani's demand that there be no across-the-board wage increase, but instead individualized merit increases in which some workers would receive no raise while others might receive up to 6 percent a year. Several union leaders denounced the mayor's proposal, saying it would leave many workers without raises and would create tensions between union members who receive merit raises and those who do not.
"It's not realistic to ask our members to accept a system of individualized merit pay," said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. "Every police officer should get a merit pay increase because every police officer did work that helped bring about a substantial reduction in crime."
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, also criticized the mayor's proposal, saying: "There's not one union in the City of New York that will accept a contract without a pay increase for all of its members. Ultimately, if the mayor stays on this course of individualized merit pay or nothing, then nobody's going to do a contract with him, and then it's clear to me that he's just not serious about bargaining."
But Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding insisted that Mr. Giuliani was indeed serious about bargaining. "He's already shown his ability to negotiate with the unions," he said.
Mr. Harding said that in the last round of citywide bargaining, Mr. Giuliani and the city's unions successfully negotiated a five-year contract that included a no-layoff clause, a two-year wage freeze and a 12 percent increase over the last three years. He also noted that the city reached a pension agreement with the unions just two weeks ago.
That agreement, which would require state legislation to take effect, would reduce the percentage of annual salary that city workers contribute to their pensions each year by about 3 percent. In return, the unions approved a plan to let the city use $808 million from unexpectedly high investment profits from union pension funds. The one-time windfall would be used in the city's operating budget.
Some labor experts say that some of that money may be used to finance a labor contract (each 1 percent wage increase in the city's payroll costs about $160 million). Several experts said they expected that Mr. Giuliani would eventually make a fallback proposal that included a modest wage increase for all employees and individual merit increases on top of that. In the handful of negotiating sessions held so far, the unions have demanded a substantial wage increase without specifying a percentage.
James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, said the recently negotiated pension agreement created a spirit of cooperation that could give some momentum to the collective bargaining. He added that the unions would feel some pressure to reach an agreement because their members would not see reductions in their pension contributions until an overall labor agreement was reached.
But he would not predict when an agreement might be reached.
"We're still in the early stages," Mr. Hanley said.
Some union leaders said Mr. Giuliani's decision not to run for the United States Senate would make it easier to reach an agreement, suggesting that Mr. Giuliani had taken his hard-line approach to bargaining as a campaign strategy to please upstate Republicans and conservative donors from outside New York.
Mr. Giuliani's aides said, however, that the mayor had adopted his merit pay proposal because he considered it the best way to make the city's work force more productive. Good workers, these aides said, would be rewarded while unproductive workers might be persuaded to shape up or leave the city's work force.
Norman Adler, a political consultant, said the mayor's withdrawal from the Senate race could make it harder to reach a labor agreement. He said that as a candidate, the mayor might have pushed for contracts to win the backing of several unions, most likely the firefighter and police unions, or to neutralize them.
"I don't think he wanted to have any union job actions to take place while he was a candidate," Mr. Adler said. "You want to keep the seas as smooth as possible while you're sailing toward Election Day. Now that he's not running, he can play this game any way he wants. There are no electoral consequences."
Ms. Weingarten, who is chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Coalition, which coordinates bargaining for all the city's unions, said the unions had a plan calling for them to step up pressure on the city if there was no agreement soon. Her union, which represents more than 80,000 teachers and guidance counselors, is planning to picket at city schools on June 21 and has started a $3 million advertising campaign about the need for higher teacher pay.
"They have a $3.2 billion surplus," she said. "They have money for labor negotiations this year. They should just do a contract. If not, the unions will continue to escalate their public campaign to win a good contract."
Mr. Harding gave City Hall's response to such a pressure campaign. "That's a threat," he said. "We don't respond to threats."
Mr. Harding took sharp issue with statements that much of the surplus should be devoted to large wage increases. "If you took the city's surpluses and you spent it on any one thing," he said, "you would have such large deficits in future years that you wouldn't be able to keep the budgetary commitments that we made this year."
Carroll Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237, which represents 20,000 Housing Authority workers and other city employees, insisted that municipal workers should benefit from the surplus after having endured a wage freeze, pension givebacks and layoffs to help restore the city's financial health.
"Our motto right now is, 'We shared in the pain over a five-year period, now we wish to share in the gains of a $3 billion surplus,' " Mr. Haynes said.
One of Local 237's contracts with the city expired on Dec. 31 and the other on March 31. District Council 37's contract expired March 31. The contract of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association expires July 31, while the teachers' contract expires Oct. 31.
State law bars teachers and other government employees from striking.

HEADLINE: Countdown to the Parade, With Pride and Profit

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Each spring for the last 20 years, Nestor Rantas has traveled to the Bronx from Juana Diaz, P.R., to sell hats, T-shirts, key chains and anything else bearing the colors or name of his native land.
So it was no surprise that early yesterday, the day before the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade in Manhattan, Mr. Rantas, 44, was standing near Southern Boulevard with a bundle of flags in his hands. 
 He was a small dot in a sea of red, white and blue flags on East Tremont Avenue. Men carrying their own collections of flags and hats came by and asked what he still had in stock. Some were looking for flags to place on their cars or to drape around themselves during the parade; others were sellers trying to stock up.
Each year in the weeks before the parade, hundreds, perhaps thousands of vendors and hawkers take to the streets of the Bronx to sell the symbols that unite proud Puerto Ricans, many of whom travel across the country for the event.
And the East Tremont neighborhood, where Mr. Rantas also owns the Borinquen Records store, is at the center of that industry.
At first, Mr. Rantas said, he sold the apparel "for the people of Puerto Rico." But his next comment, which came after the driver of a flatbed truck stopped to pick up a flag and hoist it, suggested a motive somewhat less altruistic.
Mr. Rantas said he made tens of thousands of dollars each spring selling the items on the street and in his nearby store. But he does think that the economic returns show another type of pride.
"For Puerto Rico, everything," he said. "It is also good for the community because so many people are buying flags and selling them on the streets, and that helps the community."
Among New York City's many annual parades, the Puerto Rican Day Parade is particularly merchandise-rich. In the weeks before the event, flags begin popping up in windows all over heavily Puerto Rican sections of East Tremont and Mott Haven in the Bronx, East Williamsburg in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side and East Village in Manhattan.
People also drape flags on the hoods of their cars or use them as shawls, hang trinkets in their cars and wear T-shirts emblazoned with phrases like "I love you Puerto Rico."
The vendors are the economic engine of the annual rite.
There are no official city estimates on the revenue generated by the hundreds of thousands of people drawn into New York City by the parade, or "el desfile," as it is more commonly known in the East Bronx. But businesspeople in the neighborhood said the economic windfall was essential.
Ramy Khalif, 28, the owner of Mak 99 Cents store at East Tremont and Marmion Avenues, said he purchased 40,000 Puerto Rican flags about three weeks ago to sell -- at $1 to $8 -- before the parade. There were only 2,000 flags left yesterday morning. He had already run out of towels and caps.
The merchandise cost Mr. Khalif about $70,000 and he expects to make more than $100,000. He said yesterday that he expected to sell out in several hours. "I don't think there will be anything left," he said.
Mr. Khalif, who was an employee in the store before buying it five years ago, added that the parade-related sales "help bring people into the store."
At Mr. Rantas's music store, the rows of CD's and tapes that usually fill the store had been replaced by flags, T-shirts, clocks, coat racks, towels and key chains. There were even belts, plates and umbrellas.
Mr. Rantas would not say how much he expected to make from the parade, except that it would be in the tens of thousands of dollars.
But to many, he said, the merchandise sales are simply a symptom of pride. For Juan Nass, who is not Puerto Rican, it is less about pride and more about money. "Tomorrow is going to be slow and back to normal, but in the week before the parade we make lots of money," he said.

HEADLINE: Test Scores Are Up. From This We Can Conclude that the schools are doing:

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
In this era of standardized student testing, it has become an all-too-familiar ritual in New York City and across the country: the leader of the school system calls a news conference and holds a wedding or a funeral, crowing if scores are up, grieving and accepting blame if they are down.
Historically, most New York City chancellors have been able to do a bit of both. Test results can be relied on to rise in some years and fall in others. For parents and many teachers, the constant ratcheting up and down of scores -- testing experts call it the sawtooth effect -- is confusing and exhausting, if not dispiriting. 
 So it was a reality test last week when Harold O. Levy, New York's new chancellor, greeted two successive waves of good news on testing -- a nine-point rise on a statewide test and a five-point rise on a citywide test -- by urging caution. Mr. Levy half-joked that he would post bar charts in the lobby of 110 Livingston Street in Brooklyn, headquarters of the Board of Education, where, like a corporation reporting to stockholders, the school system would be forced to expose its long-term gains and losses.
In the war of perception against reality, almost nothing can be harder to gauge than the meaning of test scores. It seems only common sense that a system of 78,000 teachers and 1.1 million schoolchildren -- or, as Mr. Levy likes to point out, one out of 43 schoolchildren in America -- is too big an ocean liner to turn around in just a year. Is the curriculum new and wonderful? Did the quality of teachers improve? There is no systemic evidence of either. Yet parents and teachers are encouraged to judge their children and schools the way investors watch the Dow industrials.
"There's a quantifiable aspect to testing that is so seductive," said Gary Lincoff, the father of a fifth grader in Manhattan. "If a kid does well and scores high, you can dismiss the tests as meaningless, because you're happy. But if your kid gets a low score, you suspect he isn't getting it and blame yourself, your child, or go the other way and blame the system.
"Success in America is like a quiz show. It's how to be a millionaire, and there's usually a number in there."
But the more sophisticated view, experts say, is that it is almost impossible to attribute real meaning to a one-year gain in scores.
The New York City reading test seems a particularly clear case in point. The city and the state are now in their second year of a new reading test, and experts say it is almost axiomatic that scores go up in the second year of a test.
Last spring, in the first year of the new state test, 32.8 percent of New York City's fourth graders and 56.8 percent of the fourth graders in the rest of the state met state standards for reading and writing. This year's results showed that 41.7 percent of fourth graders in New York City met the standards, a gain of nine percentage points, as did 68.2 percent in the rest of the state.
Then, last week, the results of the city's separate reading test for grades three, five, six and seven came out, offering some corroboration of the rise in performance. On the test, 40.8 percent of students met the standards, up from 35.7 percent last year. Every district and almost every school in the city improved. But despite the overall improvement, schools at the bottom stayed at the bottom and schools at the top remained there.
Pessimists point out that the scores still mean that 6 out of 10 students in New York City, mostly poor black and Hispanic students, are not meeting city and state standards for reading and writing.
"Some schools, what I call the dead zone schools, just seem stuck at the bottom," said Raymond J. Domanico, an education consultant to the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of New York civic and church groups. "They were dysfunctional, they continue to be dysfunctional, and they won't reap the benefits of any of these systemic efforts until we get more highly qualified teachers and principals."
The Board of Education, in its press release, ascribed the rise in scores to a variety of causes: more diagnostic reading tests, expanded prekindergarten, reduced class size and after-school reading classes. But as David Liben, principal of the Family Academy in Harlem, pointed out, "you have to look at this like Sherlock Holmes."
Many steps, including reducing class size and expanding prekindergarten, are new and have affected only a small fraction of the city's very youngest students. They seem only remotely connected, if at all, to sixth and seventh grade, where scores rose the most.
While children who failed the test last year and were held back in the same grade showed large gains in test scores this year, experts say such results are the norm the year after schools stop promoting failing students. Those students, said Lorrie A. Shepard, a professor of education at the University of Colorado at Boulder, are reviewing the same material and taking roughly the same test, so their performance can be expected to go up. The more critical question, she said, is whether their gains will be maintained in future years.
Mr. Levy defended testing as a crude, if necessary, check on the system, yet sided with the skeptics in suggesting that a one-year gain revealed little about the condition of the schools.
"It's very hard to identify causality with any certainty," he said. Once other exams also show positive trends, "the more comfort one can have that we're moving in the right direction," he said. "But in judging whether the system is performing, someone in my position needs to be properly skeptical about test scores and constantly questioning what are the alternative explanations, so that you don't put on rose-colored glasses."
A further complication is the completely different way of scoring reading tests. Percentile scores, based on a national norm, were replaced with performance scores, based on an absolute standard for what children should know. The performance standards were developed by a committee of teachers and test company officials. They rank students within four levels, from lowest to highest, and by what is called a scale score, much like an SAT score, from 427 to 810. The state also uses performance standards.
Many experts say performance standards are a better measure of what students know than percentile scores, but they caution that the standards are also somewhat arbitrary, and subject to the caprices, judgment and manipulation of the officials who establish the cutoff points. "There's no precise science for deciding what meets standards and what doesn't," Dr. Shepard said.
The New York City results are also puzzling because they show striking variations from grade to grade, with scores stable in third grade, rising 12.4 points on the performance scale in sixth grade and dropping 4.1 points in fifth grade.
Given the fluctuations, Sylvia Wertheimer, whose daughter Laura is a fifth grader, said she found it hard to put too much emphasis on the five-point gain. "It doesn't make me feel better about the school system," she said. "It makes me concerned that there's too much emphasis on tests."
Opponents of standardized testing use such fluctuations to argue that tests are meaningless and should be abolished.
But others, echoing Mr. Levy, warn that test results matter most in the long term. From the 1960's to the 90's, performance on standardized tests declined in New York City as schoolchildren became poorer and dropout rates went up. Though the dropout rates and test scores have both shown a slight improvement in recent years, as the economy has improved, it is too early, experts say, to conclude that the change reflects real progress in the school system.
Mr. Levy said that rather than focusing on test results, he wanted to focus on hiring, encouraging and retaining good teachers, principals and superintendents.
Some experts suggested that the increased emphasis in the last two years on tests -- and on using them as a standard for promotion and graduation -- was enough to raise test scores in the beginning.
"One common denominator is that we are now involved in high-stakes testing," said Joseph Viteritti, a research professor at New York University. "And that's a motivator."
Diane Ravitch, the education historian, said studies showed that children who benefit most from testing were those just below the middle, "who understand that with a little bit more effort they can reach the goal." That is why, she said, the outcry against more testing and higher standards "never comes from poor districts, it comes from superadvantaged districts, like Scarsdale, which say, 'We don't want this, we're too good for this.' Those kids will do well, no matter what."
Jennette Williams, whose daughter Shauntay is in the eighth grade at Intermediate School 311 in the East New York section of Brooklyn, said tests had given her daughter a sense of mastery and pride. "All children should know how far they are in life," Ms. Williams said, "so they know where to go to move on."

HEADLINE: Putin Seeks Allies in Quest To Fight U.S. Missile Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 10

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin had barely said farewell to President Clinton this week before the Russian leader and top aides fanned out across Europe to campaign against American plans for a national missile defense.
On whirlwind trips to Brussels and Rome, the Russians sought to persuade the Europeans that a blend of diplomacy, vigilance and Russian technology is a better way to cope with the emerging missile threat. 
 Then the Kremlin announced that Mr. Putin would be undertaking a diplomatic mission to North Korea, the very "rogue nation" Washington has cited to justify its plan.
Given Russia's economic weakness, the new Russian president is not looking for a confrontation with the United States. But neither is he very pliable.
Indeed, it seems as if Mr. Putin, the former K.G.B. agent who spent the waning days of the cold war in East Germany, is trying to split the Europeans from the Americans. It is a classic Kremlin tactic, wielded with a heavy hand in Soviet times.
Today, Mr. Putin is more gentle, insisting only that Russia is a fellow European power and as such more concerned with preserving the framework of arms control than what many Europeans see as the go-it-alone Americans.
"There is a public relations war over missile defense, and all's fair in P.R. wars," a Clinton administration official said of the new Russian stand. "Some of it has been sophisticated. Some has been crude. But we have really seen an activist Russian foreign policy."
The Clinton administration had been accustomed to dealing with Boris N. Yeltsin, a sickly president who nonetheless had a rapport with leaders like Mr. Clinton and Helmut Kohl, the former German Chancellor. But while Mr. Putin's relations with Western leaders are more correct than close, he has engaged in a surprising burst of diplomacy.
Since his election two months ago, Mr. Putin has visited Britain, Italy, Belarus, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Over the next six weeks, he is headed to Spain, Germany, Moldova, Tajikistan, China, North Korea and Japan, where he plans to attend the summit meeting of the major industrialized nations, and possibly to South Korea. Visits to the United States, India and Brunei, the site of an Asian summit meeting, are also planned for the rest of the year -- but so far not to France, which has been fiercely critical of Russia's war in Chechnya.
A principal goal of the globe-trotting Russian leader is to lure Western investment, an important element of his plan to strengthen his country's economy and restore Russia as a world power. He is also looking for relief from his nation's mammoth debts, which is a major purpose of his coming German trip.
Countering the administration's missile defense plan and its insistence that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty be amended to accommodate it, however, is clearly a top priority.
The Russians understand that the first phase of the American plan would have little effect on their nuclear forces. But they fear that it would lay the basis for still grander plans, which would give the United States a strategic advantage. Having failed to persuade Washington to abandon its push to build an antimissile system, the Kremlin is doing the next best thing: It is working on America's allies.
The Europeans, for example, not only fear that the American plan to place 100 interceptors in Alaska and to build a battle-management radar system would undermine the framework of arms control accords and ignite an arms race. They are also not entirely convinced that there is a new missile threat, and they are keenly aware that the administration's missile defense plan is not intended to protect them.
The Russian diplomacy is intended to exploit all of those fears. At a meeting on Friday at NATO headquarters, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, the Russian defense minister, presented a Russian alternative, which he dubbed a plan for "European, nonstrategic defense."
The not-so-subtle message is that Russia, unlike the United States, has a plan that not only protects the European Continent from an evolving missile threat, but would be consistent with the ABM treaty, which is widely seen as the bulwark of arms control as pursued to date.
"Obviously, Russian policy is trying to use the European skepticism for its own purposes," said Karl Kaiser, a German foreign policy analyst.
Russia is also calculating that the Europeans view their Russian neighbor as more of a potential partner than the Americans. By casting himself as a philosophical ally, Mr. Putin is also trying to win friends and secure funds from Europe.
"Instead of just saying no and saying that we do not see a threat, Putin is proposing a way to address it," said Aleksei Arbatov, a defense expert and member of the Russian Parliament. "I think it is a very smart policy."
At the NATO meetings on Friday, Marshal Sergeyev presented a seven-step plan so vague in outline that it appeared more of a debating agenda than a blueprint.
Under his proposal, NATO nations and Russia would first evaluate the missile threat and develop a joint European and Russian defense that would use theater antimissile systems. Those are systems that are designed to intercept shorter-range missiles, not long-range ballistic missiles, and as such are allowed under the ABM treaty.
The Russians have suggested nonetheless that those systems might have some use against the emerging missile threat. Marshal Sergeyev did not say, however, whether the theater defense would be used to blow up third world missiles on their way up or to intercept warheads on their way down. Nor did he provide any detailed account of how the defense system would work.
"At this stage we know very little about what, if anything, the Russians have in mind at a detailed technical level," Walter B. Slocombe, the United States under secretary of defense, said after the NATO session. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and his aides will have a chance to investigate further at meetings in Moscow early next week.
While the Europeans harbor doubts about the American missile defense scheme, they are unlikely to rally around the Russian plan. Western European nations are reluctant to spend their limited military funds on missile defense, regardless of whether the technology originates in the United States or Russia.
Mr. Putin, however, is not counting only on the Europeans. He is also likely to encourage opposition to the American missile defense plan during his visit to Beijing. The Chinese are already strongly opposed to Washington's plan, and Mr. Putin is expected to encourage them to remain firm.
Mr. Putin is also expected to use his visit to North Korea, the first ever by a Russian president, to cast doubt on the rationale for the American missile defense plan. He will probably use the trip to portray North Korea as a rational government that is emerging from its isolation and to try to debunk the American notion that North Korea is an irrational "rogue state" that is likely to hurl a missile at the West at any moment.
After the flurry of Russian moves this week, Mr. Putin called Mr. Clinton on Friday to express his appreciation for a workmanlike summit meeting and to state his commitment to deeper arms cuts. American officials said Mr. Putin's tone was polite but doubted it heralded a breakthrough on the missile issue.
"Yeltsin might say no at first but it would eventually mean yes," a Clinton administration official said. "Putin says yes when he means no. He says I agree with you and then elaborates. And after you examine his elaboration you discover there is almost no agreement there."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN SYRIA;
Syria's Leader Assad Dies, Clouding Mideast Prospects

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 10

 BODY:
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a standard-bearer of Arab nationalism and anti-Zionist fervor who ruled his country with an iron hand for three decades, died today at 69 in Damascus.
Although Mr. Assad had long been in ill health, his death from a heart attack casts a quick cloud of uncertainty over the dynamics of peace and conflict in the Middle East. Obituary, Page 51. 
 Syria itself, however, moved swiftly to give at least the appearance of stability. After the announcement of the death, Parliament began to pave the way for Mr. Assad's son Bashar, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist and army colonel, to take over.
While an autocrat who brooked no dissent, Mr. Assad transformed Syria from a backwater nation into a semideveloped one and, more important, a regional power broker. Over the years, he earned begrudging acceptance from world leaders who criticized his outmoded Soviet-style leadership but came to appreciate his courtly tenacity and deep-seated convictions.
"We had our differences, but I always respected him," President Clinton said today as he issued condolences from Northfield, Minn.
Mr. Assad leaves big shoes to fill at the helm of a nation of 17 million whose isolation is reflected in the fact that it remains largely unconnected to the Internet.
After the death of his oldest son in a car accident in 1994, Mr. Assad had turned to grooming his next oldest, Bashar, and a crucial formal step in the transition of power was to have taken place next Saturday during a rare political convention of Syria's ruling Baath Party.
But Bashar Assad still has a potential family feud to quash with his uncle, Rifaat Assad, who always aspired to succeed his almost ascetic older brother. And beyond that, it is unclear whether the ruling Alawite ethnic minority led by the Assads will be able to retain its lock on Syrian politics under another member of the family.
Bashar Assad, according to his father's authorized biographer, the English journalist Patrick Seale, "would not deviate from his father's legacy." But even if he formally assumes power in the near future, it will take him considerable time to emerge from the shadow of his father and assert himself as leader.
This opens up the possibility of a tense and destabilizing transition in Syria at a crucial time in the relationship between Syria and Lebanon and between Syria and Israel. Israel's recent troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon after 22 years scrambled the power lines in the Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian triangle.
Although Mr. Assad took a resolutely hard line toward Israel, many Western diplomats believed that he was the linchpin to any breakthrough between Israel and its northern neighbors. Many believed that only Mr. Assad was strong enough to deliver a change in five decades of hostile habits.
Still, beneath anxiety about what lies in the immediate future, some Israeli and Western leaders expressed hope tonight that Mr. Assad's death could stimulate a new political and economic opening of Syria that could improve the chances for peace.
"For 30 years, Assad was Syria, and Syria was Assad," said the Israeli Justice Minister, Yossi Beilin. "With his death, this is undoubtedly a different Syria. My hope is that whoever will replace him will understand that Syria's only chance for serious economic growth will come by way of peace with Israel."
Palestinian leaders said they hoped that Palestinians and Syrians could reconcile after a long-strained relationship between Mr. Assad and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, which had put them at odds instead of side by side in their separate struggles with Israel.
Mr. Assad had survived several assassination attempts and at least one previous heart attack and had suffered from a variety of debilitating illnesses for years. But despite his gaunt appearance and his infrequent travels abroad, many in Syria had wondered if talk of his imminent demise was not exaggerated.
Syrian television made an official announcement only after the news had circulated first internationally. It showed members of the Syrian Parliament standing for a moment of silence, many of them crying and holding their heads in their hands.
"This is a day of sadness and sorrow in every home, school, farm, factory and quarry," the announcer on state-run television said. "Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and child because the legacy of his accomplishments is a sun that will shine not just on this generation but on the many to come."
In Israel, state television interrupted regular programming to run live broadcasts from Parliament -- a highly unusual sight here -- that included recitations from the Koran in memory of Mr. Assad.
When Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel first took office last sumer, he assiduously courted Mr. Assad, issuing flattering public messages about his strength as a leader. Mr. Barak and many Western experts believed that Mr. Assad wanted to return to peace talks with Israel in order to regain the Golan Heights in his lifetime and to ease the burden on his presumed successor, his son.
Mr. Assad was Syria's defense minister when Syria lost the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war.
But after the ice between Israel and Syria was broken last winter, the short-lived peace effort between the two nations, with the United States as intermediary, screeched to a halt.
In Geneva in March, Mr. Clinton made a final, failed attempt to revive the talks at a meeting with Mr. Assad. The meeting ended with American pronouncements that its diplomatic focus would shift to the Israeli-Palestinian track.
But after Israel withdrew its troops last month from Lebanon, where Syria is the power broker, officials here and in Syria voiced tentative questions about renewing the peace effort. Mr. Barak, however, said publicly this week that he was wondering if Mr. Assad would ever be fully behind it.
Israel expressed condolences tonight to the Syrian nation, but it also voiced concern over how a transition period would affect the calm that has reigned on its northern border since the troop withdrawal.
"Israel views with importance the keeping of quiet on its borders with Syria and Lebanon and expects that Syria will continue to do so, too," said a statement issued by Mr. Barak's office tonight.
Syria possesses a largely Russian-equipped military machine that is believed to be far less potent today than when Mr. Assad, a career military man, assumed power in 1970. But with mid-range and long-range missiles, and with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, it remains a force to be reckoned with in the region.
Syria installed the current civilian leadership of Lebanon. But after the recent Israeli troop withdrawal and with eagerness to reconcile their nation, the Lebanese leaders as well as the Hezbollah guerrilla movement backed by Syria and Iran started to test just how much autonomy Damascus would permit. This transition period could strengthen their move in that direction.
Mr. Assad, known as the Lion of Damascus because his family name means lion in Arabic, was one of the last surviving members of a generation of Arab rulers after the deaths of King Hassan of Morocco and King Hussein of Jordan.
Mr. Assad had surprised Middle East observers by attending King Hussein's funeral, a visit that marked a warming in what had been an icy relationship with Jordan. Since then, the late King Hussein's son, King Abdullah, has been a frequent visitor to Damascus and has cultivated a personal relationship with his fellow Western-educated scion, Bashar Assad.
In much of the Arab world, Mr. Assad was seen as a purist who remained until his death one of the last few believers in Arab nationalism. He disdained those, like Egypt, Jordan and lastly the Palestinian Authority, that negotiated individual peace treaties with Israel.
Mr. Assad believed that Israel wielded too much power in the region, and that the peace treaties reflected the imbalance of power.
The Arab League praised him tonight as "one who devoted his life to serving the Arab and Islamic nations and fighting for the recovery of their land and for Arab right." And in Gaza City, Mr. Arafat called for a three-day period of mourning and said the Palestinian people "would stand with their Syrian brothers and believe in their ability to survive this critical moment."
In Syria, Mr. Assad will be remembered quietly for some other traits as well -- like intolerance and the fear he inspired. A momentous marker of this was a massacre in Hama in 1982, when Mr. Assad succeeded in squelching an Islamic insurgency by having thousands killed.
Still, the country immediately fell into deep mourning today. Black banners were unfurled from apartment house balconies in Damascus, and noise in the streets stilled. Preparation got under way tonight for his funeral, scheduled for Tuesday.
Lebanese television reported tonight that Prime Minister Emile Lahoud of Lebanon had been talking to Mr. Assad on the telephone earlier today when the line suddenly went dead. "His last words were, 'Our destiny is to build a better future for our countries,' " Mr. Lahoud said of Mr. Assad. "And then there was a silence, and I knew something had happened."

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
A Spot for LaRouche? No Way, Party Says

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Like Rodney Dangerfield, Lyndon LaRouche says he don't get no respect.
Or delegates to the Democratic National Convention. 
 Mr. LaRouche is running for president. Again. He says he is a Democrat, perhaps the only one who can save the nation, and maybe the world, from an economic and social implosion.
But the Democratic Party says he is a convicted felon (mail fraud involving fund-raising) with political beliefs that are "explicitly racist and anti-Semitic."
Nevertheless, Mr. LaRouche continues to campaign as a Democrat and, in states where election officials permit his name on the ballot, he draws some votes, sometimes thousands of votes. In last month's Democratic primary in Arkansas, for example, he got more than 53,000 votes, or 22 percent of the total cast. The other candidate on the ticket, Vice President Al Gore, got 194,000 votes.
So does Mr. LaRouche get to go to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles with 22 percent of Arkansas's 48 convention delegates? Or with delegates from any other state?
No way, says the Democratic National Committee. If he shows up, committee officials say, he will be barred from the convention and, they add, courts have ruled several times that such exclusion is legal.
Mr. LaRouche denies he is a racist or an anti-Semite. As for his fraud conviction, he says he went to prison and paid his debt to society. His big vote in Arkansas, he argues, proved his viability as a candidate. "In Arkansas," he says, "reality struck."
As Senator Tim Hutchinson, the chairman of the Bush campaign in Arkansas, sees it, the reality is that 53,000 Democrats "couldn't stomach Al Gore" so they voted for a candidate "not famous for being somebody you can support."

HEADLINE: Green Calls for More Trains To Ease Subway Crowding

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
New York City's public advocate, Mark Green, responding to a call by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for improved safety procedures on subway platforms, said yesterday that the best safety measure would be more frequent service. More trains, he said, would prevent overcrowding in subway stations.
At a news conference, Mr. Green released a study of the frequency of service during the morning rush hour, which found that trains on more than half the city's subway lines arrived at intervals of more than six minutes. He said more trains should be put into service, to shorten the time between trains to no more than four minutes, comparable to subway systems in Tokyo, London, Paris and other foreign capitals. 
 "When subway platforms are so overcrowded that riders are at risk of falling onto the tracks," Mr. Green said, "it's time for increased and more reliable service."
The comments by Mr. Green, a frequent adversary of Mr. Giuliani who has announced his intention to run for mayor in 2001, came five days after Mr. Giuliani said he had ordered the police to study ways to reduce the risk of accidents in which people fall onto the tracks and of incidents in which people are deliberately pushed.
Police records show that there have been nine platform pushing incidents this year, the same number as for all of 1999. The statistics for accidental pushings have not yet been compiled.
But increased service can be brought about only by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its subsidiary that runs the subway system, New York City Transit.
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said yesterday that the agency would review Mr. Green's suggestions.
Mr. Green released copies of a letter yesterday that he sent on May 19 to Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit, more than two weeks before the mayor announced his police study. The letter recommended a fresh investment in new subway trains, saying that service had fallen far short of keeping pace with increased ridership over the last three years, an increase due largely to the city's robust economy and surging tourism.
Mr. Green said yesterday that Mr. Reuter had not responded. Mr. Kelly, the M.T.A. spokesman, declined to comment on the letter.
At his news conference, Mr. Green ranked subway lines on the basis of their rush-hour frequency. He said the study found the least frequent service on the B, C and M lines, with trains arriving at intervals of more than 8 minutes, and on the G line, where trains arrived at 10-minute intervals.
The transit agency's biggest hurdle in relieving overcrowding, he said, was on the Lexington Avenue line, where riders have complained for decades about crowding despite short waits between trains.
The M.T.A. says no more trains can be squeezed into the rush-hour schedule on that line. Mr. Green said the only solution on that line was to build a Second Avenue subway.

HEADLINE: 2 States Promote Plan To Clean Up Sound

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
WITH millions and possibly billions of dollars in financing in the balance, a plan to create a reserve for Long Island Sound is being advanced in Connecticut and New York, which are bound together by the 110-mile-long estuary.
The reserve would protect shoreline and underwater lands, restore habitats and increase public access to the Sound, which is severely limited for the 25 million people who live or work nearby. Though the Sound lies in the most densely populated region of the country, it has attracted less federal support than other estuaries, like Chesapeake Bay. 
 Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and others said the designation would improve the chances of federal financing by providing a conduit through which money could flow to the states, municipalities and groups involved in carrying out reserve programs.
"The Congressional climate seems positive for an increase in conservation funding," Senator Lieberman said. "Creating a reserve system might help the Long Island Sound region receive some of that money."
Potential federal funds include a share of $900 million in fees from offshore oil drilling. In addition, a bill passed in the House in May would provide $80 million annually for four years to clean up the Sound; the Senate version would provide $10 million a year for five years.
Three groups that support the reserve concept -- the National Audubon Society of New York, the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan and Save the Sound in Stamford and Glen Cove, have called hearings to gather opinion and build a consensus about what a reserve should include.
Comments at the 10 hearings, four of which took place in Connecticut earlier this month, will be sent to public officials, and Mr. Lieberman said they would be crucial in framing a bill he has tentatively agreed to introduce to set up the reserve.
The reserve would begin a second phase in efforts begun by the two states and the federal government in 1985 to reverse a decline of water quality in the Sound.
A 1994 agreement between the states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency cited low levels of dissolved oxygen, a condition known as hypoxia, as the leading threat. It set goals for a reduction in nitrogen, which is generated by sewage-treatment plants and causes the overgrowth of algae that consume oxygen, causing hypoxia and killing marine life.
The nitrogen-reduction programs, paid for principally by state and local governments, have had some success in limiting the spread of hypoxia. But an assessment by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection last August estimated that an area more than five times the size of Manhattan was still hypoxic, mostly in the western Sound.
New York City, whose four sewage plants account for nearly 40 percent of the treated sewage discharged into the Sound, is being sued by the state and by a private group, the Soundkeeper, for exceeding agreed nitrogen levels.
Most of the $200 million earmarked for the Sound under New York State's Clean Air and Clean Water Bond Act, and the more than $200 million budgeted by Connecticut for the Sound, is intended to lower nitrogen levels by upgrading treatment plants.
To date, federal involvement has been limited to annual allocations to the Long Island Sound Office, which administers the 1994 plan. Mark Tedesco, the director, said the program had received about $18.5 million in federal money since 1985. He estimated that fulfilling the 1994 agreement would cost $2 billion over 15 years.
Mr. Tedesco said that while hypoxia had been contained, there was no decisive evidence that it had declined as a result of sewage-plant upgrades, even though they had reduced nitrogen discharges by 25 percent since 1994. "I'm hesitant to say we have significantly reduced the problem," he said.
But he added that there could be a lag before a cut in nitrogen resulted in higher levels of dissolved oxygen.
Mr. Tedesco said an earlier estimate that nitrogen reduction alone could cost $8 billion in sewage-plant upgrades had been reduced to $1 billion because of better technology and evidence that bacteria used in treatment was more effective in cold weather than projected.
Proponents of the reserve said it would move beyond upgrades of treatment plants to address acquisition of shoreline properties, measures to restore wetlands and related programs.
To involve greater numbers of people, increasing access would also be a high priority. In Connecticut and Long Island, almost all municipalities restrict beaches and boat-launching areas to residents.
"We're spending billions of dollars cleaning up the Sound, and most of the people living around it can't get there," said Robert D. Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group. "It's probably the least accessible piece of coastline in the United States."
Mr. Yaro said shoreline acquisitions could also limit development, a kind of "insurance policy for water quality."
Save the Sound, which represents environmental and civic groups in the Long Island Sound Watershed Alliance, has identified 450 sites, private and public, that could be preserved or restored. William P. Shadel, a habitat ecologist for the group, said the group's goal was to preserve 2,000 acres of shoreline and strengthen protection along 1,000 miles of riverfront in Connecticut by 2007.
John Atkin, president of Save the Sound, agreed that land acquisition would "potentially have a very high price tag," but he and others said the cost of degradation from overdevelopment would be more costly.
The Long Island Sound Office has estimated the annual contribution that the Sound makes to the regional economy at more than $5 billion, with boating and recreation in the lead, despite limits on access.
David Sutherland, director of government relations for the Connecticut chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said development pressures would make land acquisitions challenging. But though "the prices may seem high," he added, "in the end it will be a bargain."
Mr. Atkin, of Save the Sound, said a reserve could also set aside surface and underwater areas for research into restoring marine habitats and understanding how contaminants affect marine life.
Proponents of the reserve cited the extensive lobster die-off last fall as a dramatic example of the need to learn more. Researchers said the lobsters might have been attacked by a parasite, but uncertainty remained.
Some lobster and fishing groups fear that pesticides used in mosquito spraying were washed into the Sound and killed the lobsters.
William N. Smith, the executive director of Fish Unlimited of Shelter Island, said dumping in the Sound of material dredged from Mamaroneck Harbor could also have played a part. Mr. Smith said the dredged material contained pesticide residues and other contaminants.
There are four dumping sites in the Sound. The E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers are conducting an environmental study to assess the suitability of the sites.
Mr. Smith, whose group favors a ban on dumping, said he planned to raise the issue at a hearing that Save the Sound has scheduled in Southold on June 29.
David J. Miller, the executive director of the National Audubon Society of New York, said similar hearings in 1990 helped define issues addressed in the 1994 management plan. "We want to turn the corner and get the people behind this new initiative," he said. "Now let's look at the natural coast and how to connect people to that natural coast."
Mr. Miller said the recent creation of the 153-acre Nissequogue River State Park in Kings Park on Long Island and $25 million pledged by Gov. George E. Pataki for public access to the Sound had advanced these efforts.
 
To Have a Say
Four hearings on the future of the Sound are planned on the Island this month.
TUESDAY, JUNE 20 -- North Hempstead Town Hall, 220 Plandome Road, Manhasset, 7:30 p.m.
THURSDAY, JUNE 22 -- Cold Spring Harbor High School, 182 Turkey Lane, 7:30 p.m.
TUESDAY, JUNE 27 -- Village Hall Court Room, 121 West Broadway, Port Jefferson, 7 p.m.
THURSDAY, JUNE 29 -- Southold Town Hall, 53095 Main Road, 7 p.m.

HEADLINE: State Referendums Seeking to Overhaul Health Care System

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 10

 BODY:
They were gently spoken and kind-eyed in their white coats, but make no mistake: the handful of doctors and nurses gathering signatures outside the Massachusetts Statehouse see themselves as part of a popular health care insurgency, and some medical powers are taking them seriously enough to spend millions of dollars trying to stop them.
With one final petition drive this weekend, a coalition of doctors, nurses, senior citizens' groups, labor unions and others is expected to collect the last several thousand signatures needed to place before Massachusetts voters what experts call the most sweeping health care referendum on any state's ballot this fall. 
 Seeking to tap into widespread discontent with inaction by Congress and the Statehouse, the referendum would require the Legislature to find a way to provide health insurance coverage for all by mid-2002 in a state where more than 600,000 people lack it. It would also introduce a patients' bill of rights that would guarantee patients the freedom to choose their doctors, and guarantee doctors the freedom to choose the right treatment for their patients. And it would put a temporary ban on the conversion of nonprofit hospitals to for-profit.
Similar white-coat rebellions are in the works elsewhere: campaigners in Washington State, too, are close to getting a measure calling for universal health care onto the state ballot for this fall, which would make this the first campaign season in which more than one state had a universal care initiative on the ballot, experts say.
In a handful of other states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Montana -- campaigns backing narrower health care proposals, like requiring tobacco settlement money to go toward health, are using ballot initiatives as well.
"What is happening is an enormous backlash by the public," said Dr. Bernard Lown, a Nobel prize laureate and a leader of the Massachusetts initiative drive.
A push to overhaul the health care system, he said, "has to come from below, from the state level; you're closer to the people, you're closer to their pain, and they're more readily mobilized."
He and other campaigners say they believe a convergence of several factors is at work in their favor. They point to the swelling numbers of uninsured people, the trouble that many patients have paying for their prescription drugs, the spiraling costs of medical care and the widespread complaints from doctors and nurses that new constraints are keeping them from offering the best care to their patients.
The opposition appears readily mobilized as well.
Here in Massachusetts, the Coalition for Health Care, which is running the ballot campaign, is already opposed by the Committee for Affordable Health Care Choices, which unites business associations, managed care organizations and other insurers.
"We're just getting into campaign readiness," said Richard C. Lord, its spokesman and president of the state's biggest business association. "But it's probably going to take millions of dollars, because if you want to get your message across to the voters, you need to advertise, and that's very expensive."
His group's message, he said, will include the points that the initiative could destroy the networks that are the very basis of managed care, and could throw the health care system into chaos by the beginning of next year.
The committee also argues that the initiative is overly vague in that it calls for universal health care but does not specify how it is to be paid for. Several commissions in recent years have been stymied by the question of who would pay that bill, Mr. Lord noted.
The initiative's backers counter that the vagueness was intentional, because it allowed the formation of a coalition that included those who favor a Canadian-style single-payer system, those who favor a Hawaii-style requirement that employers provide health insurance, and others.
"People have been specifying the funding mechanisms forever, and they've been losing," said John O'Connor, the campaign's co-chairman and a veteran campaigner for environmental causes. "We want to keep the majority of voters together on the concept that everybody has to be covered by a date certain," July 1, 2002.
Judging by polls and the signature-gathering outside the Statehouse on Friday, support is indeed broad for the general idea of universal coverage.
A few passers-by withheld judgment, but several signed with alacrity. "I'm definitely for universal health care," said Shuang Wang, a 21-year-old intern at the Statehouse, "though I don't know where the money is going to come from." Another signer, Tom McCarron, a lobbyist on transportation issues, said, "I just think it's vitally important that people be covered for health care. The cost of it is just out of control."
Proposals for universal coverage have been made repeatedly in recent years around the country, since well before the Clinton administration tried to overhaul the country's health care system in the early 1990's.
In liberal Massachusetts, a universal health care proposal was even enacted into law in the late 1980's, though the Statehouse went from Democrat to Republican and the economy from flush to hard up, and the measure was repealed before it took effect.
Usually, measures calling for universal health care and other sweeping changes have tended to go down to defeat, said Diane Lardie, national coordinator of Uhcan, the Universal Health Care Action Network, a national group based in Cleveland. They have come up in more than 20 states beginning in Ohio in 1989, Ms. Lardie said, but usually either failed to make it onto the ballot or died in a legislative committee or on the floor of one house or another.
"One of the difficulties with something like a health care issue is that health care is so complex that people are scared," she said, "and they're willing to say, 'Don't do anything,' as opposed to 'Change it for the better' because they're afraid it won't be for the better."
The Massachusetts and Washington State initiatives are important bellwethers to gauge whether public opinion has indeed shifted, Ms. Lardie said. Maryland, too, is "ahead of the pack," she said. There, a political push for universal health care is under way, though it involves no referendum this year.
Oregon, as well, is a spot to watch. Campaigners there had planned a referendum on a health care overhaul this season, they said, but postponed it, in part because action is under way on the legislative front. Also, Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a doctor, called for universal health care insurance for all Oregonians earlier this year, saying he hoped to work out a proposal for the 2001 Legislature.
In Massachusetts, other political avenues are being pursued. State Senator Richard T. Moore, the Senate chairman of the Legislature's joint committee on health care, said he was confident that legislators would pass their own patients' bill of rights within the next month or so, one that would include the possibility of external review for patients denied care by their managed care providers. In addition, he said, a commission appointed by the governor to examine health care financing, quality and safety is to begin meeting next week.
He is concerned, Senator Moore said, that the ballot initiative "really goes too far."
Dr. Harris A. Berman, the chief executive of Tufts Health Plan here, also opposes the initiative, arguing that it can be expected to raise the price of health care significantly by taking away H.M.O.s' ability to control costs. To him, the very existence of the initiative, which tries to "use oversimplification to solve a very complex problem," is counterproductive.
"In a health care system hurting as badly as Massachusetts'," Dr. Berman said, "with every hospital and just about every health plan losing money and home health care operations going out of business, to spend millions of dollars that should be used on health care on this fight is just a travesty."
But campaigners say they will soldier on, regardless of criticism and possible legislative action, convinced that universal health care would save money by improving access to preventive care and thus avoiding expensive emergency room visits. And, they said, it is also the morally correct path.
John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist, has lent his name to the campaign and said he was supporting the initiative because he joined "with all sensible people in not wanting to see anyone die because they can't afford the requisite medical treatment."
He said he had grave doubts about whether health care "can be a business enterprise, where one saves money by cutting back care."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Shhh. There's a New Musical. It's Hush-Hush.

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
THE safety of distance is one reason that would-be Broadway musicals -- the holy grail of theater -- sometimes try out 3,000 miles from their ultimate goal. Southern California is the ideal hideaway. As one New York commercial producer put it: "Farther is better. You feel that you have more privacy. The farther away a show is, the fewer people tend to get on planes and see it and gossip about how bad it is."
These days, this area seems to be making a concerted pitch to be taken seriously as a generator of new musicals. The strip from Los Angeles to San Diego is percolating with an unusual number of musical shows, but though some preliminary reviews are in, the larger jury is still out about how well these musicals might do on Broadway, once their problems are solved. The difficulties of creating a Broadway musical hit are notorious and, with a few notable exceptions, most of those involved in the quest here do not have a track record in the field. 
 Fifteen years ago, "Big River" was a hit on Broadway and its director, Des McAnuff, who had nursed it at the La Jolla Playhouse, would subsequently repeat the trick with "The Who's Tommy" and the revival of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" starring Matthew Broderick.
But the casualties have been almost as well known and include "Elmer Gantry" (1991) at La Jolla; "Time and Again" (1995) at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego; "Buddy . . . the Buddy Holly Story" (1997) at the San Diego Repertory Company; "Harmony" (1997), composed by Barry Manilow, at La Jolla, and "What the World Needs Now" (1998), with the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, at the Old Globe.
This time around, the most eagerly anticipated mainstream show here is probably "The Full Monty" at the Old Globe, a musical stage version of the highly successful 1997 movie. The six unemployed steel mill workers who decide to become male strippers are Americans in Buffalo now, not British laborers in Sheffield, England. Yet with the exception of a handful of new characters, as well as songs and dances, the show has been designed by its American creators to adhere to the poignantly funny path of those desperate men who find friendship and strength by taking off their clothes to earn money.
"When I got the call two years ago and was asked, 'What do you think about the idea of "The Full Monty" as a musical?' I thought, 'Oh, man, what a great idea,' " said Jack O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, who is staging the show. The book is by the playwright Terrence McNally, who also wrote the books for the musicals "Ragtime" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman"; the music and lyrics are by David Yazbek, a relative unknown.
"The Full Monty" officially opened here on June 1 and critics have called it highly commercial but flawed. "The show's an energetic, if forgettable, crowd-pleaser," said Variety, with "a strong shot at an extended Broadway run and life beyond that." While "The Full Monty" is widely expected to go to Broadway in the fall, the other shows are more offbeat and commercially risky. But depending on local reaction and that of commercial producers, they could wind up in New York someday.
The productions include "Celebration of the Lizard," a futuristic rock musical built around the songs of the Doors, which opened on May 28 at the San Diego Rep. The Los Angeles Times called the show a "silly, derivative and rather sweet nostalgia trip," while The San Diego Union-Tribune found it "a flat, retro show."
The third musical that recently opened, "The Education of Randy Newman" on June 2 at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, was more favorably received. In this show, conceived by Mr. Newman, Michael Roth and Jerry Patch, the composer-performer chronicles his life, from his boyhood in New Orleans -- where he never quite fit in -- to his career, marriage, divorce and remarriage in Los Angeles. The Hollywood Reporter found it "a deft musical catalog that is touching, hilarious, satirical and always unmistakably Newman." And Variety called it an "intelligently staged, powerfully sung revue-that's-almost-more."
A new show based on the 1967 movie musical "Thoroughly Modern Millie," and using the same title, is to open this fall at the La Jolla Playhouse. With a book by Richard Morris, the author of "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," and Dick Scanlon, based on Mr. Morris's original screenplay, it will have additional music by Jeanine Tesori, the composer of the Off Broadway musical "Violet." The director is Michael Mayer, who recently did the revival of the musical "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" on Broadway.
Next spring in Los Angeles, the nonprofit Center Theater Group will present a full-scale revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Flower Drum Song" at the Ahmanson Theater, with a revised book by David Henry Hwang, the author of "M. Butterfly" and the recent "Golden Child," both on Broadway. It will be directed and choreographed by Robert Longbottom, who directed the Broadway musicals "Side Show" and the revised "Scarlet Pimpernel."
The number of shows in various states of progress is a sign not only of the built-in audiences here for musical theater but also of the continued blurring of the line between nonprofit regional houses and commercial Broadway interests. A national three-day conference on the current and future relationship between nonprofit and commercial theater in America begins on Friday at Harvard University. Critics of commercial producers who use nonprofit stages to develop work bound for Broadway argue that commercial pressures for wide audience appeal can stifle experimentation.
Mr. O'Brien, who has been the artistic director at the Old Globe for 19 years, is optimistic. "San Diego was a perfect place to start this project," he said about "The Full Monty." "We're far enough from New York to work in a protected environment."
Certainly San Diego has been used for years as a tryout town for New York. And the Old Globe itself has nourished such Broadway-bound shows as the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical "Into the Woods," the revival of "Damn Yankees" with Bebe Neuwirth, and Neil Simon's "Rumors" and "Jake's Women."
T HE FULL MONTY" will remain at the 600-seat Old Globe, nestled in Balboa Park, until July 9. It is expected to open in the fall on Broadway at a Jujamcyn theater at a cost of nearly $7 million, financed by Fox Searchlight, the division of 20th Century Fox that released the movie. The San Diego production cost about $2.2 million, 75 percent of that provided by the Old Globe, the rest by Fox Searchlight.
"Audiences at a lot of these theaters are excited about being part of the birthing process of new plays and musicals -- they know their reaction can alter a piece," said Neel Keller, associate artistic director at La Jolla, where "Thoroughly Modern Millie" is to open in October.
Mr. Keller, who was trained on New York and Chicago stages, said that local audiences seemed committed to eclectic theater. "Sure, they enjoy their day at the beach -- who doesn't?" he said. "But the sun goes down and people love that outlet of the theater."
Seated in his office at the Old Globe, Mr. O'Brien put it more bluntly: "Twenty or 25 years ago this was a Navy town. It was a bastion of conservatism and military correctness, and it was quite sleepy. But it's not sleepy any longer. To be candid, a large number of the people now in Southern California have come from other areas and brought their own tastes, sophistication and expectations with them. We've seen an influx of technology companies like Qualcomm and Gateway. It's far more sophisticated, far more discerning. And people really enjoy theater."
TOM HALL, the producing director of the Old Globe, said the commercial enhancement money that nonprofit theaters can receive for a Broadway-bound production allows them to stage musicals they ordinarily could not afford. At the same time, the local theater has a chance to share in the profits if a show reaches Broadway and does well.
A few miles from "The Full Monty" is the San Diego Rep's "Celebration of the Lizard." This fable, set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, is based on the music and lyrics of the rock 'n' roll icons Jim Morrison and the Doors. (The 33 songs include, of course, "Light My Fire.") The show, costing $750,000, the most expensive so far at the 24-year-old theater, has aroused interest among New York producers. But the price of a move to Broadway would probably be three times as much as opening the show in San Diego.
"We have high hopes it will have an afterlife," said Sam Woodhouse, the theater's artistic director, who is staging the production.
The show was conceived and adapted by Joel Lipman, 42, a television producer who said that his head has been spinning since he heard "Light My Fire" on a transistor radio one summer night when he was 10. A meeting in 1989 with Ray Manzarek, one of the Doors, led Mr. Lipman to return to the poetry and writings of Jim Morrison, who died in 1971. Mr. Lipman helped create the musical from a Morrison poem, "Celebration of the Lizard," recorded in the late 1960's.
What appealed to Mr. Lipman -- and what may give the show a life despite the reviews -- is the consistent appeal of the music of the Doors to audiences who weren't even born when the group flourished. "There has been a steady increase in sales of their music for the last 30 years," Mr. Lipman said. "Many musicians popular today -- from R.E.M. to U2 to Jon Bon Jovi -- cite the influence of the Doors. One of our hopes is that younger audiences will find a new excitement in the theater with this musical."
At South Coast Rep, Mr. Newman has used the classic autobiography "The Education of Henry Adams" as a model for his show, which is directed and choreographed by Myron Johnson. The composer's songs, presented by seven male and female singers, are intended to depict his personal voyage. "It's a compilation of about 40 songs," Mr. Newman said. "It's a sort of fantasy based on my life."
He added with a laugh that the public revelations of his personal life hardly bothered him. "I would use anything I had for a song, I would make an entertainment of my life even if it were enormously lurid," he said. "If I had anything to confess and get a song out of it, I'd do it. I can't keep my mouth shut."
Mr. Newman's production of "Faust" (he wrote the book, music and lyrics) at La Jolla in 1995 moved to the Goodman Theater in Chicago but never reached Broadway. The composer spoke happily about his theatrical experiences at La Jolla and now at South Coast Rep. "The people are so well-trained," he said. "They're terrific actors, they sing harmony, they sight-read better than I can. And they get paid practically nothing. It's ridiculous."
It was to La Jolla that the commercial Broadway producer Rocco Landesman and the set designer Heidi Ettinger, who was then his wife, brought "Big River" after originally working on it at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. They would also become involved with "Into the Woods" at the Old Globe. "It was the first time that musicals were put into development through regional theaters," Mr. Landesman said recently from his office at Jujamcyn Theaters in New York, where he is the president. "You had transfers before, but this was commercial producers coming to the theater and saying, 'We'd like to develop a musical with you.' "
"In terms of being able to see your whole production in front of an audience, it's a lot cheaper," he continued. "And something which is so critical: you have the luxury of time. You can close the show and then work on it. But if you're in Boston, you have a week and then you have to be in New York. Time is the biggest luxury in developing a musical and a regional theater gives you that."
Mr. Landesman was also one of the commercial producers on the musical "Time and Again," based on the novel by Jack Finney, with Mr. O'Brien at the Old Globe. Despite the show's failure, Mr. Landesman said, "I think there's a good chance that that show has a viable future." His long-running revue "Smokey Joe's Cafe," which recently closed on Broadway, played at the Doolittle Theater in Los Angeles (part of the Center Theater Group) on its way to New York.
Interest in a musical stage version of "The Full Monty" began almost as soon as the film was released, according to Lindsay Law, the former president of Fox Searchlight, who said he had fielded calls from theatrical producers in Europe and the United States. "I told Fox, 'It's a valuable project, you don't want someone to make a bad musical that would tarnish the name,' " recalled Mr. Law, who is now a producer of the show.
He took the idea to Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Hall at the Old Globe -- two longtime friends. They decided to seek out Mr. McNally. "When I called Terrence," Mr. O'Brien remembered, "and told him about this project, he said, 'I would have killed you if you hadn't asked me to do it.' "
The team's major task was finding a composer. Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Law said they wanted songs that would, in the words of Mr. Law, "not be the same ones you hear on the Broadway stage -- we wanted to bring a different sound to Broadway than what you traditionally hear."
THEY offered the job to Adam Guettel, the composer of the Off Broadway musical "Floyd Collins." Mr. Guettel was intrigued but committed to several other projects. He suggested a composer-lyricist friend, Mr. Yazbek, 38, who was once a writer on the CBS show "Late Night With David Letterman." Mr. Yazbek, who lives in Manhattan, has recorded two albums of his own songs, scored television shows and written songs and scripts for children's television.
The producing team listened to CD's of his songs, and asked him to try out by writing several more for "The Full Monty." Mr. Yazbek said he wrote three songs, two of which are still in the show.
Mr. O'Brien said, "The music was energetic and edgy, male, witty and literate."
Patrick Wilson, 26, who recently appeared in the "Encores!" concert version of the musical "Tenderloin" in New York, has the main role created by Robert Carlyle in the movie. A 1995 graduate of Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Wilson also performed in "Bright Lights Big City," the Paul Scott Goodman musical Off Broadway.
Seated outside the Old Globe on a recent morning, awaiting the start of rehearsals, Mr. Wilson, in baggy pants and a sweatshirt, said he grew up singing in St. Petersburg, Fla., where his mother is a choir director and voice teacher and his father and brother are local television anchors. Sipping a soft drink, he said with a grin that he and the other performers were uneasy about the show's finale in which, like the film, the men remove all their clothes.
"It's lit so you can't really see too much," Mr. Wilson said. "I keep talking myself into it, saying, 'It's going to be fine, it's totally tasteful.' But you know as well as I do that someone in the audience is going to have a camera. And the next thing that happens is it's going to be on the Internet. And that weirds me out."

HEADLINE: 2 Counties: The Profligate and the Prudent

BYLINE: By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
TWO old men chatting on a street outside the Larchmont Post Office could occupy the same turf in Garden City. The sweet aroma of cafe con leche drifting out of a Mexican restaurant in Port Chester could be coming through the entrance of a Salvadoran eatery in Hempstead. A diner in Hastings-on-Hudson could be a diner in Oyster Bay, the same hungry eaters with their sport utility vehicles nosed to the curbs outside.
The weekend tag sales that proliferate each spring could be in Levittown or Tarrytown, Roslyn or Rye, any of the scores of bedroom communities that make up Nassau and Westchester Counties. 
 To casual observers, the two counties are nearly indistinguishable. Westchester is larger in land area, Nassau larger in population. Westchester was recently ranked the seventh wealthiest county in America; Nassau placed 17th. They share Long Island Sound and a state government. Both have fabulous mansions and pockets of poverty, Lyme ticks and West Nile mosquitoes and a border with New York City.
Yet one glaring difference sets them apart. While Westchester's government is the picture of economic health, awash in a sea of surplus and with a credit rating that is among the best in the country, Nassau is in a budget crisis that will probably require every New York State taxpayer's help, and with a deficit that has pushed its bond rating nearly to junk status.
How such similar counties evolved financially -- "like night and day" in the words of an aide to the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall -- is a tale of philosophically opposite methods of budgeting and taxing set against wildly varying political landscapes.
In Nassau, one-party politics prompted Republican leaders into disastrous financial decisions. For years, county officials forged a steady record of underestimating costs and overestimating revenues. They held the line on property taxes but paid employees handsomely, while selling off county property or borrowing mountains of cash to keep government chugging along.
But their luck ran out last year as the deficit reached $300 million. An apathetic electorate was energized, humbling a legendary G.O.P. machine and creating a Democratic legislative majority for the first time in nearly a century. At the heart of the election was the budget mess.
In Westchester, more conservative budgeting grew out of years of competition between Democratic and Republican elected officials, who held one another in check. Westchester voters saw their legislative branch overhauled 26 years ahead of Nassau's, a move that gave lawmakers more responsibility and provided needed checks and balances in government, officials on both sides agree.
Westchester leaders never got into Nassau's habit of using one-time revenues, like money from the sale of a hospital, for example, to pay continuing costs. They did little borrowing. And, unpopular as it was, they increased property taxes a bit each year to cover spending increases.
"The problems in Nassau have been a reflection of politics and history," said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of the Nassau County Legislature, which replaced the old Board of Supervisors in 1996. "One-party government controlled a part-time legislature that was able to rubber-stamp the executive branch of government. When you put the politics and history together, it was a recipe for disaster."
A comparison of the counties found the following:
*In Nassau, each resident's share of the county's debt is $2,065. That is more than twice as much as any other county in New York and more than six times the state average. By contrast, Westchester's debt is $627 per resident.
*Nassau spends $520 million -- nearly a quarter of its $2.2 billion budget -- on a police department whose rank-and-file officers are paid $90,000 a year. Officers eat up half the county payroll but comprise just 29 percent of the work force. Westchester has a much smaller police force, representing a mere 1.8 percent of the county's $1.17 billion budget. The average officer is paid $63,500 a year.
*When Nassau sold its hospital last year for $82 million, it used the windfall to help plug the deficit. When Westchester transferred its hospital to a public benefit corporation in 1997, it did it for $1, not seeking to make money off the deal. Similarly, Nassau used $170 million in tobacco settlement money to pay for ongoing costs and to help balance its books. Westchester used $63.4 million of its tobacco money to erase hospital debts through 2005.
*The biggest share of Nassau's debt -- $100 million a year -- goes to repay homeowners and merchants who successfully challenge their property tax assessments. Westchester paid $9 million in such refunds last year. And unlike Nassau, which borrows to pay, Westchester pays with money budgeted for that purpose.
*In Nassau, property taxes are collected by towns and cities, which first take their share and forward the remainder to the county. If there is a shortfall, it's the county's responsibility to collect. In Westchester, the towns and cities collect the money and pay the county first.
Taken together, the effect of such procedural differences is staggering, experts say. Today, Westchester has the highest credit rating given by Standard & Poor's, while Nassau's rating is hovering just above junk status, with a downgrade threatened for month's end.
"I would say that if Nassau had used Westchester as an example of how to run a county over the past 10 years, Nassau's taxpayers would be in much better shape today," Comptroller McCall said.
But the tale of the two counties is also a story of residents whose lives are playing out differently. While Westchester's roughly 900,000 residents are gliding along on one of the nation's longest economic expansions, there's a recession mentality among Nassau's 1.3 million people, who are nagged by a daily sense of fiscal chaos, by the prospect of tax increases and layoffs of county police officers and by cutbacks in services that are punctuated by protest marches through the county seat in Garden City.
Still, both counties have hordes of retail stores filled with shoppers with ready cash. Both have high per-capita income and low unemployment.
"The fact that Westchester didn't have Nassau's problems doesn't mean it's more affluent than Nassau," said Anthony A. Cupaiuolo, a professor of public administration at Pace University in White Plains. "It was just managed better than Nassau and didn't get involved in all the political games."
In Nassau, the problem comes down to one simple truth: there is not enough money flowing in to cover the amount streaming out, as County Comptroller Frederick E. Parola, a Republican, has been saying since June 1996.
In Westchester, because the math adds up, deficits are unheard of and the cost of governing is balanced, said Kathleen M. Carrano, Westchester's budget director, who grew up in Nassau County and once worked as the controller in Glen Cove.
Nassau's fiscal tailspin started long before its deficit hit $300 million last summer. The county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, took office in 1987. While he oversaw spending increases for things like keeping the county parks pristine and ensuring that salaries for county employees outpaced inflation, he held the line on property taxes. Feeling no pain, the voters for years rewarded him at the polls.
In Westchester, tax increases came in frequent small steps. It was enough so that County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, could cut taxes by 3 percent this year.
"I think the reluctance to raise property taxes incrementally is a major cause of where Nassau stands fiscally today," said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, Long Island's largest business group.
One beneficiary of Nassau's lavish spending has been the county police department, where costs have shot up 64 percent in the past decade, and where lucrative provisions in a series of police contracts -- one negotiated, in 1992, and the most recent one decided by an arbitrator -- have seen payouts for retiring officers reach the six-figure mark, with the average supervisor taking home $207,000 upon retirement last year.
Westchester's spending on its police force is much lower, just $19.6 million.
The Westchester Department of Public Safety was created by voter referendum in the early 1980's, and it merged a former Sheriff's Department with what used to be called the office of Parkway Police. Today, there are 273 positions budgeted for the department, including 222 uniformed officers. That compares with 4,100 positions, including 3,100 officers, in Nassau.
To Todd A. Whitestone, managing director of public finance ratings at Standard & Poor's, it is not the cost of such things as police services that is alarming in Nassau as much as it is Nassau's inability to pay.
Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature, said Nassau must rethink what it can afford.
"Nassau has always had the Cadillac of programs, and everyone else has had Chevys and Fords, and we have to get to that," he said.
Now, he added, politicians in Nassau need the political will to cut costs.
Of course, cutting jobs or salaries in Nassau has always been politically unpalatable because appointed commissioners, deputy commissioners, secretaries and others have been the lifeblood of a strong Republican machine.
Democrats in Nassau, hampered by internal squabbling for more than a decade, were often left on the sidelines by an electorate that "tolerated wasteful spending and governmental mismanagement," said Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, an advocacy group.
Dr. Cupaiuolo, of Pace, said: "In Westchester, for quite a few years, both parties held active roles. Both parties have been healthier, and that is healthier when you have two parties that are competitive. The impression I get is that Nassau is just riddled with patronage, and outrageously so, and the political culture was, 'Let's keep bringing people on, giving them good salaries and this way we can stay in office as long as we want.' It certainly exists in Westchester, but I don't believe to that extent."
Nassau's problems are aggravated by its debt.
In addition to loans for roads and buildings, Nassau borrows just to keep government going. To cover operating costs, Nassau's projected cash flow borrowing this year is $485 million, compared with $75 million for that purpose last year in Westchester, municipal analysts said. Westchester has scheduled no short-term borrowing in 2000.
"That is a big difference with Westchester's triple A and Nassau's triple B," Diane P. Brosen, director at Standard & Poor's, said of the credit ratings. "One big warning sign of fiscal problems is an escalation of debt and cash-flow borrowing."
Overall, Westchester has been closer to the mark in estimating cash flow, for items like sales tax receipts, and its expenses, for things like employee overtime. Only once in recent history, in 1998, has Westchester overestimated its sales tax revenue, Ms. Carrano said.
Nassau, on the other hand, has consistently underestimated overtime costs and, at least since 1995, it has overestimated sales tax receipts. Last year, receipts were $9 million short, and the year before they were $33 million short, according to Standard & Poor's.
When shortfalls or apparent overruns do occur, Nassau is slow to pick up on them and make budget adjustments at midyear or at quarterly marks in the fiscal year, Ms. Brosen said. "They just wait and say, 'Whoop, you know, there is a big gap here,' " she said. But in Westchester, there is "ongoing budget monitoring, both expenditures and revenues," said Robin Prunty, the Standard & Poors analyst who monitors Westchester.
Michael P. Jacobson, a former budget official in New York City who helped the Nassau Legislature prepare a fiscal plan last fall, said he was left feeling that Nassau's financial management system was completely nonexistent. A key problem, he said, was that Nassau's budget office was understaffed, though adding people was a "heavy lift politically, if you are in financial straits."
He continued: "There was not a centralized, powerful budget office that was able to know immediately, on a real-time basis, early on, what problems were coming down the pike, what to do about them, how to avert problems; there was absolutely no multiyear budgeting. My sense is Westchester probably has a better management system. They keep closer track."
Stopping the kind of actions that lead to budget problems in Nassau will take political will, most financial experts agree. It is an ingredient many say was missing in Nassau for years, especially considering that budgets must be passed a few days before Election Day, making tax increases that much more difficult, politically.
Arthur J. Kremer, a former Democratic state assemblyman who is now a lawyer at Rivkin Radler & Kremer, one of Long Island's largest law firms, said that in Nassau "the government was sound asleep and failed to follow any of the warning signs" of a fiscal wreck coming down the road.
But unlike New York City in 1975, or Troy, which nearly went bankrupt in 1994, or Orange County, Calif., which lost $2 billion in a risky investment scheme, Nassau threatens to crumble in the midst of a soaring national economy. To Edward Glaeser, professor of economics at Harvard University, the case for a state government bailout of Nassau is hard to make, even though the first steps are in place with a plan by Gov. George E. Pataki to combine $100 million in grants to Nassau with a fiscal control board that would monitor Nassau's efforts to get its act together, and impose its own plan if it cannot.
"This is not a city like Detroit that is mired in poverty; it is a healthy place that, if it were run with any sense of fiscal responsibility, should be very healthy," Mr. Glaeser said of Nassau. But, he said, the comparison to Westchester is even more startling, given the two counties' many similarities. "In one area, fiscal responsibility reigns, and in the other place they are playing games."
 
The Difference a Legislature Makes
IF you ask Arthur J. Kremer the No. 1 reason why "the structure crumbled" in Nassau County, the former state assemblyman will tell you it is because Nassau did not have a legislature until four years ago.
In Westchester County, those who know the system said, the creation of such a body in 1970 is a big reason why government is now in good financial shape.
"No doubt, the closer you get to one person one vote, the more effective you can govern," said Stephen P. Tenore, a Republican lawmaker for 11 years in Westchester and the former chairman of the county's Board of Legislators.
Under Nassau's old Board of Supervisors system, one representative each came from the cities of Long Beach and Glen Cove and from the towns of Oyster Bay and North Hempstead. Two more came from the more populous town of Hempstead.
"The board was made up of town supervisors who really didn't care much about county government except to make sure they got their share of the pie," said Mr. Kremer, a Democrat, who said that even when the new 19-member Legislature took over in 1996, it "needed two to three years to find out what was going on, and they were in no position to find out the depth of the problems until recently."
Westchester abandoned its Board of Supervisors for a legislature 26 years earlier than Nassau because its board wasn't working well. The legislature "never let the budget go out of shape" over the years, said Herman D. Geist, a Republican and the legislature's first chairman.
While a strong legislative body in Westchester kept a check on the executive branch, Nassau suffered "from a lack of a strong county government in terms of planning, environmental protection, industrial development," said Bruce Nyman, a former Democratic member of Nassau's Board of Supervisors and Legislature.
David Liebschutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College of SUNY Albany, said that even now politics has kept an inexperienced legislature in Nassau from forming a consensus with the executive branch on how to pull the county out of its mess. The alternative may yet be a fiscal oversight board to shoulder the tough decisions -- and share in any potential political blame. AL BAKER
 On Thursday, after the article had gone to press, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature agreed to spend $105 million to bail out Nassau County and impose state oversight of county spending. Nassau will have to agree to make deep budget cuts in return for the state aid.

HEADLINE: Charities' Investing: Left Hand, Meet Right

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
THE Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- the largest anywhere, with an endowment of $22 billion -- spends tens of millions of dollars each year aimed, in its own words, at "helping to improve people's lives through health and learning." In addition to making a sweeping effort to vaccinate the world's children, it has backed charities like Cancer Lifeline, which provides support to people with cancer and their families, and the American Cancer Society.
But according to its most recent tax return, the Gates Foundation also owned bonds in Philip Morris, the tobacco company -- raising the issue of whether the foundation's behavior as an investor sometimes runs counter to its charitable mission. 
 "If you believe tobacco kills, and you are concerned about health, it would seem absurd to hold tobacco stocks in your portfolio," said Stephen Viederman, a longtime foundation executive who has waged a tireless battle to persuade more of these charities to rethink their investments in light of their social aims.
Yet at a time when many foundations are benefiting from a huge run-up in stocks -- and as socially responsible investing has proven to be a successful bull-market strategy -- few foundations have been quick to adopt Mr. Viederman's approach.
To be sure, a smattering of foundations are active as shareholders. But many more view their sole responsibility as maximizing returns so that they can give away more money.
Mr. Viederman and a handful of others, however, contend that foundations are also obligated to consider, as he puts it, "the social and environmental consequences of their investments."
The $90 million endowment that Mr. Viederman led until recently, the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation, based in Manhattan, screens its portfolio for investments that might conflict with its goal of protecting the environment. It declines, for example, to invest in companies like Dow Chemical and Monsanto.
"You would think that foundations have a clear mission in social policy issues and would look at the portfolio as another tool they could use, but by and large they don't," said Scott Fenn, the executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington group that advises large shareholders on corporate governance and social issues.
A spokesman for the Gates Foundation declined to comment about its thinking on socially responsible investing.
While most efforts to use investments to further social goals are associated with liberal causes, the concept is not tied to a specific ideology. A foundation that disapproved of abortion, for example, might refuse to own stocks of health care companies whose hospitals performed abortions.
But conservative foundations also tend to neglect their missions when investing their endowments, according to Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor at the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy and former president of the conservative Hudson Institute.
"The trustees of conservative foundations tend to be interested in maximizing the returns of their assets," he said -- and are not likely to favor shareholder activism as a tool for change.
AT most foundations, in fact, there has been a historical separation between who decides which causes to support and who decides how to invest the endowment. The second group, more comfortable with finance than advocacy, has focused exclusively on investment returns, resisting the idea of investing with other goals in mind.
Advocates of socially responsible investing argue that foundations are ignoring their influence as shareholders.
"If you have a large endowment, the power of that money to create change is probably more than the power of your grant-making," said Jill Ratner, president of the Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment, based in Oakland, Calif. The foundation, with about $1 million in assets, has taken an activist stance as a shareholder in Maxxam Inc., the Houston natural resources company; critics say Maxxam has logged old-growth forests and has a poor relationship with labor.
Because their endowments typically dwarf the grants that these charities make, Ms. Ratner said foundations should think more about the corpus, or principal, of their portfolio than the investment income they give away. "What you have at a lot of foundations are people trying to use their earnings to basically bet against their corpus," she said. "It's weighted the wrong way."
Earlier this year, the Rose Foundation joined with the United Steelworkers of America to push for the election of independent directors to Maxxam's board, asserting that if the company were better governed, its record on environmental and labor issues would improve. Charles Hurwitz, the company's chief executive, has voting control, and the proposal was defeated in May.
About $1 of every $8 under professional management -- some $2 trillion over all -- was involved in socially responsible investing last year, according to the Social Investment Forum, a Washington group that surveys the landscape every two years. That sum, the bulk of it invested under social screens, has roughly doubled from 1997.
The concept has grown in popularity among individual investors. Well-known investment managers like the Vanguard Group and TIAA-CREF recently began offering mutual funds with holdings screened for social considerations.
In the past, many people worried that issue-minded investing damaged investment performance. But there is a growing consensus that other influences -- like the sectors and companies in a portfolio -- may have greater impact on returns.
Moreover, some money managers who screen holdings for financial considerations, like those who run the Domini Social Equity fund, can now boast a performance history that closely matches the overall market. Over the last five years, Domini has returned 25.2 percent a year, on average, versus 24.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Like the S& P, the fund is weighted toward the technology stocks that have led the market the last few years.
Still, foundations, especially larger ones, have not been in the forefront of the social investing movement.
When it last surveyed its membership in 1997, the Council on Foundations found that slightly less than 15 percent screened for any social or ethical consideration. Small foundations, those with assets of less than $10 million, were almost twice as likely to do so as large ones, those with assets of $100 million or more, according to the survey.
While many foundations were active in dissuading companies from doing business in South Africa in the 1970's and 80's, subsequent causes do not appear to have captured their interest. Even the movement among large investors like state pension funds to divest their portfolios of tobacco stocks has not won many foundations' favor, although a few-high profile ones -- like the nearly $9 billion Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the $3 billion Charles Stewart Mott Foundation -- have rid their endowments of those stocks.
By contrast, some of the largest foundations, like the Gates fund and the $13 billion Ford Foundation, invested in these stocks, according to the latest tax returns. So did relatively big foundations whose primary aim is to improve the health of Americans, like the $525 million Commonwealth Fund in New York.
"We feel our energies are better spent on our grant-making," explained Michael C. Vachon, Commonwealth's director of communications. Commonwealth has supported programs intended to improve health care for minorities and to increase health insurance coverage and access to care for working Americans. The impact of divesting its portfolio of tobacco stocks would be "minimal," Mr. Vachon said.
UNLIKE other large investors -- including colleges and state pension funds -- foundations have been all but immune to public pressure, despite having amassed nearly $400 billion in assets, according to 1998 figures, the most recent available. Organizations that receive their grants do not want to endanger future aid; staff members tend not to have the power to force the issue. And to date, many activists seem unaware of the divergence between foundations' grant-making and their investments.
The foundation world has been truly left alone," said Matthew Myers, president of the National Center for Tobacco-free Kids, in Washington.
Foundations have also chosen not to model themselves after pension funds as shareholder activists, only rarely proposing shareholder resolutions urging a company to improve its business practices.
In the mid-1990's, the Noyes Foundation and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility established the Foundation Partnership on Corporate Responsibility to involve more endowments in shareholder activism. Only a dozen or so foundations, however, were sponsors or co-sponsors of shareholder resolutions within the last year.
"We have not gotten behind the force of the portfolio," acknowledged William S. White, president of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation in Flint, Mich. While Mott, which invests its endowment without the aid of outside managers, pays attention to proxy matters, it does not view its $3 billion in assets as a way to accomplish change at companies that prove themselves to be poor corporate citizens.
"We feel the market has a way of getting at some of these issues," Mr. White said.
Some foundations are leery of devoting much in the way of staff or time to shareholder issues, and activism rarely rises to the level of debate. "Most foundations still put a Chinese wall between their investment arms and their grant-making arms," said Doug Cogan, the deputy director of the social issues service of the Investor Responsibility Research Center.
Many social activists argue that selling a holding should be a last resort, preferring to use their shareholdings within the system to effect change. Indeed, some foundations that have undertaken shareholder activism say they have had an impact.
In the mid-1990's, for example, the Noyes Foundation started working closely with one of its grantees, the SouthWest Organizing Project, a community group in Albuquerque, to put pressure on the Intel Corporation to weigh environmental and employment concerns about plans to expand its chip-making operations in New Mexico.
Noyes, which owned 100 shares of Intel stock, filed two shareholder proposals that it says led to discussions between Intel and community activists about the impact of the company's actions. Intel eventually changed its environmental, health and safety policy to commit to more dialogue with communities housing its facilities, and Noyes withdrew its second shareholder proposal.
Activists say the presence of a foundation in such discussions can make a difference by convincing executives that there is a broader group of institutions concerned about their behavior. "The acoustics change with a company," said Timothy Smith, the director of the Interfaith Center.
BUT most foundations, beyond choosing not to sponsor shareholder resolutions, have remained largely silent on many of the proposals put forward by other investors, from measures pressing Home Depot to stop using old-growth wood to resolutions urging Sara Lee to avoid genetically modified food.
Even Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie, the three foundations that helped create the Investor Research Responsibility Center in 1972, say little publicly about their current roles as shareholders. People who follow shareholder campaigns say all three foundations appear to take their voting responsibilities seriously, but not one was willing to talk in detail about how it votes its proxies.
"The key question to be raised is how best to engage corporate leadership," said Alexander W. Wilde, a spokesman for the Ford Foundation. While Ford will write privately to companies from time to time, he said, in addition to voting on shareholder issues, it prefers to work with companies on charitable programs rather than engage them through its ownership of their shares.
Some big foundations, like the Commonwealth Fund, do not even vote their shares, leaving the task to their investment managers. Others, like the $13 billion David and Lucile Packard Foundation, invest much of their money in pooled index funds, which means that they cannot vote their shares.
"I think that is a tremendous lost opportunity," said Robert Massey, executive director of the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, which works with investors to improve corporations' environmental records.
While many foundation officials say they believe that their fiduciary duty lies in trying to maximize returns, some advocates of social investing go so far as to argue that these endowments have a legal obligation to consider their mission when making investment decisions.
"It is not a question you can disregard," said William McKeown, a New York lawyer who specializes in nonprofit law. "Fiduciaries have a responsibility to carry out the purpose of the organization."

HEADLINE: Raising the Rent, and Raising the Roof

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IT is surely one of the most thankless tasks in public service. And on Thursday morning, when the gavel pounds for the start of this year's all-day hearing on proposed rent increases for New York City's 1 million rent-stabilized apartments, members of the city's Rent Guidelines Board may well have shudders from hearings past lurking in the recesses of their minds:
Thoughts of marbles arching at them from the back of the auditorium. Of rainstorms of epithets. Of circling like covered wagons on stage to conduct business while a phalanx of police officers holds the placard-shaking crowd at bay. 
 And of all nine board members, those most wondering why on earth they are doing this may well be the five public representatives seated center stage -- landlord members to the right of them, tenants to the left.
This year, the board has issued a preliminary recommendation that rents on apartments covered by the rent stabilization regulations be raised by 4 percent for one-year leases and 6 percent for two-year leases -- a significant jump from the 2 and 4 percent increases ordered in most recent years.
Recalling unruly meetings of years past, Vincent Castellano, one of the two landlord members -- who readily affirms that he serves on the board to protect his own interests and those of the city's 25,000 other landlords -- wondered: "Can you think of any agency of government where the meetings are as bizarre? It's a zoo."
As for the public members' motivation, he said, "They're masochists."
David Pagan, one of the two tenant representatives, is the administrator of Los Sures, a housing and community development organization in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "I come in from the neighborhoods where I deal with a lot of tenants, that's why I'm here," Mr. Pagan said. "The public members, I don't know. I can't figure what's there for a public member."
"There's not much recognition; it's not a power position," Mr. Pagan said. "They really must love to be helpful. At the same time, how long can you be helpful if you are being hit over the head?"
There is also not much pay; the members receive the same $100-a-day fee that was set back in 1969 when the Rent Guidelines Board was created -- a point of particular annoyance to them. "We get $100 per session, about 10 times a year," Mr. Pagan said. "So it's an extra thousand dollars, for which we have to reveal our financial history" -- in a 35-page form.
To be sure, meetings of the board have been somewhat calmer in recent years. "Far more decorous than prior years," said Mr. Castellano, the landlord representative, "almost bordering on the civil -- almost, not quite."
In part, the relative decorum "has to do with the economy," Mr. Castellano said. "It's hard to get worked up about a 2 or 4 percent increase when you've got a job. If you're unemployed, it's a different story. It's not the hot-button issue it was in the early 90's." Yet, when the board convenes in the Great Hall of Cooper Union, 7 East Seventh Street, at 10 a.m. Thursday, the button may be pushed, a bit.
For five of the last six years -- not counting tumultuous 1996 when they were 5 and 7 percent -- the rent increases have been 2 percent and 4 percent. And, in the view of tenant advocates, with inflation largely in check, the current proposal for 4 and 6 percent increases seems unjustified.
The landlords argue, however, that they have been hit with significant increases in fuel costs and real estate taxes, and deserve compensation even greater than the preliminary recommendation.
The board's final vote will not be taken during the public hearing, but is scheduled for 5 p.m. on June 22, also in the Great Hall at Cooper Union. The final guidelines will affect those leases with starting dates between on Oct. 1, 2000 and Sept. 30, 2001.
Piqued last month by media accounts that a proposed change in the way the board's staff provides economic reports could lead to whopping increases of 8.5 and 12 percent (in fact, the change was not adopted by the board), public interest in the current proposal has been stirred. And with it, renewed railing on opposing sides of the landlord-tenant divide that (a) the rent board is in the pocket of a city administration beholden to the real estate lobby or (b) that tenant advocates are simply flexing their numbers to politicize the process, invoking protection of the poor on behalf of lots of people who can afford to pay more.
Central to the board's deliberations is a debate over whether one year's rent guidelines should be based solely on economic factors from the immediately preceding year or should compensate for previous inflationary fluctuations. Also at issue is what role a potentially one-time spike in a particular element of the calculations -- fuel costs, in this instance -- should play.
All of which sets the stage for 12 hours of vigorous contention on Thursday, with landlord and tenant advocates from the audience taking turns in last-word attempts to test the limits of their allotted three-minute speaking times -- punctuated by vociferous support or derision from opposing factions in the crowd.
Edward A. Weinstein, for one, will brook little of the disorder of the not-too-distant past. Mr. Weinstein, one of the five public members of the board, is a retired senior partner at the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche and sits on the boards of six not-for-profit organizations, including the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. At the request of a friend in the city administration (whom he would not name), Mr. Weinstein agreed to serve on the rent board three years ago.
"Given my background, I'm not quite used to what I've had to endure from the people who attend the meetings," Mr. Weinstein said. "It's a question of unruliness, and the feeling that they have the absolute right to just yell out."
"I don't mind if they applaud or boo or hiss, although it's childish," Mr. Weinstein said, "but they disrupt people who are speaking and scream out their unhappy remarks. It just offends me."
Vivid in his recollection is a woman who confronted him at the intermission of a meeting during his first year on the board. "She started screaming at me that I had never heard of Patrick Henry or the Boston Tea Party," Mr. Weinstein said, "meaning I had no right to stifle their right to dissent. I just walked away."
The low moment for Edward S. Hochman came in 1994, the year Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed him to serve as chairman and a public member of the board. That year, the board voted increases of 2 and 4 percent and, after a four-year hiatus, reinstituted what it calls the low-rent supplement -- an extra charge for apartments with rents below a certain level. Tenants call it the "poor tax."
IN 1989, the supplement was $5 for stabilized apartments renting for $325 or less. For the next four years, no supplement was charged. But in 1994 it was restored at $15 for apartments renting for $400 or less (This year, the board has proposed a supplement of $15 for rents up to $500).
"After the final meeting in '94, when it died down," Mr. Hochman said, "I walked to the subway -- the good old City Hall stop for the 4, 5 and 6 trains -- and a couple of people in the crowd followed me and threatened to throw me on the tracks. I remember thinking that's not such a bad idea, an alternative to suicide."
During the final meeting in 1996, the one year in the last six in which the increases exceeded 2 and 4 percent, rising to 5 and 7 percent, "I got hit with marbles, gum and tacks," Mr. Hochman, who is a corporate lawyer, said.
That '96 meeting was probably the stormiest in the board's 31-year history. Kenneth Rosenfeld, director of legal services for the Northern Manhattan Improvement Corporation, a tenant rights group, was then one of the two tenant representatives on the rent board. He left the board last year.
Fully the tenant advocate, Mr. Rosenfeld recalled: "In that year, there was a temporary increase in fuel costs. And, despite the staff statistics in what is called the Core Price Index, the board ignored its own data and passed what, under those circumstances, were startling and onerous guidelines" -- the 5 and 7 percent increases.
"The place was full of people screaming," Mr. Rosenfeld said. "Landlords were yelling, too. We voted on the apartments and the crowd went nuts. In order to continue the meeting, because there were other votes to be taken, we ended up sitting in a circle on the stage at 1 Police Plaza, trying to conduct the rest of the business."
IF the 5 and 7 percent increases of 1996 were outrageous, in Mr. Rosenfeld's tenant-protective eyes, the 2 and 4 percent guidelines of 1994, '95, '97, '98 and '99 were less egregious only to a degree.
"Two and 4 percent may sound reasonable," he said, "but, if you recall, in almost all those years inflation was significantly lower than in the past, and, in the most recent years, almost nonexistent."
Mr. Pagan, one of the two current tenant representatives, agreed. "We're talking about zero and maybe 1 percent inflation, and the fact is that they went to 2 and 4," he said.
"This year," Mr. Pagan continued, "oil is the factor that has skewed landlord costs more than anything else, and everybody understands that oil is one of those commodities for which the price will come down at some time."
Pointing to the issue of whether the board should allow a one-time spike in a particular economic factor to govern the guidelines, Mr. Pagan said: "What happens is that we are building in a higher percentage rent increase, and when the oil price comes down and inflation comes down to a normal level, because the oil was pushing it, we will not get a reduction on rent."
"So we're just putting costs on top of costs," he said.
Referring to an annual study produced by the board's staff called the Price Index of Operating Costs -- or "the PIOC," in board terminology -- Mr. Weinstein said Mr. Pagan was contending "that if we take a look at the PIOC in relation to the increases voted upon by the board, in general the board lags behind in those years when the PIOC shows abnormal inflation, and the board leads the PIOC in years of moderate or low inflation."
"So he's saying that the board tends to act as a moderating force when it comes to prices," Mr. Weinstein continued.
"But I look at a year within itself, as well as within a framework of history, and try to achieve a balance," Mr. Weinstein said. "So his interpretation is that of the tenant representatives, and I don't agree with it. I think what we did was appropriate, based upon the statistics that we saw."
"Whatever we do, this board is not going to be popular," he said. "Either the tenants or the landlords are not going to be happy, and probably both."
The statistics, compiled by the board's full-time staff of six, provide only guidance to the members in their deliberations, rather than setting a hard-and-fast conclusion.
Rent stabilization was instituted in 1969 to counter the effects of Rockefeller-era vacancy decontrol laws that allowed a landlord to go to free-market rents when a rent-controlled apartment became vacant. There were widespread instances of landlords forcing out long-time tenants.
Under stabilization, the owner of a vacated rent-controlled apartment could set an initial free-market rent, after which the rent would be subject to the increases allowed by the board. There are currently about 70,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city, down from more than 1 million at the time stabilization was enacted.
The rent board's staff prepares at least five reports each year assessing the affordability and profitability of stabilized housing. Probably the most significant are the Price Index of Operating Costs and the Income and Affordability Study.
Like the federal Consumer Price Index, the PIOC surveys a basket of goods -- among them taxes, labor, fuel and contractor costs -- that estimate the cost of running a rent-stabilized apartment. It then offers a projection of the coming year's expenses for the landlord.
The Income and Affordability Study focuses on tenants, surveying such factors as their salaries, Social Security, public benefits, rent-to-income ratios, eviction rates and homelessness. It provides a balance to the data on landlord costs.
Mr. Rosenfeld, who in his years on the board frequently clashed with Mr. Hochman, the chairman, believes the board's political balance has changed in recent years. "Having been appointed by Mayor Dinkins in '93, the last year of his term, I spent most of my time on the board under the Giuliani administration," he said. "I saw an extreme shift in the attitudes of both the city administration and the Giuliani appointees -- from balancing out the inequities in the rent-regulated universe toward satisfying the landlord and real estate lobbies." Of the nine current members, seven -- including the chairman and three other public representatives -- were appointed by Mayor Giuliani. Members serve two-, three- or four-year terms, except for the chairman, who serves at the pleasure of the mayor.
Bart D. Carmody, one of the new public members, sees no shift in the board's attitude. "Simply put, when the vote was 2 and 4 percent, the tenants were making statements about the public members being pro-landlord," said Mr. Carmody, who is a certified public accountant. "This year, when the rates, in my view, could have been higher, the landlord advocates are crying that we are pro-tenant. So, my point is: one year yes, one year no."
Mr. Castellano, the landlord representative appointed by Mayor Giuliani, thinks "it's funny how some of the tenant advocates portray the behind-the-scenes politics."
"When I hear from them that the mayor has such control over the board," he continued, "the fact is that virtually everybody on the board is doing the mayor a favor by being there, and if he had to replace them it would be difficult, at best. There is not a long line of people who want to take this kind of abuse."
THERE is no cohesive bloc of public members, Mr. Castellano said. "My role and the role of any of the advocate members is to persuade at least two public members to agree with us and, hopefully, get the chair's vote," he said. "That makes a bare majority."
Mr. Hochman, the chairman, asked rhetorically: "Does the administration have an interest in what the Rent Guidelines Board does? I not only presume so, I would hope so. Do I, as the only member of the board who, by law, can be fired at any time, the one designated as the administration's representative, talk to the administration?
"When all the reports come in, I tell the administration that this was the board's factual findings and this is the general range where I anticipate that the preliminary guidelines may be," Mr. Hochman continued. "I have never talked to the mayor on this. Usually I send my report to a deputy mayor. I'll say, 'This is a general range; do you guys have a problem with that?' The answer has always been no."
Mr. Carmody said, "I would think the mayor has to look more to the voters than any industry" -- a point not entirely lost on Mr. Rosenfeld.
"In appointing the board and approving, to the extent that a mayor does, the final result," Mr. Rosenfeld said, "a mayor is balancing out how much influence the real estate lobby has and the dollars it provides to political campaigns with the potential votes of 1 million regulated apartments."
Mr. Hochman pointed out that those 1 million apartments house, perhaps, 2 million voters. "I've always said that if either side ever thanks us, we've probably done a poor job," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 9, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 11 about the New York City Rent Guidelines Board misstated the background to the state legislature's 1969 passage of the Rent Stabilization Law. The law was enacted in response to sharp increases in rents of apartments not subject to the Rent Control regulations, which covered buildings built before 1947. The law was not a response to harassment by landlords seeking to vacate rent-controlled apartments.

 THE WHITE SHARKS
 OF WALL STREET
 Thomas Mellon Evans and
 the Original Corporate Raiders.
 By Diana B. Henriques.
 Illustrated. 368 pp. New York:
 A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $27.50. 
 There are surely few phenomena more remarkable in American business than the periodic ability of cash-poor but swashbuckling newcomers, using little or none of their own money, to seize control of some of the country's most valuable corporations. In its most recent, frenzied incarnation, dot-com entrepreneurs have exchanged stock in companies with few tangible assets and even fewer profits for control of established, profitable companies. Fifteen years ago, the currency was junk bonds rather than inflated stock. And before that, it was bank loans using a target's assets as collateral.
Wall Street greets each wave of takeovers as the dawning of a new era. But the proposition that nothing has fundamentally changed is convincingly set forth in "The White Sharks of Wall Street," an engaging and thorough history of early corporate takeovers by Diana B. Henriques, a financial reporter for The New York Times. Her central character is Thomas Mellon Evans, who surfaces in what seems like nearly every trendsetting corporate battle from 1945 until his retirement in 1984, and whose tactics remain essential to practitioners of corporate warfare. Junk bonds? Greenmail? Scorched earth? Evans had been there long before investment bankers coined a catchy vocabulary to describe the maneuvers of people like T. Boone Pickens, Carl Icahn and Saul Steinberg.
Though Evans seems to have escaped the widespread public resentment and envy the others generated, and Henriques's portrait is carefully nonjudgmental, it is difficult for a reader to work up much sympathy for him. He was ruthless, bad-tempered, usually indifferent to workers and communities. He repeatedly displayed what appears to be a criminal disregard for the antitrust laws (though he was never prosecuted). He divorced two wives (the second later committed suicide), and both times a replacement was conspicuously at hand long before any legal proceedings had begun. He betrayed two of his own sons in his quest for corporate dominance and wealth.
Orphaned at the age of 11 in Pittsburgh, later taken under the wing of his prominent but distant relatives the Mellons, Evans was poor but grew up in a milieu of inherited wealth and privilege to which he evidently aspired. In later life he mingled prominently in old-line society, and took up art collecting and horse breeding. True to his class and era, Evans was frustratingly taciturn throughout his life, betraying little emotion. It is hard to tell whether any of his achievements, wives or riches brought him much satisfaction.
Yet as a deal maker Evans displayed a natural audacity and genius. In 1935, 24 years old and lacking any money to speak of, he decided he wanted to gain control of Pittsburgh's struggling H. K. Porter Company, a manufacturer of steam locomotives. Inspired by a Fortune magazine account of Floyd Odlum, who became rich by using borrowed securities as collateral for loans to buy undervalued stock, Evans borrowed shares from a Mellon mentor, took out a loan and invested in Gulf Oil stock, then a Mellon enterprise. When Gulf's stock rose handsomely as the nation emerged from the Depression, Evans used his profits to buy Porter bonds, then selling for a small fraction of their face value. When Porter finally had to declare bankruptcy and was reorganized, Evans, as the largest creditor, traded his bonds for equity and became the largest shareholder. Porter, essentially acquired for junk bonds, would be Evans's vehicle for most of his life.
Like many who followed in his footsteps, Evans was not much of an operations man. He shrewdly hired experienced managers while he pursued his real interests, which were balance sheets and deals. He turned his attentions to the Mount Vernon Car Manufacturing Company, a rail car manufacturer that was the economic mainstay of tiny Mount Vernon, Ill. The company was on the block for $2.7 million, even though it had over $3 million in cash. Such was the nation's aversion to debt and its paucity of capital in 1944 that no one but Evans seemed attracted to such an obvious bargain. Nor would any commercial bank lend Evans the $2.7 million until he hit on the idea of selling Mount Vernon's rail car division and using the expected proceeds as collateral for the loan -- in other words, using as collateral something he did not yet own. Pittsburgh bankers balked at the unorthodox proposal. But Evans found financing in New York and completed the purchase. In 1946, showing scant interest in the town of Mount Vernon or the company's employees, he sold off the company's core assets. Mount Vernon proved to be another model that was widely copied: buy an undervalued, underperforming company using its own assets as collateral for borrowed money; ruthlessly slash operating costs and improve profitability; then break it up and sell the pieces at a profit -- the forerunner of the leveraged buyout perfected by Henry Kravis.
Though he was a wealthy man by the mid-1950's, Evans never lost his zeal for corporate battles, even as other players came on the stage (several of whose stories are told here in less satisfying detail), the stakes rose and the tactics became tougher. Henriques painstakingly recounts Evans's numerous forays: his discovery that even unsuccessful attacks can yield handsome profits; that price fixing boosts profit even if it is eventually detected; and, in a flurry of mid-70's takeover fights, that Establishment credentials are a poor defense to a well-mounted hostile bid. Throughout, Evans displayed the cool, even heartless detachment that brought opprobrium to more recent corporate raiders.
In the book's most dramatic narrative, Henriques recounts Evans's willingness to betray his son Sheldon, who was both a board member and executive vice president of the venerable Crane Company, the Chicago plumbing-fixture manufacturer Evans had conquered in a hostile 1960 maneuver. Without informing his son, Evans secretly negotiated in 1984 to sell the company at a price that seemed unfair to shareholders -- a deal that would have cost Sheldon his job. He rallied Crane's independent directors, who canceled the sale and accepted Thomas Evans's abrupt resignation -- a matter father and son never spoke of again.
Still, surely Evans would have admired his son's fortitude, and at Evans's funeral 13 years later, it was Sheldon who delivered the eulogy. "It is not always easy to be the son of a great man," he said. "And he was a great man. His business career was legendary, innovative and ahead of its time. . . . He loved the 'hurly-burly' of the marketplace."

HEADLINE: Job Training, Child Care Under One Roof

BYLINE: By EMILY BAZELON 

 BODY:
TO move from welfare to work, Tyree Dickey took a job at Southern New England Telephone and then one at St. Raphael's Hospital in New Haven, but left them both because she didn't have reliable day care for her 2-year-old son.
Then with her time on welfare running out, she found a way to get job training and look after her child at the same time. "Coming here was like 'Yes!' " Ms. Dickey said. "I was desperate." 
 Ms. Dickey, 28, is a member of the first class of All Our Kin, a small pilot program that instructs women about early childhood development while they take care of their own children. This month, the program expects to graduate four women, all of them once unemployed. Each will have spent nine months earning a Child Development Associate credential, a prerequisite to a job at a day care center or a pre-school program like Head Start.
By attending to the needs of parents and children, All Our Kin makes a connection missed by most welfare-to-work efforts, experts said.
"The state has been very industrious about getting mothers to work, but not about taking care of the children," said Edward Zigler, a psychology professor at Yale University and one of the founders of Head Start. "It's obvious that to have successful welfare reform, you have to have child care reform. All Our Kin, while small in numbers, is a very good model."
State officials also said the All Our Kin approach has potential, though they cautioned against assuming that child care training is the answer for larger-scale welfare-to-work programs.
"This kind of training is worthwhile for some people, but it's not a panacea for everyone on welfare," said Nancy Wiggett, director of Welfare to Work at the Connecticut Department of Labor. "Not everyone should be a child care worker. I think we need to be careful of that. But for some people, who have that natural talent or ability, this program is a first step in that career. Compared to just sending people to work as waitresses, it offers an opportunity to get a credential and for growth."
 To address the need for child care where it's sharpest, the founder of All Our Kin, Jessica Sager, located the program in an apartment at the Brookside housing project, home to about 200 families in New Haven's West Rock neighborhood. Boarded-up apartments line the streets. For years, the city's housing authority has been vacating the project because of its isolated location.
There is only one convenience store and one bus line within walking distance. And Brookside has no organized child care.
That means Brookside is like a lot of poor neighborhoods in the city. According to a recent study by researchers at Yale and the University of California at Berkeley, New Haven neighborhoods where welfare families live have less than half as many day care programs as comparable neighborhoods in California and Florida cities, for example.
New Haven's scarcity of local child care programs has been felt acutely since the 1996 advent of welfare reform, when the state's new work requirements and 21-month time limit for state benefits began pushing more mothers into the work force. The Yale-Berkeley study found that about three-fourths of welfare mothers in Connecticut leave their children with relatives rather than at day care centers or pre-schools, compared with about half in California and one-fourth in Florida.
Relatives can be lifesavers, but they often provide poor care. Children cared for by relatives watch television more and read less than children who go to day care, the researchers found. Connecticut does not regulate family settings, though it pays up to $315 a month for them. "There is no quality control," said Professor Zigler. "This is a huge disservice. We're spending tax dollars to buy negligent child care."
All Our Kin, on the other hand, has state approval to provide both child care and job training. And the program teaches the mothers how children learn. "We are not baby sitters. We are professionals," said Janna Wagner, the programs' early childhood development teacher.
The women in All Our Kin spend half the day taking classes and the other half putting theory into practice while tending the six children in the program, ages 11 months to four years. On a recent morning, Ms. Dickey and Maryann Williams, 24, monitored the play of four children (two others were out sick for the day) at All Our Kin's home base. In a room freshly painted yellow and decorated with children's drawings and collages, the children moved from reciting parts of books they had memorized to playing with a child-sized kitchen set. When two kids threatened to tangle over a toy, Ms. Williams deftly separated them.
"I was raised that you spank a child if you want them to know something is wrong, or you make them sit down," Ms. Dickey explained. "But 1- and 2-year-olds won't sit -- they don't understand! There are a lot of underage mothers in my family. What I'm learning, I can pass on to them."
Ms. Sager sketched a small-scale model of the program in a law school paper. She named the project after a book by the sociologist Carol Stack about the importance of family networks for poor urban African-Americans. To put the idea into practice, she needed a partner who was expert in working with young children and in poor communities. Ms. Wagner had taught third grade in the South Bronx and then earned a master's in education at Harvard. She was also a New Haven native eager to return.
Together, the pair looked for applicants who had the staying power to complete nine months of full-day training and the potential to be community leaders. "We're looking for women on public assistance who have been having children from an early age," Ms. Sager said. "They are the backbone of their families, and they've failed to enter the work force because the jobs they could get conflicted too much with their responsibilities."
To select the first group, they posted flyers and attended tenant meetings at Brookside and two neighboring projects, and recruited parents at the local elementary school. They asked for written applications, conducted interviews, and observed applicants playing with their children. The written samples measured literacy skills. At the interviews, Ms. Wagner tried to scare off the faint-hearted by stressing the program's workload and schedule. Eight women out of 25 original applicants completed the process. Six were selected for All Our Kin. One dropped out a few weeks into the program, another near the end, leaving the current four.
There has been some tension with other Brookside tenants who have wondered why so many resources have been devoted to only a handful of children. "Everybody is ready to bring their kids here," said Maria Coardes, 31. "People knock on the door, and it's hard to say no." In response, All Our Kin started a twice-a-week after-school program open to all Brookside children.
When their training is complete, the All Our Kin graduates will face a low-paying job market. Child care workers make starting wages of $6 or $7 an hour.
Ms. Sager said that rising demand for child care may mean the All Our Kin graduates will be able to get benefits like health insurance and access to more education. Eventually, she hopes that the program's graduates will go on to college (the All Our Kin credential counts for some credits), open their own day care programs, or work their way up to direct a larger center.
All Our Kin also plans to open another site for six trainees and six children in Quinnipiac Terrace, another New Haven housing project. The program's annual budget will increase from $87,000 this year to about $200,000 to staff the second site, most of it coming from private grants. Costs are relatively low because the New Haven Housing Authority gave All Our Kin its Brookside apartment rent-free and the state has allowed the women to continue receiving welfare benefits while they train. Most of the program's books, toys, and furniture have been donated.
As graduation approaches, the women are lining up work for next year. Ms. Coardes and Ms. Williams are choosing between job offers from area day care centers. Ms. Dickey has been hired to help staff All Our Kin's expansion. Ms. Young plans to open a home-based child care program in Brookside and has nearly completed the state's licensing process.
"I get phone calls every day from people asking me when I'm opening up," Ms. Young said. "If I had a place, I could fill it 24 hours a day."

To the Editor:
Re "Higher Degrees of Occupation" (Workplace section, June 7):
While the recent rise in job openings in the humanities is heartening, it is premature to describe college teaching as "a hot career in a hot job market." A 1999 study shows that only half those seeking tenured positions in English had actually achieved them after 10 years. 
 Any country with 50 percent underemployment would declare a national crisis.
To remedy this chronic underemployment, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation is helping create positions for humanities Ph.D.'s. As a result, new doctoral graduates are finding challenging opportunities inside and outside academia.
A robust academic market for Ph.D.'s in the humanities requires a robust market for these professionals throughout the economy.

HEADLINE: REVISIONS;
Let Artistic Gray Areas Be, as Long as Truth Is Out

BYLINE: By Margo Jefferson

 BODY:
Given how many things -- politics, economics, cultural moods and movements -- we preface with amorphous terms like "post," "trans," "global" and "multi," we're clearly in a state of high anxiety about how to define them. Definitions mean boundaries, and all of these terms make clear that the boundaries we once knew are disappearing. At most we have borders now, meant to be crossed, redrawn or erased.
Look at the furor over the Tony-winning show "Contact." It was nominated as a musical. It is all dance and music built around three revuelike sketches, one in pantomime. But the American Federation of Musicians protested the use of tape instead of live music. So did others, Tony voters among them. 
 A musical must have an original score, people I spoke to said. (The dances in "Contact" use an antic mix of music: classical, jazz and rock; Tchaikovsky, Bizet, Stephane Grapelli, Benny Goodman, "Do You Wanna Dance?," "Runaround Sue" and more.) What kind of encouragement does this give to lazy, cynical producers who don't want to risk money on more expensive productions with new music that the public must learn to love?
It's true that the musical can't thrive without new composers. But consider the cultural crimes that have been committed in their name? No sooner did Andrew Lloyd Webber loosen his hold on Broadway than Frank Wildhorn and Elton John arrived.
The best new composers and lyricists are getting their start in small houses off Broadway's beaten, musically abused track. "Contact" imitators aren't likely to be anywhere near as smart or talented as its choreographer and director, Susan Stroman, or its book writer, John Weidman. But that's always the case with imitators, whatever they're copying.
The musical has been in such bad shape for so long that I'm game for all experiments. Call "Contact" a dance play or a musical performance piece; invent a new category for shows that put music, movement and language together in unpredictable ways.
However it's done, let a show like "Contact" stir people to keep inventing musicals instead of copying them. Its form was unusual, but its impulse was primal. It showed us that musicals don't exist except to convince us that the people onstage always feel a song coming on, and therefore, in the succinct words of Gene Kelly, "Gotta dance, gotta dance, gotta dance."
Literature, too, is in something of a tizzy over definitions, appropriations, genres and such. Fiction and nonfiction use each other's techniques. History and fantasy combine forces; memory is both lying and truth telling. And nowhere is all of this clearer than in the historical novel. Look at the furor that broke out a few weeks ago over Susan Sontag's historical novel "In America" (Farrar Straus Giroux). It was based on the life of the great Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who emigrated to the United States in 1876 and lived a glamorous and dazzling life. Ms. Sontag has been accused of taking passages from the works of historians, journalists and Modjeska herself that are virtually unchanged and unacknowledged beyond a briefly expressed debt to "material and anecdotes used and altered."
And naturally other writers of historical fiction, as well as historians, began debating the conjunction between what you invent and what you borrow, and what you need to tell the reader about this process. Some go no further than acknowledging the libraries where they did their research. Others supply short bibliographies. I suspect it's often a struggle: what novelist doesn't want to get as much credit as possible for creativity and inventiveness?
Ms. Sontag's solution, as reported in The New York Times on May 27, was to dismiss the historians and journalists in question, along with Modjeska, as being merely information sources, not writers. She said that while they supplied the raw matter, she produced a work of art. But what interested me most in the end was the question of how history -- fact if you will -- shapes characterization.
Expressing her surprise that Modjeska scholars were not thrilled, Ms. Sontag concluded: "She was a great figure. I made her into a marvelous person. The real Modjeska was a horrible racist."
Well, I thought, the race card does pop up in unexpected places. Ms. Sontag certainly tries to make her heroine marvelous by propping her up with period dialogue, letters, journals and aphoristic musings. But I would much rather read about a woman of great talent and charisma -- a marvelous creature indeed -- who was also a woman with monstrous beliefs. I want to feel and understand all of this. I don't want things to be prettified and simplified in the name of literary uplift.
While I was thinking about all this, a 12-year-old friend with excellent taste recommended a historical novel that she loved, Ann Rinaldi's "Hang a Thousand Trees With Ribbons"(Gulliver Books/Harcourt Brace). It was about yet another immigrant artist (an immigrant by force, not choice), the 18th-century slave and poet Phillis Wheatley. And it presented a good test; I am not alone in having always found poor Phillis an aesthetic trial and psychological embarrassment, despite her interest historically.
She was taught to read and write by her relatively enlightened Boston owners, petted and coddled as she began to write poems, then examined on her Greek, Latin and verse by a group of Massachusetts men who included the governor and John Hancock. It was then certified that she had indeed written the poems in question.
One heard from childhood about her precociousness, her piety and her well-behaved poems. What could one feel besides pity or contempt for lines like these, in "On being brought from AFRICA to AMERICA"?
Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Ms. Rinaldi doesn't quote these lines in her novel. She quotes very few of Wheatley's proper, Alexander Pope-inspired, acutely melancholy poems. She gives us the Phillis Wheatley who had to learn how to be pious and conventional -- the price of a young slave girl's education -- and who sometimes fought, sometimes embraced her role as the symbol of how a debased race might prove itself worthy of civilization. She shows us how the writing, which always had to meet the approval of her owners and their friends and doubting publishers, was as much genteel bondage as intellectual or spiritual freedom.
She gives us a spunky, high-strung Phillis Wheatley, but also a Phillis who is crushingly dependent on the kindness of strangers who become first her owners, then her family. She needs to believe in some form of salvation, and she needs to display spiritual obedience. Thanks to Ms. Rinaldi, I now understand what it took for her to write the next lines of that poem, the only racial defense that Puritan Boston and Christian Britain would understand.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negros black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.
Do I like these lines any better than I did before? No. But now I understand the circumstances and the needs that make her admirable, infuriating and, almost unbearably, sad.
Give us the infuriating, the shameful and the horrible. The purely noble and marvelous are much too simple.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
The technology sector's financial downdraft has done little to ease the shortage of qualified employees in Silicon Valley.

BYLINE: By Laurie Flynn

 BODY:
DESPITE the recent sell-off in technology stocks and the steady drumbeat of failing dot-coms, the search for the best high-technology employees continues. And recruiting them still takes extreme measures -- not the least of which is learning the names of potential recruits.
One ploy currently in vogue -- with many variations on the theme -- has a headhunter call a company, posing as a prospective date who has lost the name and phone number of the nice guy she met at the gym the night before. "He said he was director of engineering," the headhunter confides to the company receptionist, who can't help but oblige by producing a name and extension. In another ruse, a recruiter phones a company's front desk and pretends to be the manager of the new restaurant that just opened up down the street: "We'd like to send everybody in marketing a gift certificate for a free lunch. Now if I could just get their names." 
 And so goes the race to hire away the best minds of the information technology industry. Even as some dot-com companies hand out pink slips, true high-technology jobs remain a employee's market, with far more jobs than job candidates. Microsoft, which has not let its antitrust travails slow its talent search, currently has 3,000 unfilled positions. Cisco Systems hires 3,000 people every quarter -- if it can find them.
"From the point of view of companies trying to hire, this has been the worst few years in the history of the planet," said John Holman, a San Francisco recruiter. The hardest workers to find are technical ones -- software designers, test engineers, programmers. And start-ups are also plagued by a shortage of managers.
While demand for workers shows no sign of abating, what has changed recently is what it takes to lure away a new senior-level employee: cash. Stock options, particularly in companies not yet public, have considerably less allure than they did just a few months ago, according to the recruiters helping to craft compensation packages.
Earlier this year, executives changing jobs might have agreed to pay cuts as long as they received plenty of stock options. Now, though, companies are finding they must pay more in salary and options as well as bonuses and other perks.
Pay for a marketing vice president now runs between $170,000 and $250,000 plus stock options and, often, a bonus. That compares with top salaries of about $150,000 six months ago. And potential employees are scrutinizing companies' financing and management more closely.
"People would rather go to more established companies," said Valerie Frederickson, president of a high-technology recruiting company in Menlo Park, Calif., that bears her name, so they need not worry about when or if a promised initial public stock offering actually happens. "Employees are getting angry that their companies are delaying their I.P.O.'s."
Ms. Frederickson did note that layoffs at smaller Internet companies had helped create a noticeable increase in job candidates in May.
David Pritchard, Microsoft's head of recruiting, said there was no end in sight to the shortage of workers, though he added that competition from Internet start-ups for new recruits had diminished. "Given what's been happening in the stock market lately, people are looking a little less at the big payoff that the dot-coms are offering," he said. "When candidates have a competing offer, we tell them to go do some research."
Mr. Holman, the recruiter, said he, too, had noticed greater caution on the part of job candidates.
"Nine months ago, you could say to someone at Hewlett-Packard, 'Sure, we're going to pay you less, but your stock may soon be worth $50 million,' " Mr. Holman said. "Now, that same stock looks like it will be worth only $10 million. It's a change in the risk-reward trade-off."
Consider Thomas Blanco, who just last month took a job at a publicly traded Internet music company in San Francisco after a year in a telecommunications company and 20 years in banking before that. (He spoke on condition that his current employer not be identified.)
A human resources director, Mr. Blanco had considered a competing offer from an Internet start-up that planned to go public soon but decided the risk was not worth it. Had he been making the move a few months earlier, before the Nasdaq's dive in April, he said his decision might have been different. "I knew that the number of I.P.O.'s from here on would be smaller," Mr. Blanco said.
To lure new hires, companies continue to add perks, including catered dinners. In a recent survey by Deloitte & Touche of chief executives at high-technology companies, a quarter said they offered their employees free meals at work. Six percent said they allowed employees to bring pets to work. Other flourishes included in-house gyms, dry cleaning and even flu shots.
But few things beat more money. Back in February, Microsoft's management in Redmond, Wash., raised salaries in the company's Silicon Valley operations 15 percent across-the-board. That move came after Microsoft concluded that it would otherwise be unable to compete in the Northern California job market, where housing costs and living expenses were far higher than in Washington.
And in April, Microsoft's president, Steven A. Ballmer, announced a new companywide stock option program. The hope was to bolster the confidence of current employees and attract new ones in light of both the lower stock price and the vagaries of the government's intention to split the company.
But Nasdaq uncertainty is not scaring everyone away from start-ups. Michael Marrow, an executive with more than 10 years experience in providing outsourced customer service, recently signed on as chief operating officer of a new company called ShipServ, which plans to develop an e-commerce marketplace for the deep-sea shipping industry. He turned down more lucrative offers in order to "create something that has not been created before," he said, despite the fact that other dot-coms were facing layoffs and delayed stock offerings.
"I'm not a 25-year-old programmer," Mr. Marrow said. "I know there are not guarantees, that the payoff may be further down the road."
For many, joining a start-up is still considered boot camp for managing larger companies. In fact, Ms. Frederickson said some of her clients in large, established corporations would consider only candidates with some experience at companies before they went public. "You have to get your ticket punched at a pre-I.P.O. company or you don't get any respect," she said.
The difference now, she says, is job candidates may want more cash along with the respect.

HEADLINE: New Economy, Old-School Rigor;
G.E.'s Management Methods Are Put to Work on the Web

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
It seems intuitively obvious: anyone who is buying a new refrigerator or washer wants it delivered as soon as possible. So, an appliance manufacturer setting up a Web-based order-and-delivery system would put next-day delivery high on the list of lures, right?
Right -- if the Web designer was trusting to intuition. But one thing that the folks at General Electric have had drummed into them the last four years -- or, ever since the company embraced the quality-control regimen known as Six Sigma -- is that they act on gut instinct at their peril. 
 No matter that the Six Sigma sensibility evolved out of old economy rules; it is informing every aspect of G.E.'s push into new economy mode.
Consider what happened when GE Appliances decided last year to set up a Web-based system to arrange delivery of G.E. products to people who bought them at Home Depot. GE Appliances used focus groups, what-if scenarios and other Six Sigma methodologies to discern how much value customers placed on having new appliances show up in 24 hours.
Shock one: The answer was, not much value at all. "Six Sigma eliminated any perceived need for evening deliveries, next-day deliveries, Sunday deliveries, all sorts of costly things that we had wrongly thought would be important to customers," said Michael P. Delain, GE Appliances' quality manager for local delivery service.
Shock two: If the delivery people had a professional, soothing demeanor, customers would tolerate just about anything, even late deliveries or damaged products.
"Sure, customers cared that we accommodated their choice of a delivery date, and that we showed up in the window that we promised," said Steve LeClair, program manager for e-business at GE Appliances. "But Six Sigma studies showed that they cared most about the softer, less measurable skills."
The resulting system, which is operating in about 600 of Home Depot's 980 stores, lets sales representatives enter a customer's order onto the Web, and arrange for delivery to the customer's home directly from a G.E. warehouse. GE Appliances, meanwhile, now trains installers and delivery personnel on people skills.
Six Sigma, of course, is the quality program that big companies including Motorola, Honeywell and G.E. have credited with squeezing billions of dollars in costs out of products and processes, without losing quality or service. It is a statistical method of breaking a customer's requirements into tasks or steps, and setting the optimum specification for each part of the process, based on how the parts interact.
It means taking nothing for granted, checking out even those things that seem intuitively obvious, and running countless what-if scenarios to see what kind of cascade effect changing even seemingly innocuous variables can have on the result. When GE Medical Systems designed its Lightspeed diagnostic scanner, for example, Six Sigma studies showed that widening a few tungsten wires could increase the machine's accuracy -- something that the design team had thought would require a costly tube redesign.
And Six Sigma means having all G.E. departments, from accounting to production to customer service, analyze the impact that their ways of interacting with each other could have on a customer's total experience with G.E.
Since 1996, at the dictum of G.E.'s chairman, John F. Welch Jr., Six Sigma has been a way of life at G.E. The company has applied it to pretty much every aspect of its business -- designing products, interacting with customers, fine-tuning delivery.
So early last year, when Mr. Welch said he expected every G.E. business to have an e-commerce strategy up and running by the spring of 1999, it took just nanoseconds for most to realize that Six Sigma was a natural for guiding G.E. onto the Web, particularly if they thought of a Web page as a product and of e-business as a process. All the G.E. businesses met Mr. Welch's deadline.
"Six Sigma processes let us demystify the whole concept of e-business," said Piet C. van Abeelen, G.E.'s vice president for Six Sigma Quality. "They let us get organized without handing off pieces of the process among 55 people."
Industry experts say that G.E. is way ahead of other old economy companies in embracing the Web. Indeed, it is turning its Web savvy into a business itself. Just last week, G.E. announced a joint venture with Cisco Systems that would help manufacturers use Internet technology to tie their factory data systems in with their office systems. G.E. also introduced a host of new Web-related services for small businesses.
"They've figured out how to transfer their brand identity to the Internet," said Geri Spieler, an e-business analyst with the Gartner consulting firm. "They grab people with depth and breadth of services, and keep them with multiple opportunities to click for more."
Indeed, GE Lighting, GE Appliances and others have Web-based programs that let architects and builders design lighting systems and kitchens from a list of specifications. Most G.E. businesses have self-help sites that give users step-by-step guidance for fixing or maintaining products. And all of them give browsers a chance to buy things.
"Each of their businesses is transactional on the Web, and no other old-line company can say that," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "Six Sigma was a real turbocharger for them."
Examples abound. Through Six Sigma analyses, many G.E. businesses concluded that customers, given a modicum of extra information, would willingly handle a lot of repair work themselves. Other studies showed that if information about optional features was easy to find, many customers -- businesses as well as consumers -- would configure their own products, without waiting for a sales representative to call.
For G.E., that meant saving a fortune on service personnel and "selling" to customers who are either geographically remote or too small to warrant sales calls.
One problem, the Six Sigma studies showed, was that customers often could not find the model numbers on their appliances or machines. So, several G.E. businesses put "how to find your model number" sections on their Web pages.
And, several G.E. businesses have given their Web sites so-called configurators and wizards -- electronic guides that enable customers to customize their own systems, be it a redone kitchen or a lighting system for a new plant, and even help customers fix them in the future.
Six Sigma analyses also showed that house builders -- prime customers for GE Appliances -- want to give their own customers a way to design their homes at one Web sitting. So, G.E. is designing Web sites for major builders that enable the builder's customers to configure what G.E appliances they want in their homes, but that also help them explore what's available in cabinetry, carpeting and other essential home items that G.E. does not sell itself. One such site, called Selectioncenter.com, is being tested at the U.S. Home Corporation, and GE Appliances hopes it will be fully operational in a few months.
"It's going to be an important site for builders, and for distributors like us," said Joe Dumstorf, president of Trend Technologies, a distributor of building products that helped G.E. design the site.
Almost every G.E. business can point to ways that Six Sigma forged a path to the Web. When G.E.'s CNBC unit first put up a Web site last year, for example, the home page seemed to take an awfully long time to load. Instead of blaming traffic or Internet glitches outside G.E.'s control, analysts used Six Sigma methods to deconstruct the page; they discovered that one of the page's distinctive features, the trailing stock ticker at the bottom, was slowing up the loading time. The site designers gave viewers the option of loading without the ticker, which cut the upload time in half, to four seconds. They have since whittled it down to 2.46 seconds.
And when GE Appliances wanted to lure consumers to check out new products on its Web page, the company performed a Six Sigma analysis to determine what kind of information customers wanted, how many mouse clicks they would be willing to make to get it, and whether they would settle for schematics of appliances that could be loaded quickly rather than full-color digital photos that might take forever to load.
"Intuition told us the bigger and more detailed the picture, the better," recalled Joseph J. Deangelo, vice president for e-business at GE Appliances. "Six Sigma analysis showed that customers preferred speed to detail when they were first comparing models, and were only willing to wait for detailed pictures when they were close to a decision."
Six Sigma has also played a role as G.E.'s consumer businesses have set up Web-based help desks. G.E.'s telephone help centers had been through their own Six Sigma rigor, which had led to a computerized body of knowledge that operators could consult to answer any question. Now questions that come in by e-mail, by direct query on a Web site, or by phone, all receive answers from that same database within 24 hours.
"A tenet of Six Sigma is that you take variability out of results," Mr. Deangelo explained, "and this enabled us to get rid of an entire category of potential defects, which is wrong, incomplete or late answers."
There was another Six Sigma tenet at play with the help sites: running what-if scenarios on how to convert questioners to self-help mode enabled G.E. to fine-tune the information offered through self-help mechanisms on the Web.
For example, owners of G.E.'s new Advantium Oven, which cooks with a combination of light and microwave energy, often write in with questions on how to translate recipes for use with the Advantium. GE Appliances refers such questions to home economists on its staff, e-mails answers to the questioners, and then includes the information on its self-help sites, where anyone hoping to try a similar recipe can find it.
All told, Six Sigma means approaching every problem with the assumption that it has a data-oriented, tangible solution in the end. The process does not yield perfection, but it provides a handle on how much variability from a standard, be it a product specification or a delivery time, customers will tolerate before they perceive it as a defect.
The collaboration between GE Appliances and Home Depot is a case study. Until this year, G.E. shipped a small assortment of appliances to Home Depot, which kept them in inventory until they were sold and then delivered them to customers. Home Depot wanted to offer more items but to stock less inventory.
So GE Appliances and Home Depot worked out a Web-based model whereby Home Depot sales representatives could use a kiosk at the store to enter a customer's order for any G.E. appliance. The kiosk transmits the order to the nearest G.E. warehouse via the Internet, and the item can be shipped from the warehouse to the customer's home.
"This lets us offer quicker delivery of a wider assortment of products, without maintaining big warehouses full of products," said Donald E. Galloway, Home Depot's national product manager for appliances.
The concept was simple, the economics were not. Home Depot wanted to offer the service to every customer; G.E. used Six Sigma analyses to discern how wide a geographic radius around each warehouse it could economically serve.
Both G.E. and Home Depot finally agreed that it made sense to forgo servicing a handful of customers in order to guarantee stellar service to the vast majority. For customers who do not fall within the delivery radius, Home Depot resorts to the old methods -- it places an order with G.E., which ships the appliance to the store, which arranges delivery to the customer's home.
The process of applying Six Sigma continues, as G.E. moves toward being ever more Web-centric. According to Gary Reiner, G.E.'s chief information officer, G.E. has dedicated about 1,000 employees to its e-commerce effort. And 80 percent of those e-business mavens are home grown; most old-economy companies hire their Web expertise from the tech world.
"It was essential that our Web sites reflect out customer's needs, not our organizational structure," Mr. Reiner said. "That kind of customer focus is an underlying principle of Six Sigma."

HEADLINE: U.S. Pursuit of Microsoft: Rare Synergy With Company's Rivals

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, has no doubts about who is responsible for his company's antitrust woes. During a news conference last Wednesday, hours after a federal judge ordered that Microsoft be split in two, Mr. Gates spoke pointedly of the "competitors that have been behind this lawsuit."
What part did Microsoft's rivals play? The competitors, to be sure, played a crucial role throughout the investigation, litigation and sanctions phase of the suit by the Justice Department and 19 states. It was, in fact, a 222-page white paper written in the summer of 1996 by lawyers for Netscape Communications, Microsoft's main rival in the market for Internet browsing software, that caught the attention of Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and prompted him to order an investigation. 
 At the trial, a procession of competitors -- representing Netscape, Sun Microsystems, America Online and others -- testified against Microsoft. And in the months and weeks before the government presented its proposal in April to break up Microsoft, industry executives -- some rivals of Microsoft and some not -- were shown or read individual sentences and paragraphs in drafts of the remedies plan by government lawyers, who then asked if the provisions seemed sensible.
The scale of the antitrust case, including the extent of consultation with industry rivals, was extraordinary, government officials acknowledge. But the methods employed were not: Despite all the information and interpretation given to the government from other companies, industry executives and government lawyers say the Justice Department kept its own counsel as it sifted evidence and built its case.
The government charged, and the court found, that Microsoft is a monopoly that has thwarted competition and innovation. Some of the evidence came from competitors, but much of it came from Microsoft's e-mail and internal documents.
"The industry's role in a case like this is as a resource -- a source of ideas, comments, facts and analysis," said David Boies, the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer. "But the government brought the Microsoft case because the evidence was there. And the most powerful documents were ones created by Microsoft itself."
Yet, to bring and win the Microsoft suit, the government had to build a relationship of cooperation and trust with the industry. When the investigation started in 1996, there was skepticism in Silicon Valley -- home to many of Microsoft's rivals -- about the wisdom of working with the government.
A consent decree with Microsoft that the Justice Department signed in 1994, and that a court approved a year later, had mainly focused on a modest change in Microsoft's licensing practices. In Silicon Valley, the consent decree was regarded as a slap on the wrists that did nothing to loosen Microsoft's control of computing. So, many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the government and risk angering Microsoft.
To meet with the Justice Department, some industry executives insisted on strict conditions to ensure anonymity. Late in 1997, the chief executive of a Silicon Valley company agreed to meet only at a hotel suite in Washington -- not at the Justice Department's offices -- and only with a promise that any notes of the meeting could not mention him or his company, recalled Daniel Rubinfeld, former chief economist in the department's antitrust division.
The chief executive did eventually agree to send a senior member of his management team to testify in the Microsoft trial, which began in October 1998.
Indeed, that kind of visible industry support -- sending witnesses to testify in a high-profile, high-pressure trial -- was needed to present a convincing case in court. And Justice Department officials stressed that point in meetings with industry executives. "They did say repeatedly that if you don't stand up and take this on, neither will we," recalled William J. Raduchel, a former senior executive at Sun Microsystems who is now chief technology officer of America Online.
Yet throughout the case, the government and Microsoft's competitors had a delicate, often wary relationship, according to both prosecutors and industry executives.
And no wonder. The Justice Department's antitrust division receives a steady stream of complaints from companies about their rivals. Much of this proves untrue or exaggerated upon investigation, prosecutors note. And the government's policy is not to inform anyone in advance about whether it will take action.
Several industry executives who cooperated in the prosecution described dealing with the Justice Department as "speaking through a one-way mirror." The government officials asked questions, and they answered. That approach, apparently, remained consistent -- from the initial investigation, right through to consulting on the proposed remedies.
One executive recalled being asked to comment on the government's sanctions plan. "It was, 'Does this sentence make sense to you,' or 'If the following rule were in place, do you think PC makers would choose operating systems other than Microsoft's Windows,' " the executive said. "But you never quite know what they're up to. I had no idea they were going to propose breaking Microsoft in two."
Mr. Raduchel, who spoke with Justice Department officials several times in the last few years, remarked: "I really believe that you can't lobby them. But what you can do is educate them. They gradually came to realize that seemingly arcane details of software really do matter."
The education process did take time. It took the government investigators a while to appreciate the legal significance of a meeting in June 1995 between Microsoft and Netscape executives, for example, even though the Justice Department received a detailed account of the meeting two days after it occurred.
The account came in a letter to the department from Gary L. Reback, a lawyer representing Netscape, who described how Microsoft had used access to its industry-standard Windows operating-system technology to threaten Netscape. He also attached notes of the meeting taken by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, which strongly suggested that Microsoft had made an offer to Netscape to divide the market for Internet browsing software -- an offer that, if proved, was a violation of antitrust law.
That June 1995 episode eventually became an accusation in the government's suit against Microsoft, one that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson accepted as a fact and ruled to be illegal. Yet at the time, word of the meeting did not set off alarm bells in Washington.
"You have to understand that back then, the Internet was just starting to take off," said Roberta Katz, the former general counsel of Netscape, "and people other than techies did not understand the Internet or software. The troops at Justice, understandably, had a lot of learning to do."
And Netscape certainly helped. "My whole approach," Ms. Katz said, "was to get to the point where they really understood what was going on. After that, if the government did anything or not was obviously up to them. And they totally held their cards closely. There was never a time when the Justice Department let us know what they were going to do."
The Netscape white paper in August 1996 helped get things started. Despite its dull title, "White Paper Regarding the Recent Anticompetitive Conduct of the Microsoft Corporation," the paper often reads more like a book than a legal document. Indeed, its 222 pages are formatted and laid out like a book, with attractive typefaces and chapter headlines like "A Fork in the Road" and "Microsoft's Fear: The Threat to Its Desktop Monopoly."
The Netscape white paper was never made public, but it was passed to some industry executives and state attorneys general, in addition to the Justice Department. An industry executive allowed a reporter for The New York Times to read parts of the document. It was written mainly by Mr. Reback and Susan Creighton, then both lawyers at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif., with contributions from Garth Saloner, an economist at the Stanford University business school.
The Netscape document includes a litany of accusations against Microsoft. These were backed up with e-mail messages that Netscape had received, from personal computer makers and others, about Microsoft's actions.
But the one assertion that really interested Mr. Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, was that in June 1996 Microsoft had threatened to cancel Compaq Computer's license to use Windows unless Compaq stopped featuring Netscape's browser over Microsoft's. To Mr. Klein, this seemed to be evidence of Microsoft's selling its Windows operating system to PC makers on the condition that the manufacturers also take the Microsoft browser. To him, the threat violated the 1994 consent decree and raised broader antitrust issues about the company's behavior.
Microsoft has argued that its browsing software should be considered part of Windows -- one product, not two, and thus not an antitrust violation. In June 1998, a federal appeals court agreed with Microsoft in a related case. But after reviewing the evidence, Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft had illegally tied two products.
The government pursued some accusations in the Netscape white paper and set others aside. Over all, though, the legal and economic theory in the Netscape document is remarkably similar to the themes laid out in the government's suit two years later. The core of the case the Justice Department lawyers presented at trial was that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly by engaging in a broad pattern of practices intended to stifle the competition posed by Internet software.
"This is, at bottom, a very simple case," the Netscape white paper stated. "It is about a monopolist (Microsoft) that has maintained its monopoly for more than 10 years. That monopoly is threatened by the introduction of a new technology (Web software) that is a partial substitute -- and, in time -- could become a complete substitute for the monopoly product."
The Netscape white paper also pointed toward a broader public-policy issue surrounding Microsoft. Personal computers were the way people get onto the Internet and thus, the paper asserted, Microsoft's industry-dominant Windows operating system could give the company a gatekeeper's control of the flow of information and electronic commerce in the future.
"There is no reason to believe," the Netscape document warned, "that Microsoft's monopoly power will be confined to a single industry."
That broader message resonated beyond the software industry, and eventually led executives in other industries to raise concerns about Microsoft with the government. Andrew Steinberg, who was then general counsel of Sabre, the computerized airline reservations system, recalled traveling through Silicon Valley early in 1997. Sabre had recently begun a travel Web site, Travelocity, and Microsoft had a competing site, Expedia. Mr. Steinberg was told of the Netscape white paper, and he obtained a copy from Netscape.
Reading the document had a "profound effect" on him, recalled Mr. Steinberg, who is now an executive vice president of Travelocity. "It struck me that this was a serious threat to competition over the Internet and the future prospects of our company."
Other industry executives had similar worries about Microsoft's power and its potential use of that power. Executives from many companies expressed such concerns in meetings with the Justice Department -- including those from Time Warner, Disney, Sabre, General Motors and Palm, according to people who attended or knew of those meetings.
Further white papers were produced. Netscape updated its original document, and then provided still another with a more detailed focus on e-commerce and media over the Internet, "Access Denied: Microsoft's Strategy for Overriding Consumer Choice." The other companies that sent white papers to the government included Apple Computer, Sabre and the makers of speech-recognition software, according to people familiar with those documents.
The suit the government brought against Microsoft was based on accusations about what Microsoft had done, rather than what it might do. But the government has said it took action partly to protect innovation in the future and to keep the Internet open to competition.
"The role of the browser as the gateway to the Internet was significant to bringing this case," said Mr. Boies, who presented the case against Microsoft in court for the Justice Department. "It's what made this case important."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report;
Easier-to-use sites would help e-tailers close more sales.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
IN the spring of 1998, Internet retailers were troubled to learn that, according to Forrester Research, two-thirds of Web shoppers abandoned their "shopping carts" before actually buying something. At the time, and throughout last year, e-commerce companies pledged to improve the shopping experience, giving customers no reason to leave without passing through checkout.
But because investors showed little inclination to penalize e-tailers for basic deficiencies like failing to close the sale, these resolutions were frequently shuffled to the back burner in favor of planning TV ads and making business development deals. 
 And so, consumers are still abandoning their Web shopping carts at the same rate they did in 1998, according to a recent report by Shop.org, an industry trade group. But now, with e-tailers under increasing pressure to start actually making money, Web merchants are suddenly being serious in their efforts to squeeze whatever cash they can from site visitors.
According to a report planned for release today by Creative Good, a consulting firm in New York, e-tailers could generate substantially more revenue by focusing on basic customer needs, like speed and simplicity. The report estimates that e-commerce companies could realize an additional $20 billion in sales this year -- bringing overall Web sales to some $57 million -- by improving site design, navigation and overall ease of use.
Creative Good's chief executive, Phil Terry, acknowledges that prescribing these changes may be much easier than having sites implement them. "We've seen a real resistance to the basics in the industry," he said, "which indicates that this is just the tip of the iceberg."
For instance, Mr. Terry said, many e-commerce sites still fail to track their order conversion rates -- the rate at which visitors become paying customers. Shop.org recently pegged the average conversion rate at 1.8 percent, but Mr. Terry, said e-tailers could easily raise that rate to 2.5 percent.
Ignoring such a core statistic, he said, indicates how little attention many sites are paying to what visitors actually do once they are at the site. The Creative Good report focuses on a number of key categories in which merchants typically fail their customers, including page design, site search and the checkout process. The report criticized marthastewart .com, for instance, for letting customers add out-of-stock items to the shopping cart without informing them until reaching the final checkout that the items are unavailable.
Martha Stewart, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, acknowledged this shortcoming but disputed the notion that changing it would be easy. "We're working on that," Ms. Stewart said, "but the coordination between the catalog and the Internet operations has to be perfect before we can do it."
The company that handles inventory and fulfillment for marthastewart.com, the Time Customer Service unit of Time Warner, has an older computer system, she said, so it takes a while for the site to search Time's database for in-stock items. Because of this, Ms. Stewart and her executives had decided not to slow things down with a real-time inventory check of each item as a shopper selects it.
But Ms. Stewart said the company was searching for a fulfillment partner that would enable the site to display real-time inventory without slowing down the customer. "It's a minute-to-minute task, to keep up with technology and customer demands," she said. "It's a constant thing."
The Web is littered with glaring examples of poorly designed pages and features, of course. The Creative Good report acknowledges as much, pointing out sites that label products poorly (or not at all), sites that try to pack too much information and sites that require customers to fill out a lengthy questionnaire before they can actually browse for goods.
Indeed, if there is a common criticism from those within the industry, it is that e-commerce sites may be interesting to look at or listen to, but they are not easy enough for many customers to use. And that, says H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association, may be because e-tailers are still struggling to shed their high-technology habits.
"It comes down to a reverence for technology," Mr. Wientzen said. "A lot of the people who started these sites are technologists, and in the beginning, at least, the people who used the sites were more savvy about technology." Now that the Web is more closely aligned with mainstream culture, he said, the sites must cater to the capabilities of nontechnical customers.
Meanwhile, technology itself is making it easier for Web sites to be more shopper friendly, according to Ford Cavallari, who heads the e-business practice for Renaissance Strategy, a consulting firm in Boston. Mr. Cavallari said that in the last year, companies that made software that helped Web sites create their pages -- content management software, in industry argot -- had "moved forward a light year from where they were."
"Webmasters were always behind the eight ball," Mr. Cavallari said. "They were throwing content together on the page. But as this software has gotten better, the staff has more time to get more creative and spend time on value-added activities."
The new urgency on the part of retailers to make a profit could be a boon to shoppers. Too often, consumers have been lured to the Web by the promise of convenience, only to find the experience less convenient than shopping at the mall.
Ron Hanners, executive vice president of JCPenney.com, said competitive pressures had forced his site to become more user friendly. He said the company planned to introduce a new version of its site in October -- an overhaul that will have taken a year and the efforts of about 300 people to create.
Through the redesign, he said, the company has focused on its average customers: women, ages 25 to 55, with a household income of $55,000 to $70,000. "It's the sweet spot of middle America," he said.
And a conclusion from the many customer focus groups the company has conducted while testing the redesign, Mr. Hanners said, is that middle America is most interested in "noncluttered" Web sites. The challenge in putting this insight to use is that JCPenney.com has 10,000 product images to display.
Mr. Hanners would not disclose specifics of the site's new design. But he said it would give customers options on how they would like to shop, although not so many options that they would be confused.
"When we started the redesign, I thought it'd be easy," he said. "Then I moved to thinking of it as extremely impossible. Now I'm somewhere in between. People talk about e-commerce being easy. Well, I'm an old retailer, and I don't recall ever working this hard at retail."

HEADLINE: Maverick Chinese Province Fears Opening of Trade

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: ZHONGSHAN, China

 BODY:
Every Monday for seven years, Wang Tai-ching has boarded a ferry in Hong Kong and chugged up the muddy waters of the Pearl River delta. His destination is a factory in Zhongshan, one of the slapdash cities that have sprouted in Guangdong Province over the last decade, crowding out rice paddies and duck ponds with smokestacks and elevated highways.
Mr. Wang, and thousands of Hong Kong entrepreneurs like him, have helped transform Guangdong into the fastest-growing region in China -- a capitalist hothouse on the South China Sea. As China moves closer to its dream of entering the World Trade Organization, however, people here are nervous. 
 Far from relishing the prospect of free trade and wide-open markets, they worry that the new competition could threaten their livelihood. To enter the W.T.O., China will have to throw open its doors to foreign companies. And by reducing tariffs on imports, it will level its commercial playing field -- depriving the frontier capitalists in Guangdong of many of their advantages.
"The beauty of W.T.O. is that it is a signal to foreigners to come in," said Mr. Wang, 55, who bunks in a spartan dormitory with his workers during the week. "But it's different for the people who are already here. I don't know how many will survive and how many will fail."
Mr. Wang's factory makes disposable diapers. His company, Disposable Soft Goods, is one of 15 such manufacturers in China -- a remarkable statistic for a country that regarded throw-away diapers as an unattainable luxury a few years ago. Procter & Gamble began selling Pampers throughout China last October, setting off a ferocious price war.
For Mr. Wang, that is just the beginning of his headaches. As part of its agreement to join the W.T.O., China is committed to reducing duties on imported raw materials like plastic and fabric by 40 percent, and to open up its tightly controlled distribution system. This will greatly benefit global manufacturers like Procter & Gamble, enabling them to cut their prices even further.
"It's going to be very tough for the local companies to survive," said Andy Xie, an economist who specializes in China at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. "The W.T.O. deal means that in industries with large economies of scale, the American companies will dominate."
As one bounces along the pothole-pocked roads here, Zhongshan seems the very picture of a swaggering gold-rush town. Tacky hotels and karaoke bars line the streets, while prostitutes troll for visiting businessmen. But there is something new in the air these days: fear.
"The local people are scared," said Mr. Wang, who employs 130 workers, most of them women. "They're worried about losing their jobs. They're worried about their factories being closed. To them, this is a revolution."
Of course, the threat to Chinese-owned companies is not confined to Guangdong Province. But it resonates powerfully here because of Guangdong's hard-won prosperity. An economic backwater as recently as 1984, this province of 60 million people capitalized on its proximity to Hong Kong and its distance from Beijing to transform itself into a free-market powerhouse.
Initially, companies moved their factories across the border to escape rising labor costs in Hong Kong, a former British colony. The increasingly blurry line between Guangdong and Hong Kong enabled the garment industry to evade strict quotas placed on clothing exported from China.
Later, business people from Taiwan came, attracted by Guangdong's anything-goes atmosphere and the access to Hong Kong's duty-free port. More than 4,000 Taiwanese companies set up footwear, electronics and other factories.
By the early 1990's, Guangdong was producing two-thirds of China's exports. When Deng Xiaoping made a famous visit here in 1992, he held up the province as a model for China. Guangdong, he declared, would become the "fifth tiger of Asia," alongside Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.
But the political winds have shifted, and the country's leaders are now promoting development around Shanghai and in the northern provinces. Guangdong's economic growth slowed to 9.4 percent last year from 10.2 percent in 1998. Although it still grows faster than China as a whole, its share of the country's exports dropped to 41 percent in 1999 and 38 percent in the first quarter of this year.
"The focus of China's economic development is moving north," Mr. Xie said. "Guangdong will remain successful, but it will no longer be central to China's growth."
In some industries, the Chinese government is trying to accelerate this process. Earlier this year, Beijing began requiring garment manufacturers here to pay a deposit equal to 30 percent of the value of their exports. Factory owners complained.
"We think the Chinese government is trying to drive us out of business to move the industry up north," said Laurie Jim, whose Hong Kong garment-trading company works with dozens of factories in Guangdong. "Eventually in southern China, there won't be any garment factories at all."
The outcry from the apparel makers was so loud that the government shelved its policy. But Ms. Jim believes it is only a temporary reprieve. As China seeks to establish normal trading relations with the United States to and enter the World Trade Organization, she contends, China will intensify its efforts to move labor-intensive production from Guangdong to the less-developed northern regions.
Even without state intervention, Guangdong's advantages are slipping away. Today, many apparel companies here make a portion of each piece -- a sleeve or collar -- in Hong Kong, so they can claim it is "Made in Hong Kong," and ship it out under the territory's less-restrictive trade quotas.
By 2005, however, the United States is scheduled to lift quotas on textiles from China. That would erase the advantage of splitting production between Guangdong and Hong Kong. And with labor costs significantly lower in northern China -- not to mention countries like Mauritius and Bangladesh -- it would rob the apparel companies of one of the main reasons to build factories here.
"Guangdong has been very good in taking advantage of loopholes," Mr. Xie said. "But when the rule of law is strengthened, it will be tougher to do that."
Like other coastal provinces, Guangdong has a thriving underground economy in smuggled oil, cigarettes and food products. China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, has made cracking down on smuggling the centerpiece of his anticorruption campaign.
Guangdong also led the way in the creation -- and subsequent downfall -- of investment trusts. These state-run companies borrowed heavily to invest in often-dubious real estate ventures. When Beijing decided to make an example of one of them by throwing it into bankruptcy, it chose Guangdong International Trust and Investment, the flagship venture of the provincial government.
In some ways, Guangdong is suffering the same growing pains as any region that struggles up the economic ladder. With its labor costs the highest in China outside of Shanghai, it is trying to attract more capital-intensive industries, like telecommunications, computers and software. It is also trying to hold on to the higher-end segments of its traditional manufacturing industries.
"What Guangdong needs to do is move up the value chain," said Vincent Chen, the founder of Texwatch.com, a Web site that tracks the garment industry. "They will be known for making high-quality products, like polo shirts."
As China seeks to catch the technology wave, however, Guangdong may find itself handicapped by its dearth of good universities and its less-educated work force. China's Internet industry is centered in Beijing -- home to the top-notch Beijing and Qinghua universities.
For all its weaknesses, experts say that Guangdong is still far more competitive and resilient than other parts of China. They note that the Pearl River delta is dominated by private entrepreneurs -- a stark contrast to the sclerotic state-owned enterprises of northern China.
"None of those grievous problems that you see up north blight the Pearl River delta," said David Dodwell, who has written extensively about the region. "Most of the companies here are leaner, meaner, and better equipped to confront international competition."
Indeed, Wang Tai-ching is not about to wave a white flag. He notes that he, too, will benefit from lower duties on imported raw materials. Lower duties on machinery will allow him to install another assembly line in his factory.
To counter the threat from Procter & Gamble, he wants to build warehouses in the north to deliver diapers in Shanghai and Beijing. Eventually, Mr. Wang predicts, his factory will produce 300 million diapers a year. With 19 million babies born in China every year, he says there are more than enough bottoms to go around.
"I'm very optimistic about W.T.O.," Mr. Wang said gamely. "But the changes haven't happened yet."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Behind-the-Scenes Adviser Joins the Digital Revolution

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HE WORKS out of a cubicle not much bigger than a prison cell, but his ambit is the world.
James B. Steinberg, the White House's deputy national security adviser, is less visible than his boss, Samuel R. Berger, who works in a sunlit corner office a few steps away in the West Wing. 
 Mr. Steinberg seldom appears on television and tends to remain in the background at public appearances of the president.
But his influence has been widely felt through his role as chairman of the committee of deputies of the government's national security agencies. And Mr. Steinberg has often colored press coverage of administration foreign policy by offering burnished versions of events to a few favored reporters. Some dare call it spin.
In Mr. Steinberg's eyes, President Clinton's meetings with foreign leaders are never tense; they are "businesslike." Interagency discussions are never argumentative; they are "lively." One of his standing orders to staff members is that they never put anything particularly sensitive on paper; paper trails lead to subpoenas.
To outsiders, he gives the impression of being a friendly, relaxed sort, but associates know, and occasionally fear, his intensity. His temper has scared away potential colleagues and shortened the tenures of several assistants.
He is so single-minded that when a reporter once phoned his office seeking comment on Bosnia, he called back -- from his honeymoon.
Last Friday was as close to a typical day as there is for someone at the vortex of American foreign policy. At 7 a.m., Mr. Steinberg met with the heads of the State Department, Department of Defense, Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. The subject was a sensitive international law enforcement matter about which Mr. Steinberg would say no more.
At 8 a.m., he briefed the president for a telephone call that Mr. Clinton was to make to Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, a few minutes later. At 8:30 a.m., he attended the senior staff meeting led by Steve Ricchetti, the deputy White House chief of staff, to discuss financing for antidrug efforts in Colombia and the Pentagon budget, among other matters. That was followed by a conference call with officials at the State Department about a British peacekeeping mission to Sierra Leone.
Mr. Steinberg then briefed Mr. Clinton for his meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico in the Oval Office at 12:45 p.m. After that, the Middle East, reparations for Holocaust survivors, the Northern Ireland peace process, Ethiopia-Eritrea, the Congo, preparations for the G-8 summit.
It is a heady life for someone who started in the Clinton administration in 1993 as a deputy assistant secretary of state in the relatively obscure Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But Mr. Steinberg had a mentor in Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher, for whom he had worked in the Carter administration.
Mr. Christopher elevated him to the chief of policy planning, the State Department's internal research center, a position Mr. Steinberg described as "the best foreign policy job anywhere." When the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, left after Mr. Clinton's re-election in 1996, Mr. Berger moved up and Mr. Steinberg moved into Mr. Berger's deputy slot.
BUT Mr. Steinberg, 47, is leaving all that behind. This summer, he will join the Markle Foundation to work on a $100 million project to study the impact of the digital revolution on international relations and economic development. He has known the foundation's director, Zoe Baird, since the Carter administration, in which they served as lawyers, she at the White House, he at the Department of Justice.
Ms. Baird was Mr. Clinton's first choice for attorney general but withdrew from consideration after it was disclosed that she had not paid taxes for a baby sitter.
The Markle project addresses many of the issues that have preoccupied Mr. Steinberg over the past seven years: the march of technology, the globalization of markets, the ubiquity of the Internet, and the social and security concerns they raise.
"How do you create a governance structure for what is basically a private sector function?" he asked. "Government can't do this. But how can private entities bring the benefits of the networked society to developing countries?"
Mr. Steinberg cut his teeth on local politics in Boston, where he grew up. His father was a jeweler; his mother a homemaker. He received his law degree from Yale and worked for Mayor Kevin White of Boston in the 1970's and on the Congressional campaigns of the Rev. Robert F. Drinan. He has also worked on the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on the 1988 presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis and for the Rand Corporation.
Mr. Steinberg identified the agony of the Balkans and the evolution of relations between the United States and China as the two areas that have engaged him most over the past seven years.
He was one of the architects of Mr. Clinton's decision in 1994 to sever the link between human rights and trade with China.
Mr. Steinberg defends the administration's record on Bosnia and on Kosovo, but said that the unfinished business of the Balkans remains his biggest regret.
"We won't have a stable southeastern Europe," he said, "until the problem of Serbia is resolved."

HEADLINE: Referendums From States Are Seeking to Overhaul the Health Care System in the U.S.

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 10

 BODY:
They were gently spoken and kind-eyed in their white coats, but make no mistake: the handful of doctors and nurses gathering signatures outside the Massachusetts Statehouse see themselves as part of a popular health care insurgency, and some medical powers are taking them seriously enough to spend millions of dollars trying to stop them.
With one final petition drive this weekend, a coalition of doctors, nurses, senior citizens' groups, labor unions and others is expected to collect the last several thousand signatures needed to place before Massachusetts voters what experts call the most sweeping health care referendum on any state's ballot this fall. 
 Seeking to tap into widespread discontent with inaction by Congress and the Statehouse, the referendum would require the Legislature to find a way to provide health insurance coverage for all by mid-2002 in a state where more than 600,000 people lack it. It would also introduce a patients' bill of rights that would guarantee patients the freedom to choose their doctors, and guarantee doctors the freedom to choose the right treatment for their patients. And it would put a temporary ban on the conversion of nonprofit hospitals to for-profit.
Similar white-coat rebellions are in the works elsewhere: campaigners in Washington State, too, are close to getting a measure calling for universal health care onto the state ballot for this fall, which would make this the first campaign season in which more than one state had a universal care initiative on the ballot, experts say.
In a handful of other states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Montana -- campaigns backing narrower health care proposals, like requiring tobacco settlement money to go toward health, are using ballot initiatives as well.
"What is happening is an enormous backlash by the public," said Dr. Bernard Lown, a Nobel prize laureate and a leader of the Massachusetts initiative drive.
A push to overhaul the health care system, he said, "has to come from below, from the state level; you're closer to the people, you're closer to their pain, and they're more readily mobilized."
He and other campaigners say they believe a convergence of several factors is at work in their favor. They point to the swelling numbers of uninsured people, the trouble that many patients have paying for their prescription drugs, the spiraling costs of medical care and the widespread complaints from doctors and nurses that new constraints are keeping them from offering the best care to their patients.
The opposition appears readily mobilized as well.
Here in Massachusetts, the Coalition for Health Care, which is running the ballot campaign, is already opposed by the Committee for Affordable Health Care Choices, which unites business associations, managed care organizations and other insurers.
"We're just getting into campaign readiness," said Richard C. Lord, its spokesman and president of the state's biggest business association. "But it's probably going to take millions of dollars, because if you want to get your message across to the voters, you need to advertise, and that's very expensive."
His group's message, he said, will include the points that the initiative could destroy the networks that are the very basis of managed care, and could throw the health care system into chaos by the beginning of next year.
The committee also argues that the initiative is overly vague in that it calls for universal health care but does not specify how it is to be paid for. Several commissions in recent years have been stymied by the question of who would pay that bill, Mr. Lord noted.
The initiative's backers counter that the vagueness was intentional, because it allowed the formation of a coalition that included those who favor a Canadian-style single-payer system, those who favor a Hawaii-style requirement that employers provide health insurance, and others.
"People have been specifying the funding mechanisms forever, and they've been losing," said John O'Connor, the campaign's co-chairman and a veteran campaigner for environmental causes. "We want to keep the majority of voters together on the concept that everybody has to be covered by a date certain," July 1, 2002.
Judging by polls and the signature-gathering outside the Statehouse on Friday, support is indeed broad for the general idea of universal coverage.
A few passers-by withheld judgment, but several signed with alacrity. "I'm definitely for universal health care," said Shuang Wang, a 21-year-old intern at the Statehouse, "though I don't know where the money is going to come from." Another signer, Tom McCarron, a lobbyist on transportation issues, said, "I just think it's vitally important that people be covered for health care. The cost of it is just out of control."
Proposals for universal coverage have been made repeatedly in recent years around the country, since well before the Clinton administration tried to overhaul the country's health care system in the early 1990's.
In liberal Massachusetts, a universal health care proposal was even enacted into law in the late 1980's, though the Statehouse went from Democrat to Republican and the economy from flush to hard up, and the measure was repealed before it took effect.
Usually, measures calling for universal health care and other sweeping changes have tended to go down to defeat, said Diane Lardie, national coordinator of Uhcan, the Universal Health Care Action Network, a national group based in Cleveland. They have come up in more than 20 states beginning in Ohio in 1989, Ms. Lardie said, but usually either failed to make it onto the ballot or died in a legislative committee or on the floor of one house or another.
"One of the difficulties with something like a health care issue is that health care is so complex that people are scared," she said, "and they're willing to say, 'Don't do anything,' as opposed to 'Change it for the better' because they're afraid it won't be for the better."
The Massachusetts and Washington State initiatives are important bellwethers to gauge whether public opinion has indeed shifted, Ms. Lardie said. Maryland, too, is "ahead of the pack," she said. There, a political push for universal health care is under way, though it involves no referendum this year.
Oregon, as well, is a spot to watch. Campaigners there had planned a referendum on a health care overhaul this season, but postponed it, in part because action is under way on the legislative front. Also, Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a doctor, called for universal health care insurance for all Oregonians this year, saying he hoped to work out a proposal for the 2001 Legislature.
In Massachusetts, other political avenues are being pursued. State Senator Richard T. Moore, the Senate chairman of the Legislature's joint committee on health care, said he was confident that legislators would pass their own patients' bill of rights within the next month or so, one that would include the possibility of external review for patients denied care by their managed care providers. In addition, he said, a commission appointed by the governor to examine health care financing, quality and safety is to begin meeting next week.
He is concerned, Senator Moore said, that the ballot initiative "really goes too far."
Dr. Harris A. Berman, the chief executive of Tufts Health Plan here, also opposes the initiative, arguing that it can be expected to raise the price of health care significantly by taking away H.M.O.s' ability to control costs. To him, the very existence of the initiative, which tries to "use oversimplification to solve a very complex problem," is counterproductive.
"In a health care system hurting as badly as Massachusetts'," Dr. Berman said, "with every hospital and just about every health plan losing money and home health care operations going out of business, to spend millions of dollars that should be used on health care on this fight is just a travesty."
But campaigners say they will soldier on, regardless of criticism and possible legislative action, convinced that universal health care would save money by improving access to preventive care and thus avoiding expensive emergency room visits. And, they said, it is also the morally correct path.
John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist, has lent his name to the campaign and said he was supporting the initiative because he joined "with all sensible people in not wanting to see anyone die because they can't afford the requisite medical treatment."
He said he had grave doubts about whether health care "can be a business enterprise, where one saves money by cutting back care."

The Rejectionist

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If you want to make a list of the Syrian dictator Hafez al-Assad's good deeds, begin with this: he was an enemy of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. That's where the list ends.
On the debit side of his life's ledger can be included his eager alliance with Soviet Communism; his slaughter of thousands of dissident Syrians in Hama; his avid support of terrorists worldwide; his military occupation of neighboring Lebanon; and most consuming of all, his abiding hatred of Israel, which made Assad the Arab world's most relentless rejectionist. 
 At his funeral tomorrow, crocodile tears will flow from Yasir Arafat, long the object of Assad's contempt, who must be delighted at having outlived his tormentor.
Western leaders will proclaim respect for "stability" provided by such dictators-for-life. Groping for ways not to speak ill of the dead, they will note that once Assad grudgingly made an agreement, he "kept his word" by sealing his side of the border.
Wisely, Bill Clinton decided to bypass this chance at wearing his inimitable lip-biting mournful look, and won't dispatch Vice President Al Gore, his normal substitute, to Damascus.
Why? Because three months ago, at a much-touted meeting in Geneva, Clinton presented Assad with the Golan Heights on a silver platter. The Syrian then humiliated the supplicating American by refusing to take yes for an answer, making fresh demands for control of Galilee that embarrassed not only Clinton but even the most appeasement-prone doves in Jerusalem. Assad scuttled negotiations in the most dramatic way possible.
As a result, an unelected official, the secretary of state, will represent the U.S. at the state funeral of a world figure; that deliberate diplomatic slight will not be lost on Middle East leaders or American voters.
Does the dictator's demise help or harm the processing of peace? It helps.
Short-term, this week's attempt to transfer power to his son, Bashar, means that the "Syrian track" is derailed for at least this year. That delay is not a matter for hand-wringing. On the contrary, the implacable Hafez was pressing the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, into a corner that might have resulted in Israelis, in a referendum, voting to turn down a deal that would deliver the high ground in return for treaty promises.
Longer-term, the absence of Assad will help because the dictator was driven by pride to recapture in negotiation every inch of land he lost in foolish early aggressions. That intensely personal motive for self-justification is gone. Several scenarios now present themselves:
1. Worst case: anarchy in Syria. The Assads come from a religious minority, the Alawites; the majority Sunnis may want to take over. The dictator also struck a balance among his military, his spy service and his political party; his 34-year old son, figurehead of the regime's insiders, may not have the manipulative cunning of a father who in the end could be expected to make neither peace nor war. Anarchy could lead to coups, riots, a reckless lashing-out at Israel, rapprochement with Saddam. Hebrew University president Itamar Rabinovich, expert on Syria, tells me he's concerned that "The days of predictability may be over."
2. Less bad case: a balance of internal powers behind a dictator who needs to make peace to survive. If not Bashar, this could be a militarist or politician able to establish internal order -- "stability" -- without Hama-style massacres. Economic incentives might induce him to bring home 30,000 troops from Lebanon as Iran's Hezbollah is induced to leave.
3. Best case: the young man leads angry, backward Syria into the modern world. Bashar is an ophthalmologist, educated by London eye doctors. He heads the computer society in a socialist land too worried about dissent to permit Internet access to anybody beyond the elite. With initial investment from Saudis and the emirates, and with a little canniness and a lot of luck, he could introduce the rudiments of market reform and prosperity to a freedom-parched land. It's wishful thinking, but that's how a real peace could take hold.
As newscasters learn to pronounce "ophthalmologist" (first two syllables are "ahf" and "thal"), Syrians will adjust to life after Hafez. To succeed, whoever follows him must reject a life of rejection.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Out of Reach For Many, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The nation's expanding economy has produced an unintended downside, rapidly increasing housing costs that are denying many working-class wage earners an affordable place to live, especially in urban areas.
The growing gap is a major finding of the Clinton administration's fourth annual State of the Cities report, an assessment of the nation's economic health that otherwise reflects favorably on cities and suburbs that are enjoying overall low unemployment and high rates of home ownership. 
 But the economic growth that administration officials say has led to 22 million new jobs in the last seven years has helped push housing costs beyond the reach of many workers. The report found that the shortage of affordable houses and rental units is particularly acute in cities like Denver and San Francisco, where high-tech companies have led the boom.
"We have become a victim of our own success," Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said in an interview. "We have a great economy, and I hope it keeps going. But we also have to manage the downside of good economic times." Mr. Cuomo is scheduled to present the report today in Seattle at a meeting of the National Conference of Mayors.
The report suggests that the federal government can help close the housing gap by providing more financial assistance in the form of vouchers that could be applied toward rental costs and, for the first time, mortgage costs.
In that sense, the report does more than point out a problem: It also supports the administration's housing budget request for the 2001 fiscal year, a $32.1 billion proposal that represents a 23 percent increase over last year and would be the largest housing budget in two decades. Last week, the House Appropriations Committee approved all but $2.5 billion of the administration's request.
The report concludes that the economic health of cities, in general, has continued to improve in recent years, spurred by job creation in high-tech industries that is three times the growth rate for jobs in other industries. The combination has resulted in a 4.7 percent population increase in the nation's 331 largest metropolitan areas between 1990 and 1998, compared with an overall decline of 3.1 percent from 1970 to 1980.
While that swing has infused cities with a new vitality through ethnic and racial diversity, as the report says, it has helped drive up housing costs at a rate far beyond inflation. In cities like New York, Denver and San Francisco, competition for even small apartments has led to monthly rents of $2,000 and more.
In addition, job growth in cities and a growing disdain for long commutes from the suburbs have led many people to seek housing closer to their city jobs, only to find that prices in many neighborhoods are increasing at annual rates of 20 percent and more.
The result, the report says, is a record number of "worst case needs," which represents families who pay more than half of their income for housing or families in inadequate housing. In 1997, the last year for which statistics are available, the number of these families reached 5.4 million, a 12 percent increase over the same group in 1991.
"To make matters worse," the report said, "the number of affordable housing units is shrinking just when it needs to expand."
Mr. Cuomo said the challenge for the Clinton administration in its final months would be to help moderate wage earners gain access to better housing while doing nothing that interrupts overall economic growth.
What could make the efforts easier, he said, was what he perceived as a new willingness by Republicans to seek answers to the same problems. He recalled that four years ago Senator Bob Dole, the Republican challenger to President Clinton, favored eliminating the Housing Department.
But after Mr. Cuomo's address today to the mayors, a majority of whom are Democrats, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas planned to lay out his plans for housing and economic development in a speech to the same group by satellite.
"We've come a long way in four years," Mr. Cuomo said. "Four years after Republicans wanted to get rid of us, Governor Bush has a competing plan. I'd say that was progress."

HEADLINE: Hopes Remain High After a Late Delay in Korean Meeting

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Monday, June 12

 BODY:
South Korean officials remained confident today that the first summit meeting with North Korea would proceed normally on Tuesday despite an unexpected 24-hour delay by the North.
North Korean officials surprised their southern counterparts on Sunday with a request for the delay of the three-day meeting for unspecified "minor technical reasons." 
 The postponement set off rife speculation over the cause, with analysts here focusing on security arrangements, the death of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a longtime ally, or matters as mundane as the erratic electricity supply and telecommunications networks in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where the meeting is to be held.
Nonetheless, South Korean officials say they are still hopeful that the meeting can yield progress on reducing the tensions that have made the divided peninsula the most heavily armed place in the world, ultimately including a pledge by Pyongyang to forswear nuclear weapons development.
In addition, Seoul's main allies, the United States and Japan, have pressed for emphasis on reducing the threat from North Korea's ballistic missile program, which has helped provoke proposals in Washington to spend billions of dollars on an elaborate missile defense system.
Despite a half-century of military hostilities and fierce ideological competition between the two countries, not to mention the North's renowned unpredictability, officials here said they had few doubts that the delay would prove to be only a momentary setback.
Among other reasons for this confidence, they cited the presence of a 30-member advance team already in North Korea. "We will definitely go on Tuesday," said Moon Chung In, an academic who is part of the official southern delegation. "There is no major problem."
North Korea's first leader, Kim Il Sung, died in July 1994, just days before the only other previously scheduled summit meeting between the two countries, and the gulf between the two countries widened drastically in the ensuing years. Just last year, the two countries engaged in a fierce naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea, raising anew the prospect of war across the border.
Diplomats said, though, that the uncharacteristically intense recent diplomatic activity by North Korea was the best gauge of its seriousness about engaging the South and lifting the country's reclusive veil.
This month, the Korean president, Kim Jong Il, paid a surprise visit to China, his first trip outside the country since he succeeded his father. Since then, Mr. Kim has invited the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, for a visit to Pyongyang that is expected to take place in July.
Pyongyang has also recently busily established diplomatic relations with a wide range of nontraditional partners. These have included countries from Italy to Australia, and talks aimed at restoring or establishing ties with others are proceeding.
Last week, Washington announced that it could soon lift most economic sanctions that remain in place on North Korea, most of which are tied to the the State Department's listing of the country as a supporter of terrorism.
"It is clear that something important is going on here, and the North-South meeting is obviously the centerpiece," one senior Western diplomat said.
"It is hard to say just how far or how fast this will all proceed, but to not have spoken to someone for 50 years and then be seated at the same table is itself historic."
In recent days, a major concern of the South Korean government has been controlling high public expectations over the first meeting between leaders of the countries. In briefing after briefing, South Korean officials have stressed that the summit meeting should be seen as only the beginning of what they hope will be regular, high-level contacts between the two countries.
The two presidents, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong Il are expected to meet at least twice during the three days, and there have been persistent but unconfirmed reports of a reciprocal visit to Seoul by the North Korean leader in the coming months.
In a reflection of the huge differences separating the countries, the agenda has been left deliberately vague.
The South Korean leadership would like to achieve something that lowers military tensions on the peninsula, focusing on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which have generated anxiety throughout the region. Tensions rose sharply in 1998, for instance, when North Korea made a surprise test launch of a long-range Taepodong 2 missile that flew over the main Japanese island of Honshu.
For its part, North Korea can be expected to make renewed demands for the withdrawal of the approximately 37,000 American troops based in the South. And after years of disastrous shrinking of its economy following the loss of its Soviet-bloc allies, Pyongyang is also eager to receive a large increase in economic assistance and investment from the far richer South.
Seoul has already promised large amounts of development assistance in exchange for a real detente. And southern companies, many of whose leaders are flying to Pyongyang in the 130-member presidential delegation, are eager to expand their presence in the north.
To expand greatly, however, will require new agreements on everything from technology transfer and legal protections from expropriation to monetary exchange and ordinary banking procedures.
Given the daunting amount of groundwork required in these areas, South Korean officials say privately that they will consider the summit meeting a success if the two sides can announce progress on human issues like the restoration of mail service between the countries, or visits between millions of families separated by the war.

HEADLINE: Bush Draws Campaign Theme From More Than 'the Heart'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
Ask Gov. George W. Bush of Texas about the intellectual origins of his campaign's mantra and he says, "Compassionate conservatism is first and foremost springing from the heart."
Yet well before Mr. Bush began building his presidential campaign around the words "compassionate conservative" -- reshaping the image of his party to follow suit -- a cadre of thinkers on the right had been trying for years to fashion a form of conservatism that rejected the welfare state but did not turn its back on the poor. And with his campaign strategist Karl Rove acting as his guide, Mr. Bush began reading their books and meeting them, even before his first race for governor. 
 Mr. Rove gave the governor "The Dream and the Nightmare," a book by Myron Magnet of the Manhattan Institute that Mr. Bush said helped crystallize his thinking about culture. The book is an indictment of the attitudes of the 1960's counterculture and its legacy to the poor. Mr. Rove also introduced Mr. Bush to Marvin Olasky -- a proponent of 19th century-style charity over the entitlements of the welfare state -- whom the governor calls "compassionate conservatism's leading thinker" in a foreword to Mr. Olasky's newest book.
Those introductions amounted to the first building blocks of the "compassionate conservative" platform Mr. Bush is running on today: tax incentives that he predicts will lead to an explosion of charitable giving; an emphasis on using religious institutions to deal with poverty, drug abuse and other social problems and a pledge to "usher in the responsibility era," to replace the notion that "if it feels good, do it."
The core concept of this platform is that while government has a responsibility to the needy, it does not have to provide the services itself. This approach can be seen in everything from Mr. Bush's proposals for a tax credit to help people buy health insurance to his call to divert some Social Security payroll taxes into individual investment accounts.
As Stephen Goldsmith, Mr. Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, describes it, "compassionate conservatism means providing help in such a way as to stimulate and reinforce self-governance."
Such thoughts have been germinating for years, and the Bush campaign drew from several different schools of conservative and neo-conservative thinkers.
Some, like Mr. Magnet, start with a scathing critique of the attitudes of the 1960's and essentially blame liberalism for creating an entrenched underclass. Others base their views on Roman Catholic teachings that say social problems are best dealt with by the institution closest to those who are suffering.
And still others are Republican politicians, like Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio and former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, who have argued that the Republicans who put time limits on welfare benefits in 1996 could not just wash their hands of the poor.
"Can we match our skepticism about government with a bold new definition of public compassion?" the two lawmakers asked four years ago in a statement. "Can we dismantle a destructive welfare culture, and still fulfill our responsibilities to the disadvantaged?"
Mr. Bush describes "compassionate conservatism" as being rooted in values rather than as an intellectual movement. "It is the understanding that lives can be changed and that cultures can change," he said in a recent interview. "The origins are not just logical thought and inspirations from writings."
And he does not seem as steeped as his aides in the lineage of the ideas.
"News to me," Mr. Bush said when told that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had been captivated by many of the same writers as he had. And while Mr. Gingrich not only read Mr. Olasky's "The Tragedy of American Compassion" but gave copies to freshmen lawmakers in 1995, Mr. Bush said he had primarily learned about Mr. Olasky's concepts from talking with him, rather than from reading his books.
But Mr. Bush is clearly devoted to the new conservatism. As governor he has promoted hostels for welfare mothers and legislation that encouraged religion-based drug treatment centers and prison ministries. And when the time came to assemble his campaign staff, he tapped two apostles of compassionate conservatism: Michael Gerson, his chief speechwriter, had been a senior aide to Mr. Coats; and Mr. Goldsmith, his chief domestic policy adviser, had tried to create a laboratory for compassionate conservatism as the mayor of Indianapolis in the 1990's.
"If you go back to 1996," Mr. Goldsmith said, "the Republicans' message was that government had been harmful. Therefore, eliminate government, and people in tough circumstances will suddenly be better off. Both the public and many Republican mayors said that's naive. Merely the absence of bad action is not going to be sufficient."
When Mr. Bush made welfare's overhaul one of the main planks of his first campaign for governor and later wrestled with it after his election, Mr. Rove arranged for Mr. Bush to meet conservative academics like James Q. Wilson, who has studied character and social policy, urban problems and crime, as well as Mr. Olasky and Mr. Magnet, who were looking into the causes of entrenched urban poverty. As Mr. Magnet, who had been a scholar of Dickens, put it, "Weren't dizzying contrasts of wealth and poverty supposed to have gone out with Dickensian London?"
Mr. Magnet, whose book is subtitled "The Sixties' Legacy to the Underclass," charged that the youth of the 1960's, with their sexual revolution, disdain for bourgeois culture and praise for alternative lifestyles, "permitted, even celebrated, behavior that when poor people practice it will imprison them inextricably in poverty."
And in "The Tragedy of American Compassion," Mr. Olasky, whose personal pilgrimage led him to become first a Marxist and then an evangelical Christian, concluded that 19th-century America's religious-based charity was preferable to the welfare state. He thought that the social revolution of the 1960's was "disastrous" because it emphasized public assistance as an entitlement, asking nothing in return. The "key contribution" of the War on Poverty, he wrote, was "the deliberate attempt to uncouple welfare from shame." Religious charities of the last century, he argued, were more effective because they made demands in exchange for aid and because they required donors to give time as well as money.
The attack on the counterculture struck a chord with Mr. Bush. "It really helped crystallize some of my thinking about cultures, changing cultures," he said in the interview, "and of part of the legacy of my generation." Mr. Bush quickly acknowledged, though, that "positive things" also came out of the activism of the baby boom generation, like environmentalism and the women's movement.
As governor, Mr. Bush also met David Horowitz, once a voice of the New Left, who later turned conservative. In his book "Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the 60's," written with Peter Collier, Mr. Horowitz branded the 1960's as a time when "the System -- that collection of values that provide guidelines for societies as well as individuals -- was assaulted and mauled."
The Bush campaign also owes an intellectual debt to Catholic neo-conservatives who have based their advocacy of empowering grass-roots groups on concepts articulated by several encyclicals. As described by John J. DiIulio Jr., a University of Pennsylvania professor who has become a leading researcher of faith-based social services, the idea is that "charity begins at home. You always try to solve serious social problems as close to the people as possible." In other words, the federal government steps in only when problems become too big for other institutions.
Critics of compassionate conservatism argue that it erodes the wall between church and state and may use charity to force religion on the poor. They also ask whether the concept really offers a way to eliminate government's responsibility to the poor. Arianna Huffington, once an acolyte of the Gingrich revolution who ran an organization with Mr. Olasky to promote such ideas, now counts herself a skeptic.
"How do you take what works and make sure it reaches enough people?" Ms. Huffington asks. "Can that really be done without the raw power of government appropriations given that the private sector has not been forthcoming?" She said she once thought that if government were scaled back, the private sector would step forward. Instead, she realized "how much easier it was raising money for the opera or a fashionable museum."
And even among proponents of compassionate conservatism there is debate about how far to go. Mr. DiIulio, a professed New Democrat who has also advised some of Vice President Al Gore's aides, said he did not believe that the civic sector could replace government as a means to help the poor.
By contrast, Mr. Olasky, though he proposes a step-by-step testing of faith-based programs and tax credits for charity, seems eager to use them to eventually replace the federal safety net.
"We must place in the hands of state officials all decisions about welfare and the financing of it, and then press them to put welfare entirely in the hands of church and community based organizations," Mr. Olasky has written.
Some of these differences of opinion were hashed out for Mr. Bush in early 1999 when a group assembled by Mr. Goldsmith in Texas met with Mr. Bush and his top aides to prepare for the coming presidential campaign.
Mr. DiIulio and Mr. Olasky were there. So, among others, were Mr. Wilson and Robert L. Woodson Sr., the founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a nonprofit organization that assists neighborhood groups battling drugs, youth gangs and teen pregnancy.
Mr. Woodson, too, had gone on an intellectual journey, parting ways with former activists in the civil rights movement to become a leading black conservative in favor of social programs built around class, not race.
For perhaps four hours that day, as the group discussed policies for the poor, Mr. Bush asked what would work and what would not.
They did not all agree. "True to my New Democrat profile I made very clear, for me at least, it's not about ministry versus Medicaid," said Mr. DiIulio. "You're not going to solve these problems with just faith-based approaches. There's not enough money in civic society."
Mr. Olasky recalled that Mr. Bush was less interested when the conversation touched on tax policy and tax credits and more engaged by the discussion of particular faith-based institutions.
He attributes Mr. Bush's interest in faith-based charitable institutions to Mr. Bush's personal conversions in the 1980's.
"He seems to me to feel a real connection with these inner-city faith-based groups," Mr. Olasky said. "He went through religious change at the same time he gave up drinking, so he understands even though he is from a very different economic background."
Mr. Bush straddled the views that had been aired that day in Texas months later when he spoke in Indianapolis about using churches and neighborhood groups to help the needy.
Like Mr. Olasky, Mr. Bush said charities should make demands of the recipients of aid. "At Teen Challenge -- a national drug treatment program -- one official says, 'We have a rule: if you don't work, you don't eat,' " the Texas governor said. "This is demanding love," he said, "a severe mercy. These institutions, at their best, treat people as moral individuals, with responsibilities and duties, not as wards or clients or dependents or numbers."
But he also reflected the ideas of Mr. DiIulio, saying, "We will recognize there are some things that government should be doing -- like Medicaid for poor children. Government cannot be replaced by charities -- but it can welcome them as partners not resent them as rivals."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
As the Coliseum Comes Down, a Long-Missing City Vista Starts to Open Up

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
DON'T look now, but 59th Street is back.
Actually, do look now at what used to be New York City's intolerable hulk, the Coliseum on Columbus Circle. It could be a few months from disappearing forever, and despite the unsightliness of the demolition job on Broadway between 58th and 60th Streets, this happens to be one breathtaking scene. 
 Come to Columbus Circle and see sun, light and air, of which New York has much too little. There's so much sun and sky, you could be in Phoenix. Despite the rubble, the hanging black drapes of safety netting, the dangling concrete slabs, the site is all opened up.
It won't be for long, but the coming replacement for the Coliseum and its companion 26-story office building at 10 Columbus Circle doesn't look as though it will make the same mistakes.
What was always wrong about the Coliseum was its original conception. It was, as an exhibition hall, broad and impenetrable, a wall of blond brick. There it sat at the gateway to Central Park -- an unblinking barrier.
It was windowless, squat, and erased 59th Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue. Obliterated it. There was nothing particularly great about that stretch of 59th Street, but it was part of the city's fine east-west grid, which creates the perception of light and space. The grid allows glimpses of sky, of the Hudson and East Rivers. Of New Jersey.
"The Coliseum closed off 59th Street," said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. "For a long time, we were urging the city to do a better job, so when you went down Central Park South you could see that there was sky there. That's the great feature of Manhattan. Even though we have skyscrapers, we see light at the end of the tunnel."
Twelve years ago, Metro Matters argued (not quite seriously) that 59th Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue should make a comeback and predicted (quite seriously) that it never would. Well, M.M. was technically right, but figuratively wrong. Apologies. The razing of the Coliseum has returned 59th Street to us in spirit.
Of course, that won't last; a location that rivals the Arc de Triomphe's for drama is not about to stay vacant. Soon, maybe by the fall, construction will begin for Columbus Centre, two 750-foot towers on a large base, to be built by Related Companies. The project emerged from more than 15 years of false starts, litigation and an economic crash that killed an earlier proposal. It will include the headquarters of Time Warner, studios for its Cable News Network and New York 1 television news operations, restaurants, stores, a hotel, condominium apartments, a 12-screen movie theater, up to 600 parking spaces -- and the first permanent home for Jazz at Lincoln Center.
It is hardly low-rise or scaled modestly in any way. But thanks to city planners, community critics, its own architects and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who intervened and thwarted another design, Columbus Centre shows no signs of becoming a walled-in colossus. The city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, owner of the property, imposed design guidelines that, among other things, were aimed at opening up the 2.5 million-square-foot project. Its main feature is dividing the site with a "view corridor" -- space -- about where 59th Street would be.
THE final design is to be announced June 28. City officials say that the two towers will be separated by 85 feet, 25 feet more than the width of the typical city street. The project's 150-foot-high base, 50 feet higher than the Coliseum, is hardly small. But it is to have a glass "curtain," a spectacular Central Park view from the jazz center, and views from the outside into the center.
If the advance billing is accurate, the design doesn't sound like another blank wall.
So New York isn't really getting back a piece of 59th Street, but the next best thing -- the sense that it is there. Plus, the city rebuilt the park opposite the Coliseum site, simplified the spaghetti of streets and messy parking areas around the statue of Columbus, and created a real traffic circle.
Given the history of this bedeviled corner of Manhattan, maybe more trouble lurks. Maybe Columbus Centre won't be as advertised. Or maybe New York City will have finally given itself a world-class treat.
Amazing what rediscovering a bit of 59th Street can do.

HEADLINE: Gentlemen, Start Your Lawn Mower Engines

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: MANDAN, N.D., June 11

 BODY:
Perhaps it is the tedium of watching the grass grow just to cut it down and watch it grow some more. Perhaps it's just something about men and their motors. No one seems to know why it is happening now. But all across America, men have discovered new thrills at the throttle of the snail of gasoline-powered locomotion, the riding lawn mower.
From Bergholz, N.Y., to Buda, Tex., from Troy, Ohio, and Stillwater, Okla., to Cut Bank, Mont., Damascus, Ore., and this brawny town across the Missouri River from Bismarck, men and the rare woman are off to the races on souped-up, decal-coated John Deeres, Snappers, Dynamarks and Murrays. Some as stocky as their machines themselves, they whip around dirt tracks at speeds routinely exceeding 30 miles an hour and sometimes 60. 
 "This is going to go over big time if somebody doesn't get killed," said Larry Freisz, 61, a fan at the races around a 480-foot dirt track at the Dacotah Speedway here on Saturday. Poking along at four or five miles an hour in the solitude of the prairie west of Mandan, Mr. Freisz mows five acres of grass around his home, so he was taken by the speed of the machines here.
"Those two mowers over there?" Mr. Freisz said. "They're just like mosquitoes. They're here and they're gone."
The racing inspires puns. "The mow the merrier," the United States Lawn Mower Racing Association advertises, in the "mowdowns" of the "mowlennium." A group in Ohio calls itself the Dewberry Mudboggers, and one in Alabama, the Dixie Outlaws.
Although the mowers' blades are removed, these machines still have a modicum of menace. Somebody might indeed get killed. Through their trade association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, in Alexandria, Va., the companies that produce 1.6 million riding lawn mowers a year will have nothing to do with racing and have adopted a resolution opposing it. "We're concerned with the use of the equipment as it was manufactured to be used," said William G. Harley, president of the institute.
Here, 40-year-old Richard Bohlman, operations director of a medical center 200 miles away in Tioga, won the biggest event, with eight men starting and four finishing the 20 laps. The instant Mr. Bohlman crossed the line, his mower threw a rear wheel. The machine flipped, pitching Mr. Bohlman, who weighs about 250 pounds, 15 feet in the air. He seemed to hover there spread-eagled, then landed on his side in the dirt. Ashen and aching, he walked away.
Like stock car racing, a decades-old institution in many suburban and rural communities, lawn mower racing is becoming a regular sport. Local newspapers report the results. Local businesses sponsor many of the racers. Races in Stillwater draw thousands of fans; the one here drew 200. Evidently starting in the late 1980's as a Fourth of July event on wide subdivision streets, contenders are now organizing circuits, scheduling weekend races town to town.
Donald Gienger, a machinist at an Ingersoll-Rand factory in Bismarck, formed the North Dakota Lawn Mower Racing Association only last year. He drew six drivers to its first race, in Mandan. On Saturday, 12 showed up for the first of six events scheduled across the state so far this year. Thirty racers have signed up for one on July 4 in Wildrose, N.D., population 193. Other circuits have formed in Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington State and upstate New York.
Lawn mower racing's biggest boost has come from the Gold Eagle Company in Chicago, which makes a gasoline additive called Sta-bil. Eight years ago, Gold Eagle executives formed the United States Lawn Mower Racing Association to promote Sta-bil. The association now claims 500 member racers for whom it has organized more than 20 regional events this year, the most ever, and a national championship in Mendota, Ill., on Labor Day. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, more racers belong to groups, just a year or two old, unaffiliated with the association.
One secret of the racing's growth is its economics. To enter, contestants pay a small fee, $15 or $25. There are no purses and typically no betting. "We have no desire for filthy lucre," said Larry Sandoval, 62, who edits the newsletter of a racing group in Stillwater. Bruce Kaufman, a public relations man and president of the national association, said, "We race for trophies, bragging rights and glory."
More important, the mowers are cheap, opening a vast new horizon for the adrenaline-enriched and mechanically inclined. Racing mowers cost a fraction of the $10,000 or $20,000 spent to buy and prepare a stock car racer.
Most are long-retired machines that racers rebuild to meet four or five levels of classification, from stock racers that still cut grass, but race with blades removed, to "factory experimental" machines on which the platforms intended to cover the blades are strictly decorative.
Mr. Bohlman, who had the accident here, said that one of his two racers is 28 years old. "My uncle bought it for me when I was 12 to mow the grass on my grandfather's farm," he said. Long after, "I dug it out of a rock pile" and fixed it up for racing.
Wayne Storick, a 35-year-old contract laborer, bought his mower for $100. "I cut my grass with it and then tore it apart," he said. "I put a centrifugal clutch in it" so he doesn't have to shift gears. "I made my own intake manifold and cam shaft." He installed an external oil pump and brakes from a snowmobile.
"I've always liked working with engines," said Mark Steinwand, 33. "I like making stuff go as fast at it can." A machine operator at the Ingersoll-Rand plant, Mr. Steinwand bought his mower from a farmer last August. "He pulled it out of his tree rows. I got three lawn mowers from him. I gave him $50 for all three."
Mr. Gienger, the machinist, who owns four mowers, said: "They're the guys who always wanted to race and couldn't afford to. If they missed their call for professional racing, this is their venue."
Any silliness to the notion of racing a riding lawn mower evaporates as a race approaches.
In Mandan this weekend, grim-faced men donned the required safety apparel -- long-sleeved shirts, long pants, gloves, over-the-ankle boots and full-face helmets. On their machines, each had a switch, to be tethered to their belts, to stop the motor if they fell or were thrown. Racers cannot drug their machines with speed-inducing additives.
On the announcer's command, "On your mark, get set, get ready, mow!" they dashed to their machines and roared off. Round and round they went, hunching over their steering wheels. Thundering into turns, they hiked out their bodies barely touching their seats, from one side, then the other. Lean, lanky younger men had the edge in maneuvering and dodging, the bigger men in keeping their wheels down.
In all four races, machines spun into the center and returned, or died with dropped chains and burst engines. "The big men won," said Mr. Gienger, who, with Mr. Bohlman, was one of them.
Then came the tamer, double-elimination one-on-one drag races, and another close call. Wayne Schultz, 34, a farmer from Streeter, Okla., 90 miles east of Mandan, had finished third in his class in the earlier race.
In the first heat of the drag, he lost to Donovan Hoffer, 27, a heavy-equipment operator from Bismarck. With the flash of orange lights starting the second, Mr. Schultz's mower did a wheelie, leaping up on its rear wheels. But instead of folding back down on him, still in the seat, it stood there upended, and Mr. Schultz walked away.
"You really got to be a good defensive driver," Mr. Gienger said. "You have to be very level-headed about it. There's a huge level of risk."

Leaders of Syria Building Support for Son of Assad
The party and nation that Hafez al-Assad ruled for 30 years until his death on Saturday moved swiftly to anoint his son, Bashar, as Syria's new president, raising prospects that at least the nominal trappings of power in the highly militarized state may pass peacefully to a new generation. The younger Mr. Assad secured a number of new titles and positions, cementing his claim to his father's job. A1 

Israeli leaders proclaimed that the death of Mr. Assad, a sworn enemy of their state, ushered out an old era in the Middle East. But no one could predict what that portended beyond a potentially problematic transition period. A14
 
Damascus was a contrast in silence -- of mourning and secretive political maneuvering -- and the noisy grief of tens of thousands of people. Public gatherings are not generally permitted, but residents of the capital streamed into the streets, watched by security guards. A14
 
In a border village in the Golan Heights, members of Mr. Assad's minority Alawite sect chanted and wept in a demonstration of loyalty to Syria at a memorial ceremony with a peculiar twist. After Israel's recent withdrawal from Lebanon, United Nations teams surveying the border determined that part of it actually lies in Lebanon. The villagers bitterly oppose being divided. A14
 
Korean Summit Hopes Still High
South Korean officials remained confident that the first summit meeting with North Korea would proceed normally tomorrow despite an unexpected 24-hour delay. North Korean officials surprised their southern counterparts with a request for the delay of the three-day meeting because of unspecified "minor technical reasons." A6
 
Push to Weaken World Court
The United States, isolated among the nations of the world, is going into a crucial conference on the soon-to-be-established International Criminal Court still asking for changes in its charter. Unless some compromise can be found, legal experts say, a major step in international law will be taken without United States participation, even though Americans have been at the forefront of demanding trials for leaders like Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein. A9
 
Montenegro Vote as Barometer
Montenegrins voted in two local elections that were being closely watched as a barometer of relations between the small Western-leaning republic and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Both outsiders and residents fear that a rupture with Belgrade would cause another of the Balkan wars that have erupted since the old Communist Yugoslavia began splitting apart. A3
 
A Battle in Congo Ends
Rwandan troops drove Ugandan forces from Congo's third-largest city after a fierce seven-hour battle that ended a week of widespread shelling and enabled the United Nations to deploy forces between the two armies and prepare for their withdrawal. A5

Death Sentences Reversed In Two of Three Appeals
The most far-reaching study of the death penalty in the United States has found that two out of three convictions were overturned on appeal, mostly because of serious errors by incompetent defense lawyers or overzealous police officers and prosecutors who withheld evidence. A1
 
G.O.P. to Push Drug Benefits
House Republicans will flesh out their proposal for Medicare drug benefits this week and try to push it through two House committees in three days, despite fierce objections from many Democrats. A18
 
Housing Costs Beyond Reach
The nation's expanding economy has produced an unintended downside, rapidly increasing housing costs that are denying many working-class wage earners an affordable place to live, especially in urban areas. A22
 
Making the Case for Gore
The Gore campaign is enlisting scores of character witnesses and deploying them on talk shows and the campaign trail. Their job is to attest to Vice President Al Gore's humanity and make the case for his policy proposals. A25
 
Perot Backers Are Ousted
Several supporters of the Reform Party's founder, Ross Perot, have been unseated in Texas, in a coup described as a "storming by the Pat Buchanan brigade." A25

Impact of Global Warming
A warming of the global climate is likely to have substantial consequences for better and worse around the United States in coming decades, including bumper crops in the heartland, chronic erosion of coasts, summer water shortages and winter floods in the West, a federal study has concluded. A1

State Senate Republicans Show a More Liberal Side
The Senate Republicans, long a redoubt of conservatism in a liberal state, have made an astonishing march leftward in approving legislation in the last several months, with an election looming. Joseph L. Bruno, Republican majority leader of the State Senate, said, "We're in a business where times change." A1
 
Census Takers Finishing the Job
An army of census takers has surpassed the Census Bureau's efforts in 1990 and nearly completed the agency's task of accounting for New Yorkers who did not complete their mail-in forms this spring, the Census Bureau said. B1

An outbreak of violence that began Friday night continued unabated yesterday when 3 people were killed and 28 others were stabbed or shot in attacks throughout New York City, the police said. Over the weekend, a total of 60 people were shot or stabbed, and 6 of the victims died. B1

HEADLINE: Gore Campaign Enlists 'Character Witnesses'

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11

 BODY:
When he was in Seattle last week, Vice President Al Gore dropped by a fund-raising reception for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington. The governor, in introducing the vice president to the crowd, followed a script suggested by Mr. Gore's presidential campaign. And here is what the campaign wanted these people to know:
"He's not only a great person, but he's very funny," Governor Locke said. He is "a person who is committed to his family," Mr. Locke went on. "He is always picking up the phone to check on his mom." 
 Governor Locke, like countless others who are introducing Mr. Gore around the country these days, is what is known in the trade as a "validator," or a character witness, someone who can attest to the nature of the real Al Gore and reassure voters that he is a decent man, a family man, a good guy.
Although Mr. Gore has been campaigning intensely for more than a year now and has been in public life for nearly a quarter-century, he is still having trouble getting across this basic message. That is one reason why the campaign is enlisting scores of validators -- Democrats like Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts -- and deploying them on talk shows and the campaign trail.
Their job is not just to attest to Mr. Gore's humanity, although that is a large part of it. They must also make the case for his policy proposals and be prepared to scold Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Mr. Gore's Republican rival, so that Mr. Gore does not have to do it himself and thereby contradict the positive, good-guy image that the campaign is so desperately seeking to convey.
The deployment of validators is just one element of a new phase of the Gore campaign, one that the vice president agreed last week in an interview could be as dramatic a turning point as one last fall when he moved his campaign headquarters from Washington to Nashville and started engaging his now-vanquished Democratic challenger, former Senator Bill Bradley, with zeal. And he and his advisers hope the payoff is as great.
The new phase is marked by a concerted effort to transmit more of Mr. Gore's personal side along with a positive presentation of his policy proposals. It includes a media blitz he plans to begin on Tuesday in New York, one so extensive that it will almost seem like a relaunching of his campaign, as he begins a "progress and prosperity tour" across the Middle Atlantic States and the Midwest.
The new phase also features a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, a retreat by Mr. Gore from his harsh assessments of Governor Bush and a cheery message of optimism. As he told a group of financial contributors on Thursday night in Beverly Hills, Calif., "We'll make this decade the brightest time in American history."
Unfortunately for Mr. Gore, the shift in strategy plays into one of the Republicans' chief criticisms of him: that he lacks consistency.
"Al Gore Reinvents Himself -- Again!" blares a news release from the Bush campaign. It goes on to list six Gore incarnations since last summer: the underdog, the average Joe, the alpha male, the crusading reformer, the negative attacker and, now, the thinking man with a heart.
The strategy also reflects some concern by the campaign that Mr. Gore needs to inspire core Democratic constituencies with whom he should be comfortably ahead. The tour will take him to places like Scranton, Pa., and Cincinnati, conveniently located in battleground states.
Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, said that this period was less a shift than a reflection of "the natural ebb and flow" of any campaign. "There will be plenty of time down the road to draw the comparisons and contrasts with the options that Governor Bush wants to pursue," he said.
On the first day of his "progress and prosperity tour," in New York, Mr. Gore is to stand with Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary and Wall Street giant, at his side, and begin a national discussion on the upbeat subject of how best to use the burgeoning budget surplus and keep the economy roaring. The White House projects a surplus of $746 billion over the next decade, and the Gore tour, scheduled to span the next two weeks, is designed to coincide with forecasts of an even greater surplus.
The emphasis on the nation's prosperity will give Mr. Gore a chance to remind voters that he has been part of the administration that has presided over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. This, his advisers say, is his strongest suit and provides the most compelling argument for his election as president.
Already, President Clinton -- another validator -- is out making this case. On Saturday in Minneapolis, Mr. Clinton told 700 donors at a fund-raising reception: "You need to know that there has never been anybody in that job who had more of an impact on more issues across a broader range of areas and that a lot of the success we enjoy today would not have been possible if it hadn't been for him."
Mr. Gore is to push proposals for helping to pay down the national debt, protect Medicare by removing it from the budget process, eliminate the long-term Social Security deficit, provide tax incentives, make investments in education, health care and job training, and create a new kind of personal retirement account, one based on a Clinton proposal for Universal Savings Accounts.
The prosperity tour coincides with the opening of a two-month $25-million advertising campaign financed by the Democratic National Committee but produced by Gore consultants. The first commercial, running in 15 states, touts his support for a Medicare benefit to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs.
Future commercials leading to the Democratic convention in August are to focus on parts of Mr. Gore's personal biography and his life outside Washington -- as a soldier in Vietnam and a divinity student and journalist in Tennessee, and, of course, as a family man.
His wife, Tipper, who has been keeping a separate campaign schedule, has been appearing with him lately. On Monday night, at a town meeting with women in New Jersey, he is to be accompanied by his oldest daughter, Karenna.
"We want people to have an opportunity to learn more about Al Gore the person, where he learned his values and how he would lead," said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
Mr. Gore has also ceased attacking Mr. Bush. Although he spent much of the spring denouncing Mr. Bush as inexperienced and proffering "risky" schemes, he has not mentioned Mr. Bush's name in public since May 26, when he derided his call for an expansive missile-defense system. Since then, Mr. Gore has only sparingly referred to him as "the other fellow" or "the other side."
At the same time, Mr. Gore is stepping up his pleas to Democrats to work hard for him. As he said to a group of Democratic mayors last week: "I'm asking you to really turn it on for me."

HEADLINE: A 42-Block-Long Party In Honor of Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
Politicians and protesters vied for attention yesterday at the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. But there was no mistaking what drew the hundreds of thousands who jammed the sidewalks for a 42-block stretch of Fifth Avenue: a chance to be part of a high-spirited celebration of Puerto Rican culture, music and ethnic pride.
Though the parade itself went off without incident, hundreds of bystanders were overcome by the heat, and the celebration's aftermath was marred by violence. Three men were stabbed near the end of the parade route, the police said yesterday, in unrelated attacks in a 20-minute span beginning shortly after 5 p.m. All three were hospitalized in stable condition last night. 
 It was an unfortunate coda to an otherwise upbeat parade, traditionally one of the city's largest and most boisterous. The celebration turned the Upper East Side into a undulating sea of red, white and blue Puerto Rican flags displayed on T-shirts, bandannas, nail polish, necklaces and even a cape worn by a dog.
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio, New York's candidates for the United States Senate, were there, along with a long list of other state and local politicians. Hundreds of marchers and spectators held signs urging the United States Navy to stop using Vieques, a Puerto Rican island, as a bombing range.
Still others at the parade, which choked traffic from Midtown through the Upper East Side, rallied in memory of Pedro Albizu Campos, a figure in Puerto Rico's separatist movement who called for islanders to start an armed struggle against the United States.
But it was the dancers, the competing salsa and marching bands and the floats sponsored by towns and villages from Puerto Rico that drew the biggest roars from the crowds. So, too, did the tributes to Tito Puente, the jazz musician of Puerto Rican heritage who died on May 31.
"It's about Puerto Rican people being together, proud of being Puerto Rican and celebrating our day," said Violet Colon, 49, from the Bronx.
But the sun that beat down on Fifth Avenue proved too much for many paradegoers. As temperatures reached the low 90's, about 250 people were treated for heat-related health problems, mostly sunstroke and dehydration, Firefighter Vito Berretta said. While several were taken to hospitals, no cases were serious, he said.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani marched alongside Mr. Lazio, who replaced him last month as the Republican candidate for the Senate. Mrs. Clinton was escorted by Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, with whom she broke into a dance at one point, as the two passed a 12-member salsa band.
The previous Sunday, Mrs. Clinton was jeered and booed intensely as she marched up Fifth Avenue in the Salute to Israel Parade, in part because of her previous support for an independent Palestinian state. But yesterday, it was Mr. Giuliani who drew a symphony of boos and occasional rude gestures, evidence of his decline in popularity among the city's Hispanic population since first being elected mayor in 1993, particularly after a series of recent police shootings of unarmed men.
Mr. Giuliani seemed impervious to the often bitter response, rushing to the sidewalks to greet spectators even when he was being booed. "It was a better reception than I usually get," said Mr. Giuliani, alluding to the heckling he had received at recent Puerto Rican Day parades. "I think it is wonderful. I think more people applauded for me."
Mrs. Clinton clearly relished the turnaround that a week had brought.
"That is democracy in action," she said of the reversal from the previous Sunday. "We are so blessed to live in a country where everyone is free to express their opinion."
The parade -- which at times seemed to extend throughout much of Manhattan, with streams of cars and motorcycles festooned with Puerto Rican flags -- illustrated the growing economic force of Latinos in the United States economy.
There were, of course, floats sponsored by traditional Latino-oriented products, like Cafe Bustelo coffee and Corona, the Mexican beer. But the Showtime cable network was promoting its new television series "Resurrection Blvd.", about a Latino family in East Los Angeles. There were also floats by several Latino-oriented Internet sites, like Latino.com and LaMusica.com, as well as by retailers and companies like Sears and Colgate-Palmolive.
The Mazola corn oil float feverishly rocked back and forth to the tunes of the Barrio Boyzz, who had the young girls in the crowd swooning. The actors Jimmy Smits and Rosie Perez also drew intense cheers, as did the boxer Felix Trinidad.
The parade was dedicated to Vieques and to Pedro Albizu Campos, the onetime leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who was imprisoned in the 1930's and 40's for trying to overthrow the United States government and again in the 50's for attacks against the government. But the concern about Vieques drew more attention.
"We are being invaded," said Brinitte Gonzalez, 30, of the Bronx, one of many who held a "Peace for Vieques" sign. "It is our island. I just want them to get out."
Yet even some of the demonstrators acknowledged that the expression of ethnic pride and celebration of Puerto Rican culture were what most drew them to the parade.

HEADLINE: Brat Control on Easy Street;
Rich Parents Get Tips on Raising Kids Not to Be Rotten

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN

 BODY:
If your 5-year-old asks how much money you make, and you make tons, then the appropriate reply is, "That is not a nice question."
If your 22-year-old gives a big, boozy party and breaks up the million-dollar TriBeCa apartment that you just bought as a graduation gift, then that child is not yet ready to be trusted with serious inheritance money. 
 If your son insists on marrying someone who is poor, then, as soon as is seemly, you should persuade the future daughter-in-law to sign a prenuptial agreement. After the signature, it is prudent to smooth ruffled feathers with a sizable cash gift that says, "Welcome to the family."
These and other strategies for raising the rich in Manhattan were served up last week in an auction room at Christie's filled with wealthy parents and grandparents.
Rich kids are something of a growth industry in Manhattan and across the country, as the number of families worth $10 million or more has jumped more than fourfold in the last decade to 275,000 from 65,000, said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University and editor of The Review of Income and Wealth.
At least 41,000 of those families live in New York City, constituting the largest concentration of the rich in any American city, Professor Wolff said.
Last week's strategy session at Christie's marshaled the expertise of four rich-kid specialists -- a headmaster at a private school, a lawyer specializing in trusts and estates, a child psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. Together, they explained how to increase the odds that children who know they will never have to work for a living will turn out to be something other than pouty layabouts.
"An awful lot of people have made an enormous amount of money and are scared what it is going to do to their kids," said Dale Burch, who organized the box lunch and panel discussion for which tickets cost between $100 and $500. It was the second such panel in two years at Christie's, with proceeds going to the Henry Street Settlement, a community organization on the Lower East Side. Mrs. Burch is on its board.
The ideal rich kid that the experts talked about would grow up to be a hard-working adult -- smart with investments, inclined to philanthropy and comfortable in social settings with the nonrich.
Unmentioned by the press-shy parents at the box lunch were the flame-outs, drug overdoses and suicides that periodically burn the names of rich families -- and their profoundly unhappy progeny -- into the public mind.
In Manhattan in the last 13 months, Raphael de Rothschild, 23, heir to one of the largest fortunes in the world, died of an apparent heroin overdose on a sidewalk in Chelsea; Robert Bingham, 33, a promising fiction writer and heir to a newspaper fortune, died of an apparent heroin overdose in his loft in TriBeCa; and William Woodward III, 54, scion of a society family known as much for violent deaths as for wealth, took off his slippers and jumped to his death from his 14th-floor apartment on the Upper East Side.
Judging from last week's two-hour advice session (and a videotape of last year's), three particularly vexing clusters of trouble confront parents trying to raise well-adjusted children in Park Avenue circumstances.
 
MOTIVATION AND DISCIPLINE
"You can buy whatever you want without lifting a pudgy finger."
That's how Hume R. Speyer, the trusts and estates lawyer on the panel, summed up the fundamental risk facing rich children.
To defend against what Mr. Speyer called "the dark side" of wealth, the panel collectively offered advice.
Parents should show their children, by example, that meaning in life comes from work, education and concern for others -- not from buying and bragging about clothes, cars, airplanes, apartments, summer houses and fancy foreign vacations.
In practice, parents should insist that children do real work around the house, even if it means ordering servants to back off and let a child wash a dish, vacuum a rug or clean a closet.
Children, at about the age of 5, should be made aware that most people are not rich and that the privileged few have an obligation to pay attention to the poor and to invest time and money in trying to help them.
Children should be given an allowance that amounts to somewhat less than what they say they need, and part of it should be set aside for charitable giving.
So their school-age children can't hornswoggle them with tales about what "all the other kids are doing," parents should meet regularly with other parents (a relatively easy trick, since most rich kids in Manhattan attend small private schools). They should compare allowances, credit-card policies and set rules for how much money rich children can spend on one another.
If your child comes home and says he wants a credit card because all the other children have them: "Ask who and how many of the friends have credit cards," advised Diana Russell Deacon, the psychoanalyst on the panel. "The list might get short very fast."
The panelists advised parents to keep children away from technology that enables unlimited spending. Instead of American Express cards, give debit cards that run dry when allowance runs out. Give cellular phones that have a prepaid chip. If children chat beyond their allotted time, then they are out of luck until next month. Car repairs and maintenance should come out of allowance, not unlimited access to dad's wallet.
Dr. Peter J. Walsh, the child psychiatrist on the panel, told the story of a 19-year-old daughter from a Manhattan family who went off to an Ivy League college with a shiny new BMW convertible. When she wrecked it, her parents immediately bought her a Mercedes, and when she wrecked that, they immediately bought her a Lexus sport utility vehicle.
"Parents will often go for the quick, easy solution, which often isn't the right way of dealing with the problem," Dr. Walsh said. "You don't always have to smooth things over with a bigger, better thing. Instead of buying her better cars, take the time to teach her how to drive. Impose a little delay between cars, so she realizes that there are consequences for wrecking them."
 
DEALING WITH THE NONRICH
"Do I have to fly coach so my son will not alienate other kids?"
So asked one parent, who said he could not control the obnoxious bragging of his son about family money.
The panelists said such bragging was common among insecure rich kids trying to establish a sense of self. To smooth a child's entry into a world where most people are not rich, the panelists agreed, parents should talk early and often with him about family money -- and about the obligations that go with it.
"Be honest and matter of fact with children inside the family about the money," said Mr. Speyer, the lawyer, who advises starting frank discussions about money when children are in their early teens. He said the chats should become more detailed -- and should be supported with paperwork from brokers and banks -- as a teenager's capacity to understand increases.
But in all these conversations, Mr. Speyer said, parents should draw a firm line between proper discussions of money inside the family and improper boasting about money with friends and all other outsiders.
"By not acting like an extremely rich person," he said, "you may not be treated like an extremely rich person, and that is a good thing."
When a rich child grows up in nonrich world, there is always the possibility that he or she may marry a person from that world. As with all the risks of moneyed child rearing, panel members said, the best answer is to talk early and honestly to child about the family's long-term interest in protecting its capital. This usually means, they said, bringing up the prenuptial agreement.
Dr. Walsh advised parents to deal with their child and the nonrich future in-law "as a couple."
"You should sit them both down and tell them what your concerns are," said Dr. Walsh. "It is a wonderful litmus test to see the character of the person who is coming into your family."
Mr. Speyer, the lawyer, said that prenuptial agreements were "a really good idea." But, he said, it is also true that "for the poor spouse, the process can be very unpleasant."
He advises parents to cushion the upset by giving a "not insubstantial" gift -- as soon as the prenuptial is signed.
 
GIVING ALL THE MONEY TO THE CHILDREN
"Do you 'owe' your children your lifestyle?"
This question seemed to arouse the most passion from panelists and parents.
All the experts argued that parents owed their children continuity with the luxurious lives to which they had allowed their children to become accustomed.
"If they have lived themselves a life of plenty, that is all they will have learned in their lives," said George P. Davison, head of Grace Church School, a private school in Manhattan. "They will have been really good at it in order to please you as their parents. Then, after doing everything right for 21 years, you say, 'Sorry, you are out.' Of course, they are going to be angry. Of course, they are going to be uncomprehending."
Disinheriting a child, Dr. Walsh said, is not a humane option for wealthy parents.
"This just causes rage among children and they start floundering," he said.
Nor did the experts have an encouraging word to say about "incentive trusts," a new wrinkle in estate planning among the very rich. These trusts give money on the basis of performance. A child, for instance, might get more money if he became a teacher, rather than an international playboy.
These arrangements are complex for trustees to administer, the panelists agreed, and they almost always make offspring crazy with rage, driving a wedge of resentment between parents and children.
The panelists agreed that it was usually better for all concerned for parents to give their children just enough money to be comfortable, although the experts offered few specifics as to what that might mean.
"A lot of my really rich clients have made a conscious decision not give all the money to their children," Mr. Speyer said. "They set up a foundation and give the kids a chance to help decide how it will be spent. This centers the family, gives responsibility, gives life meaning."

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Rebounds in Canada As It Becomes Top U.S. Supplier

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta

 BODY:
As this summer's driving and air-conditioning season unfolds, Americans may watch gasoline meters spin and utility bills soar and be tempted to think bad thoughts about energy princes in faraway Arabia.
But, as the ditty dictates, why not blame Canada? Or, more precisely, blame Alberta. 
 With the deferential surreptitiousness that some Americans now associate with their northern neighbor, Canada in the last decade nearly doubled its oil exports and nearly tripled its natural gas exports to the United States. Now Canada has definitively emerged as the No. 1 energy supplier to the United States, the world's largest energy importer.
"Canada is the largest total energy supplier to the United States, greater than Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Mexico," Gordon D. Giffin, the United States ambassador to Canada, said here recently in a speech to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, an industry group. The ambassador diplomatically did not note that oil and gas imports this year account for a big part of the rising United States trade deficit.
With oil and natural gas prices doubling over the last year, there are no apologies for $30 barrels of oil here in Alberta, Canada's largest oil and gas producing province.
 To the contrary, this city, Canada's energy capital, rolled out red carpets on Sunday to welcome the World Petroleum Congress, a 54-nation association that is a forum for industry leaders and energy technology experts. The five-day affair is drawing 3,000 delegates and journalists, as well as protesters against global warming.
"It's basically our turn; commodity prices have been down for a long time now," said J. C. Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Exploration Ltd., a major gas producer. His voice carries not a hint of apology, and his rural Nebraska twang reflects the new, almost seamless North American energy market. "This business has become a continental game. That border is kaput," he added.
For the last decade, low prices depressed the profitability and value of investments in Canada's oil patch. But in a radical turnaround in the first quarter of this year, profits for Canada's six largest oil and gas producers leaped 130-fold, hitting nearly $500 million.
With the oil and gas prices that are posted daily on front pages here expected to remain strong through the winter, North America's energy industry is slowly moving out of the shadow of the dot-com high-technology economy. As investors rediscover that the Western world still moves on oil and gas, takeover frenzy has swept this city of corporate headquarters. In one week alone in April, there were three takeover bids for energy companies here. With the United States' capital markets about 40 times the size of Canada's, the United States is pumping billions of new dollars into Canada's energy industry.
In Alberta, the highest natural gas prices in memory are helping gas dethrone oil as the top fuel for exploration, production and provincial royalty revenue.
While oil is shuttled around the world in ships, natural gas remains a "terrestrial commodity," economically transported by pipeline. A clean-burning fuel that produces less carbon dioxide than coal or oil, natural gas is making Americans look north with new respect.
Increasingly the fuel of choice for heating American homes, natural gas is also the preferred fuel for electricity generation instead of coal and nuclear power. Long bottled up here, Alberta natural gas now flows through four new pipelines into the United States.
"I've been to the end of that pipe, and it's the Brooklyn Navy Yard," said Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier, whose government now earns three times as much from natural gas royalties as from oil.
Referring to a Con Edison gas-fueled electricity generating plant, he added: "Unbeknownst to most New Yorkers, New York is lit up with Alberta natural gas."
Over this decade, American consumption of natural gas is expected to increase by about 50 percent, to 33 trillion cubic feet a year. For electricity generation alone, it is expected to double. The hitch is that American natural gas production has declined by about 5 percent since 1998. To the south, Mexico's state oil company, Pemex, barely satisfies growing local use.
"We are going to be so tight on natural gas this summer that people are going to say, 'What are we going to do?' " said Thomas A. Petrie, a Denver-based investment banker in the energy field. "It's going to create a scramble for gas projects. We are going to look all over the lower 48, but the big projects are going to be in Canada."
Or, as Mr. Anderson put it from his corner office in a steel-and-glass tower here: "We are going to have to drill the pants off this basin. Then, we are going to have to go north."
American demand is growing so steadily that even if Canada's gas exports increase 50 percent this decade, as forecast, Canada will only be pacing American growth. And, even though the number of exploration rigs in Alberta is jumping 50 percent this year, geologists say that, after half a century of pumping from the Rocky Mountain foothills, there is no more low-hanging fruit. The future of North American gas production now lies in Canada's geographic and climactic extremes.
On the east coast, North Atlantic developments off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are turning the Maritime provinces into a major oil and gas producing area. The United States is the sole export market.
The region's first major oil project, Newfoundland's Hibernia, started production in November 1997. This May, Exxon Mobil announced plans to increase production by 30 percent this year, to 65 million barrels a day. The province's second large project, Terra Nova, is to begin production early next year. With four other oil projects in the planning stage, a recent government study increased Newfoundland's offshore oil reserves by almost a third, to 2.1 billion barrels.
Off the coast of Nova Scotia, Sable Offshore Energy Inc., started in January to pump natural gas to New England, is bringing the first piped gas to Maine in a pipeline that goes to Boston. In addition, gas companies are spending $400 million more to explore offshore tracts around the Sable development.
Here in Canada's West, the energy action is moving north.
While Alberta's oil production dropped 6 percent last year, it is expected to rebound in coming years as $25 billion worth of investments in northern Alberta's oil sands starts to pay off. These reserves of thick oil, estimated to rival those of Saudi Arabia in size, were largely untouched. But new technologies, including some that use steam and hot water, now render about 15 percent of the deposits -- five billion barrels -- recoverable at a cost of $10 or less a barrel.
Over this decade, the oil sands portion of Canada's oil production is expected to double, hitting 50 percent by 2005. In Fort McMurray, the northern Alberta epicenter of oil sands mining, there is such a labor shortage that doughnut shops and fast-food shops have had to cut back service until new workers can be brought up from the south.
Oil sands and North Atlantic production will allow Canada to increase its oil exports to the United States by about 50 percent over this decade. With this increase, Canada will probably surpass Venezuela to become the United States' most important source of imported oil. This expansion takes place in an international economy where low oil prices have allowed world oil consumption to double since 1970, approaching 80 million barrels a day by the end of this year.
"Last week, I saw a stretched-out Humvee in New York; the week before I saw a Range Rover without a speck of mud driving around London," said Martin P. Molyneaux, managing director for research at First Energy Capital, an oil and gas brokerage firm based in Calgary. "Consumption per vehicle is high. World consumption keeps going northward."
On the natural gas front, growing American demand and higher prices are pushing Canada's production frontier north of the Arctic Circle. For years, bad economics, local American Indian reluctance, and environmental opposition blocked development of massive reserves in the Mackenzie River delta and Beaufort Sea area. The deposits, some of the largest in the world, were only viable for development when natural gas prices surpassed $2.50 per million British thermal units. But now with North American gas prices hovering around $4, everyone is looking north.
"A year ago, nobody was talking about the far north," said Pierre R. Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. "But now the price has moved substantially, and people are working on it."
Gas developers are drawing maps for multibillion-dollar pipelines, negotiating with local Indians for participation and discussing environmental safeguards.
At stake are the largest known natural gas reserves in North America below the Beaufort Sea. The Mackenzie Delta area is believed to hold nine trillion cubic feet of gas, roughly equal to the gas reserves off the coast of Nova Scotia. To the west of the Mackenzie, Alaska's Prudhoe Bay is believed to hold 25 trillion to 30 trillion cubic feet.
One proposed 5,000-mile pipeline would run from Prudhoe Bay, potentially underwater to minimize environmental impacts, then south along the Mackenzie River into Northern Alberta to connect with pipelines to the United States. Unlike oil, natural gas is easier to pump cold.
This line could carry 3.5 billion cubic feet of American and Canadian gas, a 40 percent jump over Canada's current export level to the United States. This October, when the $3 billion Alliance pipeline opens from here to Chicago, Western Canada will have excess pipeline capacity into the United States.
Energy experts believe consumer pressure will prevail over any environmentalist opposition, and that Canada's Arctic will be opened to gas production by the end of this decade.
"The U.S. and Canadian utilities are running scared now, almost everybody has overestimated supply and underestimated demand," Mr. Molyneaux, the energy analyst, said. He noted that in the last five years 75 percent of new electricity generation in the United States went to natural gas. "If your energy bills go up by 30 percent, you are not going to be happy about it," he added.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Health Care, Where Hope Is Still a Thing With Feathers

BYLINE: By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
In 1947 President Harry S. Truman declared, "All Americans should have the opportunity for universal good health." Congress defeated his health care initiative, which was denounced as "socialism."
In 1993 President Bill Clinton declared, "This health care system of ours is badly broken." He urged Congress, within a year, to produce legislation guaranteeing health care to every citizen. 
 As you may recall, that didn't happen. So now, despite a long run of economic prosperity, about 44 million people in this country have no health insurance, and 38 million more have inadequate coverage.
This situation seems well worth considering, especially in an election year. "Health Care Crisis: Who's at Risk?," a one-hour documentary tonight on PBS, does a clear, thoughtful job of explaining the hows and whys of this confounding problem, if not what exactly to do about it.
The producer Fred Silverman uses a once-classic journalistic style: he surveys academics, doctors, policy experts and ordinary folks to present a helpful overview of a complex matter. There are no re-creations or other efforts at forced drama (though he did bring in Blythe Danner to narrate off camera). In this summer of so-called "reality" shows, it's reassuring to turn to an authentic inquiry into an important subject.
This plain style provides its own kind of drama. "If we had set out to design the worst system that we could imagine, we couldn't have imagined one as bad as we have," says Marcia Angell, a physician and editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.
She's referring to managed care, the system developed in the 1980's to control spiraling health care costs. Health maintenance organizations and insurance companies rather than doctors began to determine the scope of a patient's treatment. "It's an unethical system," Dr. Angell says on the program. "Doctors have to convince themselves this chest X-ray they'd like to get maybe isn't necessary."
We meet Mara Gilbert, a 13-year-old leukemia patient, whose treatment was often jeopardized while her oncologists waited for the required referrals from her primary care physician. Her parents became poor credit risks because their insurance company wasn't paying the hospital bills, even though none of the procedures requiring payment were contested. (Happily, Mara's isn't a tragic example: she appears to be thriving after her treatment.)
Patients covered by programs like Medicare have been caught short. Take the case of the elderly Marine Corps veteran who had a transplant almost 10 years ago. Medicare covered the first year of postoperative medication, and then he was left with an annual bill of $13,000 to $15,000. Without the medicine, his body would be very likely reject its alien heart.
But Mr. Silverman and his team don't simplistically lay all blame on big business or the government. They try to put the travails of uninsured patients into historic and economic context. Experts explain that while technological progress has improved health care, there have not been attendant economic and legislative advances to help pay for new procedures. Also, doctors have tended not to consider whether the benefit of tests justified the costs.
Some general solutions are offered: H.M.O.'s should lower their administrative costs and consider lowering profit margins. The government should devote more money to health care coverage. But it's the devilish details that have stalled reform. Those lay in the hands of the country's leaders. Given the track record there, hope requires a big leap of faith.

HEADLINE: Bert Moore, 65, American Held Hostage in Iran

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Bert C. Moore, who was one of the Americans held hostage in the United States Embassy in Teheran, Iran, died on Thursday at his home in Homosassa, Fla. He was 65.
The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported. 
 Mr. Moore was the administrative consul at the embassy when it was taken over by Iranian students on Nov. 4, 1979.
In the first few days after the embassy was seized, secretaries were subjected to Russian roulette. Guns were held to the heads of Mr. Moore and other embassy officials at various times in their captivity. In one incident, Mr. Moore shouted defiantly, "Go ahead and shoot, you bastards!" His captors held their fire, and later, like dozens of other former hostages, he received the Department of State Award for Valor.
Roughly 90 people were in the embassy when it was taken over after an Islamic revolutionary government had taken power in Iran earlier in 1979. Fifty-two, including Mr. Moore and Moorhead Kennedy, an economic officer, were held captive until Jan. 20, 1981.
"Like all of us, Bert Moore played his role in an important moment in history," Mr. Kennedy said. "Somehow the memory of the hostage crisis never goes away."
For his service, Mr. Moore also received the Christian A. Herter Award for extraordinary contributions to diplomacy and a Presidential Meritorious Award.
Born in Kentucky, he grew up in Ohio and received a bachelor's degree in education from Ohio State University and a master's degree in public administration from Syracuse University.
After teaching history at a high school in Mount Vernon, Ohio, he joined the Foreign Service, serving in Canada, Rhodesia, Malawi, Zaire and France.
He was transferred to Iran in July 1979. In later years he served in Spain, Nigeria, Indonesia and India. He retired in 1990.
Surviving are his wife, Marjorie; three sons, David, Bob, and Charles; a daughter, Diane Wilkie; a brother, Raymond; a half-brother, Roby Watson Jr.; and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries UpAs Investors Seek Safety

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, leaving yields at six-week lows, as the worst decline in the Nasdaq in three weeks sent some investors into the fixed-income market.
Traders said they were also buying Treasuries -- or holding on to the ones they own -- in case reports on retail sales today and consumer prices tomorrow come in below expectations. 
 "People don't want to sell" Treasuries, with stocks falling and traders ambivalent on the reports, said Vinny Verterano, head of Treasury trading at Nomura Securities International.
The 10-year note rose 13/32 , to 103 5/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.06 percent from 6.12 percent on Friday. The 30-year bond rose 9/32 , to 105 11/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.87 percent from 5.89 percent on Friday.
The retail sales report, along with a speech by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to economists in New York, might give insight into the strength of the economy and the outlook for interest rates. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect retail sales to be unchanged in May.
Analysts expect consumer prices to have risen 0.2 percent in May, pushing the annual pace of inflation to 3.2 percent. That would leave the inflation-adjusted yield on the 30-year bond at 2.68 percent.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 3-month and 6-month bills:

HEADLINE: Government Opposes Microsoft's Request for a Stay

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
The Justice Department rebuked Microsoft in a court filing today, saying the company's request for a stay of the trial judge's ruling against it last week was actually a disingenuous attempt "to manipulate the court" and thwart taking the antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court.
A law known as the Expediting Act allows antitrust cases "of general public importance" to be sent directly to the Supreme Court for review, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson says he favors such a step. Last week senior Justice Department officials said they intended to invoke the Expediting Act. 
 But Microsoft wants to take the case to the Court of Appeals, which has issued rulings favorable to Microsoft in the past.
Microsoft called the government filing "extremely bizarre" and said it would lead to unnecessary delay.
"These kinds of stay requests are the normal way appeals are handled, and we don't understand why the Justice Department felt a need to respond in this way," said Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman.
Last Wednesday, Judge Jackson ended the long-running antitrust trial with an order that Microsoft be broken up into two companies. The company was also ordered to comply with a long list of restrictions on its business practices known as conduct remedies. Under Judge Jackson's order, the breakup is automatically stayed until appeals are complete, but the conduct remedies would take effect in October.
Almost immediately, Microsoft filed a motion asking Judge Jackson to stay the entire order, pending appeal. But the company has not filed a notice of an appeal.
The argument revolves around the appeals procedure. Microsoft says it will not file its notice of appeal until Judge Jackson rules on its request for a stay of last week's remedy order. And the government cannot ask the Supreme Court to take the case until the overall appeal is filed.
The Justice Department charged today that Microsoft's real intent was to use Judge Jackson's almost certain rejection of the stay request "so that it can then simultaneously file a lengthy and detailed motion for a stay in the Court of Appeals," confusing the issue while the government is simultaneously trying to take the case to the Supreme Court.
The government is concerned that if the appeals court were already deliberating on a request to stay the conduct remedies, the Supreme Court might be less likely to accept the case. With its brief, the government included a draft version of the motion for certification to the Supreme Court. The draft says the case clearly fits the standard set in the law for direct appeals because "the markets found by the court to be the loci of Microsoft's illegal conduct" are "global markets that affect hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses throughout the world.
"The public interest would be served by a prompt decision that would end uncertainty about the remedy facing Microsoft's employees, stockholders and firms in the technology industry and throughout the economy that do business with it," the government said.
Not surprisingly, the government argued against a stay of the remedy order, saying the ongoing harm to competition from Microsoft is "so substantial and pervasive in a fast-moving sector of the economy," that "the irreparable injury to the public interest is particularly great."
Still, the Justice Department asked Judge Jackson not to rule on the stay request for now but to wait instead for Microsoft's appeal. Then, the government suggests, the judge should certify both requests to the Supreme Court for decisions.
With that, the government gave Judge Jackson a draft scheduling order that would allow briefs and counterbriefs on these issues over the next 10 days.

HEADLINE: Urban Mayors Share the (Not Unwelcome) Burden of Coping With Prosperity

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, June 12

 BODY:
The mayor of New Orleans slammed his fist on the lectern, reaching for a passionate note before more than 300 of his fellow mayors. "We have a crisis in the offing," said the mayor, Marc H. Morial.
The mayor of Long Beach, Calif., Beverly O'Neill, was equally concerned. "This is the No. 1 problem facing our country," Mayor O'Neill said. 
 But it was not drugs, crime or other persistent urban ills that was most troubling to the city leaders gathered for this year's annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors.
Instead, to hear the mayors tell it, urban America's biggest challenge of late is prosperity. Compared with past years, the problems of the city are almost happy problems.
The mayors complained about too many high-skill jobs, and not enough people to fill them; too many well-off people moving back to the city, and not enough houses for all of them, driving up prices for everyone else; and too much demand for parks and serenity, and not enough open space to offer the new city dwellers appalled by sprawl.
Just as the cities now view themselves as solvent, polished and politically fashionable, they find they are no longer shunned by political leaders who used to consider urban concerns a dead end. Four years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, would not even address the mayors when they gathered in Cleveland for their annual meeting.
Today, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who spoke to the mayors by satellite from the family home in Maine, embraced many of their issues, though the overwhelmingly Democratic majority of mayors took issue with him afterward.
Mayors from both parties agree that the nation's big cities, neglected in the era of suburban concerns, are in the catbird seat.
"What's changed is the re-urbanization of America," said Larry Bartley, Republican mayor of Titusville, Fla., and a supporter of Mr. Bush. "More and more Americans are moving back to the cities because they like what's going on there."
As the president of the Conference of Mayors, Wellington Webb of Denver, said, "It's our day in the sun, and it's a very bright day because the old image of the American city is gone."
"Cities used to have a tin cup out begging for money from Washington," Mr. Webb said. "Now half the cities are worried about what they in Washington are going to do to us."
Underscoring the good times were two reports released at the conference, which runs through Tuesday.
One study, the annual state of the cities report issued by the Clinton administration, made a case that urban areas were "enjoying the longest and strongest economic expansion in our history," in the words of Andrew M. Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which released the report today.
The other study put the urban economic boom in a global perspective, ranking 47 American metropolitan areas among the top 100 economies in the world. Chicago's gross product is greater than that of Switzerland, and Providence, R. I., ranks above Vietnam, to cite two cases.
The percentage of American families who own their homes, 67 percent, has never been higher, the study showed. And among urban dwellers, home ownership is also a record, at 51 percent, though still 20 points below the home ownership percentage in the suburbs.
But the mayors saw a darker side in the reports, which note that not all cities are enjoying renewed vigor. The booming urban economies have transformed places that were in a near-triage situation, but have made it harder for the poor and lower middle-class to live in the cities.
The urban boom has driven up home prices at twice the rate of inflation, Mr. Cuomo said. In San Francisco, a city where real estate prices have skyrocketed with the surge in new economy jobs, the school system is planning to build rent-subsidized apartments for public school teachers.
Similarly, Mr. Cuomo said the federal government would have to step up its housing subsidies for the cities that are now pricing out low- and middle-wage job earners.
Governor Bush, repeating several ideas he has proposed on the campaign trail, called for allowing people who now get subsidized rent to use that money for down payments on their homes. He also advocated tax credits for builders who construct houses to sell below market cost in certain neighborhoods.
Democrats criticized Mr. Bush for not offering more to the mayors in the form of direct housing subsidies, and for not going further on gun control. But on other, more general, issues, there was more consensus.
"There's been a big change across the nation," said Gov. Brent Coles of Boise, Idaho, a Republican. "As prosperity has increased, and the cold war disappeared, the issues on the minds of the American people are things like growth, sprawl, parks."
Mr. Bush promised to fully finance a federal program that allocates up to $900 million a year to buy open space near cities, something many Republicans in Congress have been reluctant to do.
He backed increased educational choices, including vouchers and charter schools, as a way to train future workers. And in a nod to the change in the urban pulse, Mr. Bush noted that cities like "Pittsburgh and Cleveland have seen a renaissance."
Coping with prosperity has even become a problem for cities that were slow to turn around. Approaching its 300th anniversary next year, Detroit has reversed the tide of jobs and people out of the city, said its mayor, Dennis Archer. The city's unemployment rate had fallen to 5 percent, from 16 percent in 1994, Mr. Archer said.
Providence, like the high tech centers of Seattle or San Francisco or Austin, Tex., has a shortage of skilled workers, and has seen a sudden spike in housing prices, said the city's mayor, Vincent A. Cianci Jr.
"I've been a mayor in the 70's, 80's and 90's, and it used to be that being a big city mayor meant being a social worker," Mr. Cianci said. "Now mayors are entrepreneurs."
"The exodus of years ago has changed," he said. "It's hip living in the cities. People want to be back."

HEADLINE: Venture Firms, Once Greedy, Now Face Fear;
Nasdaq-Led Reality Check

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 12

 BODY:
When the Nasdaq took a drubbing in April, it drove Jon R. Staenberg to drink, and Mr. Staenberg, a venture capitalist based in Seattle, is taking his colleagues with him.
The beverage is not alcohol, though, but a ginseng-based energy drink. Mr. Staenberg sent a case to executives at all the companies he helps manage with a sobering message: even with technology stocks regaining their footing, start-ups that had hoped to go public quickly or get new private financing should tap their own energy instead. 
 The last several years have been a boom time for venture capitalists. But April's plunge was scary, and instead of taking a flier on just about any plausible idea out there venture capital firms are re-emphasizing grunt work -- shepherding companies through the difficult early stages, refining business models, building value.
"Fear," Mr. Staenberg said, "has replaced greed."
The fear, or reality check, is that traditional economic rules have returned just when many start-ups were acting as if those rules had been suspended. It used to be that growth was all, and profits an expendable luxury.
But with the public markets closed -- at least temporarily -- to many start-ups, venture capitalists are urging executives to plan for a future in which new capital will not appear overnight.
Companies must show clear business models -- and quicker profits. Indeed, between April 14 and last Thursday, 71 companies pulled public offerings, more than double any other two-month period in the previous two years, according to IPO.com, which tracks this market. Dozens of venture firms, including the top-tier firms and investment arms of major financial institutions, have found they must wait indefinitely for returns that seemed so sure months ago.
And as they wait for the window to reopen, venture capitalists are making sure their investments stay alive -- a process that means overseeing cost-cutting, up to and including layoffs.
Linuxcare, a San Francisco consulting company backed by Kleiner Perkins, Caufield & Byers, planned an offering for early March, then for April, but has now put it off indefinitely. On May 3, it laid off 70 of its 270 employees.
Ted E. Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins and chairman of Linuxcare, said the company was in solid shape before the layoffs, but needed to be ready if the markets remained closed.
"We grew the burn rate in anticipation of being a public company," he said, referring to the rate at which the company spent its cash reserves. "If there's a public offering, great. If not, let's plan for it."
But even as venture capitalists shepherd old companies, they continue to finance some promising new ones, too. The reason is that they have billions in their combined coffers to invest, thanks to record-breaking first-quarter fund-raising, according to figures released today by the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Financial Securities Data.
Their study put contributions to 100 venture firms at $12.4 billion, up 85 percent from last year's first quarter. As a result, venture capitalists said they were investing at a slightly slower pace because they were spending time on existing investments.
Warren Packard, a partner in Draper Fisher Jurvestson Associates, said that before April 15, he spent roughly 75 percent of his time working with companies he had already invested in, and 25 percent looking at new ventures; now, it is more like 85 percent and 15 percent.
Venture capitalists are still investing, but at a different pace. Mr. Packard said that while he typically made four investments a year, he might make just three this year.
Like Mr. Schlein, Mr. Packard is working with companies to cut costs, as illustrated by his work with DigitalWork.com, which is based in Chicago and helps small businesses automate tasks like sending out press releases, recruiting employees and building Web sites.
The company had planned to go public on April 14, the day the Nasdaq took its biggest dip. It postponed the offering, and is considering pulling its filing altogether, said its chairman and chief executive, Rob Schultz.
Mr. Schultz said that, meanwhile, he had worked with Mr. Packard and other directors on how to shift gears. The conclusion, he said, was to curtail growth efforts, and seek to be profitable by late 2001, a few quarters ahead of schedule.
He noted that the company had around $30 million in reserves, plenty for now, though he declined to say how fast it was spending that cash.
One suggestion Mr. Packard had was that DigitalWork alter the way it uses its resources. Rather than emphasize signing on new partners, he suggested trying to get more out of existing partnerships, like a deal with Office Depot that features kiosks promoting DigitalWork.
In all, the company has 65 such partnerships, and Mr. Schultz said it would not turn to new partnerships unless the opportunity was "phenomenal."
Mr. Packard said he worked with companies to help them survive longer on existing capital, to see that "Plan A" -- to go public quickly -- may not be a reality.
"All our companies are just dusting off Plan B," he said; he counsels them to delay offerings a year or two. "Instead of a sprint, it's become a marathon."
Similarly, Mr. Staenberg coaches companies to find alternative strategies. He is working with one to find merger partners, and is shopping another as an acquisition candidate.
Matthew Cowan, a principal at Bowman Capital, which makes late-stage, or "mezzanine level," financing in the months just before an offering, said his company was putting new focus on enterprises it had already financed rather than putting its money exclusively in new ventures.
Financiers and industry observers, meanwhile, say the type of new company being sought out is changing -- and was doing so even before April. Business-to-consumer and, to a lesser degree, business-to-business companies are out of favor, while wireless and optical networking technology are in vogue, said Sasha Talebi, research director of VentureOne, a market research firm in San Francisco.
One company that canceled a June offering but is still getting overtures is the Intira Corporation, in Pleasanton, Calif. Intira operates data and network centers for companies on an outsourcing basis, and burns through $9 million a month, said Bernie Schneider, the chief executive.
Mr. Schneider said Intira, already backed by Chase Capital Partners, among others, had been approached by at least two other parties asking if the company "is interested in raising private equity."
"There's probably more money available than at any point in '99," said Mr. Schneider, who hopes to attract $100 million in new cash. "But the market has to be a good one, the business model has to be a good one, and the management is coming under more scrutiny."
VentureOne reports one indication that financing will continue at a healthy pace: despite the market downturn, venture capitalists still have large stores of cash available.
Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, venture capitalists raised $9.8 billion, compared with $4.6 billion for the comparable 1999 period, the firm said, apparently supporting the trend seen in today's figures. Venture capitalists say there are tens of billions of dollars in their coffers they still need to invest, even though they have been investing money within 18 months of raising it, more than twice as fast as they used to.
Whether the amount of available capital will keep growing is a different question. Financiers say they are seeing some slowing.
Mr. Staenberg, who manages roughly $100 million in assets, said that before April 14 he had begun to raise money for a new fund and found the response overwhelmingly positive. But after that, he said, many investors pulled back, leaving him about half what he had anticipated. He declined to disclose the size of the fund.
"People told me, 'I know I said I was going to invest X amount, but would you consider a quarter or a half of that?' " he said. Some investors asked if he would leave room for them to invest more later.
Mr. Staenberg cited two reasons for the pullback: investors do not have as much to invest, and they are reassessing what percent of their assets to allocate to technology-related deals, asking, "Have we gone too far, too fast?"
Similarly, Mr. Packard said the firm recently completed the second stage of fund-raising for a global Internet fund. He said the fund was at $650 million, or 10 to 20 percent less than it might have been.
Venture capitalists, meanwhile, have been investing at a record pace. During the first quarter, financiers at 900 firms, all with at least $20 million under management, poured $17.8 billion into 1,040 start-ups, both record figures, according to VentureOne.
No wonder, given that the returns have been other-worldly in the last year. The US Venture Capital Index, compiled by Cambridge Associates, a Boston market research firm, found that during 1999, American venture firms together had a 279 percent rise in value of their investments. (That represents the value of those investments, some of which remain private, not the actual amount returned to investors.)
The 1999 figure compares with 27 percent in 1998 and 37 percent in 1997, also high by traditional standards.
In fact, Cambridge Associates found that in the late 1980's and early 1990's, annual returns were much humbler, with limited partners experiencing gains of 3.1 percent in 1988, 6.8 percent in 1989, and 2.3 percent in 1990.
Indeed, as many venture capitalists have said all along, their trade has been made to look far easier in recent years than it may prove to be over the long haul. In large part, this is because the public markets no longer embrace every new technology offering without first checking under the hood.
"Companies that previously could expect to have a funding around every six months, now have got to operate under the assumption it might take one and a half or two years," said Mr. Talebi of Venture-One.
"The returns in this business have outweighed the risks," said Sean Foote, a principal in Labrador Ventures, of Redwood City, Calif. "Now the risk has gone way up because there is no place to flip those companies to anymore."

H.M.O.'s Ruled Not Liable In U.S. Court for Some Suits
The Supreme Court spared managed health care from a potentially fatal legal attack, ruling unanimously that the financial incentives that health maintenance organizations give doctors to hold down costs do not make the H.M.O.'s liable to suits in federal court for violating a duty to put their patients first.
The decision leaves such lawsuits in the province of state courts, while at the same time handing back to Congress the issue of patients' rights as a matter of federal policy. The ruling was not likely to be the court's last word, with questions not presented in the case remaining to be resolved. Page A1. 

The Hidden Costs of Stock Options
Stock options have made many Americans wealthy over the last decade, but less understood is how stock options have benefited the companies that offer them, in some cases cutting their tax bills to nearly nothing. But when stocks stop rising, some economists and investors warn, companies and their shareholders will pay a heavy price for something they thought was a free lunch. A1.
 
Stocks Fall on Earnings Worries
Uncertainty about second-quarter earnings helped drag down stock prices. Leading the way was Citrix, which adapts software for computer networks. The company said its earnings would fall short of expectations, and its shares fell $18.9375, to $22.25. The Nasdaq composite index fell 106.93 points, or 2.8 percent, to 3,767.91, its biggest loss since May 23. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 49.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,564.21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 10.95 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,446. C12.
 
The Nasdaq stock market plans to announce this morning that it will offer investors a new way to trade New York Stock Exchange-listed securities off the floor of the Big Board. C12.
 
Credit Card Antitrust Trial Begins
Government antitrust officials began efforts to prove in court that Visa and MasterCard, the world's two biggest credit-card networks, limit competition with each other and their rivals to the detriment of consumers. C11.
 
A $1 Billion State Farm Dividend
State Farm, the largest car insurer, said it was giving customers an unexpected dividend of just more than $1 billion because of better-than-expected earnings in 1999. But State Farm's after-tax profits were actually greater in 1998, and it paid no dividend on those results, leading analysts to wonder if it was an effort to counter market share erosion. C26.
 
More Executive Changes at G.E.
General Electric announced another round of promotions in preparation for the retirement next April of its chairman, John F. Welch Jr. The company named Ronald R. Pressman, left, to be chief executive of the GE Employers Reinsurance Corporation and be a senior vice president. John Krenicki Jr. moved up to chief executive of GE Transportation Systems and Tanya D. Fratto became vice president of GE Superabrasives. C2.
 
Justice Rebukes Microsoft Request
The Justice Department rebuked Microsoft in a court filing, saying the company's request for a stay of the trial judge's ruling against it was actually a disingenuous attempt "to manipulate the court" and thwart taking the antitrust case directly to the Supreme Court. C2.
 
London Diamond Listing Is Halted
Oryx Natural Resources, a diamond-mining company with ties to the governments of Congo and Zimbabwe, was forced to shelve plans to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange less than 24 hours before the stock was to begin trading. It was not clear when -- or even if -- the company would be able to restart its planned stock offering. C4.

BYLINE: By Terence Neilan

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
MONTENEGRO: SPLIT VICTORY -- Both the government and the pro-Serbian opposition were able to claim victory in local elections. President Milo Djukanovic, left, welcomed the government coalition's win in the capital, Podgorica, as proof that "Montenegro is marching on a stable, democratic, reformist path." But the pro-Belgrade opposition, led by the Yugoslav prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, won in the town of Herceg Novi in a show of support for President Slobodan Milosevic. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: FOX HUNTING BILL -- The Government announced that it would make legislation prohibiting fox hunting with hounds a government priority in Parliament, where surveys show widespread opposition to the practice. The action, permitting a free vote on a series of options ranging from no ban to a full ban, guarantees passage by the House of Commons and will help the bill overcome expected opposition in the House of Lords. The bill will be introduced this fall. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: CHARLES SKIPS A TOWN -- Prince Charles visited Northern Ireland but did not carry out a planned engagement in Londonderry because of a continuing inquiry into the 1972 "Bloody Sunday" massacre in which 14 people were shot dead by members of the parachute regiment of which he is colonel in chief.
 Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
IRELAND: CORRUPTION ATTACK -- President Mary McAleese criticized the culture of corruption that she said was jeopardizing Ireland's prosperity, and said corruption investigations among politicians were revealing the "sordid side of the country's secret life." Ms. McAleese, whose role is largely ceremonial and diplomatic, said failed leadership had "contaminated the wells of hope that we draw from." Brian Lavery (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: PROTESTS IN CALGARY -- In downtown Calgary, 200 people peacefully protested the World Petroleum Congress, which had just opened in Canada's energy capital, drawing almost 3,000 delegates from 95 countries. On Sunday about 1,500 people demonstrated, also peacefully, against global warming and sport utility vehicles as well. James Brooke (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: BARAK TALKS CONTINUE -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak continued to negotiate with political parties to reconstitute his government. He did not follow up on a threat to dismiss ministers who voted against the government for early elections, and they did not quit as threatened. In the midst of the talks, Shas Party ministers charged that other ministers who portrayed them as extortionist for demanding more money for their indebted school system were using "Nazi techniques." That caused a storm. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: DIAMOND BAN -- The Israel Diamond Exchange said it would expel any member who "knowingly trades" in diamonds from rebel movements in Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo. The exchange, in Ramat Gan, outside Tel Aviv, supervises the importation and re-exportation of diamonds, Israel's largest foreign trade item. Expulsion would ban a diamond trader from conducting business in Israel and in 23 other recognized diamond exchanges around the world, the organization said. William. A. Orme Jr. (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: SWITCHING PRESSES -- With striking printers shutting its presses near Tel Aviv, the daily Yediot Ahronot has been publishing sections of the paper in the Palestinian-ruled West Bank, a rival newspaper, Haaretz, reported. The paper is said to be using presses in Ramallah owned by Al Iyam, a Palestinian daily close to Yasir Arafat. William A. Orme Jr. (NYT)
 
IRAN: REFORMISTS AND PRESS -- In a bid to fulfill promises that helped them win parliamentary elections, more than 100 reformist legislators have drafted a bill calling for lifting curbs on the news media imposed by their predecessors, a journalist and leading reformist lawmaker said. Rajabali Mazrouie added that no date had been set for introducing the bill, which would be the reformists' first legislative sign of change. (AP)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
AMERICAN'S PALESTINIAN ROLE -- An American with nearly two decades of experience with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees has been named appointed director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an organization that provides education and health care for 3.6 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza. Karen Koning AbuZayd, who has most recently directed refugee work in the United States and the Caribbean, will be based in Gaza. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
POVERTY AMONG THE RICH -- Unicef says in a new report that nearly one in six children in the world's richest nations lives in poverty. Britain, Italy, the United States and Mexico ranked at the bottom of the 29 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, when "relative" poverty was measured, defined as households earning below 50 percent of the national median income. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: PRESIDENTIAL APOLOGY -- President Olusegun Obasanjo apologized for not consulting widely on sharp increases in gasoline prices on June 1 that have plunged Nigeria into a general strike. The government appeared desperate to end the strike, and analysts saw the dramatic apology as preparing Nigerians for a reversal of the widely unpopular increases, a result of the ending of government subsidies. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
INDONESIA: NEW CLASHES KILL 8 -- At least eight people, including two police officers, were killed in new Muslim-Christian fighting in the eastern province of Maluku, officials and witnesses said. In the provincial capital of Ambon, an official at the main mosque said four Muslims were killed in a clash with a Christian gang at Hative Kecil, a village near the city. Witnesses said two Christians also died. (AP)

HEADLINE: The Two Koreas, Talking

 BODY:
This week's meetings between South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, mark an encouraging change in the relationship between the two Koreas. In the 55 years since the Korean Peninsula was divided after World War II, the North has directed invasion, infiltration and terrorism against the South and both sides have employed vitriolic propaganda against each other. Now, for the first time, the top leaders on each side are getting together to discuss mutual concerns like economic cooperation and family reunification.
Never before have North and South Korea come this close to a normal, peaceful relationship. What has pushed them this far is a combination of severe economic and social strains in the North, including serious famine and energy shortages, and a new recognition by the South that its own security would be endangered by a sudden breakdown of authority in North Korea. That understanding has inspired President Kim Dae Jung's policy of actively engaging the North, an approach the Clinton administration has wisely supported. 
 Unfortunately, North Korea's government remains one of the world's most opaque and unpredictable. Expectations for specific agreements coming out of the meetings should not be set too high.
South Korea's main goals in these talks, which are scheduled to run through Thursday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, include reaching agreement on additional high-level meetings, expanding economic exchanges and arranging for the reunification of millions of families divided since the Korean War. Many of these separated relatives are now elderly, adding some urgency to resolving this issue. South Korea will also bring up military and security issues of concern to the United States. The North must continue living up to its agreements with Washington to freeze its nuclear weapons program and to suspend all testing of long-range missiles.
North Korea has recently been seeking to broaden its diplomatic contacts around the world. It has worked to upgrade its relations with Europe and Japan as well as South Korea and the United States. Last month Kim Jong Il met China's leaders in Beijing. Next month Vladimir Putin is scheduled to become the first top Russian leader ever to visit Pyongyang.
North Korea's development of long-range missiles, coupled with its diplomatic aloofness and unpredictable behavior, was the leading reason behind the Clinton administration's efforts to develop defensive technologies capable of protecting the United States from a limited missile attack. Those concerns remain valid. But as North Korea begins to reach out from its self-imposed isolation, there are grounds for hoping that one day it may no longer need to be treated as a dangerous rogue state.

World oil prices surged to more than $31 a barrel today, the highest level in three months, on growing uncertainty whether OPEC ministers will decide to increase production at their next meeting in nine days.
Oil prices are significantly higher now than they were in late March, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls nearly half of the global oil supply, decided to raise its official production limit by about 1.7 million barrels a day, or 7 percent. 
 That increase, reached only after Iran angrily but unsuccessfully rebelled, was supposed to bring modest relief to gasoline consumers. But as the summer driving season begins, the production increase has been more than offset by rising demand and depleted gasoline inventories in the United States, the world's largest consumer of oil and one of the biggest importers of foreign oil.
Motorists in the United States are already paying the highest prices in a decade for gasoline. Last week, the United States Energy Department predicted that gasoline prices would average $1.50 a gallon this summer, though declining as the vacation season wound down. But in some areas, motorists are already paying more than $2 a gallon, and the possibility that OPEC production might not rise has caused new concern among large oil-importing nations about the overall prospects for easing gasoline prices.
From the importers' view, the most pessimistic piece of information about OPEC's intentions came late last week, when the 11-nation group did not invoke a production increase that was meant to happen automatically once the 20-day average for oil prices exceeded $28 a barrel.
That leaves OPEC leaders once again divided along almost exactly the same lines now as they were three months ago.
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer, wants to increase production and bring prices down. More aggressive members like Iran and Algeria want to keep prices high.
"Effectively, what is going on now is the politics of OPEC, and really it is quite traditional politics," said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, an oil-business consulting company.
Even with a fresh Saudi warning today that oil prices are too high, traders bid up the price of the benchmark grades of crude to the highest since OPEC's last meeting in March. In London, Brent crude rose $1.63 a barrel, or 5 percent, to $31.21. In New York, light sweet crude rose $1.54 a barrel, or 5.1 percent, to $31.74.
At least for the moment, the United States Government is keeping a low profile. It has not issued any statements urging OPEC members to reach a particular decision, in contrast to the highly public lobbying campaign waged three months ago by the secretary of energy, Bill Richardson.
As so often in the past, oil prices and the internal workings of OPEC have confounded forecasters and oil traders for the last few months.
At OPEC's tumultuous last meeting, Saudi officials managed to push through a modest rise in production.
In what was seen primarily as a form of insurance if prices started to fall too quickly, OPEC ministers also agreed on automatic changes, up or down, of 500,000 barrels a day if oil prices moved outside a band of $22 to $28 per barrel.
Two weeks ago, when the 20-day average price was nearing the upper limit of that range, OPEC's president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, announced that the cartel would probably invoke a production increase. But OPEC delegates later decided to postpone a decision until their June 21 meeting. On Sunday, OPEC's secretary general, Rilwanu Lukman, said the automatic price change "was always an informal plan," and that the group would probably make no decisions before its meeting next week in Vienna.
Industry analysts say Saudi officials were never comfortable with an automatic mechanism, because they feared losing their grip.
Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, predicted that OPEC would have to increase production to bring prices down to a more stable level. But some Saudi officials evidently believe that the increase might need to be more than 500,000 barrels a day. By allowing the automatic increase to take effect, analysts said, Saudi officials would be in a weak political position to argue the need for additional production increases.
Meanwhile, other cartel members are lobbying against deciding on any increase until at least September. The Dow Jones news agency quoted Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, as saying that OPEC is unlikely to raise output either before or at the Vienna meeting.
Mr. Khelil added that OPEC probably would raise output by 1.2 million barrels in September. But traders reacted by pushing prices up, because the comments suggested little quick relief for replenishing the dwindling crude-oil supplies available to refiners.
"Inventories are very low and the market is indeed very tight,"said Gary N. Ross, head of PIRA Energy, an industry research firm in New York. Mr. Ross was one of many forecasters who had predicted that prices would drop to about $24 a barrel. "I admit it," he acknowledged, "the expected buildup in stocks during the second quarter was less than we expected."
Even if OPEC does decide to increase production next week, consumers may not notice the impact for weeks or months. The Middle Eastern Economic Survey, a respected industry publication, reported today that member countries exceeded their official quotas in May by about 588,000 barrels a day. Iraq, which is an OPEC member but is not subject to the quotas, increased its production by 400,000 barrels as well.

Gasoline Prices Soar
By The Associated Press
Federal officials met for two hours with refiners yesterday, and the Environmental Protection Agency's top air pollution official said he heard no good explanation for soaring gasoline prices in Midwest cities where new requirements require cleaner-burning gas.
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department said field inspectors were sent to the Milwaukee and Chicago areas to investigate price increases in recent weeks of 30 to 50 cents a gallon. They focused on both refining and distribution, one official said.
At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, said the Midwest "price hikes seem to be out of whack," and added that any evidence of price-gouging investigators found would be turned over to the Federal Trade Commission for further investigation.
Officials from eight major oil refineries sat in on the E.P.A. and Energy Department meeting, and further sessions were held later with individual companies.

HEADLINE: Hidden Costs of Stock Options May Soon Come Back to Haunt

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Microsoft and Cisco Systems, two of the nation's most profitable companies, are well on their way to owing nothing in federal income taxes on the money they have made so far this year.
How can powerful companies like these, reporting billions in income to shareholders, owe nothing in taxes? It is all thanks to the wonder of employee stock options. 
 Stock options have made many Americans wealthy beyond their wildest dreams over the last decade. Less understood is how much stock options have benefited the companies that offer them. But when stock prices stop rising, some economists and investors warn, companies and their shareholders will find themselves paying a heavy price for something they thought was a free lunch.
Consider how options help eliminate a company's income tax bill. Under I.R.S. rules, employees pay income taxes on the gain they receive when they exercise their options, even if the gain is only on paper. When they exercise their options, their company receives a tax deduction equal to the gain.
With the stock markets soaring and many employees cashing in, the taxes the employees pay on their gains have meant deductions that greatly reduce and in some cases even wipe out some companies' current tax bills. This does not mean the federal government is reaping less in taxes. It simply means that the tax burden has shifted from corporations to individuals, most of whom willingly pay because the taxes are so much less than the gains.
Microsoft's options-related tax deduction of roughly $11.4 billion in the first nine months of this fiscal year, for example, exceeds the $10.6 billion in pretax income that the company reported to shareholders. That saves the company $4 billion in taxes. So while Microsoft may escape taxes this year, its employees will presumably pay tax on that $11.4 billion at ordinary rates.
Tax breaks are not the only benefit to corporations. Options can also significantly cut companies' labor costs as employees, eager to get rich off their options, demand less in cash compensation. Lower labor costs. Lower taxes. What more could a company ask?
"Stock options have become as American as motherhood and apple pie," said Patrick S. McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, an investment advisory firm in Rockville, Md. "It has all been fueled by this notion that options have no cost and that there is an unlimited supply of them. It's like the government and its printing press. But ultimately the market is going to suffer. The day of reckoning will come."
When that day comes is, of course, unclear. But when stocks stop soaring -- and many have done so this year -- the equation upon which option mania is based changes. Employees exercise fewer options and companies' tax bills will rise. And as worried employees begin to demand more of their compensation in cash, companies' labor costs rise.
Desperate to appease employees, many companies will issue even more options. After Microsoft's stock tumbled on the prospect of a breakup by the government, the company issued $1.9 billion in new options in April to supplement those issued last year that are worthless. This comes on top of the $69 billion in outstanding Microsoft stock options as of last June.
Trouble is, the more options there are, the less valuable the stock becomes.
Options carry significant costs. One is that companies must buy back millions of their own shares to offset the stock they have dispensed to employees at much lower prices in option programs. If they do not repurchase stock, there will be so many shares on the market that the company's earnings, on a per-share basis, will plunge. This is known as dilution.
In the last three years, for example, Dell Computer has bought back $3.6 billion worth of stock to reduce share dilution. In the period, Dell's net income totaled a little over $4 billion. The money Dell put into buybacks might have gone into research and development.
Dell is not alone in stock repurchases. A 1999 study by J. Nellie Liang and Steven A. Sharpe, researchers at the Federal Reserve Board, found that in 1998 the 140 largest nonfinancial companies in the United States expended 40 percent of their earnings to buy back shares, up from 17 percent of earnings used to do so in 1994. The study noted that large companies have borrowed money or run down financial assets to finance repurchases.
The upside of stock options has been well-chronicled in recent years. They allow cash-poor start-up companies to attract talented employees and help established companies keep the workers they have. And options reward hard-working employees and give them the benefit of ownership in their enterprise.
All to the good. But corporate America has played down the costs associated with options. As a result, what began as a dalliance threatens to become an addiction.
The number of employees receiving stock options in the United States has grown to as many as 10 million from about one million in the early 1990's, according to the National Center for Employee Ownership. About one-third of companies have programs offering options to lower-level workers as well as executives, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in New York. Last year, 200 of the nation's largest companies granted equity incentives -- mostly options -- to employees that represented 2 percent of the companies' shares outstanding, on average, the firm said. Ten years earlier, the so-called grant rate was about half that.
Now that many share prices are falling, options will harm the value of a company's shares even more than they did when stocks were higher, Mr. McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services said. That is because executives' option grants are typically based on a dollar figure, say $2 million, rather than on a number of shares. A falling stock price means more shares dispensed to the executive in an option grant.
As managers' compensation has depended more on stock options, keeping the share price rising -- and options in the money -- has become paramount. Walter P. Schuetze, former chief accountant for the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says the prevalence of accounting gimmickry at many American companies is in part a result of the increasing popularity of options.
"The amount of management compensation tied to the stock price is huge," Mr. Schuetze said. "And it is driving corporate managers to make their numbers so the compensation gets even larger."
An academic study by David Aboody, assistant professor of accounting at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Ron Kasznik, associate professor at Stanford University's business school, found that executives manage the disclosures of corporate news to increase the value of their options. The study will be published in the Journal of Accounting and Economics.
Studying option grants made between 1992 and 1996 at 1,264 public companies that make awards on fixed schedules, Professors Aboody and Kasznik found that companies had significantly lower returns in the period before the award than in the period immediately after it. This confirmed to the professors that executives delayed announcing good news until after the award dates and rushed out with bad news before the options were awarded.
"Such a disclosure strategy," the professors wrote, "ensures that decreases in the firm's stock price related to the arrival of bad news occur before, rather than after, the award date, while stock price increases related to the arrival of good news occur after, rather than before, the award."
Indeed, stock options have become so crucial to executives today that some economists say if stock prices tumble, managements interested in maximizing the value of their compensation plans would have an even greater interest in driving down their stocks' prices to guarantee future gains on options issued at rock-bottom levels.
Andrew Smithers, founder and economist at Smithers & Company, an investment advisory firm in London and the co-author with Stephen Wright of "Valuing Wall Street: Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Markets," said: "If the market were to fall, the interests of management would cease to be driving up the stock price. It would be driving it down so the next round of options are at a lower price."
Even now, some companies' option grants are at odds with shareholder interests. A 1999 study of 900 companies by Ira Kay, a practice partner at the Watson Wyatt Worldwide consulting firm, found that companies with the greatest percentage of shares outstanding represented by unexercised options produced lower returns to shareholders than those with a smaller percentage of option grants hanging over them.
While Mr. Kay said that many companies produce good returns for shareholders in spite of the so-called option overhang, he added, "It's a scarce and very valuable resource that needs to be optimally allocated by the board of directors."
If the use of options were limited to a handful of companies, the overall market impact would not be great. But many companies have joined the option game recognizing that they are at a disadvantage to companies spreading the option wealth.
Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation, has for years refused to make options a part of the company's executive compensation plan because of their future costs to shareholders. Last year, however, he succumbed to the pressure and now hands out a tiny portion of options to managers. "I'm against options and we haven't had options at Loews in 25 or 30 years," Mr. Tisch said. "But it was a problem with some executives. Whether we needed it or didn't need it, we thought we needed it."
One of the biggest arguments for options is that they help companies retain good workers and provide an incentive for employees to increase their productivity. John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft, said: "We very much continue to believe strongly in the direct linkage to our employees being shareholders and creating long-term shareholder value. Both shareholders and employees would look at this program as being an integral part of the success of our company."
Microsoft said it was impossible to predict what its tax bill would be in 2000 since the year is not yet over. The company confirmed that its options-related tax deduction exceeded its taxable income as reported to shareholders so far this year, but said that there were many different elements that go into figuring the company's taxes that are not available to the public. Microsoft declined to make its tax returns available.
Mr. Connors acknowledged that his company's happy experience with stock options had come in a bull market. It remains to be seen, he said, whether options will keep employees happy if their company's stock price falls.
For the moment, options maintain their allure. Even Washington is convinced that they are good for all. Rather than fretting about the decline in corporate tax receipts, some lawmakers want to give employees a tax break as well.
John Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee on employer-employee relations, has written legislation that would create a new "superstock option." It would allow employees to pay taxes on the options at capital gains rates rather than higher ordinary income rates. The new options would still provide a tax deduction for the companies issuing them. This would almost certainly reduce Treasury receipts.
Mr. Boehner said the legislation would help workers "share in the tremendous growth of today's economy in a way that benefits them, their employers and the entire economy." To qualify for the tax treatment, companies would have to offer options to at least half of their employees. Democrats on the subcommittee are hardly objecting -- they are just insisting that companies make them available to 90 percent or more of employees to qualify.
But the cost of making options more attractive than they already are is high. "If you believe in the free market system you have to have a scorecard that works," said Bill Parish, a former accountant and auditor who is an independent investment adviser in Portland, Ore. "The scorecard has been completely corrupted and the biggest way it has been corrupted is through the issuance of watered stock. And the average person doesn't know about it."

HEADLINE: Seoul Leader Lands in North for Meeting

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, June 13

 BODY:
Nearly 50 years to the week since the Korean War began, the leaders of North and South Korea met this morning for a first-ever series of talks.
With thousands of official greeters cheering his arrival in the North's capital, Pyongyang, President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea descended from a plane and was welcomed by the North Korean president, Kim Jong Il. 
 They shook hands at length, and then walked together along a red carpet to review a military honor guard. The two men smiled and chatted as they walked to the visiting president's limousine, while the crowd chanted the name of Kim Jung Il, and ocassionally the name of Kim Dae Jung.
In a surprise, the two men rode together in Kim Dae Jung's limousine, brought especially from South Korea, to the state guest house, where the visiting head of state will be staying.
 South Korean officials said they were delighted by the North Korean president's presence at the airport.
"It was something we were not expecting at all," said one government official in Seoul. "It is a very good sign."
He said the two presidents would go immediately into meetings together. Their schedule for the three-day summit meeting has been kept secret. It is known, however, that the two leaders intended to meet alone at least twice.
Before setting off from Seoul, Kim Dae Jung said the entire world was "welcoming and blessing this trip." He promised to listen clearly in order "to broaden understanding between North and South Korea."
Then he asked his nation to "please pray for me and wish for me a safe return."
The departure speech captured the sense of hope that surrounds this trip, as well as the deep uncertainties of dealing with North Korea, one of the world's most secretive and unpredictable nations.
Thirty years ago, a northern commando raid penetrated Seoul in a failed bid to assassinate the president, Park Chung Hee. And just last year, North and South Korea fought a fierce naval skirmish in the Yellow Sea that began over fishing rights and briefly threatened to explode into a full-blown war.
The Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, left millions of people dead, injured or missing, including Americans and Chinese. To this date, 37,000 Americans troops are deployed along the border.
President Kim, who for many years was an outcast and a dissident, was imprisoned in South Korea and was even sentenced to death. But he was elected president and reached out to the North in his inaugural speech in February 1998, when he made a ringing call for an end to the cold war on the peninsula.
Of late, his counterpart in the North has been taking steps to end its isolation, seeking to make or restore diplomatic relations with countries in the region and elsewhere.
In an apt symbol of the divide between the two countries -- one an economically fragile Communist dynasty, the other a capitalist power and vibrant democracy -- Mr. Kim's jet took a long detour over the Yellow Sea rather than fly over the world's most heavily armed border.
For most of the last two years, even as it suffered through diplomatic isolation, economic collapse and a widespread famine, the North's propaganda continued to scorn Mr. Kim, and his so-called Sunshine Policy toward Pyongyang, treating him as a puppet of the United States.
But since Mr. Kim gave a speech in Berlin in March, pledging a huge commitment of resources from the relatively rich South to help rebuild the impoverished North, relations between the two countries began their dramatic shift.
The Berlin speech coincided with surprising changes in North Korea's ties with the rest of the world, as the reclusive Kim Jong Il began some bold diplomatic moves.
"This all began with our president's inauguration," said Kim Myong Shik, a spokesman for the South's government. "Then came Berlin, and the North's opening. Now we have a summit. Don't think it will stop here."
While the two neighbors are largely responsible for this turnabout, both have been supported by their main allies, which are eager for peace but anxious to see their interests protected.
Traveling outside North Korea for the first time since succeeding his father as leader in 1994, Kim Jong Il entered Beijing secretly by special train earlier this month, reaffirming the relationship between the two Communist countries, which fought together against American and southern troops in the Korean War.
At practically the same time, the southern leader met in Tokyo with President Clinton and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan.
The United States and Japan are pushing for North Korea to end suspected programs to develop nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. Japan was shocked in 1998 by a surprise test-firing of a North Korean missile that flew over its main island of Honshu, and it and suspended aid and diplomatic contacts with Pyongyang for two years.
The Korean missile program has been the main threat used in Washington to justify the proposed development of a $60 billion antimissile shield.
As a result of a carrot-and-stick effort by Washington conceived by a former defense secretary, William Perry, Pyongyang has suspended any firing of long-range ballistic missiles for the last year.
Meanwhile, for security reasons, Pyongyang has remained all but sealed. Visiting business people and tourist groups were banned weeks ago, and even accredited diplomats caught outside of the country during the preparations had to postpone their return.
The contrast with Seoul could not be more evident. Here, the meeting has been the occasion for mass prayer sessions and parties alike, neither of which the tightly controlled and economically devastated North is particularly known for.
North Korea, which rarely allows foreign journalists into the country anyway, has rejected all requests to cover the meetings except for 50 South Korean journalists who were allowed after protracted negotiations to visit.
Other journalists are following the events from the official press center, at a hotel in Seoul, where wall-to-ceiling television screens are broadcasting live footage from Pyongyang.
Many South Koreans say their most immediate hope is for a reunification of the 1.8 million people whose families were split up by the war.
A close second is a reduction of military tensions on the peninsula, where both sides maintain huge armies, and North Korea has been testing ballistic missiles and is suspected of developing weapons of mass destruction, from nuclear warheads to chemical weapons.
"People don't talk about war like they did when I was a child," said Park Kil Tae, a department store employee. "But every now and then, you stop to think that Seoul could be destroyed in minutes."
Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea specialist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said: "All of the major players at the moment perceive their interests in immediate terms: wanting to have more stability on the peninsula, and kicking problems down the road. The United States, South Korea and Japan are all very vested in the Perry process, which is actually a kind of American version of President Kim's Sunshine Policy."
So far, Mr. Eberstadt added, China has benefited most from the detente. "China has a divided Korea, with two governments both vying for Beijing's affection," he said. "And all of the Pacific powers are soliciting China's cooperation over North Korea, including Washington."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE BUDGET ISSUE;
Bush and Gore Revise Plans To Match a Growing Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12

 BODY:
Projections of the federal budget surplus are likely to be revised upward by as much as $1 trillion in coming weeks, leading Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to prepare differing claims to the windfall.
For Mr. Gore, more money means new initiatives to encourage savings and improve education, health care and environmental protection, as well as to speed his plan to reduce the national debt, his aides said. 
 For Mr. Bush, it is a chance to assert that his plans for a big tax cut, the creation of private investment accounts within Social Security and a national missile defense program are not only affordable but would also leave plenty of money for additional debt reduction, his aides said.
Analysts in both parties and private economists said they expected the Congressional Budget Office and the White House's Office of Management and Budget to raise their 10-year surplus projections soon by at least $500 billion, with some estimates running as high as $1 trillion. Most of the increase is expected to come from the non-Social-Security segment of the budget, the part that is up for grabs in political terms.
Depending on what assumptions are made about the path of government spending, current estimates of the surplus outside of the Social Security program range from $750 billion over the next decade to nearly $2 trillion. Social Security is projected to run a surplus of another $2.3 trillion in that time, and the two parties have agreed to use that money to reduce the national debt.
Should the new surplus estimates match expectations, they would continue a trend in which projections of the nation's fiscal condition have grown increasingly bright over the last several years, giving both parties a chance to press for their priorities after decades when deficits constrained policy proposals.
The Congressional Budget Office is preparing to release its updated surplus projections as early as the end of the month, although the release could be delayed until mid-July. The White House has not disclosed when it will release its new budget outlook, though it is expected to be in the next month. But both presidential campaigns are already preparing to use the new numbers to highlight their differences over how best to sustain and take advantage of the nation's prosperity.
Mr. Gore will begin setting out his ideas in a speech in New York on Tuesday, the kickoff to a campaign swing in which he plans to emphasize that fiscal prudence has played a major role in bringing the economy to where it is today, his aides said.
Mr. Gore will continue to emphasize debt reduction. But with the surplus growing, he intends to make a case that spending more on education, health care and the environment is a vital element of any plan to invest in the nation's future. And he will offer some modest tax cuts of his own, including a program, still under development, that would give tax breaks to people with low and moderate incomes to encourage higher rates of savings.
"This election is going to revolve around the fundamental question of how do we responsibly use our budget prosperity," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman.
"Do we use it as a foundation to reach for the stars by addressing issues like Social Security, Medicare, education, the environment and health care?" Mr. Lehane said. "Or do we squander it on a tax cut for the wealthy, a trillion dollar Social Security privatization plan and an enormous Star Wars defense system?"
Mr. Bush's aides said their calculations also suggested a big upward revision in the surplus, but they said they would not offer any new programs or tax cuts. Rather, they said, they would use any additional surplus to help reduce the national debt or to help pay for a transition to a system of personal investment accounts within Social Security.
"If voters have a choice between a Democrat and a Republican in Washington when the money comes in, they can be more confident that the money will go to debt reduction under Bush, because the history of the Democrats is that they will spend it," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman.
Advisers to Mr. Bush said the new numbers would insulate them against Mr. Gore's persistent attacks on the Republican as fiscally irresponsible. They said that Mr. Bush's plans could be paid for even within the budget forecasts the campaign has been using for the last month, and that there was no question they would be affordable under the coming projections.
"This would alleviate any and all concern that the tax plan did not fit within the budget and did not leave substantial room for a comprehensive package that would include Social Security reform," said John F. Cogan, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University who advises Mr. Bush.
The surplus projections are likely to rise for several reasons. The economy has grown faster than projected this year, meaning that gross domestic product will be bigger than anticipated in coming years, so that even steady rates of taxation will generate bigger than projected revenues. And the economy has been growing at a healthy rate with low inflation and strong productivity growth for so long that budget estimators are beginning to incorporate slightly more optimistic economic assumptions into their outlook. The stronger the outlook, the higher the tax revenues and the bigger the surplus.
There is some risk to any surplus projection from a steep economic downturn or a plunge in the stock market, the source of much of the recent surge in tax revenues. But even taking those risks into account, analysts say the surplus is likely to remain large for years to come. Economists at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York concluded recently that "massive surpluses and retirement of Treasury debt are 'baked in the cake' almost no matter what the economy does over the next 10 years."
This presidential election is the first since the 1960's in which voters are contending with neither the memory of a recent recession nor the restrictions imposed by large budget deficits. The candidates and their parties -- and probably the voters -- are still catching up to the politics of prosperity, and a large increase in the surplus projection would no doubt hold political opportunities and pitfalls for both sides.
While Mr. Gore has worked hard to position himself as the guardian of the strong economy and the candidate of fiscal responsibility, any shift he makes toward new spending programs will leave him vulnerable to attacks by Mr. Bush as a traditional Democratic big spender.
Yet Mr. Gore's aides are convinced that using the nation's moment of robust fiscal health to deal with problems other than the debt is justified on policy grounds and politically popular as well. If Mr. Bush tries to argue against steps to improve education, clean up the water and air, protect open spaces and improve access to health care, he will be right where Mr. Gore wants him, one adviser to the vice president said today.
To the degree that the new numbers make his plans look affordable, Mr. Bush has much to gain. But the revisions could make it more difficult for him to argue that the federal government needs to shrink in size and influence, one of the ideological cornerstones of his campaign.

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
It was shortly before midnight on the eve of 2000, and Timothy Fitzgerald Stevenson Cobb was savoring the moment. Debonair as always in a white dinner jacket, sipping from a glass of the 1990 Krug Champagne he had selected for the party, he was in Miami Beach, surrounded by the friends and relatives he was putting up for the weekend, waiting for the fireworks to start.
He had much to celebrate. Like the dashing hero in "The Thomas Crown Affair," a recent Hollywood remake that had quickly entered his movie pantheon, Mr. Cobb had pulled off something of a coup. 
 Over two sleep-deprived years, he and his partner, Jeff Levy, had built an Internet research company in Atlanta that ultimately captured half of a fast-growing market. Then came a merger with their only rival and the payoff: a public stock offering. By the end of trading on May 7, 1999, each man's net worth had swelled by about $25 million.
In the booming Internet economy, their windfall was by no means the most spectacular. But it conferred an uncommon distinction on Mr. Cobb: he became one of the country's few black Internet millionaires, joining an elite group of blacks in the upper reaches of American industry.
It also happened to be Mr. Cobb's 35th birthday that balmy night at the Art Deco-style National Hotel in South Beach, and when the clock struck 12, there were hugs all around. Mr. Cobb remembers in particular a warm embrace with Mr. Levy. It reminded him, he recalled later, of how strong their bond had been. They had shared a single-minded drive to succeed, often reading each other's thoughts and finishing each other's sentences. To Mr. Cobb, Jeff Levy, 37 -- one of the few white people in the room on New Year's Eve -- understood his satisfaction in a way that probably no one else could.
Yet Mr. Cobb also recalled a creeping uneasiness that weekend. It showed in his oversleeping the day before, a rare lapse for someone who took pride in never having to set an alarm. And it showed in what he described as one of his worst rounds of golf ever.
One reason for his distraction was his shifting fortunes. Shortly after the merger, Mr. Levy and Mr. Cobb went off to start separate Internet ventures. Mr. Levy's was doing fine. Not so Mr. Cobb's.
Another reason was the racial mantle Mr. Cobb bore: the black success story in a white world. He calls it both a source of pride and an enduring burden. For all he and Mr. Levy lived through together, in this he was alone.
The racial backdrop to Mr. Cobb's accomplishments went largely unmentioned by the people he did business with, but he seemed never to forget it. When things were good, being black made them better; when things were not so good, it made them worse.
Not that he dwelled on it, he insisted. To wonder how race might have made his success harder or its aftermath rockier would be counterproductive. Besides, he said, it would be unseemly for him to complain. He had a new Porsche, a new Range Rover and trust funds for his sons, ages 4 and 10 months. He was well invested in other Internet companies. He was preparing to move into a luxurious new house.
Moreover, he said, in his business world overt discrimination had been alleviated by legal protections, changing notions of acceptable behavior and an actual improvement in racial attitudes. And the new high-tech economy provided a better semblance of equal opportunity. It was one reason he had risked becoming a Web entrepreneur.
Still, he said, he had no illusions. He knew how race could tip the scales. How skin color could trump money and status when it came to forging business ties. How self-imposed pressures to succeed, particularly as a black man, could take a toll on every part of life. Certainly, he acknowledged, race was in his thoughts as he churned over his game plan that weekend. As he often reminded his wife, Madelyn Adams Cobb, he was nearly alone as a black Web entrepreneur in Atlanta. If he failed, he believed, others would not get the chance. He was a role model.
"Failure is not an option for me," Mr. Cobb said. "I can't accept it. I won't accept it. I won't let it happen. There are other folks coming down the path who will all do much cooler things than I've done, and I want to be sure I'm not blocking their way."
Simply not failing didn't cut it for him, either. When he was growing up in Durham, N.C., he recalled, his parents told him that he would have to work twice as hard as white people to achieve as much.
Perhaps that was why he took care to be the best-prepared and best-dressed for every business meeting. And why he is so driven to excel. "Michael Jordan is not a role model," he said. "I compete with him."
In one way that statement was a measure of his brashness; it was also a half-joking nod to his freshman year at the University of North Carolina, spent warming the bench while Mr. Jordan dominated the basketball court. But what he really meant, he said, was that to be black and successful in business you had to be more than good; you had to be a superstar.
That was how some friends at the Miami Beach party said they saw him. But Mr. Cobb said he knew that in this moment of glory he had to admit to a more recent defeat: he was spending half a million dollars a month on an idea he had lost faith in. He remembers thinking he would have to work harder than ever on a new venture. And he said he put out of his mind the question of whether his marriage, already frayed, would survive the strain.
 
Friends and Rivals
Close partners and good friends, Tim Cobb and Jeff Levy were also friendly rivals. On the golf course Mr. Levy was the superior player, but Mr. Cobb challenged him all the same, a trait that impressed Mr. Levy when they were getting to know each other.
"Most African-Americans I know are in some way intimidated or uncomfortable with the white man's world," Mr. Levy said. "They never learned how to play golf, so you take them to a golf course and they're terrible, so they don't want to play. Well, Tim never learned to play golf, and he was terrible, and he didn't care."
Mr. Cobb eventually sought Tiger Woods's coach for tutoring. But if he took some ribbing on the fairways, he dished it back elsewhere, rating Mr. Levy's fashion sense a lukewarm "improving" and urging him to forget his grandfather's maxim, "Dress British, think Yiddish."
"Not so preppy," advised Mr. Cobb, who favored Italian suits.
As they went their separate ways, the former partners kept tabs on each other's business exploits. Each invested in the other's company, each sat on the other's board. Each also noticed who had the bigger office and how much cash the other was burning.
They were, it seemed, equally well-equipped to steer a new enterprise in an industry that claims to be the ultimate meritocracy. In Silicon Valley, the mantra goes, the business is evolving so quickly that the only color that matters is green. In Atlanta, a budding technology hub in an area with a much larger black population, the refrain is much the same.
"I can't imagine that race would be an obstacle," said a white industry executive on the board of Mr. Cobb's new company. "If somebody has a good business plan in the Internet space, that's all that matters."
For whatever reason, though, by the start of this year Mr. Levy had clearly pulled ahead of Mr. Cobb. He had raised an additional $11 million to finance his venture, eHatchery, which helps companies start up in exchange for a sizable ownership stake. The company's offices, in a renovated ice cream factory, were filling up with dot-com fledglings. And good press was plentiful.
But Mr. Levy, a consummate schmoozer who counts compulsive efficiency as one of his greatest virtues, was coping with pressures of his own. He was determined, for instance, to measure up to his great-great-grandfather, Julius Rosenwald, an early chairman of Sears Roebuck & Company who had given millions of dollars to build more than 5,000 schools for blacks in the South. Mr. Levy had dabbled in civic causes and thought about philanthropy, but he first wanted to build an even larger fortune, and to do that he was counting on eHatchery.
That meant he was always drumming up interest in eHatchery's investments and calculating how and when to cash in. At the same time, he said, he had to be careful not to stretch himself too thin. He and his wife agreed a few months ago that he needed to be "present" when he was home and to be home more often. What was the point of the money, she wanted to know, if she and his sons, ages 4 and 2, never saw him?
Still, in a life Mr. Levy described as a multilevel chess game, the racial plane was one he did not have to play on. As a Jew, he said, he often felt like an outsider himself. But he also knew that his blond hair, blue eyes and white skin shielded him from the kind of scrutiny Mr. Cobb faced.
"Tim has to take things over a hurdle that I don't have," Mr. Levy said.
Though sensitive to race, Mr. Levy prides himself on looking beyond it. He and Mr. Cobb rarely talked about it. "I never saw Tim as black," Mr. Levy said. What mattered, he said, was that they thought alike.
But they didn't always. There was a moment last fall when the two were discussing a young black man pitching an idea. "He's smart, but he doesn't have your polish," Mr. Cobb recalled Mr. Levy's saying. The comparison to an aspiring entrepreneur with no experience rankled, Mr. Cobb said, but he let the remark roll off. He knew Mr. Levy did not mean to offend, he said.
On another occasion Mr. Levy told Mr. Cobb that he thought being black could be an advantage in business when diversity was increasingly viewed as a plus. Mr. Cobb considered. Then, as a way of gently informing his friend that in his experience the drawbacks outweighed any benefits, he broke into a mock-gospel chorus: "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen."
But Mr. Cobb's black friends did know. They included David Crichlow, who in March became the first black partner at the 132-year-old Wall Street law firm Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts; Ed Dandridge, who recently left ABC, where he had been one of two black senior executives; and Henry Moniz, who was Democratic counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment hearings.
Each could attest to the power of race. They told stories of being too eagerly sought by co-op boards needing a respectable black face; of being told too often by well-meaning whites that they "transcended race"; of not hailing taxis to avoid being passed by. There was a risk of falling into the "angry black man syndrome," as one of Mr. Cobb's friends put it; show too much anger and people will write you off.
These were the subtle ways race played out. Other moments weren't so subtle. Mr. Crichlow said he would not easily forget the time he stood in a law office lobby, wearing his customary suit and tie and waiting to meet an opposing counsel, who is white. When the lawyer appeared, he mistook the only other person there, a white man, for Mr. Crichlow. The man wore green work pants and a short-sleeve shirt and was standing next to his delivery of Poland Spring water.
Mr. Moniz remembered appearing in court to handle a drunken-driving case as a favor to the defendant's father, an important corporate client. When Mr. Moniz started to speak on behalf of the accused -- a young white man in a goatee -- the judge, also white, interrupted, apparently assuming that the black man had to be the defendant. "You have a competent attorney," the judge told Mr. Moniz.
Mr. Dandridge said that when he went out on weekends in casual clothes near his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, he was invisible to the ABC colleagues he might pass on the street, even though they were neighbors. To him, the truth about the daily lives of Mr. Cobb and his high-powered black friends is captured in a monologue by the black comedian Chris Rock. "There ain't no white man in this room that will change places with me -- and I'm rich!" the routine goes. "That's how good it is to be white. There's a one-legged busboy in here right now that's going: 'I don't want to change. I'm gonna ride this white thing out and see where it takes me.' "
The joke had struck Mr. Cobb, too. Told that a white executive at Mr. Levy's company had described him as a "black James Bond," Mr. Cobb knew it was meant as a nod to his fondness for gadgets and risk. But "why a 'black' James Bond?" he had wanted to know, supplying his own answer: "Black is the identifier that goes before you, always. It raises the odds that you will get a real reminder that you are an outsider every time they meet you."
Yet to Mr. Cobb there is a joy in being black. There is the pleasure in the color of his own skin, he said. There is the bond among his black friends, based in part on their being outsiders. There is the trash-talking in basketball that he and his friends have transposed to the golf course. And there is something about being black and successful in a white world without compromise that can make him break into his wide, easy grin. "I love being black," he said.
He remembered telling his mother he would not have had the same success if he were not black. If he were white, he told her, maybe he would have believed more in his chances of making partner at his old law firms. Maybe as a junior executive at Turner Broadcasting he would have had mentors and so would not have left. In some ways, he said, the doors that seemed less open directed him down the entrepreneurial path where he was happiest.
Still, Mr. Cobb called the idea that race was not a factor in the technology industry "laughable," if only because of who has more access to capital. Like most Internet entrepreneurs, he and Mr. Levy had raised their first million from friends and family -- and most of it had come from Mr. Levy's friends and family.
"It's one thing to have people who can write checks for $1,000," Mr. Cobb said. "It's another thing if they can write checks for $100,000."
But he would not blame race for the disparity between his and Mr. Levy's recent fortunes. That would be too easy. They had started different businesses; the market moved in unpredictable ways. And he harbored no resentment toward his former partner. Mr. Levy remained one of the few people he could talk to about what really mattered: business.
"Dude, what's your burn rate right now?" Mr. Levy demanded recently, speaking into his ever-present cell phone. "How much of the company are you giving away?" On the other end, Mr. Cobb, in his faint drawl, said something that made Mr. Levy laugh.
 
Only One Could Be C.E.O.
The first time the Levys and the Cobbs met as couples was in early 1994 at an Atlanta cafe. Valerie Hartman Levy had wanted them to get together since Mr. Cobb, a lawyer, joined Turner, where she held a senior position in the legal department.
Struck by his sense of humor, she remembered telling Mr. Cobb in his job interview that he reminded her of her husband. Later, Mr. Cobb told his wife that Ms. Hartman Levy, strong-willed and forthright, reminded him of her.
The couples soon discovered they had a lot more in common. Two years earlier, both men left coveted jobs at fancy New York law firms to follow the women, whose careers had taken them to Atlanta. And both men soon chafed at their new jobs, Mr. Levy's with another law firm.
By the time dinner was over, the women had become friends and the men had begun plotting their entrepreneurial escape. Their rapport was immediate.
It was a rare thing, both men said, the way they could let their guard down and talk so freely. When the Levys' first son was born, Mr. Cobb became his godfather.
The men soon became convinced that the Web was their generation's cable television. Then the idea struck. "You know," Mr. Cobb recalls saying, "I don't think there's a Nielsen's of the Internet." His idea was to create an audience measurement system for Web sites that Internet companies would use, much the way the television networks rely on Nielsen ratings. He thought of a name, too: RelevantKnowledge.
By then Mr. Levy had joined Turner's legal department and Mr. Cobb had moved on to its business development unit. They began meeting for coffee at 6:30 every morning, calculating and debating their chances of success.
Finally, during the opening ceremonies at the 1996 Olympic Games, Mr. Cobb turned to Mr. Levy. "If Billy Payne can bring the Olympics to Atlanta," Mr. Cobb said, referring to the lawyer who had done so, "we can start this company."
As Mr. Levy saw it, Mr. Cobb had more to lose, having less of a financial safety net. But at the same time Mr. Cobb felt that at 32 he had hit a glass ceiling. Of the several hundred vice presidents at Turner, only seven were African-American, he recalled.
Mr. Levy remembers taking courage from Mr. Cobb's resolve. In the fall of 1996 they quit their jobs. RelevantKnowledge was born.
At first, the two were 50-50 partners in everything: finances, decision making, titles. But when they began raising money, the venture capitalists told them that a company led by co-C.E.O.'s would not fly. Investors would be comfortable only if there was one chief, someone to hold accountable for making a profit.
The decision about who would be chief executive was made in one of the nearly wordless exchanges they often had in those early days. Both knew that Mr. Cobb was more qualified, they later acknowledged. He had more business experience than Mr. Levy, whose specialty was libel law. And the company was his idea. But both also believed it would be easier to raise money with a white chief executive than a black one. They did not think people would refuse to invest simply because Mr. Cobb was black. Not exactly. They just thought a black C.E.O. would make the company look more unusual, Mr. Levy said. And as much as Mr. Cobb cared about being a positive role model, risking the company over racial pride could be self-defeating.
Anyway, did it really matter? That was the question they kept asking. They were grateful just to have found each other, two ambitious young men -- one the descendant of a sharecropper, the other of a millionaire.
The eldest of three children, Mr. Levy grew up in Lawrenceville, N.J., in a modest home that reflected the family's conscious effort not to show off its wealth. Mr. Levy's father, Paul, was a judge, who as a lawyer in the 1970's had represented the National Urban League. His mother, Linda Levy -- an heiress to the Rosenwald fortune -- was a humor columnist and cookbook author.
For Mr. Levy, the family heritage always loomed large. Things came easily to him: childhood summers on Martha's Vineyard; family golf vacations in Scotland; early admission to Harvard, where he was captain of the fencing team; a first job with a good law firm in Manhattan. Taking risk, too, came easier with family money to fall back on. But for Mr. Levy the family money was also what made him so determined to prove that he didn't need it.
Tim Cobb was born in Burlington, N.C., where his father, Harold, was a Baptist minister and his mother, Armadia, a teacher. Race was the main topic of conversation at the dinner table. Once, Tim's father came home drenched. He had been marching for civil rights and hoses had been turned on him. Mr. Cobb's mother still lowers her voice when she says "white," an indication, he said, of her perception of how the world was divided, which side had power.
When the family moved to Durham, Tim excelled in class and on the basketball court. In the 11th grade, he was accepted to Andover, the elite Massachusetts prep school, and persuaded his parents to let him go. His father had suspicions, though. "They said, 'We need a black kid,' and Tim had good grades and spoke nice," Harold Cobb said.
When Mr. Cobb decided to attend law school at the University of Pennsylvania, an uncle warned that corporate law firms would not hire blacks. But for Mr. Cobb, law school was an epiphany.
"That was the beginning of seeing firsthand dozens of people like me who had similar ambitions, similar talents and similar skills and resumes, all getting job offers and getting hired," he said. "That was a confirmation in my mind that there are times when an individual can limit themselves by not trying, and so I vowed never to say I'm not going to try that because I don't see any black people doing it."
And yet, about a decade later, the issue before him was whether he and Jeff Levy would dare try a path that few had taken -- naming a black man chief executive.
Mr. Levy remembers as painful their conversation about the C.E.O. question. They were taking a huge risk with their careers. They would be investing their money and that of friends and family. In the end, Mr. Levy recalls, they sort of said it without saying it. Mr. Cobb picked up the phone afterward and left Mr. Levy a message: "If you want to be C.E.O., that's fine with me."
 
The Payoff, Then the Parting
If their bow to pragmatism was troubling, it is hard to argue that it did not pay off. A friend of Mr. Levy's from Harvard put them in touch with J. H. Whitney & Company, the venture capital firm that eventually put up several million dollars after dozens of others had turned them down.
Mr. Cobb and Mr. Levy knew they were really co-C.E.O.'s, Mr. Levy said. "It wasn't like I would ever say, 'I'm C.E.O., so that's what we're doing.' " Friends remember that he always took care to refer to Mr. Cobb as his partner and co-founder, and Mr. Cobb, who took the title of president, attended every meeting with potential investors.
Neither man recalls overtly racist incidents during their partnership, although they remember that an associate of Mr. Cobb's once told Mr. Levy that he had been "jewed" out of something, and Mr. Cobb called to demand an apology.
Mr. Cobb had a joking explanation for the paucity of racist remarks. "I think they were afraid I was going to beat them up," he said. Lowering his voice, he mimicked what a venture capitalist might say about him: "He could be angry."
"The angry Jewish man just doesn't command the same fear in the heart," Mr. Levy said.
But there were times when racism may have operated below the surface, they said. For instance, an investor who seemed ready to give them money abruptly changed his mind after meeting them. Billions of dollars had been flowing into Internet companies, and the venture capitalists at J. H. Whitney had told the partners that getting financing from that investor should be "a layup."
"From my perspective it was the most bizarre thing," Mr. Cobb recalled. "It could have been for some other reason. But I chalked that one up to his just being uncomfortable with me."
Mr. Levy is reluctant to link any difficulty in their raising money to Mr. Cobb's race. But he remembers noticing how people sometimes looked to him in a meeting as if he, not Mr. Cobb, would have the answers.
"It wasn't like, 'Hey, he's the better business person.' It was, 'Hey, he's the white guy,' " Mr. Levy said.
Yet he also said he thought Mr. Cobb was able to use race to his advantage, drawing a comparison to a woman who might use sexual attraction to gain an edge. He could "play the angry black man" when he felt like it, Mr. Levy said, and people reacted.
"All's fair in love and business," he said. "You play to win."
By the beginning of 1998, much of the Internet industry was relying on Relevant-Knowledge to measure Web-site popularity. And because he carried the top title, Mr. Levy was becoming more closely identified with the company's success. He was the one quoted in the media; he was the one who networked with other Internet moguls.
That March, Mr. Levy spoke in Tucson at PC Forum, an annual gathering of technology executives. At the next year's forum he met Bill Gross, an Internet entrepreneur who became a mentor and, later, the biggest investor in eHatchery other than Mr. Levy.
Whether it was because Mr. Cobb always seemed to be one of only three black people at conferences or because he was too impatient to mingle without purpose, he was glad to leave that duty to Mr. Levy. So what if his name wasn't in the paper?
But Mr. Cobb's taking the lesser title and a quieter role appears to have had a price. Mr. Levy was reminded of it at this year's PC Forum. On Mr. Cobb's behalf, he approached the sponsor of another conference, which Mr. Cobb wanted to attend.
"You remember my partner, Tim Cobb?" Mr. Levy asked.
"No, never heard of him," came the reply.
"To the world, I was C.E.O.," Mr. Levy said, "and I think certainly that had an impact."
If Mr. Cobb regretted taking the No. 2 job, the closest he would come to saying so was to comment: "I don't make the rules. I have to play by them, and I have to win by them."
Still, once the partners decided to merge with their major rival, Media Metrix, Mr. Cobb did not stick around long. He knew that only one of them would be able to participate in taking the company public, he said. Mr. Levy wanted that job, and as the public face of RelevantKnowledge, he seemed like the logical choice for it.
Instead, Mr. Cobb invited Mr. Levy to help him start a Web site aimed at teenagers, an untapped demographic niche, according to the information they had gathered at RelevantKnowledge. This time Mr. Cobb would be chief executive, and this time they would take the company public themselves.
Mr. Levy declined. The idea of a lifestyle site for teenagers did not grab him, he said. And he couldn't imagine not being chief executive. He, too, wanted to take his own company public, and he tried to persuade Mr. Cobb to be his No. 2 at eHatchery. This time, Mr. Cobb declined.
 
One Succeeds, One Struggles
HipO.com, Mr. Cobb's new company, let teenagers buy clothing and accessories through its Web site with "HipCards" and attracted some major sponsors and investors. But by late fall, Mr. Cobb was stumbling. Deal after deal with potential partners had fallen through. By January, visitors to the site were seeing an animation bidding them farewell.
Ms. Adams Cobb, now a vice president for employee development at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, believed that her husband might have had an easier time with HipO had he not ceded the top job at Relevant Knowledge. Little slights gnawed at her. Sitting in the audience at the Atlanta Convention Center in October as Mr. Cobb and Mr. Levy were introduced on a panel of local technology executives, she bristled as Mr. Cobb was introduced last, even though he was not sitting at the end of the dais. The moderator introduced Mr. Levy as the "former chief executive of RelevantKnowledge" and described eHatchery. When he got to Mr. Cobb, he said simply, "This is Tim Cobb, who helped found RelevantKnowledge." Helped found?
"It was almost like an aside," Ms. Adams Cobb said. "I know how hard he worked, and he didn't get the credit."
Mr. Cobb had a different theory.
"I often feel on panels like this that the moderators don't know what to say to me," he said. "Maybe they're afraid they're going to say something offensive, so they don't say anything. I don't know."
In college, when a member of a fraternity known for flying the Confederate flag called him "nigger" one drunken night, the response was clear: a punch. Now, in a more sophisticated world, he was often left with nothing to do but shoulder the weight of shadowy perceptions.
Did the demise of HipO have anything to do with race? He did not think so, he said. Even in the midst of the current Internet frenzy, the majority of start-ups fail. But he could not know for sure. How had he performed at dinner when the Time Warner executives talked about wine and people they knew in common? What impression had he made on the National Football League executives when he had tried to recruit the N.F.L. as a sponsor? Anyone might go through such a self-evaluation after an important business meeting, but for Mr. Cobb each question came with an unspoken qualifier: how did he perform, what impression did he make, as a black man?
Asha Appel, his lieutenant at HipO's New York office, said she often thought that potential partners wanted to work with Mr. Cobb because joining a successful black man would make them look good. Ms. Appel, who is white, said she had been conscious of feeling that way herself and had not been proud of it; it is a reaction to racism that is racist itself, she said.
"In meetings they all look to him, and that look doesn't come from just wanting to see his reaction," Ms. Appel said. "It comes from, 'We want you to know we're respecting you.' "
Her white boss in a previous job never got those looks, she said. "Now they will speak to me and look to Tim for approval," she said. "And it's not about business. It's personal. Tim is a touchstone. His color is a touchstone."
Reactions like those by white associates only make it harder for him to establish the rapport that is often necessary to make business deals, Mr. Cobb said. "Ultimately it comes down to relationships," he said. "I've got to be able to connect with the person, and it's harder for people to connect with me as a black man.
"I'm never going to remind somebody of their little brother or their cousin or their next-door neighbor. I might remind them of someone in business school who they thought was smart and wish they'd gotten to know better."
Mr. Levy had no such concerns, of course. He was busy leveraging his reputation from RelevantKnowledge to attract investors and draw attention to eHatchery. A spread in U.S. News and World Report and an appearance on CNN followed the first article about the company last August in The Journal-Constitution. "Jeff Levy is an Internet success story," it began.
By contrast, HipO received scant press attention in its early days. In January, The Atlanta Business Chronicle ran an account of the demise of Mr. Cobb's HipO.com under the headline "Not Hip Enough? Web Site Dumps Pursuit of Teens."
But if Mr. Levy's public profile is higher than Mr. Cobb's, in part owing to his position and exposure at RelevantKnowledge, he also made an effort to raise it. He joined the board of Atlanta's science museum, helped the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and was invited to Washington for a dinner with President Clinton. Occasionally he answered his cell phone and found a senator on the line. He got a kick out of that. And his "Thursday Nights at the Hatch" cocktail parties attracted a crowd of Atlanta movers and shakers.
He was also spending more time with his sons as his wife became more involved in causes like the Million Mom March.
"Jeff is a poster boy for the new economy in Atlanta," said a prominent lawyer in a toast one Thursday in March.
Mr. Cobb, meanwhile, was traveling more and working longer hours. He was determined to make sure his investors did not lose their money and was working furiously to transform HipO's assets into a new Internet business. His wife remembers his coming home exhausted, with little energy for anything but watching ESPN.
He was also too overextended to think about community involvement, he said. Besides, he had never shared Mr. Levy's enthusiasm for it. Although he joined a panel of black entrepreneurs in a program for black students at the Wharton Business School, Mr. Cobb turned down requests to join political campaigns and civic groups and passed on a chance to work with Magic Johnson on a Web venture aimed at blacks.
In his view the struggle for blacks now was mainly economic. He could do more good, he said, by ensuring his own success, by supporting other black professionals and by offering himself as a model. And he had a hard time with peers who chose not to, like the black man working out at his gym who turned out to be the chief executive of a public Internet company. The man told him he kept a low profile, Mr. Cobb recalled, because he thought it would be better for the company's stock performance if people did not know he was black. "I told him that was messed up," Mr. Cobb said.
Soon, Mr. Cobb insisted, there would be more like himself. To ensure that, he paid special attention to black entrepreneurs who asked him to invest, and recently put $200,000 into an Internet start-up run by young African-Americans. If they did well, they in turn would finance others, Mr. Cobb said. "That's how you get the momentum."
But sometimes, he said, he grew frustrated with how slowly the ranks of black entrepreneurs were growing. He wished he could page the entire listening audience of the Les Brown show, a radio call-in program aimed at blacks, and tell them: "Here, do this. I did it, you can do it. I didn't do it dunking a basketball or singing a song, not that there's anything wrong with that. So have all my close friends, they've done it too. But we need other people, other success stories."
 
Tolls and Prospects
In April Mr. Cobb and Mr. Levy dined together at an Atlanta restaurant. They ordered a bottle of cabernet. They talked about business.
Mr. Levy was preparing to raise more money. He wanted to set up another eHatchery office, perhaps in Washington D.C. Soon, he hoped, an eHatchery investment would be ready to take public or be sold.
Prospects had also brightened for Mr. Cobb. He had transformed what was left of HipO into a new company, Edaflow, which was using the Internet to connect clothing manufacturers and retailers.
They also talked about their personal lives. Mr. Levy's 4-year-old son, Mr. Cobb's godson, had been admitted to a private preschool where he would start learning Spanish. As for Mr. Cobb, shortly after they returned from Miami, he and his wife separated. He moved into the new house in March while his wife remained with the boys a few blocks away. But he spent more time with his sons now, three nights a week.
Ms. Adams Cobb said some combination of the missed family dinners and the constant feeling that her husband had blinders on had worn her down. Mr. Cobb acknowledged that his approach to work had burdened the relationship: "When I'm in a foxhole I divorce all emotion from what I'm doing and just do it," he said. "Madelyn doesn't like me when I'm like that."
Their marital troubles were similar to those of many entrepreneurs battling the odds. But some of Mr. Cobb's friends suggested that because the sense of going into daily battle was heightened for black men in business, so were frictions at home.
"The toll," Mr. Cobb said, "is probably higher than I realized."
Meanwhile, Mr. Cobb's oldest son, a few months older than Mr. Levy's, had begun to explore the meaning of race in his young life. Mr. Cobb had started what he knew would be a continuing conversation with him about what it means to be black in America, and why a white boy in a similar situation might have an easier time. In lectures that echo those of his own parents, Mr. Cobb said, he tells his son that he must not allow his race to hold him back.
"I tell him it's important to work hard, it's important to succeed. Absolutely, I'm burdening him with all that early on. He'll be like, 'I hear this stuff in my head, I don't know where that comes from.' "
Yet Mr. Cobb said he was confident that his sons' racial experiences would be better than his, partly because of social progress and partly because of his effort to provide for them. It will never occur to them that they should not have access to something because of their race, he said.
When he was growing up, he remembers, there was a country club he knew his family could not belong to. Now his sons play in the pool with Mr. Levy's at the exclusive Ansley country club and never question whether they should be there. Still, they were becoming aware of a difference.
"Dad," Mr. Cobb recalled his older son's observing one morning, "I'm the only brown boy in my class."
"I told him not to worry so much about color of skin," Mr. Cobb said. "I told him to look at his friends, and if they're nice people, to make his determination based on that. And I told him I was the only brown kid in my class too, and it's O.K."
 
About the Series
 
Two generations after the end of legal discrimination, race still ignites political debates. But the wider public discussion of race relations seems muted. Race relations are being defined less by political action than by daily experience, in schools, in sports arenas, in pop culture and at worship, and especially in the workplace. These encounters -- race relations in the most literal, everyday sense -- make up this series of reports, the outcome of a yearlong examination by Times reporters.
 
This series will continue intermittently and conclude with a special issue of The New York Times Magazine on July 16.
 
The articles in this series can also be read at The New York Times on the Web. The site offers forums in which visitors can discuss the articles and racial issues in their own lives and respond to a questionnaire. Photo essays, video and audio presentations -- including comments by people from around the nation -- and lesson plans from The Learning Network are also available:

HEADLINE: Gore's Interest in Indians

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is nice to see that Vice President Al Gore seems to be showing an interest in Indian affairs ("At Meeting of Tribal Leaders, Gore Taps a New Font of Cash," news article, June 8). Perhaps he will begin to address the real issues that plague the majority of Indians in this country: staggering unemployment, substandard living conditions and lack of adequate health care, just to name a few. 
 What many Indians on the reservations need is real help and real change from government agencies -- not an Internet connection, as President Clinton has proposed. How does one get online when (in many cases) one doesn't even have adequate phone service?

HEADLINE: Microsoft and the Law

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, June 9) is right to champion the rule of law, the foundation of a liberal society and a market economy. In calling for retribution against Microsoft, however, he loses sight of an important point: The arbitrary punishment of individuals and companies for perceived "arrogance" is nothing less than an unconscionable violation of this hallowed principle. 
 As Mr. Friedman suggests, many of the "billionaire geeks" who have led America's high-tech renaissance disagree with him on the appropriate role of government in our lives. Fortunately, that is not, as of yet, a crime.

HEADLINE: Tests' Economic Bias

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Mount Holyoke Drops SAT Requirement" (news article, June 7), you say that many educational institutions have "recently moved to de-emphasize College Board scores to ward off criticism from opponents of affirmative action, since whites tend to perform better on such tests than black and Hispanic students." 
 I would argue that it is not so much cultural bias that makes the tests problematic as it is the increasing use of test-preparation programs. Those who can afford the extensive prep courses available for the SAT and graduate admissions tests corrupt the process and render the test scores poor indicators of student learning or potential. The bias is increasingly economic, not cultural.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Opening Further, Japanese Are Buying More Corporate Bonds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 13

 BODY:
The demand for corporate bonds denominated in yen has exploded this year, a result of some far-reaching changes that have helped make the Japanese economy less insular.
I.B.M. was the latest company to tap the market here today, selling 140 billion yen, or $1.31 billion at current exchange rates, of so-called Samurai bonds and setting a record for corporate fund-raising in yen by a foreign company. 
 Three weeks ago, the financing arm of the Xerox Corporation sold 130 billion yen of Samurai bonds, following companies like Fiat and countries like Argentina. General Motors, Ford, McDonald's and Deutsche Telekom have also sold yen-denominated bonds this year, although their debt issues were sold outside Japan.
"There's been an explosion this year in yen-denominated issues," said Jack Gunn, head of the Tokyo debt-syndicate desk at Merrill Lynch, currently the world's largest seller of yen-denominated bonds. Merrill and Daiwa Securities were the lead underwriters for the Samurai bonds I.B.M. issued today.
So far this year, almost five trillion yen worth of the bonds have been sold, or $46.7 billion, compared with less than three trillion yen last year, according to Merrill, and the factors driving the market speak volumes about how Japan is changing. The boom tells a story about increased foreign investment in Japan, as well as about how extensive corporate restructuring has been here.
As high-interest deposits in Japan's huge government-run postal savings system mature over the next two years, some 100 trillion yen will be seeking a new home. And the Japanese savers will be seeking better returns than bank accounts and government bonds, which offer little in the way of return given the central bank's policy of maintaining virtually zero interest rates to stimulate economic growth.
Yen-denominated bonds appeal to these prospective investors' concerns about foreign-exchange and credit risks. I.B.M.'s bonds mature in two years, reducing the risk of a rise in interest rates, and pay a coupon of 0.62 percent, or 21.5 basis points better than Japanese government bonds of similar maturities. (One hundred basis points are equal to 1 percent.)
And I.B.M., unlike some Japanese businesses, presents relatively little credit risk.
Those terms also explain why raising money here is far more attractive for corporations, which would have to pay a much higher interest rate if they sold bonds in the United States or Europe. Borrowers seeking to capitalize on Japan's low interest rates can issue bonds in yen and use derivative securities known as currency swaps to turn the yen they raise into dollars or euros.
Moreover, as foreign investment here increases, the need for foreign companies to finance their activities in Japan also rises. For instance, Boehringer Ingelheim, a German drug manufacturer that recently acquired a controlling stake in SS Pharmaceutical of Japan, presumably does more business in yen now than it has in the past.
Imports are also rising, which increases the demand for yen to pay for them.
"Part of this is the internationalization of the yen, which is a result of the fact that the Japanese economy is opening up at a faster pace now," Mr. Gunn of Merrill Lynch said.

HEADLINE: Warming Earth, Heated Rhetoric

BYLINE: By Gregg Easterbrook; Gregg Easterbrook is a senior editor of The New Republic and Beliefnet.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Clinton administration's global warming report, released in draft this week, is a puzzling document.
It touts assumptions far more pessimistic than those in mainstream climatology. And while presenting itself as a scientific document, it also boasts of being built on "a national discourse" with "farmers, ranchers, engineers, scientists, business people, local government officials" expressing a "unique level of stakeholder involvement" -- in other words, nonscientists who might have lobbying reasons for wanting to influence the report. 
 Whether or not these flaws are politically fatal, here's the puzzling part: Despite them, the report is probably basically right.
The federal assessment of global warming was ordered by Congress and elevated to urgency by the White House in 1997 around the time of the Kyoto greenhouse treaty talks. Its central prediction is that by 2100, temperatures in the United States will have risen by 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a much bleaker estimate than that of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations affiliate under whose auspices hundreds of the world's researchers have been debating greenhouse questions since the 1980's. The panel makes a "best estimate" of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100; its worst-case estimate is 6 degrees.
Defenders of the administration report note that it concentrates on North America and that warming effects may be especially pronounced in higher latitudes. The science on this point is shaky, a reason why the United Nations panel has avoided making temperature projections by region.
The authors of the administration report relied on what was essentially a merging of two greenhouse simulation models that disagree on many points. For example, one predicts a catastrophic drought that kills off all trees of the American Southeast; the other forecasts increased rainfall and forest expansion in the Southeast. Statisticians know that merging two approximations does not produce precision; rather, it produces galimatias.
 Considering that many environmentalists, including Al Gore, have for years been urging Americans to believe the United Nations panel, it seems peculiar that the administration's report should diverge from it so sharply. Also open to question is the fact that the report's overview draft was been made public even though a few of the underlying studies are still not complete. It's hard not to suspect rushing for political purposes; perhaps there was a "unique level of stakeholder involvement" on the part of the Gore campaign.
The misgivings about the administration report are unfortunate because the scientific case for an artificial greenhouse is growing ever more persuasive. Global temperatures have increased roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past 100 years, and there are other, more telling climate signals: statistically significant changes in postwar rainfall patterns in North America; springs arriving one day earlier each three years; water-level cycles of the Great Lakes showing progressively earlier springs and later winters. In March, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that global ocean temperatures are rising: because oceans cover most of Earth's surface, this may be more revealing than land temperatures.
Meanwhile, negotiations on the Kyoto agreement have generally been positive. President Clinton signed the Kyoto proposal in 1997 but has never submitted it for ratification because the Senate voted 95-0 not to approve any deal that failed to include the developing world. But developing nations, which initially viewed the Kyoto plan as a Western trick to slow their economies, are beginning to show support. India, for example, has reversed its position and now endorses the sort of clean-energy development that would make greenhouse reform possible.
Of equal importance, the European Union nations, which initially opposed the American idea of using market-based carbon trading to reduce global warming gases, are beginning to back it. Carbon trading is favored almost unanimously by economists, many of whom project that if achieved through market mechanisms, greenhouse gas reduction will not harm world economies. David Sandalow, the assistant secretary of state who negotiated the breakthrough with India, says, "Many of the open issues in the Kyoto treaty are gradually being ironed out."
Greenhouse action seems increasingly important, and the chances for it seem increasingly favorable, whether under the Kyoto treaty or through some new agreement. Political overselling of the kind found in the federal global warming study isn't necessary; consensus science and economics are more than enough.

Death and Taxes

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
The distribution of wealth does not look like the "bell curve" beloved of statisticians. Instead it is best described by a "power law," a sort of elongated ski slope. Power-law distributions, unlike bell curves, have a lot of their mass far out in the right tail -- which means, in this particular case, that a large share of the total wealth is held by a small number of families.
To give you an idea of the implications: You may or may not be impressed to hear that 25 percent of U.S. families own more than 80 percent of private assets. But well over half of the wealth of that 25 percent is actually in the hands of the top fifth of that group, that is, the wealthiest 5 percent of families. Roughly the same proportion of that wealth is actually in the hands of the top fifth of that group, the top 1 percent of families. And although our statistical vision starts to blur at high altitudes, it's more or less certain that most of the wealth of the top 1 percent is actually in the hands of the top 0.2 percent, and so on up to Bill Gates. 
 The hate-mailers and right-wing pundits are already firing up their word processors. Wealth distribution is one of those subjects where even a bland statement of the facts is met with furious attacks on the messenger. If someone says that a small number of people own a lot of assets, and does not assert in the same breath that this is a good thing -- the politically correct statement is not that people "have" wealth but that they "create" it -- he will immediately be denounced as a dangerous leftist.
And the protesters have good reason to be upset: it's important to suppress these facts if at all possible. If middle-class Americans had any realistic sense of how rich the rich really are, policy moves that cater specifically to the wealthy -- like the repeal of the inheritance tax, voted by the House last week -- would face a much rougher ride.
The current inheritance tax applies only to estates of more than $675,000, with the cutoff scheduled to rise to more than $1 million over the next few years; as a result, only about 2 percent of estates pay any tax at all -- a fact that opponents of repeal tried in vain to publicize. But even that 2 percent figure quite literally doesn't tell the half of it. Because of the power law, a good deal more than half the value of that top 2 percent of estates actually lies in the top 0.4 percent. And since only the amount over $675,000 is taxed, and the tax rate rises with the size of the estate, the bulk of each year's inheritance tax is actually paid by only a few thousand multimillion-dollar estates. This really is a tax levied almost entirely on the very, very well off.
So why did most members of the House vote to repeal a tax that yields $30 billion per year, yet doesn't touch the vast majority of their constituents? Perhaps they were moved by sob stories about salt-of-the-earth family farmers and small-business men forced by estate taxes to abandon their heritage -- although a quick check of the facts would have revealed that such stories are actually quite uncommon, and that the compromise bill offered by the Democratic leadership would have made them vanishingly rare.
Or maybe Congress is really, truly worried about incentives -- about the potential entrepreneur who thinks to himself: "Why bother? Even if I make millions, I can only pass 61 percent of it to my kids. So I'll stick with my job as an insurance salesman."
Or, finally, maybe Congress just figured that $30 billion a year isn't a lot of money -- although it is roughly what the federal government spends on the earned-income tax credit, a program that helps millions of poor workers but draws a constant barrage of criticism from economy-minded conservatives. Oh, and it's more than twice our total spending on foreign aid, and around five times as much as the non-military component of that aid.
But if you believe any of these explanations of last week's vote, I've got this bridge you might be interested in buying. The truth is that the vote to repeal the inheritance tax was just an unusually blatant demonstration of a much simpler power law -- the one that says that money talks.

HEADLINE: Irving Anker Dies at 88; Led Schools in Time of Turmoil

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Irving Anker, the courtly former New York City schools chancellor who guided the system through the city's fiscal crisis and the turmoil over integration in the mid-1970's, died on Monday at his home in Jamaica, Queens. He was 88.
A soft-spoken career educator who worked his way up through the school system, Mr. Anker became its leader in 1973, when economic and racial struggles were roiling not only the schools but the entire city as well. 
 One of his most complicated tasks was overseeing the decentralization of the school system, which started in 1969 when he was deputy chancellor under Harvey B. Scribner. The contentious process created 32 locally elected community school boards and shifted considerable power over elementary and middle schools from Board of Education headquarters to neighborhoods, where some residents saw the boards as a pathway to political office or an opportunity for patronage.
Mr. Anker was more a product of the city school system than any other chancellor in its history. He was born on Oct. 27, 1911, in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, to Austro-Hungarian immigrants, and attended public schools while his father worked as a tailor and his mother labored in an embroidery factory. He began his teaching career at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1934, after earning bachelor's and master's degrees from City College.
Mr. Anker served as the chairman of social studies at Long Island City High School, and eventually became principal of Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem, where his dedication to integration and civil rights took shape. He was made a roving superintendent before being appointed assistant chancellor. His low-key style contrasted sharply with that of the flamboyant Mr. Scribner, who had been criticized by the teachers' union and others as an outsider (he came from Vermont) who did not understand the city's political and educational structures.
The first major crisis that Mr. Anker faced as chancellor was associated with decentralization, a policy enacted by the State Legislature to give more educational representation to the city's growing minority communities. Shortly after taking office in 1974, Mr. Anker was forced to confront serious fiscal mismanagement in District 9 in the Bronx. He suspended the district's school board and appointed a trustee.
The action provoked a sit-in by parents, but a state audit found improper hiring and millions of dollars in expenditures that could not be accounted for. Mr. Anker's critics saw his actions as a racially motivated assault on decentralization, but the fight over District 9 turned out to be only the opening skirmish in a battle that still continues.
During his tenure, he investigated allegations of corruption and mismanagement in at least 7 of the 32 local districts. He sent monitors into some districts and began using his power to suspend local school boards or supersede their authority.
"Chancellor Anker navigated this system through the turbulent early days of decentralization with courage and tremendous wisdom," Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said in a statement yesterday.
By 1974, the city was in a fiscal crisis whose effects would be felt for years to come. The Board of Education, like other city agencies, was asked to propose cutbacks to ease the city's financial burden. But Mr. Anker refused to cooperate, and warned of devastating cuts in school services if the city did not back off.
"We can leave the car in the garage; we can do with less sugar," Mr. Anker said at the time. "But we cannot write off the children of New York City without calling into question every value we live by."
But the board ended up having to cut its budget by $230 million, and had to dismiss 21,000 employees, more than half of them teachers. Class sizes, already large, increased. After-school programs, art and music classes and sports programs were almost completely obliterated.
"It was a gruesome period," said Bernard R. Gifford, who served as deputy chancellor under Mr. Anker. "The climate was one of being punched in the nose every three weeks. But Irving was too much of a gentleman to complain about how unfair life was."
The United Federation of Teachers, under Albert Shanker, added to Mr. Anker's troubles in September 1975, when its members, angered by teacher layoffs and swelling class sizes, went on strike for five days. The strike ended when Mr. Anker and the Board of Education agreed to shorten the school day by 90 minutes, provoking protests from parents around the city.
At the same time, Mr. Anker was struggling with the question of how to sustain integration of the city's schools as the population of black and Hispanic students grew to roughly 70 percent of the total and more white students left the system each year. He altered the attendance zones for high schools in Brooklyn, to make some more racially diverse and others less crowded. But that move drew heavy criticism from white families, many of whom took their children out of the system.
In 1977, the federal government accused the Board of Education of discrimination in hiring, pointing out that the school system had a disproportionately low number of black and Hispanic teachers, and that those teachers had been assigned to schools with mostly black and Hispanic students. In response, Mr. Anker proposed broad changes to bring more minority teachers into the school system and avoid concentrating them in majority black and Hispanic schools.
But critics accused the board of starting racial quotas, and Mr. Anker agreed that he was uncomfortable with the changes. He ended the policy of assigning teachers on the basis of race in 1978, just before he resigned.
Mr. Anker was forced out that year by the newly elected mayor, Edward I. Koch, who chose Frank J. Macchiarola as chancellor. Mr. Anker retired. He later taught at a community college in Florida and at the Long Island University Graduate School of Education. He also wrote and consulted on education issues.
Mr. Anker is survived by his wife, Sarah; two daughters, Deborah, of Boston, and Laura, of Easthampton, N.Y.; a son, Philip David, of Bethesda, Md.; and seven grandchildren. His three children attended public schools in New York City, and one of his granddaughters, Shanna Beth Schwartz, is now a teacher at Public School 116 in Manhattan.
"My father believed that your commitment to the system was demonstrated by the fact that you believed in it for your children," Laura Anker said on Monday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A South African-Canadian Merger in Gold

BYLINE: By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, June 13

 BODY:
Gold Fields Ltd. became the first South African gold producer to merge with a foreign counterpart today, a deal with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada, creating a mining giant with a combined market value of $3.4 billion.
The transaction partly reflects the global pressure on gold producers to combine and keep costs low, best positioning themselves for the possibility that the prolonged slump in gold prices will end. 
 For South Africa, the deal represents an effort by another big corporate name in a mainstay domestic industry to reduce exposure to the country's political and economic problems, joining others like De Beers and AngloGold that have diversified abroad.
Under the terms of the deal, the new company, called Gold Fields International, will have its principal headquarters in Toronto and a presence in Johannesburg. Its main stock listing will be in Toronto. Each company's shareholders will own 50 percent.
While other foreign mining companies, like Placer Dome of Vancouver, British Columbia, have purchased stakes in South African gold deposits, the merger announced today is the first between a South African and a foreign producer.
The new company is expected to produce 4.4 million ounces of gold a year and, as the original Gold Fields did, will rank third in world production, behind AngloGold and Newmont Mining of Denver.
Franco-Nevada, based in Toronto, relies primarily on royalties generated by its international array of joint ventures, while Gold Fields, based here, is a traditional mining house and owns and operates virtually all its holdings, most of them in South Africa.
Both partners have strong balance sheets, and the new company would stand to benefit from any upswing in the price of gold. Angus Auchterlonie, an analyst at SG Securities in Johannesburg, said that was certainly a prime consideration for the deal.
While low by historical standards, futures prices have risen from $270 an ounce two weeks ago to $288.10 today on gold for August delivery, near the highest level in three months. "There is a significant upside if you think the price goes up," Mr. Auchterlonie said. "They wanted to create a globally diversified company that is very well geared to gold going up."
Seymour Schulich, chairman of Franco-Nevada, and Pierre Lassonde, its president, will become the co-chairmen of the new company, while Chris Thompson, chairman and chief executive of Gold Fields, will become the president and chief executive.
"This merger is a leap for Gold Fields into the international arena that could not be achieved through organic growth alone," Mr. Thompson said in a statement released by the companies.

 BODY:

Rallies for More School Money
Advocacy groups have banded together in the New York State Schools Coalition, hoping to unite parents, students, teachers, neighborhood organizations and unions into a powerful force that will pressure state lawmakers to allot more money for education.
Yesterday, the founders of the coalition held rallies in Manhattan and Buffalo to publicize their effort. The New York City schools chancellor, HAROLD O. LEVY, and WILLIAM C. THOMPSON Jr., president of the Board of Education, were among the speakers at the Manhattan rally. 
 The driving forces behind the coalition are Acorn, an advocacy group for poor neighborhoods, and Citizen Action of New York, a watchdog group. DOUG TURETSKY, a spokesman for the coalition, said its members would hold rallies throughout the state, testify at budget hearings and campaign against state lawmakers who vote against increases in education financing.
 
$500,000 for All That Jazz
The Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation has committed about $500,000 for a visiting professorship each year for five years at Columbia University's Center for Jazz Studies, a program that explores the role of jazz in American culture.
The center, which opened in September 1999, is run by ROBERT O'MEALLY. The visiting professors, Mr. O'Meally said, will be leading scholars in the humanities, arts or social sciences who have made significant contributions to an understanding of jazz and its influence. Candidates will teach one upper-level undergraduate or graduate seminar each semester in jazz studies.
 
From CUNY, Doctorates in Urban Education
Eager to contribute more to solving the education problems of New York and other American cities, the City University of New York is creating a doctoral program in urban education. The trustees on CUNY's academic affairs committee approved the program last week, and the full board is expected to grant its approval later this month. Pending approval by the state, the program would begin taking students in September 2001.
Although CUNY is already the largest single source of New York City teachers, faculty members at the university thought that there ought to be a Ph.D. program and more research on the issues facing urban schools. "What is distinctive about our program is that there will be a very substantial bringing together of the educational disciplines with the liberal arts and sciences disciplines, like anthropology, sociology and economics," said JAY L. LEMKE, a theoretical physicist and professor of education at Brooklyn College who led the effort to develop the program.
 
A Former Mayor to Speak at Fieldston
DAVID DINKINS, the former New York City mayor, will address the 121 members of the graduating class of Fieldston School tomorrow at the school's campus in Riverdale, the Bronx.
Mr. Dinkins (left), who teaches at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and is the host of a radio program on WLIB-AM, is the father of two Fieldston alumni, DAVID Jr., class of 1972, and DONNA DINKINS-HOGGARD, class of 1975.

HEADLINE: Small but Uncertain Indications That the Economy Is Slowing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Ask Jeffrey Joerres, the chief executive of Manpower Inc., the huge temporary-help agency, whether he can see a slowdown in the economy and he explains that the demand for temporary workers remains strong -- except for one group.
Manpower supplies nearly 80,000 temporary workers a day for small companies that assemble all sorts of small products and parts. "We are starting to see a little bit of a tail-off in light manufacturing," Mr. Joerres said. 
 This spring, similar evidence of slower economic growth is budding in more than a few industries. Wall Street calls attention to each new bud as one more reason for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates, removing an albatross that holds down stock prices. But in the view of some Fed officials, the signals are still too ambiguous to conclude that the economy is actually beginning to slow.
Several Fed policy makers have suggested in speeches over the last 10 days that they remain concerned about growth, although William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a question-and-answer period after a speech yesterday that "a number of variables" suggest that a slowdown is becoming visible, Reuters reported.
Mr. McDonough referred mainly to retail sales, which fell 0.3 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. They had dropped 0.6 percent during April.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also spoke yesterday, but he discussed productivity, making no reference to the current strength or weakness of the economy.
While the Fed's policy makers may decide to keep short-term interest rates steady at their next meeting, in two weeks, their speeches and comments indicate that another increase is likely -- if not in late June, than later in the summer, unless further evidence makes clear that the higher cost of credit is bringing down economic growth enough to damp inflation.
"The economy surged over the winter, and that surge is now disappearing, but we are still operating at pretty high rates of economic growth," said Peter Hooper, chief United States economist for Deutsche Bank North America.
What the Fed's policy makers decide could affect the November election. Not since late 1967 and early 1968 has the Fed pushed up interest rates by so much in the early months of a presidential election, before the nominating conventions. And in the election that followed, Richard M. Nixon brought the Republican Party back to the White House. The six Fed rate increases since last June have added 1.75 percentage points to the federal funds rate on overnight loans among financial institutions, compared with 2.13 percentage points in the 1967-1968 period. The increases have raised the costs of mortgages, car loans, home equity loans and all sorts of commercial credit. The effect has been most visible in a decline in the purchases of homes and autos, and in retail sales.
The sales of autos and other vehicles, for example, peaked at an annual rate of 19.1 million in February and have since fallen to 17.5 million. The automakers are adding incentives to prevent sales from falling more, but the 19.1 million was a record and the 17.5 million is higher than in most other boom periods, when 15 million was a level to brag about. "There is no hint of dropping below 15 million in sales," said Wynn Van Bussman, corporate economist at DaimlerChrysler.
The numerous other signs of a slowdown are similarly hard to read. Manpower, for example, continues to send out more than 190,000 workers a day, with jobs in the service sector rising by enough to offset the decline in light manufacturing. Similarly, steel shipments are rising more slowly than last year, and so are sales of corrugated boxes in which so many products are packed. But resistance to big recent price increases in both cases may help to explain the dip, as well as draw-downs from inventories.
"We are not looking at the most robust demand we have ever seen," said Tom Pagano, vice president for corporate planning at the Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, a big maker of corrugated containers, "but we are not looking at weak demand either."
So is the economy experiencing a temporary downward blip that will soon fade? Or is this a turning point, the early signs of a significant slowdown as Americans finally respond to higher interest rates? Whatever the answer, the current pace of economic growth -- roughly 4 percent or so in the second quarter, down from 7.3 percent in the fourth and 5.3 percent in the first -- would have been hailed as breakneck expansion in the 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's. But set against the extraordinary backdrop of the last four years, economic growth has to fall below 3.5 percent for several quarters before a slowdown takes hold.
"There are signs that growth is moderating, but the signs are still early," said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
Rising oil and gasoline prices play a role. They are diverting $50 billion a year into fuel payments that consumers might have spent elsewhere. Oil companies are just beginning to recycle the money into the economy, in the form of more drilling and other investments, said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Corporate purchases of desktop computers have softened, but laptop sales are robust and so are consumer purchases of desktops. "There is still strong demand among households for Internet access and for multiple computers in the home," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst at the International Data Corporation.
There are other mixed signals. The Boeing Company, for example, is on track to deliver 490 airliners this year, a sharp drop from the 620 last year and 563 in 1998 but the fourth- best year since the current expansion began in 1991. "We have gone through 24 months of downsizing because of the decreasing order base," said Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman, "and we believe our year-end employment will be in the range where it is now."
Apart from aircraft and weaponry, capital spending on machinery and equipment -- a big source of the robust expansion -- has risen lately, not fallen, reaching an annual rate of $613 billion in the first quarter and $635.8 billion in April. Still, there are chinks. For example, Caterpillar has reported a decline since March in sales of the big diesel engines that power tractor-trailers. Truck drivers are buying more used rigs, which are plentiful, and fewer new ones now that fuel prices are high.
The huge service sector also appears to be holding its own, expanding at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, down only one-tenth of a percentage point from early this year, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute. But there are chinks here, too. Airline travel rose more in May than in any other month this year, according to the Air Transport Association. But overnight package delivery has grown more slowly in the United States in recent months.
Consumer confidence is higher than ever, but the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys finds that people are no longer rushing to buy homes as mortgage rates rise. "Where earlier they favored purchasing in anticipation of higher rates," said Richard Curtin, director of the surveys, "now they feel the rates are high enough to justify postponement of home purchases."
Nowhere are the signals of slowdown flashing more strongly than in lending. Consumer borrowing, while still rising, is doing so at half of January's clip, and corporate defaults on public debt are rising sharply -- 47 defaults so far this year, totaling $10.7 billion, compared with 89 in all of 1999, totaling $24.2 billion. High-yield junk bonds account for all of the defaults, and lenders have grown reluctant to finance the activities of thousands of companies with junk-bond ratings.
"When the stock market was going gangbusters, people did not notice the defaults," said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard & Poor's. "Now stocks are volatile and they are noticing."
The employment statistics for May were also troubling. While the unemployment rate ticked up only slightly, to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent, the number of jobs shrank instead of growing, the first time that had happened in more than four years. The May numbers may turn out to be an aberration, but job growth over the last five months is lower on average than in the final five months of 1999.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
It's becoming easier, and more common, to combine corporate and family trips.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
IF he'd seen television, Dante, our premier travel writer, might have devised an extra circle of hell where loudspeakers eternally blast television advertising jingles from the 1960's and 1970's.
Ditties extolled foaming cleansers, dry beers, sugared cereals. But in one airline commercial that clawed itself from the memory pit and began playing in my mind recently, the jingle was meant to persuade business travelers, who were nearly exclusively male in the early 1970's, to invite their wives along. A chorus of insistent women sang to clearly anxious businessmen, "Take me along, if you love me! Take me along with you!" 
 This idea was premature in an era when hidebound bosses frowned on the notion that a company-paid business trip might include something as frivolous as family time. The ad campaign faded.
But times have changed. Today, more companies appreciate the toll that business travel can take on the lives of both married and single employees. And, given the need to retain quality workers in that prosperous segment of the economy in which business travel is a growing necessity, companies are also designing some business trips to build morale by incorporating family or household members.
The result is a cultural shift in the business travel market. A household member, typically a spouse or a partner, now tags along on about 20 percent of all business trips, according to travel industry statistics. The number of business trips on which children are included more than tripled during the 1990's, with most of the increase in the last few years.
The 2000 National Business Travel Monitor by Yesawich, Pepperdine & Brown and Yankelovich Partners suggests that the trend is accelerating. This annual survey of business travelers' attitudes showed significant increases over 1999 in the number of travelers who expect to combine leisure with business this year (65 percent), take a spouse along on at least one trip (46 percent) or bring children (15 percent).
This trend is especially evident in popular tourist cities like New York, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., which also attract a lot of convention and trade show business. In the Orlando region, more commonly associated with the hordes of leisure travelers tramping through Disney World, Universal Orlando and other theme parks, business travelers actually accounted for 21 percent of the total 38.6 million domestic visitors in 1998, according to local statistics.
Some hotels are aggressively marketing the family connection to corporate travel departments and individual business travelers. Hilton Hotels, for example, said that the number of members of its frequent-stay program who brought children on business trips had tripled between 1998 and 1999.
In Orlando, executives at a new resort, the Portofino Bay Hotel inside the Universal complex, said that even though the hotel was designed with 40,000 square feet of meeting space to attract corporate events, they had been surprised by the sheer number of business travelers checking in. The hotel, which opened late last year with a design theme that evokes the setting of Portofino, Italy, now does about half of its business in corporate-sponsored travel, according to Jonathan Tisch, the president of Loews Hotels, which built the Portofino Bay in a partnership with the Seagram Company's Universal.
Mr. Tisch said modern work schedules encouraged the overlap of family leisure and business. "The old concept was you had two weeks off, and one of the people at home wasn't working, so you could pack up the car and take the family away for a couple of weeks," he said. Now, he continued, a working couple can often put together only four or five days at a stretch for family travel, and often that needs to be combined with at least some business. "Hotels are now focused on this as a very formidable market," he said.
To reward performance, companies also are sponsoring more incentive trips that combine business with family leisure. "The company will say something like, 'Hey, if you meet these sales numbers, you get to go to this terrific place,' " Mr. Tisch added.
To market the idea that business travel can sometimes include leisure and family time, hotels had to break through walls of corporate attitudes that said, essentially, if you're having any fun, if you're spending time with someone you love, you're not working.
I am not suggesting that business travel is becoming a family affair. People traveling alone account for more than 70 percent of the estimated 280 million business trips that Americans make annually, according to travel industry statistics.
Basically, the business trip remains a lonely, away-from-kith-and-kin slog -- even more so, in fact, as corporate travelers span out across the world on tight, multidestination itineraries that increasingly allow almost no time off.
But hardened attitudes about sending people on the road like combat soldiers have softened enough so that hotels and other destinations are scrambling to design facilities, services and programs -- from day-trip excursions to day care centers -- and market them aggressively to the corporate travel office.
"You see them here all the time," said Crawford F. Sherman, the general manager of Portofino Bay. "They're all business, in meetings all morning. After lunch, the name tags come off and they leave. They're out the rest of the day playing with the family."

HEADLINE: For 25 New MacArthur Recipients, Some Security and Time to Think

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The call came as Lucia Perillo was dismantling her life -- giving up her job teaching writing at Southern Illinois University and joining her husband in Olympia, Wash., because she has multiple sclerosis and cannot commute cross-country anymore. She was preparing to clean the bathroom in the empty cinder block house she was selling in Carbondale, Ill., when the MacArthur Foundation telephoned last week to say that it was giving her $500,000.
The conversation was brief and mysterious. Then, while Ms. Perillo waited for her husband, James Rudy, the thought occurred to her: maybe she would give the money away. She and her husband needed money, but they had friends who needed it more. 
 "I had heard of the MacArthur fellowship," said Ms. Perillo, a poet who the foundation announced last night was 1 of 25 new recipients of a MacArthur fellowship for extraordinary creativity and promise.
"But I think I'm stupid, so I don't think of myself as MacArthur material," she added. "I have that -- what do you call it? -- that imposter syndrome. I always feel that my life is something that I've stumbled into and am undeserving of."
All sorts of startling things go through the heads of the poets, paleontologists, physicists, cartoonists and others who win the MacArthur, the academic and artistic equivalent of a mini-Nobel Prize and the jackpot rolled in one. And that happened late last week when the foundation began secretively calling the latest recipients of its five-year, no-strings-attached fellowships. Their names were made public last night.
Susan Alcock, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, could not remember her age when the MacArthur people asked: "I could remember I was as old as Jack Benny used to say he was, but I couldn't remember what that was."
David Isay, a 34-year-old independent producer of radio documentaries, insisted in an interview: "I'm actually not a genius. I'm just surrounded by these incredibly brilliant people and I try to help them."
Samuel Mockbee, 55, an architect and professor at Auburn University who with his students builds what the foundation called "surprising, functional and beautiful structures" in one of Alabama's poorest counties, went out and threw fastballs with his 14-year-old son.
Ben Katchor, a Manhattan cartoonist in whose syndicated comic strips the foundation found what it called an ironic, compelling and bittersweet nostalgia for the detritus of city life, said last Wednesday that he was feeling no need to celebrate.
"I'm very happy every night," Mr. Katchor said. "I mean, I'm doing what I want to do."
One of the odd aspects of their good fortune is that the foundation swore them to secrecy until 11:30 p.m. yesterday, so reporters could interview them before their names were made public. They could tell only their spouses or an intimate friend. So some found themselves giggling at the hairdresser's or sobbing in meetings, required to explain only with, "No, no, I'm O.K."
"I don't know if I should tell you that I broke the rule, but I couldn't quite keep it in the bag," confessed Carl Safina of Islip, N.Y., a vice president of the National Audubon Society who was tracked down at a dinner party off Vancouver, British Columbia. He was awfully quiet, someone remarked after he returned to the table. So Mr. Safina swore them to silence, and then told them.
Susan Marshall, a choreographer, said: "In one sense it feels like I just want to reflect on my work, like I have mental breathing room that I don't normally have the luxury of. Then it's this other feeling, as though someone has just thrown down the gauntlet. And it's a great feeling. It's just lovely that something is expected of you."
The fellowships are given each year to people who show exceptional merit and the promise of continued creative work. The money comes without conditions, intended simply as "seed money or venture capital for intellectual, social and artistic endeavors," the foundation says, to eliminate constraints on the recipients' productivity or creativity.
The foundation raised the stipend this year to a flat $500,000 for everyone; it used to range from $200,000 to $375,000, depending on the recipient's age.
The latest group -- 12 women and 13 men ages 28 to 55 -- includes, among others, K. Christopher Beard, a paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh; Deborah Willis, a historian of photography at the Smithsonian Institution who works on the history of African-American photography; Anne Carson, a poet and essayist and professor of classics at McGill University in Montreal; and Peter Hayes, executive director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development in Berkeley, Calif.
Also in the group are Cecilia Munoz, a leader in immigration and civil rights policy; Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist who works on climate change and the relationship between science and policy; Matthew Rabin, a behavioral economist at the University of California; Patricia J. Williams, a Columbia University law professor and commentator on race in America, and Laura Otis, a professor of English at Hofstra University whose work crosses the boundaries of comparative literature, the history of science and social history.
Few of them knew how they would spend the money. Many said it would buy them time to think. Others said it would bring some long-elusive security to their organization or to their colleagues or even to them.
As for Dr. Alcock, she eventually remembered. She is 39. "It took a little legwork," she said. "I asked my husband, 'How old am I?' "

HEADLINE: New System Is Planned For Online Bond Sales

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said yesterday that they would form an electronic bond market, the latest effort to offer fixed-income trading on the Internet.
The three firms, which arrange about a third of new United States bond sales, said the marketplace, BondBook L.L.C., would start trading municipal and corporate bonds by the fourth quarter. 
 Investors said electronic bond trading -- allowing them to trade with dealers and one another -- would help compensate for dwindling dealer inventories that have made buying bonds more time-consuming and costly.
The venture "will result in improved market structure and greater market efficiency," said Tim Ferguson, head of investments and technology at Putnam Investments.
The varied maturities, credit qualities and other traits of bonds have made it harder to fit them into online trading formats than it has stocks. There are four million fixed-income securities and about 10,000 listed stocks.
Still, bonds are following stocks online for both individual and institutional investors. Last week, Charles Schwab, with 6.9 million accounts, said that a new service would let retail investors trade bonds on the Web and gain access to new issues.
Electronic trades accounted for 6 percent of the $13.5 trillion fixed-income market last year, as electronic trading networks rose to 39 from 11 two years ago, according to the Bond Market Association. That compares with the 22 percent of the Nasdaq composite index shares that were traded electronically last year.
About 70 electronic bond-trading services have been announced in the last two years, according to Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. The prospect of losing clients to upstart rivals and a desire for lower costs is leading securities firms to push their bond-trading business to the Internet.
Credit Suisse First Boston, for instance, has invested in Trading Edge, which started an online trading system for junk bonds last year.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
Firmly for Death Penalty, Gore Is Open to a Review

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Despite his longstanding support for the death penalty, Vice President Al Gore suggested yesterday that recent studies showing drastic error rates in court appeals of death penalty cases could prompt a fresh evaluation of the nation's use of capital punishment.
"If there is a study that shows a large number of mistakes, that has to make you uncomfortable," Mr. Gore said. "I have assumed up until very recently that the mistakes were rare and unusual." 
 Mr. Gore, speaking with members of the editorial board, a reporter and editors of The New York Times, chose his words carefully and did not suggest that he was ready to abandon his support for the death penalty. And he said he would not impose on federal capital cases the kind of moratorium that Gov. George Ryan has imposed in Illinois.
Still, he acknowledged that recent events -- including the moratorium in Illinois, a new study from Columbia University that found that two out of three sentences in capital-case appeals were set aside, and the release of some death row inmates who were exonerated through the use of DNA technology -- were prompting a fresh evaluation of the subject, if not by him, then by the country.
"If further investigation shows that the Columbia estimates are correct," he said, "then that will have a major impact on the way the country feels about not necessarily the death penalty itself but certainly the way in which our judicial system is arriving at these conclusions."
Mr. Gore's meeting with the editorial board was part of a daylong media blitz of national news organizations. The sessions coincided with the opening of his three-week "progress and prosperity tour," a concerted effort to get credit for the nation's booming economy as well as to kick-start his campaign into a positive yet aggressive mode before the convention.
The economy was clearly Mr. Gore's message of the day. He even stopped himself short at one point in the interview as he was about to "commit news," as he put it. The first question posed to him concerned his assessment of Mr. Bush as an opponent. In response, he recapped his economic plan in an answer lasting about 15 minutes.
Mr. Gore's comments on the death penalty were his most extensive to date on the topic in this presidential campaign. Despite a handful of votes to the contrary while he was in Congress, he has generally supported the death penalty since he was first elected to the House in 1976, and his support for it was viewed as a political plus in 1992 when Bill Clinton chose him as his running mate.
Still, the death penalty is a topic that Mr. Gore has virtually ignored during this campaign, even as it has swirled around Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his expected Republican rival. Mr. Bush has presided over 131 executions, the most of any governor since the death penalty was reinstated, although he recently issued a stay of execution.
Aside from the fact that Mr. Gore has never been in the position to sign a death warrant, there appears to be little difference between the two candidates' positions. And Mr. Gore said yesterday that he was not prepared to criticize Mr. Bush over it.
"I don't know the answer to your question," he said when asked if he would make an issue of it. "If the record shows that he has done a terrible job, then I'm sure that would be a legitimate issue. I haven't reached that conclusion."
Diann Rust-Tierney, director of the capital punishment project for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a telephone interview later that Mr. Gore's comments represented "a higher level of thought and discussion around this issue" than pro-death-penalty candidates have exhibited in the past. "It sounds like he is at least thinking about it," she said. "It sounds like there is some sense of progress in his thinking."
In an apparent attempt to neutralize questions about earlier votes that some have said indicated a change in his position on the death penalty, Mr. Gore volunteered: "There have been a number of cases where proposals came before the House of Representatives and the Senate when I voted against capital punishment. But those votes were the exception rather than the rule. I have insisted upon certain criteria before I'm willing to support the death penalty. But where those criteria are present, I have always supported it."
In the 75-minute interview, Mr. Gore generally refrained from direct criticism of Mr. Bush, saying at one point, "I choose not to attach any elegant epithets to my opponent." But he also said he believed the Republicans, and by implication Mr. Bush, would advance a right-wing agenda if they won the White House.
He said that after Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, the evangelists, had met with Mr. Bush, the two were "happy as clams" and were not saying anything publicly to contradict the impression that Mr. Bush had agreed to appease them.
"I infer from that," Mr. Gore said, "that the basic arrangement is that the agenda per noted in the closing days of the Republican primary contest is still very much the real agenda, at least where the Supreme Court appointments are concerned, and that those who are most interested in that agenda have agreed to be completely silent about it during this period of the campaign."
The vice president suggested that while he would not apply a litmus test -- usually code to refer to a person's stand on abortion rights -- to his judicial nominees, he would seek those who supported abortion rights. "I'm not in favor of specific, narrow litmus tests," he said. "But we all know that there are ways to ascertain with high confidence the general approach that potential justices will take to the Constitution."
Mr. Gore, who said the next president's ability to name three or four Supreme Court justices was one of the top issues in the election, noted in passing that "Governor Bush has said his favorite justice is Antonin Scalia; mine would be Thurgood Marshall." The analogy was perhaps slightly inapt. It was not clear whether Mr. Bush was picking his all-time favorite justice or just those on the bench now, while the late Mr. Marshall is no longer on the bench.
Throughout the interview, Mr. Gore offered an uncharacteristically modest assessment of his grasp of detail. These assertions seemed an attempt to put the brakes on his tendency to veer toward the tutorial and didactic. "You're taking me outside my depths," he said of a discussion on missile technology. "I do not claim expertise," he said of a discussion of the Microsoft case.
And, in response to a question from William Safire, the language authority and New York Times columnist, about choice in matters of privacy, Mr. Gore replied: "Along with roughly 270 million other Americans, I use words more carelessly than Bill Safire, and in choosing the word 'choose,' I did not inform myself of the deeper, more subtle meanings, which I can now see clearly."
He went on to say that consumers should have "absolute protection" of privacy concerning their medical and financial records. "I do not think that your bank account and your checking -- the history of what checks you write to whom -- ought to be marketable," he said, adding: "I don't think the current law goes far enough in protecting them."
At the same time, he seemed to enjoy showing off his knowledge. At one point, Mr. Gore was asked about his tactical positioning in a question referring to Napoleon's military strategy, and surprised listeners by saying, "Napoleon also invented canned food."
(For the record, Napoleon did not exactly invent canning, but he helped popularize it by offering a reward for anyone who could come up with a way to prevent the spoiling of military food supplies.)

HEADLINE: Incumbent Doesn't Need the Job;
But a Representative Runs Again to Keep a District Intact

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: CORNING, N.Y.

 BODY:
As Amo Houghton stepped into the shower a couple of months ago, he knew no one could begrudge him retirement. At 73, he had little left to prove: the former head of a Fortune 500 corporation, a wealthy Brahmin with a social conscience, a moderate congressman of grace with a spiritual bent.
But Mr. Houghton also knew that if he retired, his absence would make his 31st Congressional District, a rural stretch across upstate New York's Southern Tier, significantly more vulnerable than it already was to being reapportioned out of existence in the next two years. 
 What's a patrician multimillionaire to do?
With shower water beating down upon his white hair, Mr. Houghton decided. He stepped out of the stall, he later recalled, and in his altogether told his wife, Priscilla, that he had some news that would disrupt their plans. He was going to run for an eighth term, which, in the 31st District, pretty much meant he was going to serve an eighth term.
"We're just going to have to work our life around it," Mr. Houghton said later. "See our children, our grandchildren, and then have our own private time in different ways."
Mr. Houghton's choice did not receive the attention of those recently made by Rudolph W. Giuliani to remain the mayor of New York and Representative Rick A. Lazio to run for the Senate. But it has won Republican sighs of relief in Washington, where the party's leaders fret over preserving their paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives.
The decision has also stifled political competition in the district. No Democrat has yet offered to be sacrificed on Election Day. "It's incumbency and money," said Richard Stevenson, the Democratic chairman for Cattaraugus County. Besides, he added, a lot of the would-be opponents "are friends of Amo."
But the friendships and respect earned by Mr. Houghton might not be enough to protect his seat from the mathematics of politics.
The state's rural districts are continuing to bleed residents. If, as expected, the current census forces the state's political map to be redrawn with two fewer Congressional seats, an obvious casualty would be some old silo of a district: where young people are fleeing, where the population could easily be split between two neighboring districts, where the representative is ready to call it a day.
Say, a district like the 31st.
In the halls of Congress, where independence is seen as an annoying tic, Amo Houghton stands apart. How many congressmen come from a family worth as much as $1.6 billion, but whose idea of motoring extravagance is a Ford Taurus station wagon? Who allowed an Episcopal bishop -- M. Thomas Shaw, who heads the Diocese of Boston -- to join his staff so he could see the workings of Congress up close? Who is as likely to talk about his friendship with Donna, the owner of a smoky diner here on East Market Street, as he is about his friendship with Nelson Mandela?
"It's a pretty dull story," Mr. Houghton said.
He is reluctant to be defined by his wealth, but he knows that his family legacy is as much a part of Southern Tier lore as that Mark Twain is buried in Elmira, or that the Mafia convened in Apalachin, of all places, in 1957. The Houghton family founded the Corning Glass Works, one of the state's largest employers during the last 150 years. His grandfather was a congressman, his father an ambassador to France. Other families might frequent their local library; the Houghton family endowed the rare books collection at Harvard University.
After a two-year stint in the Marines and a bachelor's and a master's degree from Harvard, he returned to Corning to work in the family business. He was eventually the chief executive for nearly 20 years, then retired at 60 to choose a path of public service: either be a missionary in Africa, or run for Congress.
This chief executive's hero was not a Morgan or a Carnegie, but Albert Schweitzer, whose desire to make his life "an argument" struck a chord with Mr. Houghton.
"I was always fascinated by that," he said. "Being a chairman of a Fortune 500 company and then going and doing something in Africa, which was something that I really toyed with after college. I would have loved to have done that."
He paused a moment. "It would have been fun, I tell you," he said. "But that's not where I am."
In the end, Mr. Houghton reached a kind of compromise. He and his wife continued to spend time in and money on a village in Zimbabwe. But he chose politics as the forum in which to present his life's argument.
That year, 1986, his Democratic opponent, Larry M. Himelein, tried to portray Mr. Houghton as a lord of the manor trying to mingle with the common folk. But Mr. Houghton's easy and self-deprecating manner thwarted the stereotype in that and later campaigns, so much so that he usually won more than two-thirds of the vote.
"I don't live the life of the beautiful people," he said. "I just feel a part of the community."
Mr. Houghton has distinguished himself in Washington as an independent moderate who cannot be counted on to hew to the leadership's desires. Although he prides himself on being a loyal Republican, he has often challenged party leaders in his efforts to raise the minimum wage, defend the National Endowment for the Arts and generally support abortion rights. Most famously, he was one of only four House Republicans to vote against all four articles of impeachment against President Clinton in December 1998.
At times he seems out of place in a political arena that thrives on confrontation and aggression. Last year, he helped establish a bipartisan retreat for members of Congress and their families in Hershey, Pa., in the belief that civility and personal friendship would beget constructive legislation.
"He's a principled throwback," said a former top aide to another congressman.
Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a Republican from Utica, framed his admiration another way. "This guy could be doing anything he wants, cruise the Caribbean, anything," Mr. Boehlert said. "He doesn't lack for satisfying all his material needs. But that's not Amo. He's genuinely concerned about making the world a better place, and I mean the world."
The wealthy and urbane Mr. Houghton represents a district that a political guidebook calls "one of the nation's forgotten stretches of territory": a place of forests and dairy farms, of one-stop villages and small cities, some charmingly quaint, others disturbingly distressed.
There are some major businesses prospering, among them Corning, which is now a public company (the Houghtons own substantial shares of its stock). It has shifted its focus from glasswork to ceramics technology, including fiber-optic products. But the region at large is struggling economically, he said.
"You've got dairy farming that is dying, you've got the oil and gas industry that's almost totally dead," he said. He listed the names of local companies that had shut down -- Dunkirk Ice Cream and Air Products, among others -- as though he were reciting a roster of the dead.
Barking his thoughts like the company head he once was, Mr. Houghton asserted that the region had to move beyond its industrial and agricultural bases to one concentrating on communications technology. "If we try to recreate the success of the last 50 years," he said, "we're going to go right down the tubes."
The district's small metropolitan areas -- Olean, Elmira, Salamanca -- have lost about 5 percent of their residents in the last decade. And Jamestown, the largest city in the district, lost 15 percent of its population from 1990 to 1996.
"So we've got a problem here," he said.
One dimension of that problem is politics. The Constitution requires that a census be taken every decade, and that the country's 435 Congressional districts be redrawn to adjust for population shifts. When Mr. Houghton's grandfather went to Congress in 1919, New York had 43 Congressional districts. It now has 31, and is expected to lose 2 more in the reapportionment after the current census.
Once the federal government tells the state how many Congressional seats it has lost, the leaders of the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly will huddle to decide which districts survive. Creative redrawing of boundary lines is often undertaken. One district might be rectangular, another the shape of Bullwinkle the Moose. The ultimate plan requires the approval of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican.
The prevailing theory in New York is that the Republicans will have to sacrifice a district from upstate, while the Democrats will have to forfeit one downstate. One former Congressional aide described the bipartisan dialogue as, "We shot our puppy, now you shoot yours."
"It tends to get a little interesting," said John McArdle, the spokesman for Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.
Tim Storey, a research analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, agreed: "No matter how safe they think their relationship is with the state leadership, they all begin to worry about it."
Mr. Houghton had planned to step aside this year, he said, but his heir apparent suddenly dropped out of the running. With no incumbent, the district would surely disappear. Jamestown and Olean would meld into a Buffalo district, Corning and Elmira into a Rochester district, and the area's rural needs would be overshadowed by more urban matters.
If he stepped down, "This would absolutely be a Christmas banquet," Mr. Houghton said. "People would drool over this area. I don't know if I can save it, but I'm going to go right down to the wire trying to do it." Mr. Houghton has already told Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno, in forceful but civil terms, that he hoped his personal sacrifice would not be forgotten.
Whether the avuncular guardian of the 31st District is successful will not be known for a year or more. But he expressed confidence with a certain rural refinement: "This isn't my first time around the barn."

Getting By In Shadow Of a Boom

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
YOU half expect to find the door covered with cobwebs and a couple of clerks sitting around playing solitaire on the computer. But even before the unemployment office opens here Monday morning, 20 exiles from the job-rich economy are awaiting sanctuary.
There's an account analyst who recently lost his job with a firm that advises companies in bankruptcy. There's a financial counselor whose job at a health clinic was eliminated in a state financing cut. There's a former Toys "R" Us salesman. 
 "You hear on TV that there's 3 percent unemployment," Nicholas Riccio said, "but a lot of people don't believe it."
Mr. Riccio is one of them. He recently lost his job as a metal polisher in a medical device factory that suffered competition from overseas. Suddenly he found himself on the unemployment line. "I always had a job," Mr. Riccio said. "I'm 73, but I'm looking for a job. I don't want to sit around."
Unemployment figures remain stellar, even if they have slipped recently. The national rate has risen just slightly from the 30-year low of 3.9 percent recorded earlier this year. Here in Union County, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, just below the state's 3.8 percent rate.
But the unemployment office is still open for business, and the sidewalk outside is a chat room for tales of woe often muffled in the booming economy.
"It's a little bit odd standing in this line," Kathy Cherry said. "I've been working since I'm 16." She worked steadily for 25 years, the last 9 as a financial counselor at a state-financed hospital clinic, until it shut down in April.
She knows there are jobs to be had, but it is hard without a college degree. "I guess they're really going to the college grads with M.A.'s and B.A.'s," she said. "They really want education over experience."
BUT even among the unemployed in this working-class city, where the job market improved with the recent opening of a huge discount mall, the economy breeds optimism.
"Nowadays you can find a job anywhere," said William Montalbo, 23, a junior at Union County College. He lost his job at Toys "R" Us a few months ago (he said the boss didn't like him) and collected unemployment benefits for a month before taking a job in cellular phone sales. He was at the employment office on Monday to help a friend navigate the system. "It's a benefit you have," Mr. Montalbo said of unemployment payments. "Use it. Why not?"
Mr. Montalbo's touch-and-go view of unemployment fits government officials' vision of how the benefit should be used. But the office on North Broad Street still draws the hard-core unemployed whose misfortunes seem impervious to economic trends.
Karaema Thomas, 27, said that since losing her job at McDonald's a few months back, she has worked as a prostitute in Newark. A high school graduate, Ms. Thomas said that she once worked as a home health aide, but that her license lapsed while she was recovering from head injuries after being mugged. "I've degraded myself, but I have to eat," she said. "It's hard." She was denied unemployment benefits, but said she would not consider applying for welfare because "it's not a lot of money and you have to go through verbal abuse."
Ms. Thomas was with a friend, Mecca Daniels, 25, who said she had sold drugs for money and spent three years in prison. The women said they struck out applying for jobs and were mystified that some considered these flush times. "The economy stinks," Ms. Thomas said. "You have to do what you have to do to get by."
For most people, getting by is easier with the economy strong.
A 25-year-old man named Namil said he started playing the markets while collecting unemployment benefits and seeking a better computer job. "I got into investments, commodities futures," he said. "Soybeans, cotton, corn." He lost his computer tech support job a few months ago. He said he was working part-time jobs he hoped would lead to a permanent work. "I need a little more experience," said Namil, who would not give his last name. "Another year, I'll be fine. This is just temporary."
No one knows what temporary means in today's economy better than Patti Jackson, a clerk in the unemployment office for 11 years until she was laid off last month. With claims declining, Ms. Jackson, 47, said she went on unemployment herself, hoping the economy would take care of her one way or the other.
It did. The unemployment office apparently needed extra help this week. So Monday morning, Ms. Jackson was sitting behind a desk here, with a big smile for her former brethren on the unemployment line.
"This is a transitional time," she said.

Belaboring, Not Bedazzling

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
Al Gore met yesterday with Times writers and editors. The first question put to him was: How do you assess George W. Bush as a candidate?
The vice president spoke 1,565 words, really, really slowly, with glacial pauses between each word. He propounded and expounded for more than 15 minutes, touching on such diverse topics as the human genome, the ice-free future of the Arctic Ocean, the "Star Wars" journey, the climate of New York City, federal entitlements, the climate of Atlanta, embassy security, the climate of Illinois, Individual Development Accounts, the climate of Oklahoma and the state of the U.S. economy in 1835. But despite some prodding, he never did get around to answering. 
 He simply kept exhaustively not answering in that formal voice that sounds as though he has to guide his listeners by the hand, no matter how well they know the subject.
All . . . those . . . drawn . . . out . . . syllables . . . signifying . . . nothing . . . had . . . a . . . soporific . . . effect . . . on . . . me. But when I snapped back to attention, I hadn't missed a thing.
The vice president was apologizing for being long-winded and belaboring points, even as he continued to belabor long-winded points.
Once eyes began to glaze, Mr. Gore happily slipped in his new happy maxims: "Prosperity and progress," "Ideas and not insults," the Popeyesque "I am who I am," and, on his lack of appeal to women, "All in due time."
Asked if Governor Bush had made better use of the last two months, Farmer Al sanguinely offered this Chauncey Gardiner moment: "When you plant seeds you don't know what the crop will be like just by the way the planting has occurred."
It was enough to make you miss the old slashing Al.
One editor tried to get past the filibuster by asking: "Well, is campaigning going to be about ideas or is it going to be about mostly personality and character?"
Mr. Gore replied with a treatise on post-World-War-II America and another plug for his plans for clean air, clean energy and health care.
And that's the problem with this race. One guy says a lot but never says anything. The other guy doesn't say a lot and never says anything.
One knows a lot but is afraid to offer opinions that will mar his chance to be president. The other doesn't know a lot so he just lets his brain trust script opinions that will not mar his chance to be president.
An individual who overcalculates versus a group that overcalculates.
Take the death penalty. Mr. Bush opened himself up on the issue by first bragging that all the prisoners executed on his watch in Texas were guilty. Then he issued his first reprieve in a move that seemed politically inspired.
But Mr. Gore is so afraid of reviving the old Democratic label of being soft on capital punishment that he can't capitalize on the issue despite fresh evidence that the administration of the death penalty is seriously flawed. A new Columbia University study found that two of every three death sentences are overturned on appeal.
Asked repeatedly at The Times whether he is comfortable with the death penalty now, Mr. Gore weaved and waffled.
On his way out he was asked by Brent Staples, an editorial writer: What margin of error for mistaken executions could you accept?
That should be easy to answer, even for someone who likes to hedge: Zero. But Mr. Gore simply reiterated that he thought the level of error was low.
One question he answered succinctly and maybe even candidly. After some frustrating exchanges on missile defense and the death penalty, Michael Oreskes, the Washington bureau chief, asked him: "Is it possible for a candidate to be too careful?"
"Yes," Mr. Gore said, adding carefully: "Did my answer sound too careful?"
He was asked if he noticed a "disconnect" between what he was talking about and what Americans are interested in. Napoleon, the questioner said, observed that if you position yourself on the right ground, you win the battle.
"Napoleon," Mr. Gore shot back, "also invented canned food."
At long last, an answer that didn't sound canned.

HEADLINE: In Gas Prices, Misery and Mystery

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 13

 BODY:
Gasoline is so expensive in the Midwest that a retired railroad worker in Cleveland says he had to cancel his annual summer drive to visit his daughter in San Francisco.
A volunteer agency that delivers meals to shut-ins in Milwaukee cannot afford to pay its drivers enough to fill their tanks. 
 A florist in Urbana, Ill., is talking about raising what he charges to deliver his roses and carnations.
And in suburban Chicago, Kathy Stachnik says she now considers putting gas in her blue 1997 Honda Accord an "evil necessity."
"Whenever I stand at the pumps these days, I'm just furious," said Ms. Stachnik, 38, as she bought 10 gallons of gas at an Amoco in Arlington Heights for $2.25 a gallon. "I know that something fishy is going on with these prices."
Gasoline prices in the Midwest have risen sharply in recent weeks, jumping as much as 50 cents a gallon and far outstripping increases in the rest of the country. In Chicago and Milwaukee, drivers are paying more than $2 a gallon, the first time prices have ever soared that high in the United States, analysts say.
In recent days, the federal government has been trying to determine why the prices in the Midwest have risen so steeply. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department met with oil refiners on Monday in Washington. And the Clinton administration and the House Judiciary Committee have asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into whether the increases involve price gouging or collusion.
"We don't have good explanations," said Robert Perciasepe, the environmental agency's assistant administrator for air and pollution programs. "We're not seeing this anywhere else in the country."
Gas prices increased across the country in the last few weeks as the summer driving season began. Gasoline inventories are being depleted, and new requirements for cleaner-burning gasoline became effective on June 1. But the spikes in the Midwest are especially steep.
On Friday, the most recent day for which figures are available, the average price of self-serve regular gasoline in Chicago was $2.13 a gallon, up from $1.37 a gallon in January, according to Trilby Lundberg, an analyst who compiles the Lundberg Survey of gas station prices. By comparison, prices on Long Island averaged $1.67 a gallon last week, up from $1.39 in January. And prices in Los Angeles averaged $1.56 a gallon in June, up from $1.29 in January.
Industry representatives say the price increases in the Midwest are a result of several factors.
The most significant, they say, is the new federal requirement for cleaner-burning gasoline, known as RFG-2. In the Midwest, unlike in other regions, the additive oil refiners use to make their gasoline comply with the regulations is ethanol. Because ethanol evaporates quickly, it requires a special formulation of gasoline, said Edward H. Murphy, general manager for downstream operations at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.
"It's more difficult to produce that gasoline," Mr. Murphy said. "As a result, production is significantly lower."
Another factor, industry officials say, was the rupture in March of a Texas pipeline that Midwest refineries depended on for their supply. The pipeline was repaired two weeks later, but it is still operating at only 80 percent capacity.
A third factor is a court ruling that the Unocal Corporation can collect royalties on a particular type of cleaner-burning fuel. That has prompted smaller refineries to curtail RFG-2 production to avoid paying royalties to Unocal, industry analysts say.
"In a situation where supplies are tight, and you have relatively inelastic demand for gasoline, the price increase you need that occurs in the market is disproportionately large," said Mr. Murphy, who said some refineries are carting in the fuel they need by barge from Nova Scotia or the Gulf states. "If the price of lemons goes up, you move to limes. If the price of coffee goes up, you move to tea. But with gasoline, consumers don't adjust very quickly in a very short term. Obviously you don't go out and trade in your brand new Ford Excursion for a Toyota Camry."
Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department acknowledge that all these factors play a role in increasing gas prices somewhat. But they say none is sufficient to account for the precipitous price jumps in cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.
"All of these may have some impact but they don't seem to explain the size of the disparity," Mr. Perciasepe said. For example, he said the cost of producing cleaner gasoline with ethanol should lead to only about a 5 cent to 8 cent increase in gas prices. "Whether people are taking advantage of some of these situations is something that we hope to be able to understand better."
A senior official at the Energy Department said that although the supply of oil was tight in the Midwest, "we weren't persuaded by the arguments of the refiners. Generally speaking, all of the large suppliers say they have adequate supplies to serve the demand."
The official added, "It has the administration very concerned, obviously."
Sam Stratman, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said that oil companies had years to prepare for the increased costs of the RFG-2 regulations.
"This is a complicated issue," Mr. Stratman said. "It deals with issues of supply and demand and regulatory changes mandated by E.P.A., and you wonder, have these changes given oil companies a chance to gouge consumers?"
Of course, Americans still have the lowest gas prices in the world. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which controls nearly half of the global oil supply, will meet next week to decide on whether to increase production.
Although the prices in Chicago and Milwaukee are the highest on record, they are still lower than gas prices were at their peak in March 1981, when the national average price of a gallon of gasoline was $2.67, if adjusted for inflation, Ms. Lundberg said.
That is hardly comforting to beleaguered drivers across the Midwest these days.
"It's outrageous," said Colleen Posinger, 44, of Streamwood, Ill. "I'm really upset about the gas prices, because we told our 10-year-old daughter that we'd drive to South Dakota this summer. The vacation was already planned, so I guess we'll just have to take the crunch."
Others, like Adam Matavovszky, the retired railroad worker in Cleveland, decided they could not afford their vacations.
In Milwaukee, Goodwill Industries, which delivers meals to the elderly and also takes disabled people to workshops and training programs, has been hit by $23,000 in extra fuel costs this year, said Roger Sherman, vice president for human services. He said the organization had asked for emergency assistance from the Milwaukee County Department of Aging and might have to cut back on transportation.
"We are running 150 percent over budget," Mr. Sherman said. "We have not kept up with the rising gasoline prices."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Slower Retail Sales Increase Optimism on Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as investors seized on the latest retail sales report as evidence that the economy was slowing just enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged at its next meeting.
Investors' optimism over the state of the economy helped the market break out of a slump that started after the Wall Street investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein cut its rating and earnings estimates for Hewlett-Packard. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.63 points, to 10,621.84. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 23.44 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,469.44, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 83.15 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,851.06.
In a session in which the market struggled to find direction, stocks rose after the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, applauded the use of technology to enhance the productivity of American workers.
In remarks before the New York Association for Business Economics, Mr. Greenspan said much of the improvement in productivity was attributed to basic changes in the economy, rather than temporary factors that could disappear.
While Mr. Greenspan did not discuss interest rates, many investors took his comments as a sign that the Fed was growing more comfortable with the pace of the economy's growth.
The latest sign that the economy is returning to a more sustainable pace came from the Commerce Department, which said retail sales fell for the second consecutive month in May, the latest sign that six increases in interest rates by the Fed are slowing consumer spending.
What is more, revised figures showed that retail sales fell 0.6 percent in April, much deeper than the government estimated one month ago. The combination of two weaker-than-expected months at the nation's stores allowed investors to hope that the Fed might hold rates steady at its next meeting on June 28.
Hewlett-Packard fell 7, to 119, crimping the performance of the Dow. Sanford C. Bernstein lowered its rating on Hewlett-Packard to "market perform" from "buy" and reduced earnings estimates.
The market's harsh punishment of Hewlett-Packard indicated that investors remained nervous about corporate profits, which are generally threatened by rising interest rates, analysts said.

Treasury Prices Decline
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices posted their biggest drop in more than a month after the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William McDonough, warned that inflation could accelerate further.
"McDonough came out swinging on growth and situations that could lead to greater inflation," said Alan Day, who has been buying corporate bonds for their higher yields as he manages $1 billion at the Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt. "Inflation is still the story" for policy makers, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32, to 104 9/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.87 percent on Monday. The 10-year note fell 10/32, to 102 27/32, while the yield jumped to 6.11 percent from 6.06 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ambassador to U.N. Calls for Changes in Peacekeeping

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 13

 BODY:
Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke said today that the United Nations must transform its civilian-run peacekeeping department into a larger and more effective military-style operation if it is to avoid repeated humiliations in the riskier missions it is undertaking around the world.
The peacekeeping efforts need to be bolstered with military professionals, in New York and in the field, Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview reflecting on his first year as the United States representative to the United Nations. 
 He said that the reliance on polyglot pick-up armies must stop, and that the United Nations be allowed to resume "borrowing" experts from national militaries, a practice a third-world majority of nations curtailed several years ago in the interest of creating more jobs for their candidates.
Toughening up the peacekeeping department, which Mr. Holbrooke says he intends to promote along with his campaign to get economically healthy nations to foot more of the peacekeeping bill, is not an easy task here or a welcome policy in Washington. Conservatives in Congress see the specter of a United Nations army on American soil. Developing nations, with a majority in the General Assembly, can block any substantial reform of a department they cannot control.
But Mr. Holbrooke, who said his views did not represent a change in administration policy on peacekeeping, has an unofficial ally in Secretary General Kofi Annan, a former head of United Nations peacekeeping who has had bitter experiences of failures in the field linked to the limitations of the stripped-down peacekeeping department of 400 employees -- half the staff of the organization's department of public information.
Mr. Annan has already asked for the power to restore the right to borrow military experts whose salaries are paid by governments, against the objections of the third world.
"The peacekeeping department is effectively the U.N.'s ministry of defense," Mr. Holbrooke said. "They're running worldwide operations and they're stretched to the bone. They work around the clock. They don't have sufficient technical expertise. No serious military force would have been sent out with the command and control and communications structures that the U.N. has sent into some areas."
Mr. Holbrooke's comments came as Mr. Annan offered a bleak prognosis for a planned operation in Congo.
He asked the Security Council today to order all foreign troops out of Congo and threatened to use economic sanctions or military force against any of the combatants -- soldiers from six nations and several rebel groups -- who do not stop fighting.
Military force, however, is exactly what the United Nations cannot adequately muster, Mr. Holbrooke said. "Some of the most basic components of responsible military planning are lacking in the U.N. system because of the resource crunch, the lack of qualified military personnel and, above all, the fact that the peacekeeping department has not risen commensurately in size or quality with the dimensions of the challenges."
The United Nations now has major operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Kosovo, with new missions planned for southern Lebanon as well as for Congo. The Organization of African Unity is expected to ask in coming days for a mission of up to 5,000 observers on the Ethiopian-Eritrean cease-fire line.
"So, of the big five -- about to become the big six -- five-and-a-half of them didn't exist a year ago," Mr. Holbrooke said.
"Peacekeeping needs three things: More financial resources, more and better-trained military and civilian personnel in the field and a coherent command structure overseas with better central direction out of New York," he said.
He added that all member nations, including the United States, should be giving peacekeeping more support. The United States is criticized sharply here because it owes the organization more than $1 billion, most of it in peacekeeping arrears.
For the last six years, the Clinton administration, with an eye on Congressional critics, has been reluctant to aid peacekeeping in ways that Mr. Annan says the United Nations most needs help.
Last month, the secretary general was unable to get any direct American assistance for Sierra Leone, where he badly needed the kind of official planning and coordination skills Britain ultimately provided even before it sent troops.
When Americans offered military aircraft to ferry soldiers from other nations to Sierra Leone, the Pentagon's charter rates for the job -- based on a complicated formula involving not only the cost of the plane but the numbers of passengers allowed on each flight given conditions in Freetown -- were far higher than those of commercial airlines or private charter companies, officials said.
Mr. Holbrooke's vision of professional peacekeeping runs against fears in Congress of an international army outside American control, and there is wariness in developing nations that a stronger United Nations military arm would allow big powers to run the world in the guise of peacekeeping.
Mr. Holbrooke said he would welcome a high-level debate in the United States on the issue of United Nations peacekeeping as a factor in American national security, "but not during a presidential campaign." Four years ago, Republican candidates' attacks on the organization eroded American support for the United Nations. Many Americans had already turned against peacekeeping because of the deaths of United States soldiers in Somalia.
Mr. Holbrooke's proposals for a new look at peacekeeping -- a process that would sooner or later require an interminable debate in the General Assembly -- come as a panel of experts is examining peacekeeping options for Secretary General Annan and the United Nations is selecting a new head of its peacekeeping department. Bernard Miyet, a French civilian whose contract expires later this year, is likely to be replaced with another French expert, officials say. A change in leadership could allow for some changes to be made outside the General Assembly.
As if to underline Mr. Holbrooke's worst fears about the crumbling of peacekeeping, Secretary General Annan told the Security Council in his terse report today that he is being forced by circumstances to rethink the Congo operation.
More troops with better equipment may be needed in Congo, United Nations officials say. A total force of about 5,500 -- monitors, soldiers and a large support staff for a country with few roads or public services -- had been planned.
But with fighting continuing, and with both the Congolese government of President Laurent Kabila and his armed opponents becoming increasingly uncooperative with United Nations teams, there are fears of a debacle like the one in Sierra Leone last month, when hundreds of United Nations troops were taken hostage.
Mr. Annan also included in his report examples of "serious logistical deficiencies" in troops already promised for Congo.
"One country which had undertaken to provide four airfield crash-rescue units subsequently withdrew the offer and proposed only one unit instead," he wrote. "Another, which was supposed to provide an infantry battalion, has none of the 20 armored personnel carriers required, and lacks significant amounts of other materiel, including generators, engineering equipment and radio-equipped Jeeps."
Mr. Annan recommended that while planning for eventual deployment could go on in New York, none of the basic requirements for deployment -- a cease-fire on the ground, the provision of bases and general cooperation by Congo and the recruitment of troops with "adequate strength, equipment and training" -- had been met. No force could be sent under such adverse conditions, the secretary general concluded.

KOSOVO: BANNED PAPER IS BACK -- An Albanian-language newspaper temporarily banned by Kosovo's chief United Nations administrator reappeared carrying the same article that led to the ban -- an account the United Nations says contributed to the killing of a Serbian employee. Two weeks after The Dita accused a Serbian translator for the United Nations in April of membership in a Serbian paramilitary unit that expelled Albanians last year, the man was found stabbed to death. (AP) 

SPAIN: RUSSIAN SEEKS INVESTMENT -- President Vladimir Putin arrived in Spain for a two-day visit where he is meeting with officials and business people to urge Spanish investment in his country. At a banquet, King Juan Carlos offered Spain's help in consolidating political and economic reforms in Russia and called on Moscow to ensure freedom and justice for its citizens. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
BRAZIL: MAYOR RESTORED TO OFFICE -- A Brazilian court ordered Celso Pitta, the fallen mayor of Sao Paulo, back into office less than three weeks after ousting him amid a flurry of corruption accusations. The ruling by the Supreme Justice Tribunal in Brasilia can be appealed to Brazil's Supreme Court. (Reuters)
 
BOLIVIA: CALL FOR NEW UNIVERSITY -- Tens of thousands of students and parents marched through the capital, La Paz, demanding that the government create a new independent university. Traffic was paralyzed in the center of the city through much of the day in another in a series of demonstrations that has disrupted La Paz over the last several months. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: UNEMPLOYMENT RISES -- Vice President Carlos Alvarez suggested that the current 14 percent unemployment rate could rise to 14.5 percent in official government statistics to be released in a few weeks. That would mean that two million Argentine workers are without jobs. Last October, just before President Fernando De la Rua took power, the unemployment rate stood at 13.8 percent. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: APOLOGY FOR NAZI AID -- At a news conference in Washington, President Fernando de la Rua apologized for his country's role in harboring Nazi war criminals and vowed to get to the bottom of two anti-Jewish bomb attacks in the last decade. After World War II, Argentina received thousands of Germans, including Adolf Eichmann, who directed the killing of millions of European Jews. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: JEWS' TRIAL NEARS END -- Four of 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel returned to court for a brief hearing as the trial approached its close, and a defense lawyer hammered away at what the state calls confessions of guilt by eight of the accused. "They may have made confessions in the past but one must not forget they were in prison for a long period and confessions made during such a long period are not always exact," said the lawyer, Esmail Nasseri. Officials predicted a verdict by next week. (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
SIERRA LEONE: CLASHES NEAR CAPITAL -- Rebels attacked United Nations positions and clashed with government troops northeast of the capital, Freetown, as hundreds of British troops began leaving the city. British troops sent in last month to secure Freetown after rebel forces took hundreds of peacekeepers hostage are due to depart tonight, leaving behind just 200 soldiers to train 1,000 recruits for the new Sierra Leone army. (Agence France-Presse)
 
NIGERIA: FUEL STRIKE OVER -- Labor leaders called off a crippling five-day general strike after President Olusegun Obasanjo apologized for sharply raising gasoline prices without consulting Nigerians. Under an agreement with labor leaders, the government agreed to gas prices slightly below those set on June 1. Increasing Nigeria's heavily subsidized gas prices is considered a financially necessary, but politically explosive, measure. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
ZIMBABWE: ELECTION MONITORS WARNED -- President Robert Mugabe told international observers coming to scrutinize the June 24-25 election that they would have free access to white-owned farms occupied by pro-Mugabe war veterans since February. However, the veterans' leader said the observers could speak with his men but not with farm workers, saying that would be "unacceptable" interference. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: ANTI-TAX ACTION SUSPENDED -- Markets throughout the country were back to normal, reopening after a strike by store owners against the military government's crackdown on tax evasion. But the shutdown has been suspended for only 15 days, leaders of the businessmen warned. If their demands go unmet, the strike will resume, they said. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
PAKISTAN: ACCUSATION OVER KASHMIR -- Reading a statement at his corruption trial, the ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said for the first time that the military had kept him in the dark until May 1999 about its "Kargil" operations in the mountains of Kashmir. Had he known of the plans, he said, he would never have allowed Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India to visit Pakistan on a peace mission three months earlier. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
SRI LANKA: LOAN FROM INDIA -- Desperate for cash in its fight against the Tamil Tiger rebels, the government has been promised $100 million in loans from India. A joint announcement was made in Colombo as Jaswant Singh, India's minister of external affairs, ended a visit to the war-ravaged nation. Barry Bearak (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Embraces Clinton Economic Record and Vows to Expand on It

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore moved yesterday to hitch his presidential campaign to the economic record of President Clinton and called for a new retirement program to supplement Social Security, the elimination of the nation's debt in 12 years, modest tax cuts and systematic increases in spending on education, health care and the environment.
"I intend to build even higher on the foundation of the Clinton years," Mr. Gore declared in a speech in a cramped auditorium at the New-York Historical Society on Manhattan's Upper West Side, standing next to the very symbol of Mr. Clinton's economic policies, Robert E. Rubin, the former secretary of the treasury. 
 "Are you better off than you were eight years ago?" the vice president asked, offering a positive twist to the piercing inquiry Ronald Reagan presented to President Jimmy Carter in 1980. "For most Americans, I believe the answer is obvious. Together as a nation, we turned the biggest deficits in our history into the biggest surpluses in our history."
Mr. Gore, speaking in the heart of a New York neighborhood that has long been identified with liberal political thought, urged creation of trust funds that would systematically divert parts of the nation's projected surplus to spending on education, health care and the environment, as well as to eliminate the nation's debt. He called for creation of new tax-free, voluntary retirement accounts that would supplement Social Security benefits.
Mr. Gore's speech was advertised as a major address intended to inaugurate a new thematic chapter in a campaign that many Democrats have come to view as adrift. For the next three weeks, he plans to deliver a series of speeches elaborating on his message of "prosperity and progress," with one of the weeks devoted to environmental issues.
As part of the initiative, Mr. Gore also conducted a round of news interviews in New York, including a meeting with members of the editorial board, a reporter and editors of The New York Times, where he suggested that he was concerned about recent studies that showed high rates of mistakes in death penalty cases. Excerpts, Page A20.
In his economic speech, Mr. Gore restated his support for a variety of limited tax reductions, including the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty for working couples. And he urged that excess Medicare funds be put into "an ironclad box," preventing Congress from using them for other programs, like the big tax cut being pursued by his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush.
But these presumably complicated proposals were addressed in a few quick and fleeting sentences. Instead of offering details, Mr. Gore, speaking broadly, sought to wrap himself in the legacy of Mr. Clinton's economic accomplishments, while offering his general views on how the nation should best use the surpluses that are being projected for the years ahead.
"None of this boom happened by accident," he declared, adding: "To those who say prosperity has achieved its full reach, I say: Just watch us. We will deepen prosperity, and extend it to the homes and hearts of every family."
Although he did not mention Mr. Bush by name, he offered clear criticism of Mr. Bush's advocacy for large tax cuts, and for allowing the private investment of some Social Security funds.
Mr. Gore's advisers declined to offer much elaboration on any of the proposals, saying that the vice president would instead seek to stretch out this repackaging of his candidacy by returning to each of these subjects in coming days. Most of the proposals Mr. Gore said would provide the foundation of his campaign through the summer came as a result of the projected surpluses that have allowed him to advocate new spending without calling for new taxes or cuts in other programs.
His call for new spending on traditionally Democratic issues -- health care, education and the environment -- marked a sharp shift both for the candidate himself, who has spent much of this campaign criticizing Republican initiatives, as well as for Democratic presidential candidates over the past decade, who have refrained from offering the kind of spending programs that might open them to attack from Republicans.
Mr. Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, criticized the speech, describing it as representative of an activist view of government.
"By offering new ways the federal government can gain more control, apparently Al Gore does not trust individual Americans to make decisions regarding their own retirement, health care needs, education, and finances," Mr. Fleischer said. "Just as hard-working Americans deserve credit for our economic prosperity, Governor Bush believes Americans should have more control over saving for their retirement, planning for their children's education."
There were numerous indications of the importance that Mr. Gore and his aides attached to a speech that his campaign hopes will shift the terms of debate in his contest with Mr. Bush. The vice president tinkered with the text until the very last minute, and then read from a Teleprompter, with barely a variation, when delivering it to his invited audience. To make sure that no one missed the point, the stage was festooned with a banner reading "Prosperity and Progress."
His aides arranged for him to spend much of the afternoon giving interviews for the nightly television news. The speech was also taped for possible campaign advertisements.
As has been fairly standard in recent weeks, Mr. Gore avoided mentioning Mr. Bush by name. Which is not to say he was not critical of his opponent.
For one thing, he suggested that the large tax cuts advocated by Mr. Bush would derail the nation's economic recovery. "I won't be profligate with your money," Mr. Gore declared. "I won't spend money that we don't have on a tax cut that our economy can't afford."
Similarly, he criticized Mr. Bush's proposal to allow some private investment of Social Security funds. "I will oppose any effort to make Social security a gamble, instead of a guarantee."
That said, a number of polls have found strong support among voters for Mr. Bush's Social Security plan, and Mr. Gore sought yesterday to counter that with his own plan. "Social Security Plus," as he named it, would allow taxpayers to invest a certain amount of money every year to be used for retirement, beyond the payroll taxes that workers pay for Social Security.
That money, as well as any interest earned on the investment, would be exempt from taxes, though further details on the program, including the amount of annual investment allowed, remained to be worked out, said Mr. Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane. Traditional I.R.A.'s defer taxes.
Over all, the vice president's speech appeared carefully written to allow him to present himself at once as fiscally conservative and generous in spending. Thus, he called for creation of trust programs under which a specific amount of projected surpluses would go into spending programs. But there would be no money for such programs if the surplus disappeared.
In some ways, the spending proposals made Mr. Gore sound like a pre-Clinton Democrat as he spoke about "reforming our schools, curing disease and making all of our families healthier than ever before, and protecting the environment." But he also sounded tried and true Republican themes, saying: "We can never go back to the days when we spent money that we just don't have" and describing his plan to pay the debt as "plain good capitalism."
In the past year, Mr. Gore has drifted back and forth in terms of his willingness to align himself with the president. But yesterday, he clearly stood on the Clinton administration's shoulders, arguing that its economic policies account for today's economic prosperity.
"Some want to challenge the record of the Clinton administration," he said. "In my view, that record is clear and undeniable."
 
In His Own Words
AL GORE
 
Speaking yesterday at the New-York Historical Society about prosperity:
"I propose that we set aside enough of the surplus to strengthen Medicare -- and then do for Medicare what we have done for Social Security, by putting the Medicare trust fund off-budget and into in an iron-clad lockbox. If we do that, then Congress can never try to raid Medicare, or take it away. We will keep Medicare strong for decades to come. . . .
We have to guarantee that Social Security is there for you when you retire. As president, I will keep that sacred trust. I will oppose any effort to make Social Security a gamble, instead of a guarantee. I am not going to let anyone take the "security" out of Social Security. I will oppose the effort to privatize Social Security, which could take at least a trillion dollars out of the trust fund and could drive our entire budget back into deficit. And with Social Security as the unshakeable foundation, people should be able to save and invest more for their retirement without gambling away their Social Security. I propose a new way to help them do that: Social Security Plus -- new, tax-free voluntary accounts that let you save, invest and build on top of the guaranteed foundation of Social Security."

HEADLINE: Legislators Back Pension Rises For Retired Public Employees

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 13

 BODY:
State lawmakers agreed today to give annual cost-of-living pension increases for the first time to retired state and local government workers. The measure, affecting 1.7 million current and former employees, is projected to cost New York City more than $500 million a year.
The idea of granting annual increases has been pushed hard for years by the powerful public employees' unions, and championed by a long list of politicians seeking to appeal to New York's large constituency of public sector employees and retirees. Politicians here and labor leaders have portrayed it as an issue of fairness, as most retired public employees collect pensions of less than $15,000 a year, even though public pension funds have swelled in recent years because of the robust stock market. 
 Denis Hughes, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the deal, reached between legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki, "will bring a measure of dignity and respect to New York's public employee retirees."
The agreement, contained in a bill that could be passed by the Assembly and Senate as early as Wednesday, is the second major legislative victory for public employees in as many days. On Monday, the Legislature passed a bill, which the governor has indicated he will sign, eliminating pension contributions by state and local employees after they have worked for 10 years. Workers now generally contribute 3 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.
City officials had warned that earlier versions of the cost-of-living proposal could have cost the city as much as $1.2 billion a year, damaging the city's ability to pay for programs and tax cuts, and they lobbied successfully to alter the plan to lower that cost. The city also won the ability to phase in the program over five years.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council have agreed on $418 million in tax cuts in the fiscal year beginning July 1, mostly through reduced personal income tax rates. City officials were hesitant to say today whether that plan could proceed under the agreed-on pension bill. "We have to review the proposed legislation and analyze its cost," said Adam L. Barsky, the mayor's budget director.
But aides to Mayor Giuliani, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he considered the bill's terms tolerable. The mayor sent a letter today to Governor Pataki, saying that the five-year phase-in "will enable the city to budget for this legislation in a fiscally responsible way."
Even so, the price tag for the city is projected to reach $530 million a year in added pension contributions when the program is fully carried out. That far exceeds the cost of last year's elimination by state lawmakers of the commuter tax, a move that Mayor Giuliani loudly protested and which cost the city $360 million a year in lost revenue. It is the next mayor, not Mr. Giuliani, who leaves office in 18 months, who must find a way to absorb most of the cost.
Some independent analysts, including the Citizens Budget Commission, have warned that the plan would undermine the pension funds' long-term stability. They contend that pension increases should be won by unions at the bargaining table, not given away.
But the pension funds managed by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, which cover state workers and most local government workers, are so flush thanks to the stock market boom that the employers have not made any pension contributions in two years. State officials estimate an annual cost-of-living adjustment will not cost the employers anything for the foreseeable future.
The city's pension funds are not as well-stocked, though they, too, have profited from the strong market, and the city continues to make pension contributions for its employees, though at a reduced rate.
For years, Mr. McCall, who is planning a run for governor in 2002, has called for automatic pension increases, cementing his standing as a favorite of state workers and retirees. This year, Governor Pataki appointed a task force to study the issue, which recommended adoption of the change. The governor formally endorsed the idea in May.
Most states have automatic annual pension increases, said Steven Greenberg, Mr. McCall's chief spokesman, and he said it was the comptroller's management of the pension system that made it possible for New York to follow suit.
"It's the right thing to do," he said. "The employers' contributions are down and the employees' contributions are down, so the only people who haven't benefited are the retirees."
The automatic increases will apply to more than one million retirees, and to 500,000 current state and local government employees when they retire. They include nearly all categories of government workers in New York State; the major exceptions are New York City police and firefighters, who receive pension increases under a separate system.
Until now, public employees' pensions have risen only when the Legislature and the governor could agree on a "supplementation," something that occurred every four or five years in good times, and less often when times were bad. Those increases lagged far behind inflation.
Mr. Pataki and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate agreed today to apply an annual increase of half the rate of inflation to the first $18,000 of a person's pension, with a minimum increase of 1 percent and a maximum of 3 percent. That still would not keep up with inflation, but for the retirees it would be a significant improvement.
Nonuniformed workers would have to be retired for five years and reach age 62 before the annual increases would begin, while police and firefighters would have to reach age 55 and be retired for 10 years.

HEADLINE: Market Economics;
Chicken Shows the Difficulty of Exporting Food to India

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 13

 BODY:
Americans love succulent chicken breasts dressed up in every conceivable way, while Indians relish a savory tandoori drumstick brandished easily in one hand or a spicy chicken curry enriched by the marrow of the leg bone.
For Perdue Farms, America's No. 3 chicken producer, this divergence in culinary tastes seemed a heaven-sent opportunity. While selling white meat at a premium to Americans, it could ship inexpensive, unwanted dark meat to India. 
 So as India prepared to lift its longstanding ban on chicken imports next year in a deal worked out with American trade negotiators, Perdue began developing a strategy to sell leg portions in this potentially huge new market, home to as many as 150 million middle-class customers.
But India does not have a reputation as one of the world's most protected economies for nothing. There is still a deep ambivalence here about foreign investment and trade, and India has taken a decidedly cautious approach to globalization. Over the last decade, it has let in ever more foreign goods and lowered barriers to trade, cutting average tariffs from 128 percent to 40 percent. Still, India has some of the world's highest tariffs.
Sure enough, as the domestic chicken industry considered the fearsome prospect of cheap imported dark meat, its lobbyists began to protest. The government hastily agreed last month to raise the tariff on chicken legs from 35 percent to 100 percent -- a year before the import limitations were to be removed.
"Without the tariff, we would be in a big soup," said Anuradha Desai, chairwoman of the Venkateshwara Hatcheries, based in Pune in west-central India, and the National Egg Coordination Committee.
The higher tariff, if it sticks, would be a big setback for Perdue, for this is a market to make an agribusiness giant salivate. The average Indian eats only 2 pounds of chicken a year, compared with more than 90 pounds for an American. Lower prices could increase consumption exponentially. A 100 percent tariff would sharply curtail Perdue's ability to compete on price in India.
Chicken is one of more than 1,400 goods that India is taking off its restricted list this year and next and allowing to be freely imported, after tariffs are paid.
Among those products is a cornucopia fit for a king's table. Cooks will no longer have to scrounge on the black market for foie gras and caviar, chardonnay and cordials. And the rich will be able to serve these treats by the light of foreign-dipped candles on imported yachts.
But more threatening to Indian industrialists, farmers and fishermen is the free importation of more plebeian items: coffee and tea, cardamom and betel nut, chewing tobacco and motor scooters, textiles and garments, mackerel and, of course, chicken legs.
And deep in the 10-page list of goods to be freely imported is one that would almost surely horrify India's independence leader, Gandhi, if he were alive. It is item No. 248, cotton that is "unbleached, plain weave." Gandhi made homespun cotton a symbol of India's economic independence from foreign domination, exhorting villagers to spin their own cloth rather than buy it from Britain, India's colonial ruler.
India began taking steps to open its economy several years ago. In 1997, India told the World Trade Organization that it planned to phase out its list of restricted goods over nine years, which was whittled to six years at the insistence of powerful trading partners. But the United States challenged that pace and won in 1999. India subsequently agreed to lift the restrictions by next April.
In actual purchasing power, India is now the world's fourth-largest economy, according to the World Bank. Its volume of exports and imports has grown substantially, but its share of global trade remains at just 0.6 percent, the same as it was more than 20 years ago.
Many Indians, from hard-line Hindu nationalists to Nehruvian socialists, believe India must shield its small producers, even at the expense of higher prices for consumers and lower-quality goods.
M. S. Swaminathan, a geneticist who played a pivotal role in the Green Revolution -- the development and use of high-yield strains of wheat and rice -- argues that free trade is unfair when mass-produced goods compete against goods made by the masses, particularly in a traditional agrarian society like India. Bankrupt farmers will not be able to buy food at any price. "There is no level playing field," he said.
But many economists, including those at the World Bank, argue that India should quicken its integration with the global economy as the best path toward lower prices, economic growth and millions of new jobs. Countries in East and Southeast Asia that have moved quickly have had greater success in reducing poverty, they say.
Even some in India's chicken industry say that it is in the industry's long-term interest to become more globally competitive -- and perhaps, one day, become an exporter itself.
Kiran Khatri, whose farm is near Delhi, said he sometimes thinks to himself: "If they can dump drumsticks here, why can't we dump breasts in the American market? For that we'll have to raise our quality. There are lots of diseases."
The chicken industries of northern India and the United States seem to come from different centuries.
In Perdue's highly mechanized plants, when a chicken is placed on a conveyor belt, a worker grabs it and hangs it upside down by the legs -- and it will probably never again be touched by human hands. It will emerge at the other end plucked, chopped and boned; packed in a plastic-foam, shrink-wrapped tray; and stamped with the retail price.
A single Perdue plant can process a quarter of a million chickens a day. The company, which had revenue of $2.5 billion last year, also produces the chicken feed, hatches the chicks and raises them.
In contrast, the northern Indian chicken industry is fragmented among hatcheries, chicken farmers, middlemen and traders, while in southern India a number of integrated corporate chicken producers have appeared.
Estimates of the number of chicken farmers in India, which has a population of a billion, range from 30,000 to 100,000, while a million to a million and a half people depend on the industry.
A slaughterhouse in New Delhi is often a Dickensian place. In all likelihood, it is a small neighborhood shop where men do the killing and gutting after a housewife -- or a middle-class family's cook -- has selected the bird that will adorn the table that evening.
New Delhi's INA Market, which is not air-conditioned, caters to expatriates and middle-class Indians. The air inside was heavy with the smell of blood and damp feathers in the 110-degree heat of a recent afternoon. Plump gray rats scurried across floors smeared with blood and guts.
At the improbably named Fish Corner, one of a dozen chicken shops, a man sat cross-legged slicing off heads against a large fixed blade. A few feet away, men in loincloths and flip-flops squatted precariously on the thin edge of large vats of water, tearing off feathers and dunking birds into the murky liquid.
The chickens were then cut into pieces and set out in unrefrigerated, open-air cases. Workers stood by to shoo away swarms of flies.
Shoppers in this market all said they liked their chicken killed fresh. They want it newly killed because they believe it to be fresher, healthier, tastier and less likely to give you gas -- views that could make frozen chicken a hard sell in India.
Annamma Jacob, who buys imported Tang, Quaker Oats and Kikkoman soy sauce at the market, said she liked picking out a live bird herself, preferably a small, tender one. "I don't like chicken in the United States," said Mrs. Jacob, who owns a garment business and travels to New York occasionally. "It has no taste."
But the chicken preferences of Indians are not the only obstacle to frozen chicken. Some industry experts doubt that it can be profitably distributed until refrigeration is more widely available and power failures less common. There are no big American-style supermarkets in New Delhi, a city of 14 million, or in most of India, for that matter.
But Keith Sunderlal, an economist here who is a consultant to Perdue, said he was confident that Indians would buy frozen chicken for the same reasons people in America, China and Indonesia do. "Consumers have all kinds of taste demands," he said, "but what talks is convenience and the pocketbook."
And he said he believed Perdue could move large quantities of its chicken legs in New Delhi at perhaps a third to half of what local retailers charge through more than 100 meat shops, equipped with refrigerators, that have opened in recent years.
At least that is what he thought until India raised the tariff. Now he is not so sure. And Perdue's vice president for international operations, Peggy Vining, said in an interview, "Anytime you have a tariff that high, it makes exporting more difficult."
Perdue still hopes that American officials can persuade India to lower the tariff, but United States diplomats here say they doubt India will do so in the face of a vigorous domestic lobby.
Without the jolt of much lower prices for frozen chicken, it is hard to see Indians switching from the fresh-killed chicken they find so tasty. Every now and then, Rajana Ramachandran, a housewife, said she picks up Tang or imported cheese at the market, but she said it would never occur to her to buy frozen chicken.
Americans like their mild bell peppers and their mass-produced chicken, but Indians will stick with fiery hot chilies and fresh chicken.
"We don't like bland," Mrs. Ramachandran said.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about chicken exports to India misstated the prices at which Perdue Farms estimated that it could sell chicken legs there. Assuming a 35 percent tariff, the company said, it could charge one-third to one-half less than local merchants, not a third to a half of local prices.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Indians prefer chicken prepared the old-fashioned way, as at this shop in Delhi, above. Besides fears that American chicken could overwhelm the local industry, many say that processing at plants like Perdue's in Accomac, Va., right, robs chicken of taste. (Top left, Celia W.

Chart: "Trade Cocoon"
India, like some other developing nations, has tried to protect its domestic industries from foreign competition, leading to little trade with the rest of the world. But while others have started easing trade barriers, India is still taking a cautious approach to globalization.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
A Teenager With a (Very) Big Problem

BYLINE: By CHARLES HEROLD 

 BODY:
APRIL RYAN is an 18-year-old art student living in the 23rd century. She has an art project due, the sleazy guy across the hall keeps pestering her for a date, and she holds the fate of two worlds in her hands. That's a lot of responsibility for a teenager, but April has yet one more feat to accomplish: she must get the attention of American game players without a missile launcher.
April is the protagonist of The Longest Journey, an adventure game from Funcom of Norway. It has been translated into six languages and has received some of the most enthusiastic reviews of any adventure game ever produced. But you can't yet buy it in any store in the United States, where the adventure game has been declared dead. (DreamCatcher Interactive, a small, Toronto-based publisher, plans to announce this week that it will distribute the game in North America.) Adventure games have continued to be popular in Europe, leaving Americans to their main diet of flashy, immersive violence. 
 The Longest Journey has more than a smart protagonist with a tall order to fill. It is easily one of the best adventure games ever made, with beautiful graphics, a compelling story and interesting puzzles.
You first meet April in her nightmare of a strange, supernatural world. It is the prettiest nightmare you are ever likely to see. The Longest Journey is an ostentatiously gorgeous game, the most stunning since Riven, with landscapes and animated sequences that will make you gasp.
As in many fantasy stories, April discovers that she has a destiny. She doesn't want a destiny. She wants to get A's in art school and find a boyfriend, but the fate of two worlds and billions of people depends on her. April must somehow save the mystical Balance that keeps our earth, the world of science, in harmony with Arcadia, an alternate, magical earth.
To that end, April goes everywhere from the bottom of the sea to outer space and talks to everyone from an ancient dragon to an unemployed actor. In breadth, depth and length, The Longest Journey qualifies as an epic adventure, at times seeming more like a novel than a computer game.
The game environment is a fully realized universe. Arcadia is beautiful and enchanted, with a range of strange beings, many of whom would love to trade unpredictable magic for good old-fashioned science. Three hundred years into the future, our own world is surprisingly familiar, except for things like hovercars, holographic candles and corporate-sponsored police who arrest you and then try to sell you products.
Story and character development have been given at least as much attention as the game's puzzles. The dialogue is terrific. Some of it is as funny as anything in the classic Lucas Arts adventure games, like Curse of Monkey Island and Grim Fandago. Characters like the cybergeek Flipper Burns or a prickly ship's captain will have you laughing out loud, although if you're offended by foul language, Flipper might make you cringe more than laugh.
At other times the writing is thoughtful and original, as exemplified by conversations with Abnaxus, who belongs to a race that experiences the past, present and future as concurrent. When April asks him how he knows her name, he says: "Have we not met then? I was sorry for confusing you. I will be Abnaxus."
While its puzzles lack the inspired ingenuity of a game like Day of the Tentacle, The Longest Journey is challenging without being unfairly difficult. Puzzles are logical, there are no dead ends, and even though April notes at one point that "life should carry a big ol' caution sticker -- it's certain to kill you sooner or later," you can't die in this game. Some games seem designed to frustrate you as much as possible, but The Longest Journey wants you to win.
While the tradition in adventure games is for puzzles to become more difficult as you proceed, the final puzzles in The Longest Journey are surprisingly easy. That's good because the story is so involving that it would be painful to be stuck for days on a puzzle so near the conclusion. Instead of hard puzzles, The Longest Journey's payoff is an emotional one, a satisfying and uplifting finale.
The Longest Journey also raises the question, Can the adventure game genre be revived? In popular entertainment, one of the rules is that nothing ever dies -- some things just hibernate. (In 1976 the common wisdom was that no one wanted to watch science fiction movies, and in 1977 "Star Wars" came out.) If given the opportunity, The Longest Journey stands a better chance than any game in years of reawakening the adventure game in America. It also has the potential to pull in women without putting off men.
The opportunity to play as a woman -- that is, a woman who is not simply a large-breasted male fantasy -- is rare. April Ryan, a heroine to Lara Croft's mannequin, could win the hearts and minds of disenfranchised female players.
She is strong, clever and resourceful. And for the men, April is both prettier and more personable than Lara Croft. She makes a far better sex symbol than a girl with outsize breasts whose conversation rarely goes beyond "aha." She may also be the best adventure computer game hero ever, one who creates the kind of emotional bond with the player that you expect from a good film or novel.
Funcom has hired a model who looks like April to travel the German talk show circuit and is working on an MTV-style video of April covering the Depeche Mode song "The Balance." With that determined media blitz, April Ryan is already doing more than fulfilling prophecies and saving two worlds. She is actually making the journey to a software store near you.
 
The Longest Journey, published by Funcom; CD-ROM for Windows 95 and 98; about $35 at www
.softwarefirst.com; soon to be distributed in North America by DreamCatcher Interactive.

HEADLINE: Where the TV Room Meets the Road

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
THE Maurer family -- Mike, Susan and their children, Ellen and Chad -- love their vacation condominium in Bellaire, Mich., four hours north of their suburban Detroit home. What they don't love is getting there.
"The kids hate the ride," Mr. Maurer said. "They fight because they hate being in the car for four hours. They fight over territory, or what's on the radio. They just fight over anything." Officiating the battles left the parents frazzled as well. 
 But all that changed early this year when the couple bought a Ford Windstar minivan with the newest option: a console with color television, VCR and Nintendo nestled between the front seats, facing the back-seat passengers.
"We saw it, drove it, liked it, and the kids loved it right off the bat," Mr. Maurer said.
Now the family's northern jaunts are placid. "This has been the best thing that has ever happened," Mr. Maurer said. "The kids are occupied, we can talk, and it's a much calmer ride."
In fact, Mr. Maurer is so impressed with the effect on family travel that he is considering spending $1,000 or more to install a similar system in his other car, a Ford Club Wagon, for times when he chauffeurs Ellen, who is 11, and Chad, 8.
Entertainment centers, once strictly for the home, have hit the road, turning the minivan or sport utility vehicle into a family den on wheels. Since October 1999, when the television-VCR combination became a factory option, studies have shown it to be a high-demand accessory, said Frank Forkin, a partner in the automotive marketing and research firm J. D. Power & Associates in Detroit.
"All of the minivans and family-type S.U.V.'s either already have them as an option or have them on the drawing board," he said. And aftermarket installers can put them into almost anything on four wheels.
The price of the entertainment systems usually tops $1,800, but now that they are an option offered at the dealership, buyers can rationalize the purchase more easily by rolling the cost in with the car financing.
Chevrolet expected sales of a special-edition Warner Brothers Venture van, which features a television along with the company's logo and an image of Bugs Bunny, to account for about 10 percent of Venture's sales for the 2000 model year. It is actually accounting for about 20 percent of sales, a percentage that is expected to increase, said Pete Langenhorst, brand manager for the Venture. "The growth potential is enormous," he said.
Some resourceful consumers are finding simple and cheap ways to put a television and a VCR in the car. But others are paying top dollar for fancy multizone systems, each equipped with a separate L.C.D. flat screen (the kind in laptop computers) that can be mounted in the roof or can flip up from a console, or screens that are mounted on the back of the front-seat headrests. Those more expensive systems, which give the car's interior the look of a business-class cabin on a jumbo jet, can let the children play Nintendo or PlayStation video games while Mom listens to a CD and Dad tunes in a radio talk show. To avoid multimedia cacophony, all the passengers can wear earphones, but it is illegal for the driver to wear them. And some systems have controls in the front seat so parents can shut things off in a disciplinary crisis.
But the prospect of such a crisis, among other things, leads some critics to question whether it might distract the driver to have people watching a favorite movie or playing Pokemon in the back seat, or whether a television could be a dangerous thing to have aboard in a car accident. Others debate whether it is wise to augment children's already heavy television consumption.
Entertainment technology has been making the transition from the living room to the car since the 1920's and has been criticized as dangerous at each step along the way.
In the 20's, do-it yourselfers installed tube radios in their cars, said Michael Lamm, who writes about automotive history. People could not listen to the radio as they drove because the firing of the spark plugs interfered with reception.
"You drove to a high place where you would get good reception," Mr. Lamm said, "you would take your girlfriend, and you would park and turn on the radio and it was a very romantic thing to do."
Earl Muntz, a legendary Los Angeles car salesman known as Madman Muntz, installed radios in the 30's that could play as the car drove, and states like Massachusetts considered prohibiting radios in cars as a dangerous distraction. (Now, car televisions could fall under broad restrictions found in some states against things that could distract a driver. But as long as they are not in the front seat, they are generally in safe legal territory.)
Chrysler somewhat unsuccessfully offered a car phonograph in the 50's. "If you hit a big bump, you'd know it," Mr. Lamm said. Although the reel-to-reel tape players never made it to the car as a standard option, eight-track tape players did in the late 1960's. "Eight-tracks didn't last very long because they were so big and bulky," Mr. Lamm said. "When the little cassettes came in, they did it in."
Car televisions are nothing new, of course. They were as common as shag carpet in conversion vans, popular in the 1970's. George Barris, known to some as King of the Kalifornia Kustomizers for his artistic car modifications, said he installed the first television in a car, in the dashboard of the 1953 Golden Sahara, a bubble-topped vehicle used in the Jerry Lewis movie "Cinderfella." The Golden Sahara television was a home unit, Mr. Barris recalled. "It was a Zenith, and we had the old Zenith remote control," he said. "We also used the remote control to open the doors." He had to put a transformer in the car because the television functioned on 110-volt house current.
Mr. Barris said televisions remained a popular option in the cars he modified. "When the 12-volt unit became accessible in the 50's, it became easier to put in," he said. "Now they are in all your S.U.V.'s, limousines -- we can do them any way you want now and hang them anywhere."
Some enterprising people simply adapt for car use small combination TV-VCR's that are designed for homes or camping and can be had for $200 to $300 apiece. Experts warn against that approach.
"The problem is it is not permanently mounted," said Carl Mathews, director of merchandise at the Crutchfield Corporation, a mail-order electronics retailer based in Charlottesville, Va., "and a TV can be a pretty dangerous projectile in an accident."
While some do-it-yourselfers suggest that a television can be secured by strapping it down or putting it in a milk crate that is lashed to the seats, Mr. Mathews suggested the $599 Video Traveler, a monitor and VCR in a bag that straps between the front seats.
"It can be taken out and plugged into a wall socket and played in a hotel room," he said. It also has the advantage of a color L.C.D. screen, which is less dangerous in an accident than the glass vacuum tube used in many portable televisions.
Virtually all of the entertainment units designed specifically for cars use L.C.D. screens. There are also floor-mounted entertainment units designed for the amateur installer; they are a step up from those that strap temporarily in place. A much bigger step up is the ceiling-mounted, flip-down television monitor, which is not recommended for amateur installers. The wiring has to run inside one of the car's roof support posts and in the ceiling cover.
The ceiling-mounted televisions have some advantages. Although they may partly block the rear-view mirror, they will not keep a parent from reaching into the back seat, as some floor-mounted units can. And they may also be better for passengers who suffer from motion sickness.
"What they are finding out is, kids are more likely to get sick looking down or level because when they look up they see the horizon in the peripheral vision," Mr. Langenhorst said.
Dr. Charles M. Oman, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied motion sickness for 25 years, agreed that seeing the horizon might help. When someone watches television or tries to read a newspaper in a car, he said, "the motion you are experiencing does not match the brain's expectations -- you aren't creating the motion, and you don't have confirming visual cues."
But no matter where the screen is mounted, some people are simply prone to motion sickness. Susceptibility decreases as children mature so preteenagers are most likely to become ill. "The one thing users of TV can do is sort of pace themselves, and if they feel queasy, look away," Dr. Oman said.
Most mobile televisions use a VCR as the entertainment source, and many offer jacks for video game consoles. Manufacturers say more mobile DVD players are on the horizon, and they talk about a convergence of Internet, navigation and entertainment material, all accessible on the screen.
As for watching television stations, some systems offer a tuner, although the signal is not very good in a moving vehicle. "It's not going to be the quality TV you enjoy at home with cable," Mr. Mathews said.
That's just as well, say some child-rearing experts, like Dr. Dorothy G. Singer of the Yale University Family Television Research Center. Although some bemoan the idea that television has invaded another treasured family ritual, Dr. Singer is not concerned that watching television or videos on trips will dangerously increase the time spent in front of the tube. But she does recommend that parents take along videotapes that are instructive and stimulating and that can be discussed as part of the ride.
"I don't think if you are going on a four-hour or five-hour trip that you should have the TV on the whole time," she said. "I think that is feeding into the 'TV is the baby sitter' attitude that we fall into."
Dr. Singer recommends that parents use television as a reward if the children play well together first. And that periods of watching television be broken up with periods of talking or listening to books on tape.
"We put a book in and it really teases your imagination," she said. "It's like old-time radio. Anything that stimulates the imagination is good, but when you watch TV, the images are provided for you."
Parents who want to heed her advice are in luck. Many entertainment systems, some using wireless headphones, can broadcast different programming to each person in the car. That works out well for Davis and Nancy Weaver and their teenage boys, Matthew and Mark.
"The boys have trouble agreeing on the same entertainment," Mr. Weaver. Davis and Nancy Weaver have a similar problem: Ms. Weaver likes the occasional Faith Hill CD, while Mr. Weaver likes to listen to sports on the radio. With a 30-hour drive from their home in Landenberg, Pa., to the Florida Keys ahead of them this summer, they found a solution in a top-of-the-line van with a multizone entertainment system that lets Mr. Weaver listen to the radio while his wife listens to music on a headset and the boys, also using headsets, watch a movie.
"It's quiet in the car now," Mr. Weaver said. "It's great. It's nice to take a long trip." And now that his oldest son can drive, Mr. Weaver will be able to spend some time watching the scenery and listening to his favorite music on a headset without torturing the family.
"I'm a John Denver-type person," he said. "My kids can't stand John Denver."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Out West, Giving the Musical Some Pop

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif., June 10

 BODY:
The Broadway musical, ever in search of the shows that will expand its traditional audience into hipper or younger (or both) sectors of the populace, pushed forward this past season with "Contact," "James Joyce's 'The Dead' " and "The Wild Party," all of which offered innovation in form or tone. Now in Southern California, three nascent works are trying to lure new (and old) theatergoers by energizing the traditional form with the force of pop culture in general and rock 'n' roll in particular. They vary in their achievement, but they all project at least one welcome idea: the world of pop is stageable, a tap-worthy vein of material.
All three of the productions are in the midst of world-premiere runs. At the South Coast Repertory Theater here in Costa Mesa, "The Education of Randy Newman" is a kind of stage biography of the popular singer, with a narrative built on the bittersweet and wryly acid songs that have characterized his career. An hour to the south in San Diego, the San Diego Repertory Theater is presenting "Celebration of the Lizard," a post-apocalyptic tale based on the writings of the rock icon Jim Morrison and featuring 33 songs originally recorded by his band, the Doors. Meanwhile, also in San Diego, the Old Globe Theater is putting on "The Full Monty," an adaptation of the hit British film comedy of 1997 about a half-dozen laid-off mill workers who resort to stripping to earn a quick and necessary buck. 
 A hot ticket, "The Full Monty," directed by Jack O'Brien with a broader humor than in Peter Cattaneo's film, is the most accomplished of the three. It is headed for Broadway in the fall -- not surprising considering that Mr. O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, and the book writer, Terrence McNally, both have Broadway pedigrees. Fox Searchlight, the division of 20th Century Fox that released the film and that will finance the $7 million Broadway production, has also helped the Old Globe set the show on its infant feet. To judge from a recent performance, it is a crowd-pleaser, with audience members leaping up during the final striptease and hooting for the characters to show it all.
It's a little early in the game for serious carping -- John Arnone's lighthearted sets are zippy and functional but could make use of some of that Broadway money, and at three hours the show is overlong, leaning on Mr. McNally's dialogue-heavy book, which seems likely to be streamlined -- but a few observations won't hurt.
The music and lyrics are by David Yazbek, a stage newcomer with a rock background. His wordplay is sophisticated, his sensibility brusquely unsentimental and occasionally risky. (A Motown-flavored rock song called "Big Black Man" pokes fun at an egregious racial stereotype by indulging it.)
Mr. Yazbek writes in a variety of pop modes, from a jazzy big-band overture to a country-ish lament sung by a father to the son he feels he is failing. There is at least one knockout song: "Scrap," a jangly and jarring lament sung by a chorus of the bitterly unemployed. And Mr. Yazbek knows the traditions of his medium enough that he has written a handful of numbers that would be at home nowhere but in musical theater, including a sweet and funny duet by two husbands romantically serenading the obsessions that rule their lives. One sings to his spendthrift wife, the other to his fat belly ("You grumble/And I stumble/Toward the Muenster cheese.")
Among the surprises for those who fondly remember the movie are augmented roles for three of the characters' wives and the invention of another female character, a crusty old piano player who comes out of retirement to accompany the boys in their striptease. But the most significant change is the relocation of the story from Sheffield, England, to Buffalo -- ostensibly so the show would feel more familiar to American audiences -- and with it a change in attitude.
The characters in the film, out of work and desperate, remained fundamentally gentle; they wore their uncertain plight rather meekly. In the musical they are brasher and angrier and, in the case of the male lead, played by Patrick Wilson, capable of blunt aggression; he walks an interesting line between lovable and loutish.
The show is full of penis jokes, casual obscenity, pelvic thrusting, even gay baiting, but it is able to codify its attitude in a sunny enough manner, particularly in the rousing dance number that ends the first act, choreographed by Jerry Mitchell on a basketball theme. The song is called "Michael Jordan's Ball," and it lionizes Mr. Jordan -- Mr. America indeed! -- for his ability to seize a game and make it his own.
Neither of the other two shows has as assured a future, but "The Education of Randy Newman" might well enjoy an extended life, particularly with its pretension checked and maybe presented in a more intimate setting than on the South Coast Rep main stage. Using an ambitious literary model, "The Education of Henry Adams," for its spirit if not its actual form, the show purports to tell the songwriter's life story in the context of his historical times by knitting 40 or so of his songs into a loose narrative.
As conceived by Mr. Newman, Jerry Patch and Michael Roth, staged by Myron Johnson and performed by a seven-piece band and a strong cast of seven actor-singers upon whom the physical demands are considerable, the show works better than you might think -- at least for a while. Most of the opening act concerns Mr. Newman's upbringing in New Orleans, and the songs -- including the mocking satire, "Rednecks," and the tongue-in-cheek paean to Huey Long, "Kingfish" -- provide the kind of specificity of time and place that good storytelling requires. Perhaps the best number is "Four Eyes," about the social travails of a young boy with glasses, and Mr. Johnson has staged it here as a nightmarish first day of school. Over all, Mr. Newman's upbringing feels satisfyingly singular.
In the second act, however, the action moves to Los Angeles, where the path of Mr. Newman's adulthood seems pretty familiar, if not downright generic: heartbreak and divorce, obsession with money, profligate behavior, redemption in love as a sense of mortality sets in. The songs, many familiar, are perfectly fine, but they end up dividing easily into two categories, sweet and sarcastic, and a little of each goes a long way. A bit of a saccharine sheen begins to accrue by the end of the show's 2 hours 40 minutes.
If one of the themes is that Los Angeles inflates one's sense of oneself, well, here's a case in point. Mr. Newman's life story, modest and wry, might be better served with less aggrandizement -- fewer songs, simpler orchestrations (the music was most informative and touching when played by Mr. Roth on solo piano), a smaller house.
Alas, no such solution is likely to perpetuate "Celebration of the Lizard," which takes seriously not only the music of Jim Morrison, with the lascivious thrum that made him a rock star, but also the anti-establishment defiance that made him a hippie icon.
The book, by Joel Lipman, is drawn from Morrison's own self-righteous writings, telling a futuristic story about a Mad Max-type hero on the run from the fascist authorities who encounters a tribe of hostile renegades in the desert. It is often laughably ponderous, a condition underscored by the reverent spirit of Sam Woodhouse's direction and the lead performance by Jeff Meek, a handsome guy who sings well enough to be the Morrison stand-in the part requires but who has none of Morrison's insolent charisma.
The interesting thing is that the music is as alive and enthralling as it ever was, and the chief pleasure of this production is in the moments it is well adapted for the stage. Mr. Woodhouse, the artistic director of the San Diego Rep, has found apt context for three of the Doors' most famous songs. "The End" serves as a haunting dirge. "People Are Strange" accompanies Mr. Meek's first encounter with the spookily costumed desert tribe (the one laugh-inducing scene in the show). And, of course, there's "Light My Fire," which is employed as a first-act finale, beginning as a love duet enacted by two separate couples and ending with the entire ensemble communing around a glowing campfire.
In those scenes, we get a glimpse of the Doors as theater folk. Maybe they're not Lerner and Loewe, but who would've thought?

HEADLINE: The Library As the Latest Web Venture

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
WHEN Carrie Larkworthy, a student at Harvard University, is faced with a research project, getting a book out of the library is the last thing on her mind. Instead she sits in her dormitory room and logs onto the Web, starting with Harvard's online system for searching and retrieving journal articles. "I hate the library, so I try to avoid it," Ms. Larkworthy said. "It's such a big facility that you have to search through."
If Ms. Larkworthy's experience is anything like that of other students, and many librarians acknowledge that it is, the use of books for research is becoming an archaic concept. If scholarly books are not on the Web, they are invisible to anyone using the Internet as a substitute for in-depth investigation. 
 But new efforts are afoot to change that. Several companies are racing to put the full texts of hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books, old and new, on the Web. NetLibrary started the contest, with technology that lets people view books online for short periods of time, the digital equivalent of borrowing them from the library.
Now two other companies, Ebrary.com and Questia Media, are taking on the same challenge but using a new strategy. They want to give people the opportunity to search through reams of pages at no charge, then will charge people a few cents a page for using that information. (Questia users will be asked to pay for viewing, copying and printing the online pages. Ebrary.com users will be able to view pages free but will pay for copying and printing.)
These electronic library projects are not attempts to compete with the budding electronic book industry, which offers books for downloading to handheld devices and is focused on popular fiction, like Stephen King's recent Web-only novella, "Riding the Bullet," and on other newly published trade books. The library projects have very little to do with the debate over the promise or pitfalls of gadgets that let people read novels electronically from the comfort of their beds.
In fact, the new effort to build an electronic library is not about reading at all. It is about the power of electronic searching. With digital scanning, texts of works that may be decades old can be mined for those few morsels of insight that may enhance a research paper or help prove an argument. It could be a way, some publishers say, to move books into the Web's fold and make them more visible to students like Ms. Larkworthy.
"In an ideal world, a person would find a book in the card catalog, pull it off the shelf and use it," said Kate Douglas Torrey, director of the University of North Carolina Press. "But that is just not the world we live in today." The University of North Carolina Press is among more than 80 publishers working with Questia to turn many of their titles into searchable documents available on the Web.
Laziness is not always the excuse for avoiding the traditional library. Even people who do go hunting in the stacks are sometimes thwarted. The books they want might be checked out or misplaced, lost forever among call numbers that have no relation to the sticker on their spines. Or the books might be at other libraries and available only to those researchers who are willing to wait weeks for interlibrary loans.
Such situations can be avoided on the Internet, proponents of digital libraries say. "This will take some of the tedium out of research," Ms. Torrey said, "and make it easy to use an extensive collection of scholarly work."
Of course, people have been hailing the promise of digitized libraries for years, and the reality has not yet measured up. When netLibrary opened in March 1999, for example, it was promoted in press releases as a company that would "revolutionize the library system" by enabling people to tap into a searchable and comprehensible database of reference and scholarly books.
Until this month, netLibrary offered two types of access: holders of library cards from participating libraries could use the service at no charge, and others could subscribe to the service for $29.95 a year. The subscription option is no longer being offered to new users.
Now netLibrary is primarily a service for public, academic and corporate libraries that want to buy electronic titles and make them available to their patrons. Rob Kaufman, netLibrary's president and chief executive, said the shift away from a consumer service was partly an attempt to appease librarians and publishers. Some librarians said the service was competing with them. Publishers did not like the subscription model for another reason: they said it gave people too much access to electronic texts at too low a price.
Even those who gain access to netLibrary may find the experience less than satisfying. There are just not yet enough books in the site's collection to make serious searching worthwhile. The site now has about 18,000 copyrighted books and 4,000 public-domain works, numbers that are tiny compared with the hundreds of thousands of volumes in most research libraries and the millions of volumes in major ones.
Will companies like Questia Media and Ebrary.com do any better? Ebrary.com already has more than 130,000 volumes in its demonstration database and says that it may include as many as 600,000 by the time it opens in the fall. Questia, backed by $45 million in venture capital, plans to offer access to 50,000 volumes when it opens next spring and is working toward a goal of 250,000 books in three years.
These numbers are possible, the founders say, because they have appealed to publishers' pocketbooks. When a book is sold to an actual library, the publisher makes a one-time profit. That book might be retrieved and read by hundreds of people, but the publisher never sees another dime. In the models used by Questia and Ebrary.com, however, that book could continue to make the publisher money as more people see it.
Anyone going to Questia's site, for example, will be able to search the entire database of books at no cost, but only subscribers will be able to see the books' pages by clicking on the search results. (Questia has not yet set its subscription price, but Troy Williams, the company's chief executive, said that it would be "affordable for the average college student.")
Ebrary.com has adopted what Christopher Warnock, the chief executive, calls "the photocopier model." Searching will be free, he said, and so will the act of simply reading whatever pages are retrieved from a search. But when a person tries to copy the text of those pages by using copy and paste commands, a dialogue box will appear on the screen. In a recent demonstration, the box said: "This will cost you $0.25. Would you like to continue?"
The same kind of message pops up when a user tries to print the page. If the user decides to pay for copying or printing, the software will automatically generate a citation for the work and place it below the copied or printed text.
Most people will have no problem paying a few cents for what they want, Mr. Warnock said, since they already scrounge up quarters to use photocopy machines. At the site, a user will be able to sign up for a debit account of, say, $10 and will then need to type in a user name and password during each session in which the user prints or copies pages.
These payments, the founders say, can add up to big money when millions of people are spending a few cents at a time. And many publishers are willing to license their copyrighted material in exchange for some of that cash. "It holds the promise of being profitable," said Tim Cooper, vice president for strategic operations at Harcourt Trade Publishers, one of the companies that has signed a letter of intent with Questia.
It is not just those micropayments that interest publishers, said Larry Weissman, director of new business development for Random House, which, he added, has struck no deals with either Questia or Ebrary.com. But the ideas are appealing, Mr. Weissman said, partly because they may introduce readers to new works. "The hope is that they would want to continue that reading experience by buying a book," he said.
If the sites succeed, they will be mixing the qualities of libraries and bookstores. Most people think of the bookstore as a place to buy and the library as a place to borrow or browse at no charge. But on the Internet, where full texts can be searched in seconds and information can be retrieved with a few clicks, convenience is part of the package as well. These companies, including netLibrary, are betting that people will pay for it.
Librarians are intrigued by the concept, said Kenneth L. Frazier, the president of the Association of Research Libraries. And they are eager to see how quickly texts can be digitized when put into the hands of companies, which may find more efficient ways to scan books on a huge scale.
But Mr. Frazier, who is director of the general library system at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, also wonders what that will mean to traditional research libraries, which have always been motivated by public interest, not private profits. Making sure that low-income people have access to expansive new online libraries is one area of concern. Another concerns the selections made by digital libraries. Will databases include only the most popular books, Mr. Frazier asked, "or the stuff that gets the highest return economically?"
At Ebrary.com, books are included for technical reasons. They must already exist on publishers' computers in a format called PDF (for portable document file), which was developed by Adobe Systems and is commonly read online using the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Many publishers, Mr. Warnock said, have been using this format since the early 1990's during the design of their hard-copy books.
Questia is taking a more academic approach. It has hired Dr. Carol Hughes, a research librarian who recently worked at the University of Iowa, to lead a team of librarians in selecting core titles that have been known to be useful to college students. A few of the books that will be included on Questia are "The Industrial Revolution," a 1956 book by Arnold Toynbee, and a 1982 edition of Dante's "Divine Comedy."
Dr. Hughes said she suspected that Questia might drive more students to the actual library instead of away from it. After using the Web to find books that meet their needs, she said, they may want to check them out to read them more closely. "I think it is going to greatly enhance libraries," she said.
Being able to search online books will help students see their value, Dr. Hughes said, particularly when they can easily get access to books that have become classics in particular subject areas.
A nonprofit project called JStor is often offered as proof that digitizing old texts can breathe life into them. For the past five years, JStor has been creating digital copies of scores of scholarly journals, some of which have issues more than 100 years old. University libraries around the world pay for access to JStor and provide it to their students free. A recent study by JStor showed that students used the online service almost 20 times as much as they dug into the stacks for the paper versions.
Just a few years ago, said Mr. Frazier, of the University of Wisconsin, librarians and publishers scoffed at the idea that a full-scale project like JStor could be adopted for books any time soon. Many people said it would take centuries before the equivalent of a library's bookshelves would ever make it onto the Web.
But now that Mr. Frazier has seen and heard about new efforts, he said, "I'm not so sure about that anymore." "I think this might happen much more quickly than we might have imagined a few years ago," he added. No longer, he said, will books suffer from what he called that "fatal disadvantage": the fact that they are available only in print.
 
Site-Seeing: Literature Texts
 
Although commercial companies are getting into the act, several education Web sites have been offering access to electronic texts for years. The sites are ideal for finding classic texts that are not restricted by copyright, like works of Shakespeare or Robert Frost. Most of them are plain text versions of books and are not integrated into Web-based databases, which means that they do not allow keyword searching across multiple volumes. Here are some of the sites that give people access to texts of literature and reference works:
 
ALEX CATALOG OF ELECTRONIC TEXTS: sunsite.berkeley.edu/alex
Includes about 700 books that are in the public domain, which typically means that they have been written by authors who died decades, if not hundreds of years, ago. Titles are drawn from American and British literature and Western philosophy.
 
BARTLEBY.COM: www.bartleby.com Features a searchable database of about 100 books, most of which are multivolume reference books or classics of literature and poetry. Although the site is now commercial, it started as a university project and access remains free. The company is starting to include copyrighted books as well, like The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.
 
ELECTRONIC TEXT CENTER: etext.lib.virginia.edu/uvaonline.html Offers about 5,000 public-domain texts, including English literature, manuscripts and newspapers from 1500 to the present. Also includes texts in more than a dozen other languages.
 
PROJECT GUTENBERG: promo.net/pg One of the first electronic text projects on the Internet, this has about 2,500 public-domain titles.

HEADLINE: Will Chairs Fly on the Web, or Just Fold?

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, the idea of selling furniture on the Internet seemed a stroke of genius. What could be cooler than clicking up a couch? Over a dozen Web sites sprang into action, all promising to take the schlep out of shopping and the fear out of fabric selection. After all, the furnishings industry was huge, with more than $190 billion in sales in 1999, by the estimate of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Moreover, there weren't a lot of household names dominating the marketplace. The gold rush was on.
New companies like Furniture.com, GoodHome.com and Living.com popped into view and were quickly valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. "It was the hottest thing since sliced bread," said Seema Williams, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a new-technology research concern in Cambridge, Mass. Starting early last year, an estimated half-billion dollars was invested in home-furnishings Web sites in a little more than 12 months, said Lester Craft, editor in chief of e-Commerce Business, a two-month-old trade magazine. 
 The pressure on established brands to start selling their furniture online was relentless. "It was considered blasphemy not to have a Web site up and running," said Shelly Hale, a senior research analyst in home furnishings and a managing director at Banc of America Securities. "The world was going to come to an end if you didn't sell online."
Then the gold rush turned into a soap opera, as Web entrepreneurs discovered what a tangled web the home furnishings industry can be. Trying to satisfy customers with products they hadn't seen in person was only the beginning. There was also shipping and warehousing, and the need for private labels. (Most large manufacturers didn't want to provide their brands, especially not on someone else's Web site.) There's a big difference, it seems, between ordering a $15 book from Amazon and ordering a $1,500 sofa.
Still, attracting customers wasn't difficult, especially those searching for good prices on small items, like designer sheets with 200-plus thread counts, or on known entities like the Aeron office chair. Then it turned out that what people wanted more than low prices was painfree shopping. But they weren't getting it.
A woman in California ordered a pair of bookcases from HomePoint.com in Greenville, S.C. They arrived damaged. She sent them back, taking advantage of the company's free return policy. Another set went out, and arrived damaged again.
"It was a real challenge to get that order out," said William Herlong, interim president and acting chief executive of HomePoint, who related the story. "I know we sent it back two times, maybe even three. You know, I'm not sure if she was ever satisfied. And I know she wasn't the only one."
Last month, HomePoint closed its online consumer retail operation; its founding chairman, president and chief executive resigned.
Other online companies are making adjustments, both subtle and wrenching. On June 2, Fortune.com, the Fortune magazine Web site, reported drastic reappraisals of the potential value of various furniture Web sites. By Fortune.com's estimates, Furniture.com, the mother lode of home furnishings on the Web, which sells over 20,000 products online, slid to a $20 million valuation in May, from $255 million in January; Living.com dropped to $140 million, from $600 million in December. Recently, Living.com also laid off 13 percent of its work force, even as it announced an exclusive deal to become the home furnishings Web site of choice on Amazon.com.
Now that the Web sites are faltering, the causes seem all too obvious. "Personally, I kept thinking the furniture industry is the last place I'd look" to sell directly to consumers, Ms. Hale said. "What a hard way to make money. I kept shaking my head." Web sites are simply not touchy-feely: customers still want to bounce on the mattress, caress the nub and otherwise feel the product.
Online consumers are often faced with images murky enough to be featured on "The X Files." Just try to decide whether you like the grain of a cherry sleigh bed, or whether a gingham sheet is actually checked. Hit the zoom-in button and you are still looking at murk -- but close up.
"You can't tell the difference in quality between something that's $3,000 and something that's $10,000," said Bill Sibbick of Stanley Furniture in Stanleytown, Va. "That's our biggest concern."
Stanley, a leading manufacturer, agreed to put its furniture on Living .com but pulled it off less than two weeks later after complaints from retailers who felt they were being betrayed. They said that they had to invest in floor samples and advertising, then watch while customers stopped by, kicked the tires and went and ordered the items on the Web.
Returns have also been a problem. Many sites initially offered free shipping both ways. In April, Furniture.com replaced free shipping with a $95 "no matter the amount of purchase" policy. That "works psychologically," said Carl Prindle, Furniture.com's senior vice president for product development. The company, he said, is happy with a 10 percent return rate; 5 percent is the average for the industry; Ethan Allen enjoys less than 2 percent.
Living.com is phasing out free shipping in favor of "heavily subsidized rates" said Shaun Holliday, the chief operating officer. So is GoodHome.com, which will end free shipping on July 15. "We had it to build our image," said Doug Mack, a founder and the chief executive.
As it dawns on companies that the question is not "Who is going to be the Amazon.com for the furniture business?" but rather "Who is going to survive?" the focus has also shifted from Sell! Sell! Sell! to an approach that could better be described as service . . . service . . . service. For some, the goal now is to escort site visitors through a bewildering array of choices into the waiting arms of retailers and manufacturers -- the people who physically possess the furniture.
"Everyone's tired of bloodying their foreheads against the walls of existing distribution channels and against such meager rewards," said Brian Carroll, the e-commerce editor at Furniture Today. He noted that Web sales of furniture don't even approach 1 percent of all furniture sales.
Technology may have gotten the Web sites into their predicament, but it is also being promoted as a way out: new systems will offer rotating 3-D views, virtual reupholstery and on-screen room makeovers. "There are a lot of cool tools in development so that the Web sites will be able to do things no brick and mortar store will be able to do anytime soon," said Ms. Williams of Forrester Research. By the end of the year, Furniture.com hopes that people will be able to send in pictures of a room so they can try placing different products in it. This month, GoodHome.com will introduce "floor planning," allowing site visitors to build an electronic version of their rooms, then drag in furnishings to see how they fit.
Analysts still expect e-commerce to grow, if perhaps more slowly than initially anticipated. By 2004, they say, 5 percent of all furniture sales will be made online. Steven Wagner, the editor in chief of Poshandsticks, an e-commerce Web site that has already postponed its introduction twice this year, said: "Everyone is diving in without a parachute. We've tried to learn from others' mistakes."
The site's grand plan: making sure shoppers love the furniture when they see it online, and love it even more when they get it at home.

AFRICA
 
ETHIOPIA: YES TO PEACE -- Ethiopia accepted a peace plan to end a two-year border war with Eritrea, paving the way for a cease-fire and the deployment of a United Nations force to keep the rival armies apart. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said a proposal drawn up by the Organization of African Unity had been approved by his cabinet. The plan calls for setting up a 15-mile buffer zone in Eritrea along the disputed border, to be policed by a peacekeeping force. Eritrea has already accepted the plan. (Reuters)
 
NIGERIA: NEW SHARIAH STATE -- Shariah will go into effect next week in Kano, the third of Nigeria's 36 states to adopt the Islamic penal and social code. Hundreds were killed this year in clashes between Muslims and Christians in the state of Kaduna, which was considering introducing Shariah. The movement toward Shariah is considered by many to be politically inspired, intended to weaken the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT) 

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: PLEA ON LESBIAN RULING -- The government has asked the High Court of Justice to expand its panel of judges and review its recent landmark ruling that allowed a lesbian who adopted her partner's son in California to be officially listed as his second mother. The couple, Nicole and Ruti Berner-Kadish, urged the court to reject the request, and said they had been subjected to homophobic harassment since the ruling was made public. Deborah Sontag (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: RED CROSS COMPROMISE -- Israel and its relief agency, the Magen David Adom, proposed a compromise in Geneva in the controversy over whether it can become a Red Cross movement member while still using the red Shield of David emblem instead of the Red Cross or Red Crescent to identify its workers. Israel said it wanted to continue to use the shield for its work inside the country, but put it inside a new, neutral emblem outside its borders. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
ARGENTINA: THOUSANDS STRIKE -- Thousands of government workers went on a one-day strike to protest austerity policies that are cutting their salaries by between 12 and 15 percent. The action came less than a week after a general strike paralyzed the country for a day in protest at the 14 percent jobless rate.
 Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
MEXICO: JOURNALIST QUIZZED -- One of Mexico's best-known journalists, Sergio Sarmiento, was called in as a witness in a high-profile murder case by the Mexico City district attorney, raising a storm of protest from the press. Mr. Sarmiento said he cited his professional confidentiality rights and refused to reveal how he obtained an interview last year with former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He said prosecutors seemed to be looking for a connection between a visit by Mr. Salinas and the killing of the comedian Francisco Stanley. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
PACIFIC
 
SOLOMON ISLANDS: PREMIER QUITS -- Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu resigned, saying he did so under duress but that the resignation would pave the way for peace between warring factions. Tensions have been growing for 18 months since indigenous Guadalcanal residents, called Isatabus, began forcing out migrants from the nearby island of Malaita. (AP)
 
EUROPE
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: TROOP PULLOUT -- With paramilitary cease-fires holding and security improving, Britain's military presence fell to 13,500, its lowest level in three decades as the last 100 paratroopers scheduled for withdrawal flew to the mainland. Troop levels reached 30,000 in 1972. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
FRANCE: ALGERIAN'S PLEA -- On the first day of a four-day visit, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria urged closer ties between the two nations. In a speech to the National Assembly he condemned the colonial past but called his state visit, the first by an Algerian leader since 1982, a reunion of friends. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
FRANCE: McDONALD'S SECOND THOUGHTS -- After more than 800 shopkeepers in the Marais, the Paris district known for its synagogues and Jewish shops, signed a petition to keep a McDonald's restaurant out of the neighborhood, the company announced it was abandoning plans to open a restaurant there. The shopkeepers said a fast-food outlet would ruin their neighborhood. McDonald's said it dropped the project because of technical difficulties. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: JEWISH SPLIT -- The Jewish minority appeared split after a new group declared a leader of the Hasidic Chabad Lubavitch movement, Rabbi Berl Lazar, the nation's chief rabbi. That title has been claimed since the early 1980's by Adolf Shayevich, an Orthodox rabbi. Each sect called the other's leader an imposter. Some linked the dispute to the arrest of the media baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky, who heads the group that supports Rabbi Shayevich. Rabbi Lazar, above, appears to have the Kremlin's support.

SRI LANKA: SUICIDE BLAST -- A suicide bomber in Colombo tried to blow up a bus carrying wounded airmen, but the attack was impeded by a passing cyclist, the police said. Two civilians died in the blast, for which the police blamed Tamil Tiger rebels. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDIA: PAKISTAN REJECTED -- A spokesman termed a recent overture by Pakistan for nuclear restraint as "essentially propagandist," and said India would discuss arms control only after Pakistan "stops cross-border terrorism."

HEADLINE: Booming Atlanta Saps Water as Drought Wilts Georgia

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, June 11

 BODY:
Just after dawn they emerge onto their pillowy meadows of fescue and bluegrass, some with hoses and some with mighty irrigation systems, each squeezing out every last legal drop of water before the 10 a.m. cutoff arrives with its water police, tattling neighbors and dark civic guilt.
On every block in the region the desperation of these homeowners is almost palpable, as they will their lawns to soak it up and beat the drought that is parching Georgia and most of the Gulf Coast. But the most thoughtful of them admit that it is hopeless and that Atlanta, with its famous forested canopy and brilliant shrubs, has finally gardened itself into a corner. 
 "Hey, I admit it, I'm addicted to water," said Caroline Gordon, a suburban Alpharetta resident who was pushing a shopping cart laden with peonies and impatiens at a branch of Pike's, a large local nursery chain. "Chances are, every one of these plants is going to die once they cut the water off. But I just don't want to live in a big brown field. That's not what I moved here for."
There have been droughts before in Georgia, mostly affecting the peanut and cotton farmers in the southern part of the state. Those farmers are struggling dreadfully again this summer. But something different is happening this year: a combination of uncontrollable forces that has state officials darkly warning about major changes on the horizon in lifestyle and economy.
For one thing, the drought is worse this year than in most past summers; some parts of Georgia have received less rain in the last 25 months than at any time in recorded weather history. Dr. David E. Stooksbury, the state climatologist, says the regional climate is changing in a profound way, moving from many years of stability with predictable rainfall to a far more variable climate that will veer between years of plenty and years of scarcity.
The Gulf Coast of Florida is experiencing the driest spring in a century, and the federal government's National Drought Monitor lists the crescent from Tampa to New Orleans as experiencing extreme drought. There has been a similar lack of rain in West Texas and northwest Missouri, and drought conditions exist in many other parts of the West and Midwest as well.
But the situation in Atlanta is an example of what can happen when growth and a shortage of rainfall collide. At the same time the natural spigot has been closed here, the Atlanta region has continued to grow without respite, adding nearly 100,000 people a year who fully intend to take showers, drink iced tea and swim. Most of the growth is in suburban areas, where the lawns are bigger, greener and thirstier, when they are not interrupted by backyard pools. And native and newcomer alike expect their lives to be air-conditioned, which in the summer requires huge releases from reservoirs to generate hydroelectric power.
The unstoppable flow of new customers would have taxed municipal water systems even without the drought, but with it the situation has become dire. The streams that fill the region's man-made reservoirs are flowing at less than half their usual rate, and the lakes would have dipped to dangerous levels if the Army Corps of Engineers had not agreed to cut back on power generation. But with the advent of summer, the electricity will have to be produced, the demand for water will increase and the lakes are expected to reach record lows. That makes water managers very nervous.
"Very soon, we're going to have to start drawing down those lakes," said Nowlton Johnson, the water resources chief at the state Environmental Protection Division. "But there's a limit to how much we can deplete our entire water storage. Something has to give."
That something is outdoor use. Water consumption nearly doubles here during the summer, and most of that increase feeds the sod, trees and gardens that have become the region's pride and bane. Last week, the state banned all outdoor watering for the 15-county Atlanta region from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. On Monday the state tightened the restrictions to limit outdoor watering to every other day. Violators face fines and the ultimate threat of a water shut-off; neighbors are being encouraged to report water criminals. But most officials expect a round-the-clock ban if these brilliant cloudless days continue, and then the great botanical brownout will begin.
"Please don't let it happen," said Walt Chastain, production director at the Gibbs Landscape Company, one of the region's many high-end lawn designers. "Most of our clients have invested well over $50,000 in their landscaping. You know what happens if they ban all watering? They're toast, man. Toast."
The loss of a lushly terraced oasis may seem a small price to pay in the face of a regional emergency, particularly considering what farmers farther south are experiencing. Tommy Irvin, who has been state agriculture commissioner since 1969, said this year's drought appears to be the worst in his tenure.
"Farmers had to start irrigating earlier this year than I've ever seen them do," said Mr. Irvin, whose office has been besieged with pleas for assistance. "The water tables are going down, and the ponds aren't filling. We had farmers planting peanuts in dry dust just to meet the federal government's June 1 deadline. And you know they're just not going to germinate."
But the potential water cutoff is no less threatening to those who work in metropolitan Atlanta's billion-dollar green industry. The Metropolitan Atlanta Landscape and Turf Association counts 530 landscape, maintenance and nursery companies in its membership, and Jean Ray, the group's executive director, estimated that the jobs of more than 3,000 people -- many of them Hispanic immigrants -- would be at risk if outdoor watering was cut off.
"The farmers tell me their cattle are eating brown grass, so why can't we play golf on brown grass?" Ms. Ray said. "And that sounds reasonable, until you think about the economic impact on our industry. It would be huge, a lot of layoffs."
The current restrictions are the most serious since the drought of 1986, when 26 cities and counties imposed total watering bans, lawns went brown, trees toppled and landscapers went hungry. But the region has grown by more than a million people in those 14 years, and this year's drought appears to be worse than that in 1986.The state has never imposed a total watering ban but is seriously considering doing so in the northern region if it does not rain soon.
At the rate the region is growing, demand for water will increase by 50 percent by 2020, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, a planning body, which predicts that the demand will never be met without a 10 percent cutback in water use by customers. State officials and horticulturalists are warning homeowners that they will have to begin mastering the principles of xeriscaping -- a kind of low-water landscaping -- if they want to preserve enough water for outdoor growth.
"People don't realize their lawns can look just as nice at one-third the size," said Walter Reeves, a University of Georgia horticulturalist whose television and radio gardening programs are immensely popular here. "They can have islands of flowers instead of a whole row, and there are many species of plants that require less water than the ones people use now."

Price Data From May Fuels Rise In Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose sharply yesterday after a government report on consumer prices for May showed no acceleration in inflation.
The report bolstered investor sentiment that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again when its policy makers meet on June 27 and 28. 
 The price of the 30-year bond gained 17/32 , to 104 26/32 while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.91 percent from 5.94 percent on Tuesday. The 10-year note rose 16/32 , to 103 12/32 ; its yield dropped to 6.03 percent from 6.11 percent.
Prices of government securities turned higher after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a less-than-expected 0.1 percent in May, suggesting that the six interest rate increases over the last year are having the desired effect in slowing rapid growth.
Even with the good news, the market rally fluctuated, leaving some market participants believing that they have already seen the best of the data showing benign inflation. Elsewhere, traders said an overnight purchase of longer-maturity Treasuries on the open market by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York lifted prices at the longer end of the yield curve.
"The debate over whether the recent softness in economic data presages a definitive slowdown in the pace of business activity or is merely a pause in the economy's momentum continues to command center stage among market participants," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "Nevertheless, the economy has built up a lot of steam and is not likely to come to a sudden, screeching halt."
"In the face of still-buoyant economic growth and tight labor markets," he added, the Federal Open Market Committee "will continue to regard inflation as being the major risk to economic well-being, and thus further Fed tightenings seem probable as the year progresses, although the F.O.M.C. is expected to remain on hold and defer any action at its meeting on June 28."
At first glance, inflation as measured by the C.P.I. appeared benign in May, but looks can be deceiving, Mr. Fine said. A timing quirk in the method for calculating the index produced a sharp drop in gasoline prices and did not include much of the increase in airline fares. He thinks the June C.P.I. could paint a drastically different picture.
After a weaker-than-expected retail sales report earlier this week, Richard DeKaser, chief economist for the National City Corporation in Cleveland, said the financial markets should be careful not to overinterpret that news as evidence of newly emerged weakness. That would be as inaccurate as exaggerating the strength apparent earlier this year.
"The outlook for Fed policy is unchanged," he said, "with no move expected in two weeks."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Of conservatism and distinctiveness in the religious marketplace.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress." Four economic analysts -- Ms. Postrel, Jeff Madrick, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
THE Southern Baptist Convention voted yesterday to amend its official statement of faith to declare that the Bible bars women from serving as pastors. Although each Baptist congregation is autonomous and the convention cannot stop a local church from ordaining or hiring a woman as pastor, the pronouncement is generally considered an important symbol of the denomination's increasing conservatism.
Critics also see the move as bad marketing. In a Gallup survey in May, 71 percent of Americans who expressed religious preferences said they favored "having women as pastors, ministers, priests or rabbis in your own faith or denomination." As a result, the Gallup organization said that in approving the new statement, the Southern Baptists would be "out of step with the significant majority" of religious Americans. 
 To Laurence Iannaccone, however, the vote is part of a rational strategy and is not necessarily a sign of greater conservatism. Professor Iannaccone, of Santa Clara University in California, has pioneered the application of economic theory to religion. His research examines how individuals make rational choices among religious alternatives and how religions compete in what is, thanks to the First Amendment, the nation's freest marketplace.
Among the questions he has explored are why strict churches -- those that in some way limit members' activities outside the church -- are strong, and how conservative churches adapt when social norms become more liberal. Both questions are relevant to the issues faced by the Southern Baptists, a moderately strict denomination that is the nation's largest Protestant group.
Strictness can manifest itself in dietary restrictions, distinctive clothing, geographical separation or prohibitions on activities like dancing or drinking. It can also entail such requirements as sending one's children to the church school, observing unique holidays or attending Wednesday night services in addition to Sunday services.
Joining a strict group may sound irrational when there are less costly alternatives. "Why become a Mormon or a Seventh-day Adventist" -- let alone join a so-called cult -- "when the Methodists and Presbyterians wait with open arms?" Professor Iannaccone wrote in "Why Strict Churches Are Strong," a 1994 article in the American Journal of Sociology.
His answer is that high costs screen out "free riders," deadbeat members who would otherwise enjoy a church's benefits without contributing energy, time and money. If everyone in the group has to pay a visible price, free riders will not bother to join and a committed core will not end up doing all the work. The group may attract fewer members at first, but it will be stronger over time. Distinctiveness also gives people a reason for affiliation and a sense of camaraderie. Why join a religious group if it is identical to the rest of society?
But a church cannot survive if the cost of membership is too great, especially if it wants to draw members from social groups that have other opportunities. By raising the costs of the old rules, social change poses a significant challenge to conservative religious groups. It is harder for members to find a happy compromise between the church's ideals and social norms, because the two are now far apart. Views or practices that were once close to the mainstream become deviant -- and costly.
"Contrary to most folks' assumptions, a successful conservative church must constantly adapt to social change," Professor Iannaccone said. Churches that do not evolve lose members, especially among the young, and they attract fewer converts. "The trick," he emphasizes, "is not to adapt so quickly or completely that all sense of distinctiveness is lost." A successful church will maintain what he calls an "optimal gap" between its norms and society's. Nowhere is this clearer than in the changing role of women.
In a 1990 article, Professor Iannaccone and his wife, Carrie A. Miles, a social psychologist, examined the Mormon Church's reaction to the women's movement. They combined a careful analysis of church literature from the 1950's to the mid-1980's with statistics on temple rituals performed by younger and newer members and those performed by older ones. The ritual statistics measure the degree of religious commitment for the two demographic groups.
Their analysis disclosed the church's balancing act: tough rhetoric in the short term and gradual accommodation over the long run. This strategy looks like the optimal way to keep older members without alienating younger Mormons or new converts.
Throughout the period, the church upheld the ideal of a family headed by a husband with a full-time homemaker wife and many children. Indeed, during the 1960's and 70's, church literature was much more likely to pound home the point than in the 1950's, when general social norms were not much different from Mormon views. But over time, the church began to allow exceptions to the idea that wives should not work: for widows or women whose husbands were disabled, for women who prayed about their careers and had God's and their husbands' permission to work and, eventually, for women whose children were grown.
By the 1980's, family was still primary, but the ideal of women's work had changed. "They were acknowledging that women should have careers before they have children and after their children are grown, and that they should do things that will keep their skills alive while they're home with their children," Dr. Miles said. "And Mormon women are working at the same rate as anybody else."
For Southern Baptists, the story is much the same. Far from being kept at home, Baptist women run many of the denomination's operations, and they have career aspirations similar to non-Baptists. Drawing the line at pastorships, Professor Iannaccone argues, is a low-cost way to preserve the church's distinctiveness while quietly accommodating broader social changes.
"The average woman doesn't want to be a priest or a pastor," he said. "The average woman wants a career, and the church has allowed it. Twenty or 30 years ago, people seriously talked about men being the authorities in the household. Now they talk about 'servant leadership,' and when you get underneath all that language, it's almost devoid of content. They don't say that men should always make the big decisions in the household."
In a dynamic marketplace, even the most conservative faiths have to adapt to what people want. But that does not mean giving up their distinctiveness.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq TurnsLower Again, But Blue Chips Edge Ahead

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday as the Nasdaq market fell 1.39 percent, the seventh consecutive session in which the technology-dominated gauge has reversed direction from the one before, while blue chips gained.
The Dow Jones industrial average posted its second consecutive moderate gain after three declines as some investors appeared to seek safety among household names, embracing a range of companies from Microsoft to Alcoa. 
 A Labor Department report showing minimal consumer inflation last month and a Federal Reserve survey of regional economies that found signs of slackening economic growth did little yesterday to change the prevailing belief that the Federal Reserve would probably forgo raising interest rates again when it meets in two weeks but might have to do so later.
"The rate increases that they began a year ago have begun to bite," said Mary Jane Matts, director of research for National City Private Investment Advisors in Cleveland. "But we don't think they're done" raising rates, she added, because inflation pressures are likely to persist.
To Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the market's chief worry has shifted to a focus on a possible side effect of the Fed's rate medicine: stunted growth of corporate profits.
"There is a sea change," Mr. Galvin said.
The Nasdaq composite shed 53.65 points yesterday, to 3,797.41, leaving it 1 percent ahead of its level on June 6, when the protracted up-down pattern began. The loss so far this year is 6.68 percent.
As for the Dow industrials, where 20 issues gained and 9 fell, the average climbed 66.11 points, or 0.62 percent, to 10,687.95. That narrowed its loss for the year to 7.04 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index scarcely budged, edging up 1.1 points, to 1,470.54. Although winners outnumbered losers by 263 to 217, the index was weighed down by losses in Intel, off 5 1/16, to 126 7/16; Lucent, down 2 1/8, to 56 5/8; WorldCom dropping 2 7/8, to 401 3/16; Qualcomm, falling 10 7/8, to 70 1/2; and Oracle down 21 1/16, to 79. Cisco Systems managed a gain of 3/16, to 65 3/16.
"I thought we'd be doing better today," Donald G. Berdine, chief investment officer for PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh, said yesterday, pointing to subdued inflation data and an economic slowing that he said he did not think would wind up in a so-called hard-landing. He projects that profits of the S.& P. 500 companies will rise 8.3 percent next year.
Seagram, which confirmed it was in negotiations to be acquired and jumped 7 1/8, to 60 1/8, was one of the day's standout gainers. Schering-Plough, which a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst raised to a "strong buy," climbed 3 1/8, to 48 1/2, to pace a generally strong drug sector.
Brokerage firm stocks also surged, with Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers each gaining more than 4 points, and Merrill Lynch more than 3.
Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 929.8 million shares, slightly less than on Tuesday, as 1,687 stocks rose and 1,253 fell.

Inflation Rate Flat in May, But Up Over Last 12 Months
The national inflation rate, which has been inching up this year, leveled off in May, the Labor Department reported.
The Consumer Price Index, the best known measure of American inflation, rose 0.1 percent in May. Measured over 12 months, however, the inflation rate through May was half a percentage point higher than it was last fall. Excluding energy and food prices, the index was up 0.2 percent in May. Page C14. 

Even in Deal, Seagram Trails S.& P.
Since Edgar Bronfman Jr. took control of Seagram nearly six years ago and sought to recast the liquor and beverage giant as a liquor, media and entertainment empire, he has added some value, but Seagram's performance has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Even if Seagram receives $77 a share in a deal with Vivendi of France, its performance would still trail the S.& P. 500. Market Place. C14.
 
Bear Stearns Net Profit Falls 40%
Bear Stearns said that its second-quarter profit fell 40 percent because of a slump in the bond market and a one-time $96 million charge stemming from a federal court judgment. Excluding the charge, profits rose 8 percent and beat Wall Street expectations. Shares of Bear Stearns rose $1.375, to $42.25. C27.
 
Nasdaq Declines in Mixed Trading
Stock prices were mixed as the Nasdaq composite index fell 53.65 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,797.41. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 66.11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,687.95, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.1 points, to 1,470.54. C12.
 
New York Life in Racketeering Suit

THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE PROSPERS IN NEW YORK -- Vice President Al Gore is giving a double meaning to his current "prosperity tour," collecting a cool million in New York last night. After opening his "progress and prosperity tour" in New York on Tuesday, Mr. Gore headed for Scranton, Pa., then swooped back into Manhattan last night for two dinners on the Upper East Side for the Democratic National Committee before resuming his tour today in Cincinnati. Unlike Pennsylvania and Ohio, however, New York is perceived as squarely in Mr. Gore's corner and is a reliable source of campaign cash. The vice president stopped first at the Park Avenue home of Alan J. Patricof, a financier, where 40 people paid $12,500 each for a total take of $500,000. At the next stop, the 90th Street home of Mitchell Blutt, a doctor and venture capitalist, 50 people paid $10,000 each, also yielding $500,000. At Mr. Patricof's apartment, Mr. Gore praised his listeners, many of whom had supported President Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and had been contributing to the Democratic Party ever since. The vice president thanked them for "being a constant source of good common-sense advice on how to pursue progressive values in a way that would ensure economic strength, build the economy and lift up the people who most need the benefits of good policy." Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT) 

NEW ROLE FOR GORE AIDE -- One of Vice President Al Gore's top consultants, Tad Devine, is shifting into a more central role in Nashville, where he will be spending several days a week. Mr. Devine, 45, a partner with Bob Shrum, Mr. Gore's media adviser, has periodically been deployed to Nashville from Washington as a trouble-shooter at crucial moments, such as early this year in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, and last fall when Mr. Gore was angling for the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Mr. Devine has a reputation for being a fierce campaigner, but he is also perceived as a mediator among some of the factions that have developed within the Gore campaign. Meanwhile, Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman, was admitted Monday night to a hospital in Washington, where doctors found he had an inflamed colon. He was expected to be released soon. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)
 
THE HOUSE
 
SOUTHERN PRIMARY RESULTS -- The lineups for Congressional races across the South were set in primaries on Tuesday. In Virginia's Seventh Congressional District, anchored in the Richmond suburbs, Eric L. Cantor of Henrico, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, defeated State Senator Stephen H. Martin of Chesterfield for the Republican nomination by only 197 votes, out of 41,539 cast. Mr. Cantor will face Warren Stewart, a Democrat who is school superintendent of Goochland County in a race to fill the seat of Representative Thomas J. Bliley, a Republican who is retiring after 20 years. In other primaries on Tuesday, Henry Brown, a South Carolina state representative, defeated H. B. Limehouse, a former state transportation chairman, for the Republican nomination for the seat now held by Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican who is retiring to keep his campaign pledge to serve only three terms. Mr. Brown will oppose Andy Brack, the Democrat who is a former journalist and spokesman for Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina. In a heavily Republican district where South Carolina Democrats declined to nominate a candidate, Jim DeMint, a freshman representative, assured his House re-election by defeating Frank Raddish in the Republican primary. In Arkansas, State Senator Mike Ross defeated Dewayne Graham, a former television reporter, for the Democratic nomination and will face Representative Jay Dickey, a Republican seeking his fourth term.

THE ISSUES
 
DEBATING FOR CHARITY -- The billionaire financier Theodore J. Forstmann announced yesterday that he would donate a total of $1 million to children's charities if Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to participate in a 90-minute televised debate on education. Mr. Forstmann, a critic of public education who co-founded the Children's Scholarship Fund, which sends children from poor families to private schools, said he sent invitation letters to each candidate on June 13, but had yet to hear from either one. "If we are to see the day in which every single child in America has equal opportunity in education," Mr. Forstmann said at a news conference at the New York Press Club, "then we must face up to the failure of our current model of education to provide it." Mr. Gore told reporters today that he would accept Mr. Forstmann's proposal, although he seemed a bit insulted that money was attached to it. "Nobody has to give money to get me to debate," he said in response to a question from reporters as he campaigned today in Scranton, Pa. Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said, "The governor looks forward to debating on education this fall since education is his top domestic priority, but as to this specific invitation, we have not had an opportunity to review it yet." Edward Wong (NYT)
 
THE SOUTH
 
GAY PROSECUTOR DEFEATED -- The only openly gay Republican officeholder in the South lost that designation on Tuesday. David Schwacke, the solicitor, or chief prosecutor, in Charleston, S.C., was narrowly defeated in a Republican primary by Ralph Hoisington, a lawyer whose campaign slogan was "For our families." Mr. Hoisington won by only 265 votes out of 29,421 cast, a margin so small that it will automatically trigger a recount. Mr. Schwacke was seeking re-election for the first time since making his homosexuality public three years ago. He did so after local Republican officials asked the state police to investigate accusations that Mr. Schwacke had downloaded pornography on his office computer. He was cleared of any wrongdoing. Mr. Hoisington outspent Mr. Schwacke by nearly 4 to 1 and ran television advertisements vowing to get tough on child molesters. Kevin Sack (NYT)
 
THE GREEN PARTY
 
NURSES UNION BACKS NADER -- Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running for president on the Green Party line, has picked up the endorsement of a major nurses union in California, where his candidacy could have an impact on who wins the state in the general election. The California Nurses Association, a 31,000-member union based in Oakland, praised Mr. Nader for what it called his commitment to universal health care, patients' rights and expanded federal health insurance.

HEADLINE: Abolish the Estate Tax

BYLINE: By Nydia M. Velazquez; Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democrat, is a member of the House of Representatives from Brooklyn.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, I meet regularly with small-business owners who speak enthusiastically about their struggles and rewards. Many glow with pride as they place a hand on the shoulder of a son or daughter who they hope will one day inherit the family business.
Unfortunately, the reality for family-owned small businesses is that one-third will be forced to sell or partially liquidate themselves to pay estate taxes on the owner's death. (Many small businesses' earnings are taxed as personal income.) To try to avoid that fate, small businesses spend millions of dollars each year on estate planning. The estate tax rate is even higher for those owners who elect to pass their businesses on to a grandchild because of a penalty for generation skipping. 
 Recently, the House of Representatives passed legislation to eliminate the estate tax, a plan that will be used as the basis for solving this problem. The measure does not just benefit the rich, as some have argued. More than half of those who paid death taxes in 1996 had estates valued at less than $1 million, with most valued below $5 million. These are not the Rockefellers and Carnegies; they're the families next door. The legislation establishes a threshold to ensure that small businesses will benefit. For these businesses the issue is one of simple fairness. Small business represents 99 percent of all American employers and provides jobs for more than half of all nonfarm workers. These entrepreneurs generate 80 percent of the jobs, nearly half of them in the high-tech sector. They produce the majority of new products, and obtain more patents and make more discoveries than large companies. They are responsible for most of the basic skills training for our work force.
Small-business owners also have a new face, which is increasingly minority and female. At last count, there were two million minority-owned businesses and more than nine million businesses owned by women. And the numbers are growing.
Yet many first-generation business people know that the odds are against giving their children a chance to carry on the family trade. Some 70 percent of family businesses don't survive into the second generation, and almost 90 percent don't make it to the third. The estate tax is one impediment to future success.
As a child, I saw what members of my family had to do to keep a small business afloat. So I share the anxiety expressed in the letter of a New York man who is a third-generation owner of a manufacturing business. He estimated that in the last five years he had spent more than $300,000 in legal and consultant fees, life insurance and other planning expenses to protect his children from having to sell the business to pay estate taxes when he dies. Despite the careful planning, he worries he may have overlooked something. He is also concerned about his 150 employees, who would lose their jobs and benefits, should his children not be able to pay the estate taxes.
His story is one of many. A survey of 365 businesses in New York State found that one-third anticipate having to sell or partially liquidate their businesses to meet their federal estate taxes. They could better spend their time and money on capital investment, job creation and employee benefits. Small businesses face enough hurdles without bearing the added burden of archaic laws that essentially tax them on their profits and then tax them again when the owner dies.
Parents work hard to leave their family business to the children. Those children should not be forced to sell that business to pay taxes once they inherit it. Protecting family businesses and fueling our new economy is what reforming the estate tax is all about.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Abortion Politics Surface at Gore Event

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Pa., June 14

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore brought his "prosperity and progress tour" to northeastern Pennsylvania today, promoting his plan to protect Medicare and saying he would provide additional money for health care providers that serve Medicare patients.
But in the process, Mr. Gore also became ensnared in abortion politics as he was forced at the last minute to move his event from a Roman Catholic hospital to a nondenominational health care center after church officials registered concern about Mr. Gore's support for abortion rights. 
 Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground between Mr. Gore and his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. It is also home to one of the largest concentrations of elderly people in the country, and Mr. Gore addressed his message today to them.
With the pending retirement of the baby boom, the number of Americans on Medicare is expected to double to 80 million from 40 million by 2035. Mr. Gore has proposed removing Medicare from the normal budget process so that the money collected from the payroll tax for it is dedicated to the health care program, and is not raided by Congress.
And he wants to offer a prescription drug benefit under which those on Medicare would receive half of the cost of their drugs, up to $5,000 annually. He said today that for no extra premium, he would provide a catastrophic prescription drug benefit that would cover all drug costs for recipients after they paid $4,000 out of their own pockets. He said that plan would begin in 2002.
Mr. Gore also spoke of his commitment to increasing money for biomedical research. And in his zeal to spread a positive, can-do message, he told his audience here at the Allied Services health care center about a conversation he had earlier today with a woman outside a pharmacy.
Mr. Gore said that the woman, in her late 20's or early 30's, told him that her 32-year-old husband had died last month of Lou Gehrig's disease. "She said, 'I'd like to say something to you. I want you to do everything you can to help our country find a cure for that disease,' " Mr. Gore said.
"Well, there's good news," Mr. Gore went on. "Within weeks, an event will take place that is comparable in importance to the landing of the first person on the moon." He was referring to the completion of the first phase of the human genome project, which is expected to aid in the treatment of various diseases.
He said he would double the amount of money devoted to cancer research, adding, "I'll make it a priority to treat and conquer diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes, Lou Gehrig's disease, mental illness and H.I.V./AIDS."
Mr. Gore also said that too many health care providers had been hurt by excessive budget cuts under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and that he would provide extra money for nursing homes, hospitals, home-health agencies and teaching hospitals.
He said that he would offer details on how to pay for all of these programs once the new budget surplus numbers were released, perhaps within a couple of weeks. The surplus outside of Social Security, already estimated at between $750 billion and $2 trillion, is expected to grow by a trillion more dollars.
Mr. Gore's staff had scheduled today's health care forum at Mercy Hospital, run by nuns, in Scranton.
But at the last minute the local bishop, James C. Timlin, a hospital board member who had been notified by the Scranton chapter of Pennsylvanians for Human Life, said he did not want Mr. Gore, a supporter of abortion rights, using the hospital as a political platform.
As a result, the Gore campaign switched the event to Allied Services.
Still, anti-abortion protesters held a candlelight vigil outside Mr. Gore's hotel on Tuesday night and demonstrated today at his speech.
August Perrotti, 49, a state food inspector who identified himself as a Democrat, was one of those holding signs. Like many voters in this Democratic stronghold in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Mr. Perrotti opposes abortion rights and said he would vote for Mr. Bush because of Mr. Gore's stance. He said he was disappointed that Mr. Gore had abandoned his earlier anti-abortion views and was pleased that "our bishop stood up for us on this issue."
Meanwhile, Republicans today challenged the whole premise of Mr. Gore's "prosperity and progress tour," mocking Mr. Gore by calling it the "I invented prosperity tour."
Gov. Tom Ridge, the Pennsylvania Republican who is under consideration as Mr. Bush's vice-presidential running mate, said in a statement released by the Bush campaign, "As he travels along on his 'I invented prosperity tour,' I ask him to remember that the credit for our healthy economy belongs to the hard-working men and women of Pennsylvania, not Pennsylvania Avenue."
"The vice president can lay no claim on their personal prosperity or professional success," Mr. Ridge added.

HEADLINE: THE KOREAN BREAKTHROUGH: WASHINGTON;
U.S. Says It Will Soon Drop Its Sanctions on North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14

 BODY:
Clinton administration officials, trying to build on the progress of the Korean summit meeting, said tonight that they would announce within a week the lifting of a broad set of economic sanctions that have been in place against North Korea since it invaded the South 50 years ago this month.
The end of these sanctions would allow North Korea, which is economically desperate, to export raw materials and goods to the United States and would open air and shipping routes between the two countries. American companies would be allowed to invest in agriculture, mining, roads, ports, travel and tourism in the North, though it is likely that far more Japanese and South Korean companies would try to do so. 
 The Clinton administration's decision to end sanctions -- a carrot that President Clinton dangled in front of the North last fall as part of a strategy formulated by former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry -- has limits. Prohibitions on the sale of high technology and "dual-use goods" -- those that could be used for both civilian and military purposes -- will remain in place as long as North Korea is still classified a terrorist state by the State Department, officials said. The United States is also required by law to oppose financing to terrorist countries from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
But administration officials said today that they hoped the North might, in coming months, make concessions that would get it off the terrorist list.
Today, Mr. Clinton cautiously referred to the agreement on the Korean peninsula as "just the first step," but added, "It's clearly a move in the right direction, and everyone else in the world should be encouraged."
Perhaps as striking as the imminent lifting of the sanctions is the administration's sudden change of tone about the North's mysterious leader, Kim Jong Il. Until recently, Mr. Kim was usually described by American officials as paranoid, a recluse, a kidnapper and a patron of European prostitutes. But this evening, one senior administration official went to some lengths to praise Mr. Kim and compare him to his South Korean counterpart, Kim Dae Jung.
"We knew that Kim Dae Jung was courageous and a visionary," the official said. "Kim Jong Il clearly has some of those qualities, and is displaying some vision himself."
That new approach to the North marks a big risk for the Clinton administration, especially if the accords reached today dissolve in bickering over the details.
There is reason to worry about that: some of the concessions announced today, such as cultural exchanges and visits across the demilitarized zone by Koreans who have not seen family members for half a century, were the centerpieces of a 1991 agreement between the two nations that was never put into action.
But the agreement today, officials noted, bears the imprimatur of both nation's leaders. And Kim Jong Il, they said, made a public about-face, inviting North Koreans to line the streets as he welcomed a South Korean leader that the North has regularly characterized as an evil lackey of the Americans.
If the change in the North's attitude proves real, however, it creates a whole new set of questions for the United States. Would the United States be willing, over time, to withdraw some of the 37,000 American troops based in South Korea? Is it ready to resume diplomatic relations with the North, as it did five years ago with Vietnam?
And how could the United States justify spending $60 billion on a missile defense system predicated partly on the threat of a nuclear attack from North Korea, if it believed the North was changing course?
While the administration has gone to extraordinary lengths in the past two years to coax the North out of its shell, it is unready and unable to answer those questions.
"The sticking point is the North's nuclear weapons and their missiles," said Donald Gregg, the former Central Intelligence Agency station chief and then American ambassador to Seoul. "As soon as we raise those, they are going to raise the question of why we still have troops on the Korean peninsula. And no one is ready to deal with that."
He added, "Kim Dae Jung very wisely went to Pyongyang with an agenda that deals with those issues that are within the control of South Korea and North Korea." Diplomats familiar with Kim Dae Jung's talking points say he went determined to raise the security issues, but only in an oblique way. South Korean officials say that Kim Dae Jung planned to tell Kim Jong Il that those issues needed to be resolved, but not to press specific ideas.
"That may be the subject of the return visit to Seoul," one senior South Korean official said.
North Korea watchers here -- from intelligence officials to State Department diplomats -- say that even if a new era of cooperation is dawning, there is little reason to believe that the agreement reached today heralds any imminent unification of the Korean peninsula.
Neither side really wants that any time soon. The North's leaders have long been focused on survival -- keeping their regime together at any cost. Kim Jong Il appears to have concluded that his best chances of survival lie in milking South Korea and Japan for the aid and trade he needs to achieve that goal.
And South Korea, for all its talk about the ultimate goal of reunifying the nation, knows that true reunification would cost a fortune. The billions spent propping up the country could endanger the South's recovery from the Asian economic crisis that threatened to ruin it two years ago. And it would dramatically change the country's social dynamics.
"Unification is a national goal," one senior South Korean diplomat said earlier this year, "and it should stay that way for a good while."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Steps Up Jabs Against Lazio

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Signaling a new, aggressive approach to her Senate campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday accused her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, of voting in Congress "against the interests of women, children and families."
She invoked his positions on gun control, abortion and education financing to assert that Mr. Lazio is not the moderate figure he claims to be -- a claim that even Mrs. Clinton's aides acknowledge is gaining some currency with voters. 
 The first lady assailed Mr. Lazio repeatedly during a 30-minute address to female supporters in Manhattan. She variously portrayed Mr. Lazio as a captive to the gun lobby, a Republican partisan and a supporter of abortion rights only when it came to "rich women" who did not need government assistance to pay for the procedure.
"On issue after issue, my opponent has been a follower, not a leader," Mrs. Clinton declared at a fund-raising breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria. "He voted to shut down the government. He voted for a trillion-dollar budget that would have slashed so many services that we need here in New York. He would squander the surplus and, I believe, endanger the economy. And yet he says he agrees with me on issues."
"Time and time again, my opponent has voted against the interests of New York's women, children and families," she said.
Mrs. Clinton's speech yesterday morning underscored a shift in strategy over the last several days by a candidate who has, with the loss of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as an opponent, seemed unsure how to proceed in an unexpectedly tight race with his replacement, a little-known Republican representative from Suffolk County. In taking on Mr. Lazio so directly -- the speech sounded like the kind of attack candidates save for the final weeks of a campaign -- Mrs. Clinton was trying to shape New Yorkers' perception of her new opponent before he can.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll released on Monday found the candidates in a dead heat, even though most New Yorkers polled said they did not know enough about Mr. Lazio to venture an opinion on his fitness for office.
"Maybe his folks think that if he remains a blank slate, he wins; but no one remains a blank slate," one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers said, adding that it was "time to run the fingernails across the blank slate."
This aggressive stance was notable for a first lady who has been, with a few exceptions, decorous in most of her campaign appearances, to the continuing frustration of Democrats who worry that her campaign is overly placid.
But for Mrs. Clinton, who is disliked by many voters, the strategy risks alienating potential supporters. She already was viewed unfavorably by 31 percent of respondents in the Times/CBS poll, taken from June 4 to June 10, an uncomfortably high number that may explain why Mr. Lazio is doing so well.
And by noon yesterday, Mr. Lazio moved to encourage this sentiment about Mrs. Clinton, releasing a statement asserting that the first lady was engaging in "mudslinging" and distorting what he described as his "mainstream record."
"I was deeply disappointed today to see Mrs. Clinton launch a campaign that seems to be made up of little more than attacks designed to fool New Yorkers about my record," Mr. Lazio said. "While I understand the first lady's frustration with her campaign's inability to connect with New Yorkers, I believe she would better serve herself by addressing the issues rather than throwing mud.
"I am sad to say that all too often it appears that the first casualty in a Clinton campaign is the truth," he declared.
Mrs. Clinton is seeking to do what is known in politics as "defining" an opponent, though in practice, several politicians noted yesterday, the word "destroying" might be more apt. In this case, Mrs. Clinton's advisers have cited polls that suggest that voters, if they have a view of Mr. Lazio at all, consider him moderate rather than conservative; in the Times/CBS poll, 34 percent of respondents described him as moderate, and 28 percent called him conservative. (The poll of 1,384 voters across New York was taken from June 4 to June 10 and had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.)
Mr. Lazio is viewed in Congress as having an ideologically nuanced record; he is conservative on some issues and moderate on others. Mrs. Clinton pointed to votes Mr. Lazio had cast to try to place him on the conservative side of the spectrum.
For example, she noted that he had joined Republicans in voting against legislation to provide funding to allow public schools to hire 100,000 more teachers. Instead, Mr. Lazio supported Republican legislation that would have given school districts more flexibility in deciding how to spend federal money for education.
She also noted that Mr. Lazio had opposed legislation to give patients the right to sue health maintenance organizations, and a Democratic bill to provide Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. And she assailed him again for opposing proposals to require the registration of new handguns and the licensing of gun owners.
"Apparently, he is more willing to go along with the Republican leadership and the N.R.A. than the children and families of New York," she said, referring to the National Rifle Association.
Most of all, with an eye to her female audience, Mrs. Clinton stressed Mr. Lazio's views on abortion. She noted that the next Senate is likely to vote on nominees to the Supreme Court, and asserted that Mr. Lazio could not be counted on to oppose justices who would support curbing abortions.
Mr. Lazio says he supports keeping abortion legal but, unlike Mrs. Clinton, opposes public financing of abortion and supports a ban on the procedure that abortion foes refer to as "partial birth abortion."
"I know that my opponent calls himself pro-choice, but if you look at his record, he's apparently pro-choice for rich women," Mrs. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Report Shows Inflation Level in May but Rising Long-Term

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The national inflation rate, which has been inching up this year, leveled off in May, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But rising gasoline prices promised a fresh increase in inflation for June.
The Consumer Price Index, the best-known measure of American inflation, rose an unremarkable 0.1 percent in May. What is striking about this latest report, however, is not what happened in May, but the long-term trend that is finally emerging. Measured over 12 months, the inflation rate through May was half a percentage point higher than it was last fall. 
 "There is no longer any doubt that inflation has accelerated," said Joel Popkin, president of Joel Popkin & Company, an economic consulting firm. Like many other economists, he attributed the acceleration mainly to months of strong consumer demand that have permitted many companies to gradually raise prices.
Only recently has consumer demand appeared to ease a bit, the principal evidence being a decline in retail sales in April and May. The Federal Reserve, in a separate report yesterday, took note of the incipient easing. Its periodic survey of economic conditions, called the beige book, found that "solid economic performance continued in April and May," but with "signs of some slowing from the rapid pace earlier in the year." The Fed also found "indications of worsening price inflation" in some parts of the country.
Rising prices are often attributed to increasing labor costs. Labor shortages give workers the leverage to obtain higher wages, this argument goes, and then companies raise prices to cover the higher costs of labor. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has raised this concern recently. But other economists argue that labor costs, while rising, have played no role so far in the gradually accelerating inflation rate. Most companies, they argue, would first cut back profits to pay for labor, and profits have not yet fallen.
"Inflation today is not the conventional story," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "It is clearly not wage growth that is pushing up prices."
With May included, the overall Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over 12 months, and 2.4 percent when energy and food were left out. In each case, the rate was half a percentage point higher than the annual rate late last year. Because energy and food prices fluctuate rapidly, many economists prefer the so-called core rate, which eliminates these items.
Food prices jumped by 0.5 percent in May, the biggest increase since October 1998. But fluctuating gasoline prices -- they were found to have fallen in May -- more than offset the food price increase. As a result, the overall Consumer Price Index rose only 0.1 percent, while the core rate was up 0.2 percent.
Timing played a big role in this idiosyncratic result. With OPEC's production cutbacks apparently ending, gasoline prices had fallen in April and then, on May 1, they began to rise again. But when the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed prices in early May, gasoline had not yet returned to its early April level.
It has since gone much higher, reaching $1.66 a gallon on average this week, according to the Energy Department. Other things being equal, gasoline prices at $1.66 could add three-tenths of a percentage point to the overall Consumer Price Index in June, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the bureau.
Housing and medical care have made steady contributions to the gradually accelerating core inflation rate, and they did so again in May. Housing was up 0.2 percent, mostly because of higher rent and an equivalent increase in the monthly cost of owning a home. Many hotels raised their daily rates, and that helped to push up housing costs.
Those costs have now risen 2.9 percent over the 12 months that ended in May, while medical costs have gone up 4 percent in the corresponding period, including a 0.3 percent increase in May. Ever more costly prescription drugs and rising hospital rates have played big roles in the rising medical costs.
Airline fares were up 0.8 percent in June, starting in mid-month when Continental Airlines raised fares and the other airlines followed. The airlines cite higher fuel costs as a reason for the increases, but other than airline fares, very little of the increased cost of petroleum has been passed through to other products and services -- to trucking rates, for example, and to plastics made from petroleum-based petrochemicals.
"It is tough to see the secondary effect yet," Mr. Jackman said.
Among other items, apparel prices fell 0.2 percent in May. They often decline, driven down by huge quantities of imported clothing. Tobacco prices, which often fluctuate, fell in May. They rise and fall as tobacco companies discount cigarette prices one month and remove the discounts the next. Auto prices, which have remained fairly steady, rose in May, driven up mainly by higher prices for used vehicles.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Evidence of a Slowdown
 (By Reuters), WASHINGTON, June 14 -- The booming United States economy showed signs of cooling during April and May but there also were indications in several regions of increased price inflation, the Federal Reserve said today.
The central bank's latest summary of coast-to-coast conditions, known as the beige book, reported "solid economic growth" but with glimmers of slowing in areas like borrowing and home building.
"All but Minneapolis said scattered signs of cooling are in evidence or the pace of growth is slowing," the Fed said.
"Indications of worsening price inflation, while not widespread, are reported by several districts," it added.
The beige book's findings will be used by members of the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee when they meet June 27 and 28 to consider interest rate strategy.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
As a salelooms, questions on leadership and strategy at the Seagram Company.

BYLINE: By Geraldine Fabrikant 

 BODY:
DURING one of the greatest bull markets in history, how has Edgar Bronfman Jr. done for the shareholders of the Seagram Company since he took control nearly six years ago and sought to recast his liquor and beverage giant as a liquor, media and entertainment empire?
With the Bronfman family negotiating to sell Seagram in an all-stock deal to Vivendi S.A., the French conglomerate that wants to expand its holdings in the entertainment business, the answer is that Mr. Bronfman has added some value, but Seagram's performance has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 Indeed, even if Seagram receives $77 a share, the highest rumored price yesterday, its stock would have appreciated 166.6 percent since May 1994, compared with more than 200 percent for the S.& P. 500. Its shares rose $7.125 yesterday, to $60.125.
The appreciation in the stock since 1994 could grow depending on what price is paid, of course, but the deal still faces hurdles, including the fact that Vivendi does not yet trade in the United States.
And if Mr. Bronfman had not undertaken a transformation of Seagram and had simply retained its holdings, it is not entirely clear that the per-share value of the company would have been much different from what it is today, according to analyses by a media analyst and an industry executive, both of whom insisted on anonymity.
Nevertheless, the stock has improved. So why a sale? The company has said that it feels it cannot compete in a world of far larger media companies. Still, Mr. Bronfman's performance has been criticized over the years, and while the Bronfman family certainly supports him publicly, at least one family member, his uncle, Charles Bronfman, has sold about 10 percent of his holdings to make investments elsewhere.
A sale will allow Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is expected to become vice chairman of the combined company, to follow the trend of media mergers. It will also produce profits for the Bronfman family, which has run Seagram for three generations and will be the largest single shareholder of the merged company, receiving 5 of the expected 18 board seats. Any gains, however, will be influenced by Vivendi's stock. Its price has risen sharply over the last year, but its future performance is uncertain.
One person close to the negotiations said yesterday that Mr. Bronfman had been having some misgivings about reporting to Jean-Marie Messier, the chairman of Vivendi. Nevertheless, the deal still has a decent chance of closing, he said. Still, the muted response of Seagram's stock raised questions about shareholders' confidence in a merger.
Precise terms have not been announced. Seagram's board is expected to meet informally on Saturday in New York and then formally on Wednesday at its regularly scheduled meeting, though the deal may not be announced for two weeks or more, one person close to the discussions said. The deal could be worth as much as $33.5 billion, a second person close to the transaction said. And Seagram shareholders will be protected with a minimum guarantee said to be at least 90 percent of the agreed-on per-share price if either Vivendi's stock drops or exchange rates move unfavorably.
Vivendi is a diversified conglomerate that has been scrambling under Mr. Messier to expand from mundane industries like water utilities to pay television and advertising.
Seagram was an attractive target because of Mr. Bronfman's razzle-dazzle acquisition tear. He started with a $2 billion investment in Time Warner and went on to buy 80 percent of MCA, the parent company of the Universal film and television studios; several record companies, including Polygram; and the 50 percent of USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel it did not already own.
And Seagram did more than buy assets. When Mr. Bronfman could not find suitable managers for his television and cable operations, he sold 50 percent of the cable channels to USA Networks Inc., along with a half-interest in its own television production business, betting that USA's chairman, Barry Diller, could run them better.
Despite the glamour connected with buying film, music and theme park businesses, Seagram's performance has been erratic. When Mr. Bronfman took over, Seagram consisted of a liquor company and a 25 percent stake in DuPont.
Had the company simply held on to its DuPont holdings, rather than selling nearly all of them in 1995, they would be worth roughly $24 billion, according to both an analyst and an industry expert.
The 328 million shares of DuPont the company then owned are now worth $14.7 billion. And the liquor business, these experts said, would be worth about $7 billion.
He pointed out that Seagram would have added roughly $1.5 billion in cash from DuPont dividends and the estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in capital it used to invest in the entertainment business. That would have brought the value of Seagram to about $27 billion, compared with its current value of $26 billion. Although the company has issued new stock since Mr. Bronfman took over, there were originally 350 million shares outstanding. Per share, the company would have been worth about $77 a share. Vivendi would spend an additional $6.6 billion because Seagram now has 436 million shares outstanding.
A Seagram spokesman argued that such comparisons were not valid because the company's stake in DuPont was illiquid, thus making it difficult for the company to realize its value, regardless of the stock price. And he noted that Seagram had increased its "enterprise value" -- in this case the combined value of its stock market capitalization, based on the offer price, and debt -- from $15 billion in 1995 to $41 billion.
In the view of Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University: "If something is illiquid, the right strategy is to sell it off slowly over time because the market is relatively thin compared to the size of the holdings. Had Seagram sold DuPont over four years, it would have realized substantially more as the price rose over $80 a share."
As to the enterprise value argument, he noted that "adding the debt ignores that much of the value is simply money Seagram borrowed and put into the business."
"If this argument were valid, businessmen could borrow huge amounts of money, put it into their business, raising enterprise value, regardless of performance."
The larger question will be how savvy was Mr. Bronfman's decision to enter the film and music business. Though Universal Pictures has recently benefited from hits like "Erin Brockovich," its film business has suffered, reporting a $206 million operating loss in the 1999 fiscal year.
Seagram has been aggressively building its music business, paying $10.4 billion for Polygram last year. And though Mr. Bronfman is a big fan of the music industry, the sale of music assets may be well timed.
Vivendi is paying a premium to buy heavily into the music industry at a time when its future is uncertain because of the online transmission of songs through services like Napster, which raises copyright questions.
"Until some of the potential becomes clearer, it remains vulnerable," said Michael Nathanson, a music industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.

Vivendi Chief Bets on His Ability to Create Media Empire

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 14

 BODY:
With his boyish good looks and knack for relentless deal-making, Jean-Marie Messier has dazzled investors by transforming France's biggest water utility into a media conglomerate.
As chairman of Vivendi S.A., Mr. Messier now controls Europe's biggest pay-television company, France's second-largest mobile telephone operator and a major publishing house. 
 But when Mr. Messier confirmed today that he was in talks to acquire the Seagram Company, including the Universal movie studio, investors were far from enthusiastic.
Shares of Vivendi plunged 10 percent, to 103.5 euros, or $99, in Paris today while shares of Canal Plus S.A., the pay-television company that Vivendi controls, dropped nearly 3 percent by midafternoon. That reaction reflected fears that Mr. Messier is about to take on a huge new burden and get little in return except for the glamour of becoming a Hollywood player.
"Clearly, the deal risks being very expensive for Vivendi, and that is the risk that the market is reacting to," said Andrew Shepherd-Barron, an analyst in London at the Dutch bank ABN Amro. "To pay for it, they are going to have to do something very clever."
But there are other problems as well. For all of Mr. Messier's nimbleness and vision about new media, Vivendi is one of Europe's most complicated and messy companies.
In some ways, Vivendi is the kind of European company that infuriates American investors. Though Mr. Messier is a passionate advocate of shareholder value, Vivendi is a maze of old- and new-economy businesses, many controlled through partial holdings and partnerships.
More than half of Vivendi's roughly $40 billion in revenue still comes from water distribution, waste management and construction. Its expanding portfolio of high-technology and media companies remains a mish-mash that provided only about one-quarter of Vivendi's $2.28 billion in operating profit last year.
As a wireless operator, Vivendi remains largely limited to France, while companies like Vodafone AirTouch are rolling out pan-European networks. Canal Plus, though profitable in France, is losing money over all in order to finance expansion in other European countries. To be sure, the 43-year-old Mr. Messier has achieved remarkable results. A former investment banker who became chairman in 1996, he has engineered huge acquisitions in both the old and new sides of the business. Last year, Vivendi acquired US Filter, one of the biggest water-treatment companies in the United States, for $6.2 billion. It also acquired the industrial waste business of Waste Management Inc.
Mr. Messier has been on a relentless buying binge in media and telecommunications. Like other brash European business executives, Mr. Messier has financed part of his expansion with the cash thrown off by the old-line businesses. Vivendi was a founding investor in Cegetel, a consortium that included Vodafone and British Telecommunications, which in turn created France's second wireless telephone network as well as a small but growing fixed-line competitor to France Telecom.
Much like Chris Gent of Vodafone or Roberto Colaninno of Olivetti, Mr. Messier has increasingly used Vivendi's own stock or bonds convertible into Vivendi stock as his acquisition currency. In 1997, he used Vivendi convertible bonds to acquire Havas, a large publishing and advertising company. Last year, he used Vivendi stock to acquire a 15 percent stake in Canal Plus from Richemont S.A., raising Vivendi's existing stake to 49 percent. Also last year, Vivendi acquired Pathe, which owned many media properties.
In his quest to become a global media player, Mr. Messier seems bent on making Vivendi a distributor of media and entertainment rather than an operator of telecommunication networks. But Vivendi remains an off-again-on-again player in Europe's torrid market for wireless telephone services. By siding with Vodafone Airtouch in its hostile takeover of Mannesmann A.G., Mr. Messier cut a deal with Vodafone to acquire its stakes in Cegetel and SFR, the French wireless carrier. That gave Vivendi control of SFR. Mr. Messier and Vodafone now plan a multimedia portal that would provide customers access to wireless services, television entertainment and the Internet. In negotiations to acquire the Universal movie studio as well as Polygram record label through Seagram, Mr. Messier appears to be betting that his control over rights to music and movies will greatly strengthen his hand as a distributor in Europe.
"It will give them access to English-language content that they would not otherwise have," said one French analyst. It might also have a curious effect on French cultural policies, which are still geared to preserving French culture by limiting the influx of Hollywood movies.
Mr. Messier is also busy shoring up his balance sheet. He raised nearly $8 billion last year in stock and convertible bond offerings. In July, Vivendi hopes to raise as much as $4 billion more through a public offering of Vivendi Environment, which contains the water treatment, waste management and construction businesses. Vivendi will still own about 60 percent of Vivendi Environment, but company executives say the partial spinoff will make the company much easier to understand. Vivendi Environment will assume about $14 billion of the company's overall debt.

HEADLINE: Korean Reconciliation

 BODY:
This week's first encounter between the leaders of North and South Korea did not end tensions in one of the most volatile corners of the world, but it did begin to overcome the enmity of a half-century. The Clinton administration rightly seeks to reinforce the gains by lifting many sanctions against Pyongyang. The North-South meetings unfolded in a surprisingly cordial atmosphere, and yesterday's joint declaration, though vaguely worded, contained just about all that could be realistically hoped for from this initial meeting. President Kim Dae Jung returns to South Korea with his stature enhanced. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, shed some of his reputation for reclusiveness and mystery.
The agreement addresses the long-term issues of reconciliation and eventual reunification, and the more immediate matters of economic and cultural exchanges and reunions of families divided since the Korean War. South Korea also promised to consider handing over prisoners who have served out their sentences for spying for the North. Encouragingly, both leaders pledged to follow up this week's sessions with a reciprocal visit by Kim Jong Il to Seoul, at "the earliest appropriate moment." 
 South and North Korea have agreed on reconciliation plans twice before, in 1972 and 1991. Each time, the two countries soon fell back into hostility and confrontation. This week's understandings, which incorporate elements of those earlier efforts, could produce more tangible results. Unlike the previous agreements, these have been endorsed by the top political leaders of both countries and are accompanied by a series of practical first steps.
If these steps are carried out on schedule, it may be possible to address more difficult political and military issues. Some earlier indicators will be whether the family visits are accomplished this summer, how plans for Kim Jong Il's visit to Seoul proceed, and whether arrangements can be worked out for a joint Korean team in the World Cup soccer competition in 2002.
The two Korean leaders played down security issues, with no public mention of North Korea's demand for the withdrawal of the 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea or of North Korea's suspended nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs. It is reasonable to put off such issues until greater trust has been established. But the border between the two Koreas remains the world's most militarized frontier. Reconciliation cannot advance very far without steps to address the North Korean threats that have made it so.

HEADLINE: THE KOREAN BREAKTHROUGH: THE OVERVIEW;
KOREAS REACH ACCORD SEEKING RECONCILIATION AFTER 50 YEARS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, June 15

 BODY:
With surprising speed and warmth, the presidents of North and South Korea reached a broad agreement on Wednesday to work for peace and unity on their bitterly divided peninsula, the biggest step by either side to ease tensions in 50 years.
The agreement, which came after more than three hours of talks in the North Korea capital, Pyongyang, on the second day of their first summit meeting, was signed and toasted by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and President Kim Jong Il of the North, who were shown on South Korean television clinking champagne glasses, shaking hands vigorously and smiling broadly. 
 The agreement, while deliberately vague, had clearly left both men buoyant. If carried through, the accord would reduce the precarious isolation of the North and address many basic points that have long been seen as keys to ending the cold war on the heavily fortified peninsula, where the United States still maintains 37,000 troops.
The general points agreed on included the need for reconciliation and unification; the establishment of peace; the commencement in August of exchange visits by members of divided families; and more cultural exchanges. Text, Page A14.
In addition, it was agreed that Kim Jong Il would visit Seoul "at the earliest appropriate moment." The two sides also discussed the creation of offices in each other's capitals, and establishing a hot line between their leaders.
"At this very hour, the attention of the 70 million Korean people is drawn to Pyongyang, and the eyes of the entire world are riveted to this place," the South Korean president said in a banquet prior to the signing. "For the first time, the Korean people can see a bright future as a dawn of hope for reconciliation, cooperation and unification is breaking."
While the agreement provides no road map for the future and did not address pressing security issues, it left many people here hopeful that a decisive turn was shaping up in relations between two governments that have vilified each other for decades.
In addition, the emergence of the reclusive North Korean leader in the role of a jovial statesman was certain to challenge the image of North Korea as a "rogue state" so dangerous that Washington is proposing to spend billions of dollars on an antimissile system to defend against it.
"It is important to remember the symbolic importance of this meeting," said a diplomat. "Hopefully, things will continue to proceed from here, but this has already been an unexpected success."
If the agreements lacked the kind of fine detail that is often carefully worked out in important negotiations like these, they may have more than compensated for that by the strongly personal imprimatur placed on them by leaders whose repeated performances before the cameras left no doubts about their enthusiasm.
"In societies as hierarchical as Korea, that counts for a lot," said Leon V. Sigal, a North Korea expert at Columbia University. "In the North, having Kim Jong Il sign his name to a communique like this makes it the equivalent of dogma."
Perhaps the brightest moment of the day came at the toast shared by the two leaders at the signing ceremony, which took place at 11:20 p.m. on Wednesday and was broadcast in South Korea an hour later.
While the 75-year-old South Korean president paused between draughts as he tried to empty his glass, the younger Kim Jong Il, who has been characterized in the South as a heavy drinker, tilted his head back and finished his champagne in one go.
One of the meeting's most significant achievements was to help fill in a sketchy portrait of the 58-year-old Kim Jong Il, who has been caricatured outside his country as a crackpot and a playboy.
He was frequently on view again on Wednesday, for the second consecutive day, as he was shown talking with his southern counterpart in a relaxed and self-confident manner. He himself joked about his reputation as a recluse.
"Westerners seem to have been very anxious about why I live like a hermit," he said in an informal chat with Kim Dae Jung, moments before the two leaders went into a two-hour and 20-minute meeting. "And now, with your visit, they've got the answer."
Seeking to dispel this image, the North Korean leader said he had traveled overseas many times, naming two countries he had visited, China and Indonesia, but said that he had done so secretly.
Kim Dae Jung, who had smiled politely throughout this impromptu banter, set off laughter among the aides in the room from both sides when, referring to the reports about the North Korean leader, he replied, "You seem to know everything."
South Koreans, who paused from work throughout the day to watch the events on television, and were riveted to the their screens for the dramatic late night conclusion, expressed surprise about the warm and apparently relaxed atmosphere surrounding the talks, which began with the unexpected greeting of Kim Dae Jung by the northern president upon his arrival at the airport.
Many people said they were impressed by how normal and personable the mysterious northern leader was, after years of denigrating propaganda in the south.
"This will change the relationship between the two countries," said Park Han Sung, a clerk at an eyeglass shop in downtown Seoul.
"Maybe nothing dramatic will happen right away," he added, "but most people would agree that a surprising amount of progress and understanding has been achieved already."
In his reply to the South Korean leader's banquet toast, the second-ranking figure in North Korea, Kim Young Nam, said: "History gives us opportunities only once. Reunification is not for the future but for the present."
Western journalists, who were not invited to the North for the summit meeting, covered it via a special television link in Seoul and were told to expect a streamlined, four-point agreement. But the final text appeared to have hastily added other items, like language about a search for reconciliation and respect for each country's political system, both of which appeared to be included to appease the prickly North.
For Pyongyang, there was also little doubt that mention of increased exchanges in fact meant a boost in aid and investment from the South that northern leaders hope will prop up their failing economy. Famine in the North has claimed the lives of as many as two million people, according to the estimates of aid workers and outside experts.
The southern delegation rushed to leave little doubt of its willingness to help, on Wednesday offering to speed delivery of 200,000 tons of fertilizer, and also reportedly offering to provide $450 million in economic assistance.
For the South Korean leader, progress on reunion was a vital gauge of the success of the meeting. Seven million of his compatriots have relatives in the North.
"Many of the family members are passing away due to their advanced age," Mr. Kim said in a speech intended to give a clear sense of urgency to their agenda. "We have to attend to their life-long wishes."
While both sides clearly have direct interests in reconciliation and reaching a peace agreement to finally end the state of war that formally persists between them, those interests are also keenly shared by the United States, China, Japan and other countries.
Japan has only recently renewed diplomatic contacts with North Korea, after a breech caused by Pyongyang's test-firing of a ballistic missile over Japan in 1998.
Washington has long been engaged in painstaking negotiations with North Korea seeking an end to the country's missile program, as well as a commitment not to develop or deploy nuclear weapons. For American defense planners, the divided peninsula remains one the most dangerous spots on the planet and the North's weapons programs have been seen as so potentially threatening that Washington is considering spending billions of dollars on a missile defense system to counter them.
How events of this summit meeting will shape those perceptions remains to be seen, but the North Korean leader has cleverly succeeded in changing an image that has alternated from flake to a modern-day Dr. Strangelove.
By showing himself far more publicly than ever before in meetings with the country's historic arch-enemy, whose peace initiatives he accepted with little of the North's usual intractability, he may have powerfully affected the dynamics surrounding American proposals to build an expensive antimissile shield.
North Korea's missile program has been the leading justification in Washington for the unproven shield. But Pyongyang has already suspended testing of missiles for over a year at Washington's request, and Mr. Kim's detente with the South, if upheld, with further chip away at the regime's image as being dangerous and unpredictable.
Despite the good feeling of the last two days, leaders in Seoul and elsewhere are likely to remain wary of the North's promises.
"I think it's very important that they've met, it's very important that they've signed this agreement," Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said in Washington. "But I think it's also very important that a process comes out of this summit that allows them to implement the important work they have agreed to in the last two days."
The South Korean president took a moment out to bluntly advise his North Korean counterpart, "It is important to improve your relations with the United States and Japan."
Over the last 20 years, the North and the South have held innumerable rounds of lower-level talks on issues like the reunion of families, and twice before such agreements have later come apart.
Most recently, in 1991, talks led to an agreement promoting peace and eventual reunification, but it was never put into practice, partly because of a dispute over the North's suspected development of nuclear weapons. And in the 1970's, Red Cross officials of both sides began talks that lasted 14 years on the reunification of families, bearing only meager results.
President Kim Dae Jung, who is expected to fly home later today around a border that separates over a million men under arms, often spoke with passion to his host in their second day of meetings.
In one statement he told his younger counterpart that, in the age of the Internet, competition between nations now rests on brain power and economic strength, and no longer so much on the weapons of old.
"To survive the fierce international competition, the North and South must be one," he said. "I would like to quote an old proverb: 'United, strength and mind wins over heaven.' When all Korean people join forces, there is nothing we cannot achieve."

HEADLINE: Theater for Fun or Profit;
Producers' Two Camps Remain Uneasy Allies

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
At a gathering of commercial theater producers and nonprofit theater executives at Princeton University in June 1974, Julian Beck of the experimental Living Theater emphatically called for the death of Broadway: "The alternative theater is a theater which has always been opposed to the Broadway theater. We want to destroy it. It is now being destroyed. It is in fact dying, and that is good."
Things have calmed down considerably in the last 26 years. Back then most nonprofit theaters were merely burgeoning artistic outposts; now many are formidable producing operations. Although the two worlds used to regard each other with suspicion and even disdain -- some of which still lingers -- commercial and nonprofit producers have increasingly become partners. The commercial side looks to the nonprofit for new material and chances to test costly projects; the nonprofit looks to the commercial to shoulder some expenses of ambitious productions and to help give shows longer lives on larger stages. 
 "You cannot afford the luxury any longer of thinking of two distinct isolated worlds of theater," said Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, New York's most powerful theater owner. "Economics have been the driving force between profit and nonprofit, or taxpaying and nontaxpaying, as I call it."
But although the two spheres have been collaborating more and more, disputes still rankle. Some Broadway producers, for example, resent New York's large nonprofits for reaping the benefits of producing shows on Broadway without the risk that comes with raising money from people who expect a return. The nonprofit Lincoln Center Theater, for example, has been criticized for being eligible for coveted Tony Awards -- like this year's best-musical prize for "Contact" -- without having the burden of repaying investors. Some nonprofit executives resent commercial producers for taking their work while cutting them out of the process and sometimes out of the financial rewards.
As a result questions remain: When projects are jointly developed, who has artistic control? Are nonprofits becoming too much like their commercial counterparts and abandoning a commitment to daring work? Has the commercial theater become overly dependent on the nonprofits for ideas it should be developing itself? (All of the American dramas nominated this year in the Tony Awards' best new play category originated in the nonprofit world, along with all three American productions competing for best revival of a play and two of the four best-musical nominees. And since 1976, with the exception of Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers" in 1991, every Pulitzer Prize winner for best play has been developed in a nonprofit theater.)
To tackle some of these sensitive issues, the two camps are coming together again, this time at Harvard University for a weekendlong conference that begins tomorrow. The conference, called Act Two, the Second American Congress of Theater, was organized by the League of American Theaters and Producers, which represents commercial producers, and the Theater Communications Group, which has 360 nonprofit members.
Among the country's estimated 1,100 nonprofits, most have annual budgets under $500,000. In New York they range from the Roundabout Theater Company, which has a budget of about $20 million and produces plays like the current "Uncle Vanya," to the Collapsible Giraffe, with a budget of about $25,000, which combines video and theater in new productions like its recent "Three Virgins," performed in a Times Square strip club. Conference participants will include a range of theater professionals -- artistic directors of regional theaters, Broadway producers, a few playwrights and actors -- as well as government officials.
Even though most of the conference will be closed to the press and the public to encourage candid discussion, there is some question about how frank participants will be about their real concerns. In an effort to spur some frank discussion, the Broadway producer Rocco Landesman -- writing in the June 4 Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times -- accused nonprofit theaters of modeling themselves after "the commercial arena, which is, in the end, not dedicated to the art so much as to the audience." In particular, Mr. Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns several Broadway houses, criticized the Roundabout's artistic director, Todd Haimes, for playing it safe with audience-pleasing work and for selling the name of his new theater to a corporation; it will now be the American Airlines Theater.
"It would, I suppose, be hyperbolic to say that Todd Haimes has had a more pernicious influence on English-speaking theater than anyone since Oliver Cromwell (and it wouldn't be nice, either, since Mr. Haimes is a personable and honorable man)," Mr. Landesman wrote, "but it can be reasonably argued that the forces of the marketplace through the years have been just as effective a censor as government edicts."
In an interview, Mr. Haimes called Mr. Landesman's assertions "absolutely ridiculous," as did several other nonprofit executives. While some nonprofit theaters with large groups of loyal subscribers have to worry about pleasing big audiences, Mr. Haimes said, most of them continue to concern themselves primarily with producing a body of work they can be proud of, not looking for the next commercial score.
"Ultimately they just don't want any more competition," Mr. Haimes said of producers like Mr. Landesman. "They should spend more energy focusing on doing plays."
As for agreeing to name the renovated Selwyn Theater on West 42nd Street in Manhattan for an airline sponsor, Mr. Haimes, whose company is known for producing revivals and musicals that appeal to a broad subscriber base, said: "I have absolutely no reservations about it. If they want to put their name on our theater and give us money and give us artistic control, I think it's a wonderful thing."
Roche Schulfer, the executive director of the Goodman Theater in Chicago, which originated the current New York production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten" and helped move it to Broadway, said he bristled when Broadway producers like Mr. Landesman accused nonprofits of selling out.
"Yes, we did 'A Moon for the Misbegotten,' " Mr. Schulfer said, speaking of the revered O'Neill play that has become one of the season's hits. "But there are 10 other things we did this year. I don't know how familiar he is with any of them."
"We work together with commercial producers when something is in line with our artistic priorities," he added. "We do business when our goals intersect."
Still, Mr. Schoenfeld of the Shubert Organization said the lines between the two camps had been blurred, often beyond recognition. "The larger nonprofit institutions are really replications of Broadway," he said. "Some are just booking houses for Broadway shows."
Aside from debating the role of the nonprofits, theater professionals say they hope the conference will address several other issues. With commercial producing now so costly, for example -- Broadway plays can run $1 million to $2 million, musicals as much as $12 million -- the traditional out-of-town tryout has become too expensive in most cases. Workshops, on the other hand -- rough versions of shows performed before invited guests -- are not considered a realistic gauge of a show's prospects because they lack critics and a paying audience.
As a result producers have started to use regional theaters as places to mount what are essentially workshop versions of their productions. These days "almost no commercial plays start on Broadway or even off Broadway," said Thomas Viertel, a Broadway producer. "They were developed someplace else. Economically it's safer to do it that way. Till you get something up in front of an audience, there's no way to know what works and what doesn't."
Too much of this, some warn, is not a good thing. "You don't want to be perceived as a laboratory for every commercial producer that comes along," said John Breglio, an entertainment lawyer and president of the Theater Development Fund, which runs the TKTS discount-ticket booths and several theater support programs.
Increasingly nonprofits do not want simply to hand over their productions to commercial producers. As their shows move to the commercial realm, some nonprofits will settle for a financial percentage; others want to move with the show as co-producers. The role of the nonprofit was dramatically redefined by Joseph Papp, who moved the Public Theater's "Chorus Line" to Broadway on his own in 1975, holding onto 100 percent of the production.
Now the relationships between commercial and nonprofit producers take many different forms. This season Claudia Shear's "Dirty Blonde" started at the nonprofit Vineyard Theater on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts in a production financed by the Shuberts. Then it was produced at the nonprofit New York Theater Workshop with backing from the Shuberts, who finally moved it to Broadway with several other commercial producers, all of whom shared the cost equally.
The nonprofit Manhattan Theater Club plans to move "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," which received strong notices earlier this season, to Broadway in the fall with commercial producing partners.
In the case of the Joseph Papp Public Theater's version of "The Wild Party," commercial producers shared the cost of producing that new musical, although the Public retained creative control. This became a source of tension when the commercial producers wanted to close the struggling show, but the Public decided to keep it open until the Tony Awards. It was shut out of the awards and closed on Sunday at a loss of $5.5 million.
Mr. Breglio, the lawyer, said it was important for commercial producers who back a nonprofit's production to respect the originating theater's decision-making. "If a nonprofit is going to put its resources at risk, it has to maintain control," he said. "It's, financially speaking, too dangerous to permit outside commercial forces to dictate how the money is to be spent."
Theater professionals say they hope the conference also deals with the question of how to develop talent and commission new work to maintain the flow of productions. With theater so economically forbidding, that challenge has become particularly daunting.
"The question of how we nurture the talent that we ultimately all depend on is an area none of us is paying much systemic attention to," Mr. Viertel said.

HEADLINE: The Road to Reviving a Reputation;
Cendant Chief Tries to Recover From a Deal Gone Very Bad

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Ever since the Cendant Corporation announced in April 1998 the "accounting irregularities" that would decimate its stock, Henry R. Silverman has been on a crusade to restore his reputation.
As the deal maker who built HFS Inc., a huge franchiser of brands like Century 21, Ramada, Days Inns and Avis, Mr. Silverman was responsible for the merger with CUC International that created Cendant. So with the announcement, just months after he became chief executive of the combined company, it was not only a tremendous blow to Cendant's stock that suffered a tremendous blow. So did Mr. Silverman's standing as a pillar of the business world. 
 Over the last two years, Mr. Silverman has taken a personal, as well as professional, interest in clearing his name. After embarking on a strenuous internal investigation, Mr. Silverman has cooperated extensively with regulators and been pointed in his contention that blame for this fraud lies elsewhere.
"His reputation is very precious to him, and he wanted to clean it," said Frederick Kobrick, a Boston money manager who has invested in Cendant.
This effort has pitted Mr. Silverman's credibility against that of Walter A. Forbes, the man who once headed CUC International. Mr. Forbes, who was originally positioned to run the combined company with Mr. Silverman but who resigned from Cendant in July 1998, has previously denied any knowledge of the accounting irregularities. Yesterday, his lawyer would not comment.
Yesterday's events, in which three former senior managers pleaded guilty to criminal charges of fraud and the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against seven former managers, goes a long way in providing a measure of vindication for Mr. Silverman. The regulators contended that senior managers at CUC were responsible for falsifying earnings over more than a decade in a fraud that artificially lifted earnings by more than $500 million in its last three years.
The announcement "does definitely restore a large degree of Henry's excellent reputation as a builder of companies and shareholder value," said James Citrin,, an executive recruiter with SpencerStuart. "It also justifies the aggressive stance that he took in dealing with it."
But analysts agree that Mr. Silverman's quest to restore his credibility and rebuild Cendant is not over. The accounting fraud that resulted from the merger with CUC "will be the epitaph to Silverman's career," said Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs for Institutional Shareholder Services, a company based in Rockville, Md., that advises large investors on proxy issues.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Silverman was quick to dismiss any suggestion that he might have -- or should have -- known about the fraud when the 1997 merger took place. "I'm down $800 million," he said. "I don't think the height of personal financial masochism could reach that level."
"This is very painful," he added, "personally, professionally and financially."
The outline presented by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the fraud seems to dispel any notion that Mr. Silverman or other HFS managers were involved. "It enhances credibility," said Michael Millman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "It makes him a more sympathetic actor in this sordid play."
Investors may be more likely to buy shares in the company now that the taint from the current management team has been removed, he said.
Some Cendant investors may benefit from the company's pending $2.85 billion settlement of a shareholder class-action suit. Last December, Cendant also received a vote of confidence from John C. Malone and Liberty Media, which invested $400 million.
The S.E.C. painted a dark portrait of a concerted effort by CUC senior managers -- including the former chief financial officer, who said he was acting at the direction of his superiors -- to falsify earnings.
"For more than 12 years, until its exposure in 1998, certain members of CUC's senior and middle management devised and operated a systemic, systematic scheme to inflate operating income at CUC. The scheme was driven by senior management's determination that CUC would always meet earnings expectations of Wall Street analysts and fueled by a disregard for any obligation that the earnings reported needed to be 'real,' " the regulators said.
By contrast, the regulators praised Cendant's management for its response to the discovery of accounting problems at CUC: "Cendant management promptly reported the discovery of the fraud and its attendant accounting irregularities to the commission staff; conducted a thorough internal investigation and compiled an extensive report," the regulators said, adding that they also "cooperated with staff in its investigation of this matter."
What is still subject to debate is whether Mr. Silverman should have known that CUC, the subject of lengthy accounting travails, might be a problematic purchase. "For an executive who has built fame and fortune as a savvy deal maker," Mr. McGurn, the proxy adviser, said, "to be snookered by fraudsters does beg the question of how good the due diligence was."
Still, argued Mr. Kobrick, the money manager, any such deliberate fraud would be practically impossible to detect. Regulators also acknowledged that if one co-conspirator had not come forward the extent of the fraud might not have been discovered for a long time.
But Mr. Silverman's efforts to vindicate himself are clearly not over. Cendant is trying to force Mr. Forbes to return his $47 million severance package, the subject of legal proceedings. Earlier this month, Mr. Forbes paid back $2.3 million in travel and entertainment expenses, which Cendant had disputed. "We intend to pursue that to a conclusion," a Cendant spokesman said.
Mr. Silverman would not address the issue of whether he feels personally betrayed by Mr. Forbes. "I think the court will be the instrument of retribution," he said.
The company has also brought suit against Ernst & Young, which Mr. Silverman has publicly argued neglected its responsibilities to uncover the fraud in its long history of auditing CUC. Ernst & Young is also suing Cendant, arguing that its management misled them.
All of this leaves Mr. Silverman with the continued task of rebuilding Cendant. The stock, which has been hurt in recent months by concerns about the economy and a slowing housing market, closed yesterday at $12.4375, still a far cry from its high of $41.69 just before the disclosure.
Mr. Silverman has put Cendant through a wringer, shedding $4.5 billion of businesses not related to its central operations. "It's clearly been a distraction for him and the company," said Greg Zappin, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. "It's caused them to radically change the business plans. The company's been in a holding pattern ever since."
Mr. Kobrick, for one, said he thought yesterday's events provided a kind of coda to the story of the last two years. "He's going to be the most focused guy in the world," he said.
As for his own view, Mr. Silverman acknowledged the need to move on. "We need closure," he said. "This is the beginning of the end of closure."

HEADLINE: No Fluff, No Gimmickry In These Searing Stories

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In discussions of popular culture nowadays, few words are more crassly degraded than reality, as in the ''reality programming'' that is a hot new television trend. The misapplication of the word to categorize gimmicky televised pseudo-events is all the more distressing when such sensationalist fluff is compared with the best documentary and fiction films to be seen each year at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. This reality is the genuine article.
 The vital annual series, which opened on Wednesday at the Walter Reade Theater with Randa Chahal Sabbag's documentary about Lebanon, ''A Civilized People,'' is probably the best New York showcase for films exploring political, social and economic issues that cannot be neatly summarized in 15-minute segments. And in a gossip- and celebrity-saturated media climate that increasingly ignores the world beyond our borders, the festival offers intimate, often painful glimpses into other cultures that no other information source could provide. 
 Human rights issues, of course, concern the United States as well as the rest of the world. One of the most powerful films to be shown in the festival, Laurie Collyer's documentary ''Nuyorican Dream'' (next Friday at 6:15 p.m. and June 26 at 8:30 p.m.), is set mostly within the city limits of New York. Seven years in the making, this astoundingly intimate film is a close-up, at-home portrait of a troubled Puerto Rican family in the Bronx. Their troubles are viewed through the compassionate and loving eyes of Robert Torres, the only family member to have graduated from college.
 Mr. Torres, a 30-year-old New York City schoolteacher, is the eldest son of Marta Gutierrez, a courageous mother to whom falls the almost impossible task of holding together three generations of her family with few resources. Throughout the movie, Mr. Torres offers pointed observations about how a legacy of colonialism, an inadequate inner-city educational system and ingrained prejudice that keeps Puerto Ricans out of fast-track classes and diminishes their already low self-esteem combine to perpetuate a cycle of poverty, drugs and hopelessness.
 In addition to the mother and son, we meet two of Mr. Torres's sisters, who are battling drug addiction, and a younger brother who is in prison. What gives the film an extra edge is that Mr. Torres, who is gay, is clearly alienated from his loved ones by his middle-class status. The dual perspective he offers, of someone who belongs to the family yet sees beyond its insular world, lends the film a wrenching authenticity. As much knowledge and wisdom as Mr. Torres has gained, he is essentially powerless against the social forces that have oppressed his family and thousands like them. ''Nuyorican Dream'' strikes an even deeper emotional chord than ''An American Love Story,'' the much-publicized multipart documentary about an interracial marriage that was shown last year on PBS.
 A perfect example of an international story that could be done justice only by a documentary film is Kevin McKiernan's video movie ''Good Kurds, Bad Kurds: No Friends but the Mountains'' (June 24 at 1 p.m., June 28 at 6 p.m. and June 29 at 1 p.m.). The film is, among many other things, a concise history of a people Mr. McKiernan calls ''the Native Americans of Asia Minor.''
 The ''good Kurds'' in the eyes of the United States are those who live in Iraq and are persecuted by Saddam Hussein. The ''bad'' are those fighting a guerrilla war against the government in Turkey (an American ally), where they make up 20 percent of the population. The movie delves deep into the history and politics of Kurdistan region while analyzing the seemingly contradictory policy of the United States and criticizing Turkey for human rights violations.
 Also notable on the international front are Marco Bechlis's ''Garage Olimpo'' (next Friday at 9:15 p.m., June 25 at 8:45 p.m. and June 26 at 3:15 p.m.) a not-for-the-squeamish film from Argentina about an opponent of the military dictatorship who is tortured in a garage in the heart of Buenos Aires, and ''Pathos'' (tomorrow at 6:30 p.m., Sunday at 8:15 p.m. and Monday at 3:45 p.m.), a drama by the Indian director Jayaraaj about aging parents whose grown children sell the family plantation out from under them and blithely ship them off to an old-age home. The touching Lebanese video documentary ''Children of Shatila,'' directed by Mai Masri, looks at the impoverished lives of two Palestinian children, 11 and 13, growing up in a refugee camp in Lebanon (June 26 at 6 p.m., June 28 at 8:45 p.m. and June 29 at 3:30 p.m.).
 A high point of the festival is a rare showing (tonight at 9:15 and tomorrow night at 9) of Martin Ritt's black-and-white drama ''Edge of the City,'' a movie so atmospherically gritty it has dirt under its fingernails. Released in 1957, three years after ''On the Waterfront'' (an obvious prototype), ''Edge of the City'' is a portrait of an interracial friendship and social prejudice on the job. John Cassavetes plays Axel, a drifter with a guilty secret, and Sidney Poitier is his best friend, Tommy, a cocky, free-spirited fellow porter at the West Side Terminal. Jack Warden is their corrupt, bullying boss. As Tommy, Mr. Poitier is nothing less than incandescent, effusing a volatile mixture of devil-may-care humor and infectious joie de vivre.
 The Human Rights Watch Film Festival continues through June 29 at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; members, $5; senior citizens, $4.50 at weekday matinees. Information and screening times: (212) 875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com.

A Hybrid With Brains and Brawn

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HYBRID-POWER vehicles, the engineers point out, can come in all shapes and sizes. The first two on the market are the two-passenger Honda Insight and the five-passenger Toyota Prius.
They are notable for using electric motors to achieve remarkable gasoline fuel economy. And they look like hybrids: eggy, sleek and futuristic. 
 But DaimlerChrysler is demonstrating another tack entirely.
Call it the red-meat hybrid, an S.U.V. as brawny as a pure gasoline version, in exactly the same body, with the same tough-looking wheels and grille, and four-wheel drive. But this Dodge Durango is modified to get 30 percent of its horsepower through an electric motor instead of from the gasoline engine. As with the Japanese entries, the result is better fuel economy. The improvement is just three miles per gallon, but on a big sport utility like the Durango, that is a full 20 percent.
DaimlerChrysler showed the truck here recently at the conclusion of the American Tour de Sol, an annual electric-car race.
An early fan was Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Energy Committee. "Feels like a normal car," he said.
In contrast to the Insight, a two-seater that gets about 70 miles per gallon but owes part of that to its sleek form and aluminum frame, or the Prius, which has a slightly boxy appearance, the hybrid Durango prototype is indistinguishable from the gasoline version -- unless you spot the "state of charge" meter on the dashboard, or crawl under the front to see the 70-horsepower electric motor, mounted sideways, that drives the front wheels.
"This is the soccer mom car," Senator Murkowski said.
It is also, by far, the simplest of the three. The Insight has an electric motor sandwiched into the drivetrain between the gasoline engine and the manual transmission. The Prius has a planetary gear, a specially developed device that means that at any given moment, the electric motor can be working alone, or assisting the gasoline engine, or draining energy from the gasoline engine to recharge the battery.
The Durango is far simpler; an ordinary V-6 gasoline engine in the front drives ordinary wheels in the back, and the electric motor under the front of the car turns the front wheels; the only connection between the two drivetrains is the pavement. When the driver pushes the brake pedal, the electric motor switches into a generator, robbing the car of momentum and converting that into current to recharge the batteries.
If the batteries are depleted as the car cruises, the motor in front will start letting the wheels drag a little and recharge the batteries, using the pavement to transfer energy from the gasoline system to the electric one.
"This is a leap in technology that can get you an instant improvement," said William Craven, a project-management specialist who works on the Durango and the Epic, the company's all-electric minivan.

 His competitor, David W. Hermance, an executive engineer at Toyota, whose car and its unusual gearing system is perhaps more of a leap, put it differently.
In a telephone interview, he said: "There are three attributes you're trading off -- emissions, fuel economy and acceleration, or performance. You decide what it is you want your vehicle to do in those three attributes, and then you size your internal-combustion engine and your motor so as to get the combination you're interested in."
To get acceleration, Mr. Hermance said, use a larger gasoline engine; to get better fuel economy and pollution control, favor the electric side.
The Toyota relies on the electric motor alone when it is moving slowly, and the Honda makes heavy use of the electric motor every time the driver shifts to a higher gear; both shut off the gasoline engine entirely when the car is waiting at a stop sign or red light.
Both of them were designed as hybrids, from the ground up. And both, but especially the Honda, gain performance by shedding weight. Their performance is good but nothing special.
In contrast, the Durango weighs the same in the hybrid version, and performs about the same -- that is to say, like a hard-charging bull. It has a slightly lower towing rating than the all-gasoline version of the Durango. The Prius and Insight, on the other hand, are unlikely candidates to tow anything.
Chrysler said that teaming the 3.9 liter V-6 with a Siemens 3-phase AC induction motor gave "V-8 performance with better than V-6 fuel economy."
 In the parlance of this emerging technology, the Durango is a "mild hybrid," and the Insight and Prius are "heavy hybrids."
There are other differences. The Prius and Insight have no direct cost comparisons, since they are not new versions of an all-gasoline car, but both appear to sell at a modest premium above what a conventional gasoline car that size would cost.
American manufacturers suggest that Toyota and Honda are actually taking considerable losses on each of the cars sold, something that DaimlerChrysler does not seem willing to do.
DaimlerChrysler says each hybrid Durango would cost $3,000 extra to make; it is lobbying for special tax credits.
The Japanese entries are on the road now. The population of hybrid Durangos is one lonely preproduction prototype. If the Chrysler division decided now to produce it, the hybrid would go on sale in about three years.

Finding Endless Conflict Hidden in a Peaceable Kingdom

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER 

DATELINE: COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., June 12

 BODY:
Some artists zero in on a single image and can't or won't let go. It's as if everything they really need to say is sayable there. The American painter Edward Hicks (1780-1849) was one. The Peaceable Kingdom was his theme.
All 62 surviving versions of his subject share a basic image: a kind of petting-zoo cluster of animals around a child in a parklike woodland. The tableau, often taken for an uncomplicated emblem of the Eden that America once was, has made Hicks a folk classic and also an artist that one can overlook. We know what he's about. 
 But are Hicks's kingdom paintings really identical? And are they unruffled idylls of innocence and peace? An exhibition titled "The Kingdoms of Edward Hicks" at the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown, N.Y., which includes 20 such paintings, says no to both questions and reclaims his icon work for the difficult, prickly thing it is.
Organized by Carolyn J. Weekley for the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center of Colonial Williamsburg and slightly edited here (a painting referred to in a wall text isn't on view), the show is built around the quietly intense drama of Hicks's life.
He was born in rural eastern Pennsylvania. His grandfather, a wealthy Tory, had been stripped of his property in the Revolution. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father, unable to support the children, boarded them out. From the age of 3, Hicks lived with a Quaker family named Twining. He loved them and idolized one Twining daughter, Mary, calling her his closest friend. This time was as near to a state of earthly grace as he ever got.
At 13, he was apprenticed to a local coach-making firm and showed a flair for ornamental painting: heraldic devices, fancy lettering and so on. He also fell into a pattern of drinking and carousing that spun out of control by his own account. Then he found or rediscovered religion. Around 1800 he began to attend meetings of the Religious Society of Friends and never stopped.
Hicks was as impractical as he was devout. In 1811 he both became an unsalaried Quaker minister and opened a carriage-and-sign painting shop. Because the ministry required frequent travel from home (he was married with children by this time), the business had to fend for itself.
There were other conflicts. The painting Hicks specialized in was censured by Quakers. His expertly decorated signs and objects, of which there are examples in the show, were viewed as vain, luxurious, un-Friendly things. He tried to restrict himself to a no-frills style, then sold the business to become a farmer, with calamitous economic results.
His problems were compounded by his high-strung, fractious personality. He was given to bursts of fury and fits of sobbing, and he was damagingly candid in his opinions, particularly on matters related to the religious community.
And finally, he lived at a turbulent time, when the Society of Friends had a devastating internal rift. On one side was the orthodox faction, largely urban and prosperous and promoting a rational religious hierarchy and reformist causes like abolition.
On the other side was a conservative, primarily rural faction, with which Hicks was fiercely aligned. It advocated an older version of the religion based on individual revelation. This group, called Hicksite, gathered around the charismatic minister Elias Hicks, the artist's older cousin.
What followed was a bitter doctrinal and psychic war that radically shaped Hicks's art. After his farming misadventure, he resumed his career as an artisan but also began to do easel paintings on the Peaceable Kingdom theme, at first perhaps as a way to give what he self-rebukingly called his "excessive fondness for painting" an acceptable moral dimension.
His earliest known version of the subject, crudely executed, was adapted from a Bible print illustrating a passage from Isaiah about a millennial vision in which natural enemies are reconciled: "The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them."
Hicks continued doing other work -- shop signs, landscapes, historical scenes -- on commission. But the kingdoms were special. He painted them repeatedly and obsessively, for himself, or as gifts. They become more complex in style, combining the vivacity of popular art with surprising academic finesse, and they grew more pointed in content.
The first series, starting in the early 1820's, incorporated a secondary background vignette of the 17th-century Quaker William Penn arranging a treaty of peace with American Indians. These paintings, fitted with hand-lettered frames carrying the Isaiah quotation, already addressed growing dissension within the membership.
After the great schism of 1827, the images become more volatile. In an overtly propagandistic group, Penn's treaty is replaced by a ghostly troop of historic Quaker elders, Penn among them, greeting Elias Hicks. And in the next decade, when the paintings become both deeply expressive and wildly uneven in quality, the foreground changes.
Additional children and animals crowd in. The carnivorous beasts -- lions, leopards, wolves -- grow in size. Where once they had cast their eyes docilely to the ground, they now stare out, alert, aggressive, challenging, even rabidly agitated.
Hicks meant the beasts to typify human traits in line with his view of contemporary Quaker politics: the lion symbolized power gained through wealth, the leopard a suave, threatening worldliness. Occasionally animals are in conflict. But even when they aren't, the assemblies have a jumbled, restive feeling. The ground beneath them is eroding; a fissure in the earth separates them from Penn's treaty behind.
Then, around 1840, the mood shifts again. The artist was in his 60's. He saw that the ideological battle he had anguished over would remain unresolved. The exhibition catalog points out that the animals start to look aged and weary, and it's true. In one painting, the lion's face bears a startling resemblance to that of Hicks in a portrait by his nephew, Thomas, where he poses with an unfinished kingdom on his easel.
He produced these images to the end of his life; he was preparing one for his daughter when he died. But he also turned to other subjects. From 1846 comes "James Cornell's Prize Bull." A modest-size commissioned portrait of a heroic farm animal, it clearly demonstrates Hicks's highly developed naturalistic style.
That he seldom chose to use it may be significant. His plainer, colloquial approach was closer to a Quaker aesthetic. And maybe he thought it was more appropriate for depicting what he felt most in sympathy with, a world that wasn't quite this world and that operated by its own pictorial laws.
He combined both modes in late landscapes that departed from the allegorical kingdom image while sustaining its programmatic ideal. Two examples in the show are nostalgic memory paintings of the Twining farm of his childhood, in which Hicks includes himself as an apple-cheeked toddler. Another is a commissioned picture of a farm owned by the son of Mary Twining, his childhood friend.
Titled "A May Morning View of the Farm and Stock of David Leedom" (1849), the scene falls into two horizontal bands. The bottom one is the farm. Its animals, masterfully rendered, stand in an enclosed yard. Piero della Francesca would have approved of the pristine geometry of the buildings.
At the paddock fence stand small figures who gesture conversationally among themselves. An inscription at the lower edge of the painting, scratched into the painted grass, identifies them as David Leedom, his wife and family, and Mary Twining and her husband, who were dead by that time.
A blossoming apple orchard stretches behind the farm. And behind that hills fade into mist: they seem to have been done with a dabbed sponge, a technique familiar from pottery decoration. Above everything, and taking up half the painting, is one of the prettiest skies in American art: soft pink, unostentatious gold, summery blue. It's the perfect cap to one man's peaceable kingdom come at last, part heaven, part earth, where plain beauty reigns, and reason and revelation meet.
 
"The Kingdoms of Edward Hicks" is at the New York State Historical Association/Fenimore Art Museum, Lake Road, Route 80, Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-1400, through Sept. 4. It travels to the M. H. de Young Museum in San Francisco from Sept. 24-Jan. 7.
