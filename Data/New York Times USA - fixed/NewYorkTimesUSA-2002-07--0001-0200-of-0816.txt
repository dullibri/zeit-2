HEADLINE: High Prices In London For Picasso And Monet 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL

DATELINE: LONDON, June 30 

 BODY:
The world was a rosier place this time last year, when no one could have ever imagined the events of Sept. 11 or the scandals at WorldCom, ImClone Systems, Tyco International and Xerox. Yet despite last week's stock market jitters and a general nervousness about the economy, the important annual auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art here proved that the rich feel more confident putting their money in Picassos, Monets or Legers than they do in financial markets. 
 "There are a lot of people who have made money and simply want to enjoy themselves," said Melanie Clore, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Europe and co-chairwoman of its Impressionist and modern art department. "Everyone these days wants an escape." 
 That is not to say that bidding was fast and furious all week. Collectors showed restraint, knowing exactly what they wanted and what they were prepared to pay. The big spenders, however, were mostly Europeans, something that has been true now for the last year. 
"The economic perspective from Europe is more confident than that of the United States," said Robin Woodhead, Sotheby's chief executive for Europe and Asia. That, coupled with a reluctance to fly since Sept. 11, may have accounted for the noticeable absence of American collectors in the salesrooms.
But who actually bought the top two paintings of the week -- a 1932 Picasso portrait that sold for $23.9 million and the dreamy Monet "Waterlilies" that went for $20.1 million -- is part of the mystery that is the allure of auctions. While the person raising the paddle may be a well-known dealer, art adviser or auction house expert taking a telephone bid on behalf of a client, the font of gossip and speculation as to who writes the checks and whose living room the works will magically appear in is as addictive as collecting itself. Even the auction houses do not always know who the real buyers are. But when they do, their lips are sealed. 
Still, patterns emerge each season. "It's a masterpiece market at the moment," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. Paintings that scream the signature of a big-name artist are more in demand now than the more intellectual works, which often remained unsold or went for bargain prices. And just as they had at the May auctions in New York, top examples by personalities like Gerhard Richter and Giacometti, whose recent retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art in New York got rave reviews, were hotly sought after. 
Sotheby's and Christie's each had a star work in Impressionist and modern art. At Christie's it was Picasso's "Nude With Necklace," a 1932 portrait of the artist's mistress Marie-Therese Walter. Four bidders were willing to spend more than $10 million on the painting, which ended up selling to Libby Howie, a London art dealer, for $23.9 million, way above its $13.4 million high estimate. It became the highest priced work of the week. Ms. Howie is said to buy art for an Arab collector. At Christie's in New York in 1997 she bought one of Picasso's series "Women of Algiers" from the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz for $31.9 million. 
Sotheby's most important work of the week -- Monet's 1906 "Waterlilies," which brought $20.1 million, just under its $22.5 million high estimate -- was bought through David Norman, Sotheby's director of Impressionist and modern art in New York. Experts trying to predict the buyer think it may have been one of two Americans, Stephen Cohen, a Manhattan hedge fund manager, or Henry Kravis, the financier. 
The painting had been hidden away in an unidentified private collection in France for more than 60 years and was considered by art historians to be one of the best of the Monet series. Some experts thought the painting could well have fetched an even higher price and were surprised when the Picasso surpassed it by $3.8 million. The reason, experts rationalized, was that three such "Waterlilies" were up at auction recently, and one is back on the market in New York. But Jussi Pylkkanen, head of Christie's department of Impressionist and modern art in London, said he believed that "collectors are moving their tastes forward." "As Impressionist paintings are becoming rarer, tastes are becoming more avant-garde," he added. 
Some experts noted that the price for the Picasso had more to do with supply and demand. Bidders applying the acumen of a Wall Street analyst who perceives that a 1932 Picasso is rarer than a Monet "Waterlilies" because fewer have been up for sale recently made the price rise to nearly twice its high estimate. It also seemed cheap compared to other Marie-Therese portraits that Picasso painted the same year; they have brought more than $40 million at auction. 
When a top Impressionist work was up for grabs, however, bidding was competitive. At Christie's, "Vetheuil," a sun-dappled Monet landscape of the town 40 miles from Paris where the artist lived for three years from 1878, brought $7.5 million, well above its $5.2 million estimate. The buyer was Gilly Kinloch, a British art adviser. Ms. Kinloch made another big purchase last week, too, a Degas pastel "Dancers" (1880-85), which was on the cover of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern catalog. She paid $3.3 million, just shy of its $3.5 million high estimate. While nobody knew or would say who she was bidding for, Ms. Kinloch is known to be the art adviser for Lord Harris, a carpet manufacturer from London. 
Continuing a trend that has been evident for the last few years, top German Expressionist paintings were hotly pursued. At Sotheby's, "Nudes in the Sun, Moritzburg," a 1910 landscape by Kirchner, incited a bidding war among three determined parties. The painting, which depicts six bathers in a lush green landscape, sold for $5.2 million, a record price for the artist and above its $4.5 million high estimate. The buyer was an unidentified telephone bidder.
(Final prices include the auction house commission. At Sotheby's and Christie's it is 19.5 percent of the first $100,000 and 10 percent of the rest. At de Pury & Luxembourg it is 15 percent for the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
Determined to be a player that rivals Sotheby's and Christie's, Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg (for legal reasons, however, the Phillips name cannot be used in Britain for several years) held its first sale in London. It took place last Monday afternoon in the ballroom of Claridge's, where Champagne was freely flowing for the collectors and dealers as they entered the makeshift salesroom. The auction had less fizz than estimated, with most works selling at or below their estimates. 
About one-third of the sale was bought by the Nahmad family, Lebanese dealers with galleries in New York and London, who have been among the biggest buyers at auction for years now. The Nahmads were big buyers at Christie's, too, fueling speculation that both auction houses may have given them special terms of payment. But no one was willing to comment, least of all the Nahmads. 
"These were our style of paintings," said David Nahmad, one of the principals who is based in New York, after he had bought millions of dollars worth of Picassos, Vlamincks, Matisses and Pissarros. "We sustained the art market through the 1960's, 70's and 80's. I used to buy a lot more." 
During the contemporary art auctions the majority of buyers were collectors, not dealers, and they bought selectively. While mediocre Warhols and lesser examples of the so-called Young British Artists failed to sell, both Sotheby's and Christie's managed to get some high prices for a few works. 
At Christie's five bidders tried to bring home a 1962 untitled Basquiat that sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.1 million, above its $1.8 million high estimate. Later that evening 19 telephone bidders went for "Composition," a 1951 abstract drip painting by Jean-Paul Riopelle. 
"It's considered his best work," said Brett Gorvy, who is co-head of Christie's contemporary and postwar art department in New York, when the painting brought $965,683, more than four times its high, $225,000 estimate. The total for its sale was $13.3 million, just above its low $12.9 million low estimate. 
Sotheby's sale of contemporary art was far stronger, bringing in $21.5 million, topping its $19.6 million high estimate, making it the highest total for a London contemporary art auction in 12 years. It's success was due in part to the high prices paid for artists like Mr. Richter, Francis Bacon and Lucio Fontana.
"There was fearless buying for great quality," said Mr. Meyer, the evening's auctioneer. "The desire to buy was so strong I could literally feel the energy of the bidders."

HEADLINE: DoubleClick Sells Its Media Sales Businessto L90 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
DoubleClick, the Internet advertising company, has sold its North American media sales business to L90, a former competitor in that business, for $9.4 million in cash and stock and possibly another $6 million if performance thresholds are met, the companies said on Sunday. In addition, L90 will change its name to MaxWorldwide when the deal closes, which the companies expect to happen early this month.
 The deal solidifies an emerging strategy for both DoubleClick and L90, analysts said, in that it moves DoubleClick further away from advertising sales and allows it to concentrate on its advertising technology and data analysis tools. L90, meanwhile, has been focusing more on ad sales, and less on advertising technology. 
 L90 had for years operated in a manner similar to DoubleClick, in that it sold online ad-delivery and tracking technology to advertisers, while also selling advertising inventory on behalf of a network of hundreds of Internet publishers. Last year, L90 sold its ad-delivery and tracking technology, adMonitor, to DoubleClick.
Including the 850 sites that DoubleClick used to sell online ads on behalf of -- among others Edgar Online and Dilbert.com -- L90 now represents a network of more than 1,000 sites, the company said.
Analysts said the move was good for both companies. "The network ad model has not been terribly profitable for anyone, much less someone with DoubleClick's scale," said Rudy Grahn, an analyst with the online consulting company Jupiter Research. "And since this is such a bad ad market, and DoubleClick is focusing on profitability, it's right for them to jettison this business."
For L90, Mr. Grahn said, this deal represented a chance "to buy in at a much better price than they would have been able to pay once the market rebounds."
L90 will have a new stock symbol, MAXW, and is moving its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York. It said in a news release that with DoubleClick's North America sites now included in its network, its advertisers can reach about the same number of Internet surfers as they would on AOL, MSN and Yahoo.
But Jim Nail, advertising analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, said that it would be a mistake for advertisers to consider L90 the peer of the big portals. "What advertisers want is to reach a particular kind of target audience," he said. "In an ad network with several hundred sites, even if you group them into auto, or women's sites, the range of content means there's no consistent audience."
On AOL, by contrast, the content breakdown is meant to draw certain types of consumers, like car buyers, for instance, who better suit advertisers' needs, Mr. Nail said. Still, L90 "can probably make a nice little business" from selling ads on its network after the DoubleClick deal.

PERSON: Clifford Possum 

HEADLINE: Clifford Possum, a Painter Of Aboriginal Masterworks 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, June 29 

 BODY:
Clifford Possum, who painted some of the masterpieces of Australian aboriginal art, died on June 21 in Alice Springs in the Australian desert, an ancient landscape he depicted in the mythical terms central to his heritage. He was about 70, art historians said.
 In accordance with tribal tradition, details of his death, the long illness that preceded it and his exact age were not disclosed by his family. 
 Mr. Possum, known among the Ammatyerre people as Kumuntjayi Tjapaltjarri, was the first Australian aboriginal artist to gain international recognition. He cleared the paths to artistic and economic success that many indigenous painters have followed since the 1970's by invoking sources and spiritual beliefs thought to be many thousands of years old.
Since 1974 Mr. Possum's paintings, mixing symbolism and abstraction, have been shown in solo and group exhibitions and sold to major galleries and collections in Australia, the United States, Europe and Asia.
His work had its first public exhibition in the United States in 1980, in Los Angeles. His first major New York exhibition was in a group show at the Asia Society in 1988.
In the United States his work is in the collections of the Kelton Foundation in Santa Monica, Calif., the Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami and the Pacific Asia Museum in Los Angeles.
On June 24 five of his works were sold in Melbourne at Sotheby's Australia for more than $20,000 each; one, "Love-Sun Dreaming," was bought for $60,000.
The record auction price for a Possum painting is $68,000, paid by an Australian public gallery last year for one of his earliest works, a 1972 landscape. At the time he painted it, some of his depictions of what is known as the Dreaming, a legendary time akin to creation or Genesis in other cultures, were selling for less than $50.
Mr. Possum, who adopted that name for nontribal use after a stay in the 1940's at a Christian mission where he was nursed for malnutrition, began painting after 15 years of work on a cattle ranch. 
At Papunya, a remote government settlement for the desert people, a teacher, Geoffrey Bordon, encouraged aborigines to counter feelings of alienation by recording traditional images and themes in modern media, like acrylic paint on hardboard and later on canvas. This was the cradle of the Desert Painters movement in aboriginal art. 
Dr. Vivien Johnson, a historian of indigenous art at Macquarie University in Sydney, wrote that Mr. Possum quickly showed himself to be "an accomplished and inventive artist, an exponent of striking multilayered visual effects, meticulously rendered."
Tim Klingender, director of the indigenous art department of Sotheby's Australia, said that many collectors and galleries rated Mr. Possum "high in the pantheon of aboriginal painters" for his "innovative visual language and complex narratives of myths."
In June the Australian government awarded Mr. Possum the Order of Australia medal for his service to the art movement and to the indigenous people.
Critics and collectors rate his numerous works since the 1980's below his achievements in the 1970's, and his scarcer earlier canvases draw higher prices.
Mr. Klingender estimated that several such works in private American collections would bring about $500,000 each if sold at auction now.
Mr. Possum's survivors include two daughters, Gabriella and Michelle; a son, Lionel; and 11 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Democracy in Africa 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Africa's New Realism," by Thabo Mbeki (Op-Ed, June 24): 
 Many African leaders have high hopes for the New Partnership for Africa's Development, an African-conceived program through which African countries demonstrate a commitment to advancing democracy, human rights and the rule of law in exchange for additional resources from the industrialized world. 
As Mr. Mbeki says, an "independent mechanism for peer review" is central to the partnership. 
 But the response to the Zimbabwean crisis is undermining the program. Zimbabwe is on the precipice of a devastating famine of Robert Mugabe's making, the latest of the illegitimately re-elected president's ploys to maintain power. African leaders, with a few exceptions, have been silent. Until they show a commitment to the program's goals, Zimbabweans and other Africans will pay the price.

HEADLINE: Irking Democrats Is Part of Job for a House Leader 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
Maybe all the complaints about the confrontational, partisan style of Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, come with the territory. That, at least, is what he suggests.
 "If they spend a lot of time complaining about me, maybe that means I'm doing my job," Representative Thomas said last week, between a fight with Democrats over trade and a fight with them over prescription drugs. After all, Mr. Thomas's defenders say, the chairman of Ways and Means, who has vast responsibility for tax, economic, welfare and health policy, is rarely beloved by the minority party -- or rarely even "a really nice guy," as one Republican put it. 
 Even so, the animosity between the Democrats and Mr. Thomas is striking these days -- emblematic, in its way, of a mean political season as the midterm election approaches. It was apparent this week, as Mr. Thomas, 60, a Californian in his 24th year in the House, muscled through a bill adding prescription drug benefits to the Medicare program, a bill that Democrats -- and even some Republicans, privately -- say is headed toward oblivion in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Democrats denounced Mr. Thomas's legislation as a "fraud," a "sham" and a "placebo made in the dark." It is, one said, a bill "written by the drug companies." It was pushed through the House under procedures typical of "Soviet-style democracy," another said.
Mr. Thomas says the Democrats simply cannot handle the idea that Republicans, not Democrats, are moving to deliver a sweeping new entitlement to the nation's elderly or the idea that the Democrats are no longer running the show as the majority.
"Their biggest problem," he said in an interview, "is not that the majority is fair -- and fairer than they were -- when we work our will. It is that we are the majority and they are not. And for members who were around for a long time, who came in when the Democrats were the majority, who grew up in the committee system as the majority and who expected to finish their careers as chairmen of the committees, it is a very, very frustrating time because Republicans came in and took away their birthright."
Mr. Thomas's relationships with the Democrats, notably with Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, who would be the Ways and Means chairman if the Democrats controlled the House, have been fraying for a long time. But even some Republicans complain at times about Mr. Thomas's edge. Some textile-state Republicans sharply criticized him last week, saying he had blindsided them with changes in a trade bill.
His allies acknowledge the problem. "He doesn't suffer fools well, and that's not to say anyone's a fool," said Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana. "But I know that he knows that that's a fault of his, and that for the last couple of years he's been working on it, trying to become more tolerant in more situations."
Mr. Thomas's temper was an issue when he sought the chairmanship in 2000, but his policy expertise and legislative skill clearly outweighed it. With the backing of J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, he won the post over a more senior Republican on the committee.
While acknowledging that he has shortcomings, Mr. Thomas suggests that his personality is ideally suited for the job of pushing through his party's economic agenda with one of the smallest majorities in history, a five-vote Republican edge.
"Why did Eisenhower give Patton the job of moving across Germany at lightning speed?" he says. "Because he knew Patton would do it. Sometimes hills just need to be captured."
Democrats have taken to goading Mr. Thomas. Committee hearings presided over by Mr. Thomas and Mr. Rangel can be almost painful, like dining with a couple on the brink of divorce, who know each other's vulnerabilities far too well.
Mr. Rangel began an interview about Mr. Thomas by saying, "I don't have any training in psychiatric evaluation; I'm a mere lawyer."
Mr. Rangel added, "He sets the tone, and the tone is one of exclusion -- under the excuse that that's how he feels he was treated in the minority."
Mr. Thomas said that he would like to work with Democrats but that Democratic leaders discouraged it. He said that he had reached out to Mr. Rangel but that Mr. Rangel appeared more comfortable in the role of an aggrieved outsider.
All this means that Mr. Thomas, and the other Republican leaders, often must pass major legislation with almost nothing but Republican votes. This can be very hard when the legislation is complicated, like the prescription drug bill, which some Republicans considered too big an entitlement, others too little.
Mr. Thomas, a former political science professor and state legislator, has steeped himself in health policy over the years, particularly the Medicare program. Many say that his is the most influential vision on health care in the Republican Party and that this makes him a lightning rod for liberals. They argue that his desire to see more competition and more private health plans involved in Medicare is a step toward privatizing the program.
His prescription drug bill, in fact, would deliver benefits to the elderly by giving subsidies to private health plans that offered coverage. Mr. Thomas dismisses the talk of "privatization" as a political scare tactic.
Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals and once on Mr. Thomas's staff, said of Mr. Thomas: "He's a wonk. He firmly believes in private sector and market approaches to the extent possible. And he feels very strongly about the pull of policy as well as politics."
Mr. Thomas refuses to accept the idea that the bill just passed in the House is essentially a political document with little chance of final passage. "I'm not in this for charades," he said. "I don't start things for them not to become law."
The son of a plumber, Mr. Thomas said his hobbies involve working with his hands: carpentry and rebuilding old cars. They require the same kind of puzzle-solving that draws him to legislation, he said, choking up when he talked about suddenly seeing solutions and being able to make a difference. "I'm not easy to get to know," he acknowledged.
Mr. Thomas said he loved his job. "I didn't like it for the first 16 years very much because I thought my talents were not being used," he said, speaking of his time in the minority. "Sixteen long years is the way you say it."
The Democrats would understand.

HEADLINE: California Officials Wrangle Over Plans for Great Park 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., June 28 

 BODY:
It had always seemed a given that once the residents of the vast suburban stretches of Orange County decided what the shuttered El Toro Marine Corps Air Station here should become, a decade of epic battling would end and the workaday task of drawing up plans and calling in the earthmovers would begin. 
 That decision came in March, when voters soundly rejected plans for a big new airport in favor of what has long been called the Great Park. Though there is still some legal skirmishing, the park the voters selected would fill a great part of the 4,700-acre site, a billiard-table-flat collection of deserted runways smack in the center of the county. Many here say it would become America's greatest urban park. 
 But now, as planners try to figure out how to build and pay for the park, and lawmakers wrangle over the details, it is starting to look as if the political battle was the easy part.
"I would say one book is written now in this story, but it's going to be more than one book," said Todd Spitzer, a county supervisor who fought against the airport for years. "Another book is going to be written about what happens with that 4,700 acres. We just haven't had time to focus on that part yet."
Many expected the Navy to give the land to the county at no charge, as the military has sometimes done in other base closings. But the Navy decided to sell it in pieces to the highest bidders, collaborating closely with local governments. 
The sales could net more than $1 billion and have a profound impact on Orange County, which has nearly three million people and is often described as a collection of suburbs in search of a downtown. 
Given the new economics of the site, local planners are preparing to allow developers to build on perhaps two-thirds of the old base, with projects including a university campus, an industrial park and golf courses surrounded by homes.
What will be left for the promised park? Perhaps 350 prime acres where abandoned runways now sit.
"What we all campaigned for was to have a Great Park," Mr. Spitzer said. "But it's not going to be a great big park. The economic developments are going to drive how much open space there will be. The land use will be driven by the economics."
Larry Agran, mayor of the City of Irvine, which is next to El Toro and is expected to annex the land, said, "Well, it's a development plan with the idea of a Great Park." 
There is another complication. Residents of the poorer, more densely populated northern half of the county are demanding that some of the revenues generated by private development be used to build smaller parks in their area. 
"I think if it's done right the entire county would benefit and tourism would benefit," said John Palacio, president of the school board in Santa Ana, an overwhelmingly Latino working-class city just to the north. "Some of that money must be used to build parks in our area, too." 
Cynthia P. Coad, another county supervisor, has threatened to stop Irvine's annexation of the base and construction of the park unless the planners promise that $800,000 a year will be dedicated to creating parks in the north. "I'm not interested in megaparks," Ms. Coad said. "I want neighborhood parks in the heavily built up areas of the north county." 
Irvine's city manager, Allison Hart, has been working closely with the Navy to draw up a sales plan that will include a master plan for how the properties can be developed once they are sold to private companies. 
Irvine's plan looks far different from what residents voted on in March, when 3 percent of the base site would have been turned over to private developers, leaving 97 percent for various public purposes.
The new plan involves giving developers 18 percent of the land and leaving 82 percent for public park space, which would include convention centers, educational campuses and the like. Private money would finance all the development.
As conceived now, there would be a 1,000-acre natural habitat on the northern end of the land, close to 300 acres of agriculture, some of which would be a prison farm, a 75-acre cemetery (the first in Irvine), 45 holes of golf, more than 400 acres of housing (25 percent of which would have to be for low-income residents) and several hundred acres of industrial and commercial development.
The 350 acres of park would lie in the middle, divided by some creeks.
Daniel Jung, Irvine's director of strategic programs, said the site might include some housing planned in the almost-freakish expectation, for California, that people would be close enough to public transportation and shopping that they would not use their cars every day.
"It's a development you haven't really seen in Orange County," Mr. Jung said. 
Some officials have insisted that the park would vault Orange County into the nation's first ranks. But while people here often cite other major urban parks in the region as models, it is clear that the comparisons come up short.
For instance, Balboa Park in San Diego, the park most often cited, is just 1,200 acres, but it is in the middle of a dense urban setting. It is home to 15 museums, the San Diego Zoo and a theater.
North of Orange County is Griffith Park, near the heart of Los Angeles. It consists of 4,107 acres of mountainous wilderness and only a modest amount of development. There is the Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry Museum of Western Heritage, a theater, an observatory and lots of sports fields, but mostly heavily wooded hillsides and canyons. 
The El Toro site is flat, a big chunk of it covered with asphalt from the old runways. It is surrounded by suburban development and a clean-looking, high-tech industrial park. 
"It's hard to know what the draw would be," said Con Howe, the planning director for Los Angeles. "It's not surrounded by dense urban development. It's suburban. It's not an immediate area that is open-space-starved. And it does seem like from the get-go they have no natural character there to work with." 
Ms. Hart, the Irvine city manager, suggested that those opinions miss the point. 
"This is a total free-market experiment," Ms. Hart said. "We want to take a little more time to package this and then it's rock 'n' roll."

HEADLINE: Some Conservatives Question the Value of Reorganizing Domestic Security 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
He has no realistic hope of stopping the proposed Department of Homeland Security -- a reorganization of federal agencies that official Washington suddenly considers vital to the prevention of terrorism -- but John J. Duncan Jr. says he is seriously considering voting against it.
 Representative Duncan, a Republican from Tennessee with a record of trying to knock down government projects, says the department will become another overgrown garden. He has no illusions, though, about why his colleagues will probably pass it overwhelmingly. 
 "Almost everyone in Congress wants to be seen as doing something big and lavish for homeland security, so they'll vote to create this new department," he said. "But I'm not sure it's going to make the dramatic difference that some people are hoping for." 
Mr. Duncan is the sole member of Congress who openly speaks of opposing the department. But several other conservatives on and off Capitol Hill are asking whether rearranging agencies will truly improve the nation's defense against terrorism.
Ivan Eland of the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington, wrote that the department was "designed to pretend that the administration is doing something," rather than to improve the nation's efficiency at gathering intelligence or plugging holes of vulnerability.
"Even before the September attacks, the U.S. government had sufficient bureaucratic machinery to deal with terrorist attacks on the homeland without adding a new department," wrote Mr. Eland, the group's director of defense policy studies, in a paper this month. "But in Washington, the typical response to any crisis is to rearrange organizational charts and add bureaucracies. The real problem revealed by the terrorist attacks is too much bureaucracy -- causing too many communication and coordination problems -- not too little."
In an interview, Mr. Eland criticized the administration for failing to reduce duplication and waste before announcing the plan. He said 11 government agencies -- including the departments of Commerce and State -- have intelligence departments. But rather than combining those, he said, the White House proposed a department that would demand more money and employees.
Despite such criticism, the momentum for the new department appears unstoppable. Democrats were the first to propose it, and most Republicans trudged along after the administration made the idea its own. Even conservative editorial pages like those of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times grudgingly set aside their opposition to bigger government and agreed.
The administration insists that creating the department will not in itself cost taxpayer money. In testimony before Congress this month, Tom Ridge, the White House director of domestic security, said the department "would not grow government," and he predicted that the expenses of creating any new functions would be offset by the savings derived from eliminating duplicated services. 
But many conservatives said they heard such promises when the departments of Education, Energy and Transportation were established.
Stephen Moore, the president of the Club for Growth, an antitax political action committee, said any new cabinet department creates a demand for money. He cited the same postwar reorganization President Bush brought up this month.
"Homeland security should have been a function of the Department of Defense, and that's what they originally had in mind when they created it back in the 1940's," Mr. Moore said. "That department was originally supposed to keep us safe from foreign invaders, but our foreign policy has become so adventurous in the following years that now they say we need a new department to handle the job."
Mr. Duncan said his staff had found that the growth of each modern cabinet department had outpaced the inflation rate.
"We've got to start asking these questions now, before it becomes just another department that greatly increases our expenditures," he said. 
Although they have stopped short of expressing outright opposition, several other members of Congress have voiced doubts about whether the proposed agency would make domestic protection more efficient. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote to Mr. Ridge this month urging him to ensure that the new department reduces government security costs.
"I am going to watch that agencies losing staff or funds do not try to replicate what they give to homeland security just to keep their turf," he wrote.
Some liberals have also raised warnings. Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, has railed about what he calls haphazard planning. Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said the department was intended to deflect attention from the intelligence failures of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. He also said that moving agencies from one department to another had rarely solved problems.
Congressional conservatives who normally oppose large government initiatives said this plan was different because of the national sense of emergency and the perception that the security structure had failed.
"I always have a concern about more bureaucracy," said Representative Bob Barr, Republican of Georgia, an outspoken conservative. "But in this case there's not much doubt that things weren't working the way they should work."
Mr. Moore said conservatives should seek something in return for a new department. "We ought to have a position of no growth in cabinet departments," he said. "In exchange, couldn't they at least get rid of the Commerce Department?"

HEADLINE: Waiting for Ground Zero Proposals 

 BODY:
Those who care passionately about the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan now find themselves in an anxious limbo. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has promised that by mid-July, the public will see a half-dozen options for reclaiming ground zero. The waiting would be easier if we were totally confident that everyone else is waiting, too. The corporation chairman, John Whitehead, and Gov. George Pataki need to assure the public repeatedly that no developer, no advocate group, no politician is slipping through the back doors to wield insider clout while everyone else is standing quietly on the sidelines. 
 By offering the public a series of different visions for how to rebuild, officials hope to provoke debate and discussion. Those planners who are involved in creating these options promise that they will include some proposals that will be bold and provocative, as well as some that will seem very predictable and conservative. Every week it becomes clearer how difficult a task it will be to balance the concerns of all those who believe they own a part of Sept. 11. Families, residents, corporations, public authorities, politicians -- a wide range of New Yorkers all have their varying and sometimes conflicting demands. None of these groups alone can be permitted to control the future of this site. 
 Looking at the decision-making process from the outside, we can see the pressure building. Some business executives are lobbying hard for a large network of stores with covered streets so that stoplights and walk signs will not distract shoppers from their mission as consumers. If we are looking for a splendid urban plan that revives the area and restores the spirit, a mall is hardly the answer.
On the other side of the emotional spectrum are the families, many of whom are grieving and understandably see the site only as a place where their loved ones died. Mayor Michael Bloomberg expressed himself clumsily recently when he said that workers and residents do not want to live and work around a cemetery. Still, he revealed the concerns of many people who have their own large stake in the planning and revival of Lower Manhattan. As Madelyn Wils, a representative of downtown residents, put it last week, downtown should be revitalized, not consecrated.
That does not mean any lessening of the importance of the memorial that must be at the center of any rebuilding on ground zero. But there are many ways to memorialize those who lost their lives Sept. 11. Some of those monuments could feature a tranquil park or a cultural center with the best music and art that this ambitious city has to offer. With the hiring of a new director to focus on the memorial, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation should be able to listen to the many evolving ideas while holding the memorial's design to the high standards the site and the city demand.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers In Hartford Send Budget To Governor 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 30 

 BODY:
Six hours before the start of Connecticut's 2003 fiscal year, lawmakers approved a revised $13.2 billion state budget this evening that would cut spending, increase taxes and avoid potential layoffs and state-agency shutdowns that Gov. John G. Rowland had warned of two days ago.
 Lawmakers also voted today to reduce the legal blood alcohol limit for drivers to 0.08 from 0.10. 
 The revised budget would increase a smattering of taxes by a total of $270 million, roughly 2 percent, and reduce state spending by approximately $305 million, though the new 2003 budget would still grow by 3.4 percent, double the rate of inflation, over the fiscal 2002 budget. 
The governor is expected to sign the revised 2003 budget into law Monday, the same day he has scheduled three appearances around the state to officially announce his bid for a third term in November. 
Connecticut passes state budgets two years at a time, in odd calendar years. The Legislature passed the original budget for the fiscal year 2003 last year, but since then revenue has fallen more than $800 million short of projections, forcing Democratic lawmakers who control the Legislature and Mr. Rowland, a Republican, into protracted talks recently over how to balance the books.
The governor criticized the Legislature's Democratic leadership as unrealistically wishing for no spending cuts, while the Democrats hammered Mr. Rowland for refusing to consider a temporary tax on millionaires to offset the deficit. 
As the new fiscal year drew closer without a spending plan in sight, Mr. Rowland began speaking publicly about the possible need to lay off state workers, freeze the wages of others and even consider limited shutdowns of certain programs. 
None of it came to pass, but today Republicans and Democrats in the State Senate and House of Representatives each voiced only limited satisfaction with their compromise. 
"This is not the best budget we've ever done," Kevin B. Sullivan, the Senate president pro tempore, told reporters after the Senate approved it by a 20-to-11 vote. "It's somewhere between, 'It's not too bad' and 'It's good.' "
Marc S. Ryan, Governor Rowland's budget chief and lead negotiator, said the new plan would give the state agencies and municipalities enough to keep most programs intact, but not as much as everyone would have liked. 
The new budget cuts $30 million from the Department of Higher Education, University of Connecticut, community colleges, Connecticut State University and the University of Connecticut Health Center. It also imposes a minimum $250 corporate tax and a $250 annual charge to small businesses. 
The budget will also keep 350 to 500 unfilled state jobs vacant, Mr. Ryan said, and freezes salaries of more than 3,000 managers in the executive and judicial branches. Deputy commissioners of six state agencies will be eliminated, he said.
Legislators from both parties said today that they realized the new budget would not solve the state's fiscal problems. Economists are already predicting deficits through 2005. To mitigate that, Democratic lawmakers said they would press for the millionaire's tax again next year.

HEADLINE: Tilting at Windmills, Only This One's a Bridge; 
Walkway Over Hudson Is One Man's Fixation

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
About a decade ago, Bill Sepe uncorked a doozy of an idea. The old Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge -- an engineering marvel in 1888 but a delinquent eyesore ever since a spectacular fire closed it in 1974 -- should be transformed, he said, into a pedestrian skyway over the Hudson River.
 The old rail bed, wrapped in its Victorian-era lattice of steel, 200 feet above the water, would get a second life, he and others said, as strollers and bikers thrilled to the view and the history. 
 Central to the walkway plan was its seize-the-day enthusiasm. The bridge's owner at that time, in the early 1990's, had not paid taxes for years, and that made it an abandoned structure, according to Mr. Sepe, then a self-employed handyman. He began leading volunteer crews out on the rail bed to see what could be salvaged. Local politicians and business leaders, envisioning hordes of weekenders with bulging wallets, cheered the effort on. 
"He had that dream, and he infected people with it," said Robert Shepard, town supervisor in Lloyd, N.Y., on the bridge's western side. "I believed in it."
Today Mr. Sepe (rhymes with peppy) is still living the dream, but it is an increasingly lonely one. The old bridge sits silent behind a chain-link fence, locked in legal limbo. Many of the volunteers have drifted away. Some local officials have begun worrying that pieces of rusting steel, unpainted for three decades, could fall into the river. Developers of a network of hiking trails being built on old rail lines were planning a link to the bridge, but they have plotted out an alternate route.
Mr. Sepe said he blamed narrow-minded politics for the impasse. Other people, including even some of his ardent admirers, said the problem was that the bridge's fortunes became bound up too much with the vision, and the foibles, of Mr. Sepe himself. Although the dream is not dead, people on both sides of the river agree that what eventually happens will depend less on rusting rivets than on the temperament and tactics of the man who would be the walkway king.
"The bridge is his life," said Dick Coller, a retired electrical engineer who has worked closely with Mr. Sepe for years and once led tourists out on the bridge to the viewing platform that the volunteers helped build about 1,200 feet from the western side. "But he wants to do it his way."
Town officials in Lloyd are more blunt. "The man is an idiot," said David L. Butler, supervisor of the Building Department and its chief code enforcement officer. 
He and other town officials say they have spent $30,000 in legal fees just for an unsuccessful effort to force Mr. Sepe's group, Walkway Over the Hudson, to comply with building and zoning regulations for the structures that were built within town boundaries. 
"If anybody else was running that organization, there would have been people walking on that bridge three years ago," Mr. Butler said. 
Mr. Sepe, now 54, said there was no doubt that the walkway consumed him and that he made some mistakes. Bridge affairs took over his home -- filling up his living room, then his dining room and his garage with files, posters and donated office equipment. It cost him his handyman business, he said, because customers objected to his running off for meetings. He has since taken jobs serving legal papers, driving a bus and most recently operating a tractor at a gravel mine in Rhinebeck three days a week, all to accommodate his bridge duties. The project was bad for his health, he said, as he gained weight from the stress. 
But he said he believed, whatever the cost and however sour things have turned out, that the original vision was right.
He insisted almost from the beginning, for example, that building the walkway would be a community affair -- a self-financed, volunteer effort that would not take a dime of government money. The government, Mr. Sepe preached, always takes control of what it pays for; conversely, any community that creates something through sweat and dedication will value it more, he said.
That idealistic view got hundreds of people involved in the early days, but later it came to seem quixotic, some volunteers said, as the dimensions of the project became clearer. Mr. Sepe said he thought a walkway could be built for $2 million; some experts have said it could cost $30 million just to paint the bridge. 
Mr. Sepe's freewheeling philosophy also ran afoul of local zoning laws after his group gained legal title to the bridge in the late 1990's.
He refused to post a $1,600 escrow payment for an engineering inspection, saying the bill was padded. Then, in the middle of the litigation, in 2000, a volunteer was seriously injured in an electrical accident while working on the bridge, and an angry State Supreme Court Justice said he'd had enough. The judge slapped a permanent injunction on Walkway Over the Hudson, barring any tours or repairs. Mr. Sepe appealed the injunction in May.
Standing on the unfinished walkway, Mr. Sepe said that if he lost the appeal, a civil disobedience campaign could be the next step. He might simply go back to work on the bridge anyway -- court injunction be hanged -- along with any volunteers who care to follow him.
"I won't be bullied," he said. 
Mr. Sepe said he believed that town officials in Lloyd had a political agenda behind their lawsuits and court orders. 
"To me, this is a right everybody has -- not to be harassed to take public money," he said. "Politicians would take money from soup kitchens. We've got a soup kitchen right here in Poughkeepsie that doesn't get adequate funding, and yet they would put money into this bridge." Town officials in Lloyd said taking the walkway group to court was simply a last resort.
"We think it's a great use for the bridge and have always been in favor of it, but we also have a responsibility to the general public to protect life, safety and welfare," said Mr. Butler, the code enforcement officer.
Many people in this part of the Hudson Valley, about 90 miles north of New York City, can claim an emotional ownership of the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge. For some, it stands for the days when Poughkeepsie was on every freight-hauler's map, linking New England and the Midwest. For others, it's a poignant symbol of the economic hard knocks that had begun even before the fire, as the heavy industries that once sent their freight clattering across the river faded away. It was the first bridge across the Hudson south of Albany, and for a time -- if its approach system is counted -- was also the longest in the world, at 6,768 feet. 
Judy Moran, a retired elementary school teacher, said the bridge was a link to her childhood and to her father, who worked as a switchman on the Poughkeepsie side. She was a member of Mr. Sepe's group and led walkway tours in the mid-1990's, before dropping out about three years ago in a disagreement with him over the issue of public financing. 
Mr. Shepard, the town supervisor in Lloyd, was a volunteer firefighter on May 8, 1974, when the blaze that closed the bridge broke out. It was a scary night, he said. Working high over the river, the fire crews had to tear out the oil-soaked railroad ties, which had been ignited by sparks from a train, and each tie that was removed left less for the firefighters to stand on as they worked.
Several members of the walkway group say that part of the story of the stalled walkway comes down to the question of who will, in the end, be the bridge's master. 
"Bill just doesn't want to lose control of it," said one person in the group who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, since he wants to be part of the project, which he believes will eventually resume. 
Mr. Sepe agreed that perhaps control was an issue, but he said the project was not about him. 
"I'm willing to give up control if somebody shows the commitment and wants to do it," he said. "My fear that if we give up, we'll lose the whole thing, that it'll be erased, it'll be something completely different than what we wanted. I want it to be something we did ourselves, something that we did."

HEADLINE: Part-Time Firefighter Is Held In Setting of Blaze in Arizona 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN with CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: SHOW LOW, Ariz., June 30 

 BODY:
A part-time firefighter was charged today with deliberately setting the Rodeo wildfire, which combined with another blaze a week ago to become the largest in Arizona's history.
 Prosecutors said he started the fire hoping to make money fighting it. 
 The firefighter, Leonard Gregg, 29, was arraigned this morning in federal court in Flagstaff on charges of setting two fires on June 18 near his home in Cibecue, on the Fort Apache Indian reservation.
One of them was the Rodeo fire, which on June 23 merged with the Chediski Fire to form a blaze that has devastated vast swaths of timberland, destroyed at least 423 homes and forced the evacuation of about 32,000 people.
"Can I say I'm sorry for what I did?" Mr. Gregg asked United States Magistrate Stephen Verkamp, who interrupted him before he could incriminate himself further. If convicted of the two charges, Mr. Gregg faces up to 10 years in jail and $500,000 in fines. A federal prosecutor, Paul K. Charlton, said at a news conference here that a grand jury could level more charges against Mr. Gregg, who is in custody. 
"There is evidence that he started the fire so as to earn money as a contract firefighter," Mr. Charlton said. 
In the federal courthouse in Flagstaff today, as smoke drifted overhead from the wildfires 90 miles to the south, the handcuffed Mr. Gregg was led into court wearing black jeans and a black T-shirt. Mr. Gregg, who is single and has a ninth-grade education, told the judge that he worked part time for the forestry department of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
The criminal complaint against him said he had used matches to burn brush, timber and other flammable material about two miles from Cibecue. He then told a woman he was with that he had to get home because a fire call was imminent, the complaint said. Mr. Gregg responded to the call to help fight the fire, which he had not expected to grow so much, the document said. He was arrested on Saturday evening and is to appear in court again on Wednesday.
It was the second time in a month that blame for a devastating wildfire had been placed on a federal employee paid to control fires. On June 16, Terry Lynn Barton, 38, a Forest Service worker whose responsibilities included enforcing a ban on fires in the Pike National Forest in Colorado, was charged with starting the Hayman fire, the largest ever in the state. It has burned 137,000 acres. She had told friends she hoped to become an arson investigator, the authorities said.
Law enforcement officials in Arizona are still trying to find who set the Chediski fire, which is believed to have been started on June 20 by a white woman who was trying to signal a helicopter after she got lost in the woods on Apache land.
The 452,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski blaze was about 35 percent contained today, with fire lines holding near here, on the fire's northeastern flank, and to the west near Forest Lakes and Heber-Overgaard. Conditions in Show Low, which seemed under clear threat of at least partial destruction just a few days ago, became so favorable early Saturday that the authorities permitted its 7,700 residents to return after being evacuated a week earlier.
To Native American firefighters, the news that one of their own had been arrested in the Rodeo blaze was a sickening blow. It seemed certain to worsen the racial tensions that have swept through the region since the fires began. Well before Mr. Gregg's arrest, some white people had accused the Apaches of setting the Rodeo blaze, and the Apaches did not dispute that.
Richardson Antonio, a Bureau of Indian Affairs supervisor for the Apache crews, who fought the fire on the northern rim in the devastated area of Heber-Overgaard, described the mood around Cibecue today as glum.
"It looks bad for the Apache firefighter," Mr. Antonio said. "A lot of white people are angry now."
"Our job is to fight fires, not set them," he said. "And I was angry this morning. I talked to the Indian men. What can we do? We got to do our job. The guys in the Cibecue crew are down. They feel betrayed. They know that guy."
Dallas Massey, tribal chairman of the White Mountain Apache Nation, said that, like many others, he was surprised to hear that one of his people might have been involved in setting the Rodeo fire. "All I know is all of our beautiful land is gone, people's homes were destroyed, we're like everybody else," he said. "I'm just in shock."
The fire is an economic disaster for the tribe. The Apaches are heavily dependent on their lumber industry, which pumps $30 million a year into a community with 60 percent unemployment. The ponderosa pines, the finest timber here, take 100 years to grow to maturity, but on the beleaguered western areas of the reservation where the rainfall and land quality is poor, it takes 200 years, Mr. Massey said.
With Mr. Gregg awaiting a court hearing on Wednesday, Chadeen Palmer, a spokeswoman for the White Mountain tribe, reminded reporters at the news conference here today that not all the facts in the case were known. 
"Until the entire investigation and criminal process are completed, we cannot rush to judgment against any individual," Ms. Palmer said. "However, the tribe expects that all persons responsible for the fire outbreak will be held accountable for the unprecedented destruction to homes, communities and forest lands."
Another firefighter who had toiled with Mr. Gregg against the Rodeo fire, Lionel Nachu, a member of Fort Apache's Swift 58 crew in Cibecue, said he found the news today hard to believe, and more so given the effort the fire required.
"We thought we had it out that first night, but the wind just took it," Mr. Nachu recalled. "We worked along with him. I can't believe it. I'm fighting for the white people's land, too. I hope they know that."
In all, about 25,000 residents of 10 eastern communities, some of them damaged by the flames, were allowed to return home, while most of those to the west of the fire, principally from Heber-Overgaard, Forest Lakes and Airpine, were not. Fire conditions there, while improved, were still volatile today, a Forest Service spokeswoman, Jennifer Byington, said. About 4,480 firefighters remained engaged in the overall effort to control the fire.
In Show Low, the sky was relatively clear today for the first time in a week, and the streets resumed something of a normal rhythm. Cars, vans, trailers and pickup trucks that had been hurriedly packed more than a week earlier rumbled into a town devoid of police roadblocks and the ominous threat of what officials had called a "wall of fire."
Still, the flames took some homes and came perilously close to others. "The cobwebs on the side of the house were scorched," said Lynne Louchart, who lives with her husband, Dennis, in Pinedale, on the road toward Heber-Overgaard. "You could tell somebody did hand-to-hand combat at our house."
Pine trees a few feet from the house were incinerated, and a shed that held two bicycles, a chainsaw and other tools was gone. A swing set in the garden was partly melted, and there were signs of flames a mere foot from a propane tank. Five of the 11 houses in the immediate neighborhood were destroyed, including that of the Loucharts' neighbor.
"We knew we were in the middle of it, but we didn't know how heavily we were impacted," Mrs. Louchart said. "We're ecstatic."
But the residents' return to the area brought fresh dangers from people with a bent toward arson. On Saturday afternoon, a fire spotter at a lookout post on Juniper Ridge near Linden, northwest of here, saw a plume of smoke rising near an area that had already burned and been extinguished days earlier. Firefighters dispatched to the spot discovered a patch of flames that they determined had been intentionally set.
"We found footprints, tire tracks that spun around, and an ignition source," said Jim Paxon, a Forest Service spokesman. "I just cannot believe that someone would do that after what we've been through." 
As he entered St. Rita's Catholic Church here this morning for the first time in a week, Ron Greene, a former engineer with the Phoenix Fire Department who retired to Show Low 22 years ago, said he had learned in training long ago that most arson fires were committed by active or retired firefighters.
"Maybe they have animosity or anger," Mr. Greene said. "They know from experience how to start a concealed fire. But anytime anyone does something this stupid or reckless, it saddens me deeply. Fire is so uncontrollable that you never know who you're going to kill or maim."

HEADLINE: Concession-Seekers in Legislature Hold Arena for Newark in Check 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30 

 BODY:
With the major state budget bills having passed the Senate and headed for likely approval in the Assembly this morning, New Jersey lawmakers used the unresolved issue of whether to build a sports arena in Newark as the forum to win concessions for their districts, and in the process held up final approval of the budget.
 In a rare Sunday session filled with drama and political maneuvering, the bill that would allow financing and construction of a $355 million arena to house the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, replacing the teams' current home at the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands, appeared to be languishing in a Senate committee. It was weighed down by costly amendments. When the Senate convened late Sunday night to vote on various budget measures, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who also sits in the Senate, withheld his vote on two critical budget bills to protest the failure of the arena bill to advance to the floor. 
 Mr. James was then summoned to the office of Gov. James E. McGreevey. The governor agreed to pressure the Republican and Democratic Senate leaders to hold a late-night meeting of the committee that had bottled up the arena bill, according to lawmakers who were briefed later on what was said at the meeting. Minutes later, Mr. James cast his vote for one of the budget measures and, joined by the rest of the Essex County delegation, withheld his vote on the other one until the governor made good on his promise.
Earlier in the day, the printing operation at the State House was working furiously to churn out copies of the many amendments that were surfacing to the arena bill.
The arena measure, which Mr. McGreevey supports, would also create sports and entertainment districts for Harrison to build a soccer arena, and Pennsauken to build a minor league hockey rink. The districts would be allowed to keep some of the sales taxes collected at the venues to pay off construction costs.
Several amendments were proposed on Sunday that would create similar mechanisms for Mercer, Monmouth and Bergen Counties. Other amendments would give Harrison and Pennsauken access to income-tax revenues at their sites as well. These in turn prompted amendments from some Republicans to limit the revenues such mechanisms could generate.
Meetings of the key committees needed to advance the measure were postponed again and again.
"There are no rules on days like this, and anything could happen," said Jeff Tittle, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, which supports the Newark arena as a sound environmental use of urban space. "By the end, we may have sports authority mechanisms for all 21 counties in the state."
In an echo of the past, Jack Collins, former Assembly speaker and now a paid consultant to several private interests in the state, was seen around the committee room where the Senate Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee was scheduled to consider the many last-minute amendments to the bill.
Many legislators blamed Mr. Collins, who was speaker until this year, for loading up last year's failed version of the bill with unrelated spending measures intended to win votes. Eventually, even Governor-elect McGreevey withdrew his longtime support for the measure, saying that too much spending had been larded on to it, and the bill's tenuous legislative support dissolved. "They should have passed it when I was speaker and they wouldn't be here today," Mr. Collins said Sunday with a grin.
Some supporters of the Newark arena, like Senator Joseph Charles, a Democrat from Hudson County, and the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, president of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, echoed that view, saying that Mr. McGreevey had miscalculated by opting to take on the measure now in a time of declining state revenues rather than allowing his predecessor and a Republican-controlled Legislature to approve it.
"I don't know why he didn't let Governor DiFrancesco do this," said Mr. Jackson, referring to Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican who had embraced passage of the arena measure as part of his political legacy at the close of a 25-year career in Trenton. Mr. DiFrancesco, who was acting governor for much of last year, had mustered support from several Republicans until the bill's many unrelated projects made it politically perilous.
That the stakes were high for the arena on the closing day of the Legislature was also evident from the presence of Raymond Chambers, the usually reclusive philanthropist and partner in the YankeeNets, which owns the Nets and the Devils.
A spokesman for the YankeeNets, James McQueeny, said Mr. Chambers was prepared to tell lawmakers that without their support for the Newark arena measure, the building could not open in 2005 and the ownership group would face financial losses. That would mean that members of the YankeeNets who do not share Mr. Chambers's desire to move the teams to Newark, the state's largest city, and presumably help in its renaissance, would gain leverage in their efforts to move the teams out of New Jersey.
Some Republican lawmakers said privately that many of their constituents had yet to feel any real fear of losing the teams. Still others said they had polled voters and found they did not care enough about keeping the teams to press lawmakers to support the measure, which proponents say would ensure the teams' presence in the state for at least 20 years.

HEADLINE: In Trenton, Budget Battle Keeps Legislators Working Into Morning 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature worked into the morning today in an effort to adopt the largest budget in the state's history and close its largest projected deficit ever. 
 Early today, the extraordinary session that began Sunday afternoon dissolved in bitter fighting among the Democrats over the proposed sports arena in Newark. The State Senate's vote on the corporate business tax, the centerpiece of Gov. James E. McGreevey's budget proposal, was suspended to give Senate leaders and the governor time to placate Democrats who had defected in an effort to force a hearing on the arena bill. 
 The fighting behind closed doors led to threats and even shoving, according to one Republican senator. And after submitting enough votes to assure that the corporate business tax bill would pass, most Republicans went home. 
The $23.4 billion budget, which follows Governor McGreevey's blueprint, would restructure the corporate income tax, borrow against revenue expected from the state's share of the national tobacco settlement, nearly double the cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack and raise an array of fees. 
By midnight Sunday, Republican legislators had supplied the deciding votes for most of the budget measures in the evenly divided State Senate, but not until they had harshly criticized the Democrats for increasing spending and relying on bond sales to finance operating expenses. And they made their final protests against the business-tax overhaul.
The Senate's Republican co-president, John O. Bennett, addressed the Democrats, naming all 20 senators, and said, "Each one of you will be charged with the responsibility to explain this Democrat budget that increases state spending while raising countless taxes on all New Jerseyans."
The state's fiscal problems have consumed Mr. McGreevey's first five and a half months in office. As if extending his campaign, the new governor blamed his Republican predecessors for the state's fiscal straits, then sought to raise new revenue while insisting that he was keeping his promise not to raise taxes. 
Mr. McGreevey turned almost immediately to business as a source of new money, claiming that big corporations had escaped their "fair share" of the tax burden. The administration maintained that three-quarters of the corporations in the state, and 30 of the 50 largest employers, were paying only the $200 minimum required under the old law.
The new plan would impose an "alternative minimum" tax, on a graduated basis, that is calculated according to gross receipts or gross profits. The plan would also end an exemption for dividends that New Jersey corporations receive from out-of-state subsidiaries, and would tax out-of-state sales that are not already taxed by the other states.
The budget was also a test of whether the Republicans, who share control of the State Senate with Democrats, could check the new governor's moves. With business groups, they orchestrated an advertising campaign against the business-tax plan. 
In the end, they could wrest only a few concessions. Last-minute bargaining for Republican votes shifted some of the burden from small businesses, and provided for a commission to review the tax and report in two years on whether it should continue. But the revised tax is still projected to raise $1.8 billion, more than twice the amount collected this year.
There are few new spending programs in the budget. It provides for increased property-tax rebates, staff increases at centers for the disabled that are needed to keep their accreditation and $40 million for counterterrorism efforts. It freezes aid to school districts and municipalities at this year's levels.
The budget calls for spending about $500 million more than the budget adopted one year ago. But the increase in actual spending is expected to be considerably higher, since the state made unusually large spending cuts this year after the softening economy and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 began to depress tax collections.
Late Sunday, the Democrats were still dwelling on one of Mr. McGreevey's main themes: that the Republican-controlled budget for the fiscal year that ended Sunday night contained wildly optimistic projections. Some Democrats called them fraudulent.
"I am glad to say that in this year's budget, that number is real, and not an accounting gimmick designed to pull the wool over the people's eyes until the next election," said Senator Wayne R. Bryant, the Democratic chairman of the Senate budget committee. 
Republicans complained bitterly from the outset that they were shut out of budget decisions as Mr. McGreevey and Democratic lawmakers put off sharing details of their proposals. They did not release the appropriations bill until Thursday, which was to have been the last voting day of the session.

Estimates Increase On '02 Ad Spending

BYLINE:  By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
Two forecasters have adjusted their estimates slightly upward for American advertising spending this year. 
 The Zenith Optimedia Group in London, which in April predicted a decline of 1.8 percent in ad spending from 2001, is now forecasting a decline of 1.2 percent. 
Though the economy "shows intermittent strength," executives of Zenith Optimedia wrote in a report, there is "no sign of real recovery for the United States media industry." 
 Zenith Optimedia also revised upward its forecast for ad spending this year in the world's seven largest advertising markets, including the United States. The new forecast is for a decline of 0.5 percent from 2001, compared with a prediction in April for a decline of 1.8 percent. Zenith Optimedia is owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe.
In addition, Jack Myers of Jack Myers Report, a media newsletter published by Myers L.L.C., revised his prediction for American ad spending this year to forecast no change from last year; in April, he had predicted a decline of 0.4 percent. Mr. Myers attributed the revision to increased sales of commercial time by broadcast and cable television networks and syndicators, offsetting weakness in sales of ad space by newspapers and magazines.
The revisions came days after another forecaster, David Peeler, president and chief executive at the CMR division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, increased his prediction for 2002 ad spending to a gain of 2.5 percent, compared with a gain of 1.5 percent that he had forecast in January.

N.H.L. Starts Shopping For Free Agents Today

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Most workers do not begin a holiday by starting their shift at midnight, but Mike Gillis has a specialized job, and today is a special day.
 Gillis, a former N.H.L. player, is a player agent and he lives in Kingston, Ontario. While most Canadians celebrated Canada Day, Gillis planned to begin the most important part of his calendar by being in his office for the first minute of the bidding season for unrestricted free agents. 
 "It will be exciting," he said. 
Among his clients are goaltender Mike Richter, center Bobby Holik and right wing Tony Amonte. All are Group 3 free agents, meaning they are at least 31 years old and have played out their contracts. They can negotiate with any N.H.L. team.
"You have a finite number of good players and you have teams interested in signing them and that's the first possible time that they can talk," Gillis said of July 1. "And so they call just after midnight. I'm always in my office."
Goalies and right wings are the most prominent and abundant unrestricted free agents on this summer's market. Also available are goaltenders Curtis Joseph, Ed Belfour and Byron Dafoe. Other right wings available are Bill Guerin and Teemu Selanne.
The number of teams looking for goalies expanded last week when Dominik Hasek retired from the Detroit Red Wings, who won the Stanley Cup last month.
"Hasek's retirement obviously adds another team to the mix for a top goaltender," Gillis said. "Clearly, in the free-agent market, when you have more competition, the tendency is for the dollars to go higher."
Hasek made $8 million last season, plus a $1 million bonus for winning the Cup. Among available goalies, the highest paid was Joseph, at $6.575 million by Toronto. Among the right wings, Selanne made $9.5 million at San Jose. Holik was paid $3.5 million by the Devils. The top-salaried defenseman on the market is Chris Chelios, who was paid $5.5 million by Detroit.
Among the restricted free agents who are theoretically available are Calgary right wing Jarome Iginla, the league's scoring champion, and Montreal goalie Jose Theodore, who won the Hart trophy as most valuable player and the Vezina as best goalie in the regular season.
They have Group 2 status because they are younger than 31. Their teams have the right to match any offer. Should they choose not to match, their teams would get up to five first-round draft choices as compensation. No free agent of this status or stature has been offered a lucrative contract since 1998, when Detroit matched Carolina's bid of $38 million for six years to Sergei Fedorov.
The current formula for free agency emerged from the settlement of the 15-week lockout that delayed the start of the 1994-95 season. Although that negotiation produced a cap on base wages for rookies while reducing leverage and mobility for players younger than 31, it created more bargaining power for veterans.
In the season before the lockout, the average salary was $572,161. Last season, the average salary was $1,642,590, up 14.48 per cent from 2000-1.
N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said recently that teams need "cost certainty" after the collective bargaining agreement expires in September 2004. "High-spending teams create an inflationary environment which puts severe economic pressure on some of the lesser-endowed teams," Bettman said. "So we're going to have to address that."
One of those teams is Detroit, with a payroll of about $65 million last season. To replace Hasek, the Red Wings could court Belfour, Joseph or Richter. Gillis said Richter has recovered from a skull fracture and had no animosity toward the Rangers for not signing him before his free agency. Gillis spoke last week with Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, but Gillis said no negotiation took place.
They did agree, however, that no deals had been made unofficially between free agents and teams seeking them. This contradicts allegations made by William Wirtz, the owner of the Chicago Blackhawks, who said Amonte had an agreement with the Dallas Stars.
"I think the deal has been done already, but it's tampering if anything is done before July 1, so nobody is saying anything," Wirtz told The Chicago Tribune on June 21. "We hear eight or nine players already have agreed to sign and he's one of them."
In response to this, Gillis said: "There is nothing to it." Sather, on the same issue, said: "I don't think that anyone's even talked to anyone about it. If they had, I'd be shocked. You'd be nailed to the wall for that one."
Not all unrestricted free agents are older than 31 or top talents. An unusual case is that of defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, who finished the season with the Colorado Avalanche and earned $1.15 million. Because, at age 29, he is a 10-year veteran who earned less than the league average of $1.643 million, Kasparaitis can negotiate with any team and is likely to get a substantial raise.
Also unrestricted are the veteran defensemen Luke Richardson and Gary Suter; the experienced centers Adam Oates and Doug Gilmour; and specialists in rough play like Tie Domi and Donald Brashear. Center Mark Messier is technically a free agent, as is center Mario Lemieux. But Messier, 41, is expected to re-sign with the Rangers, and Lemieux, 36, is an owner of the Penguins.

HEADLINE: Pro-Europe Leftists Gain in Old East Bloc 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, June 30 

 BODY:
A new political divide has appeared in Europe: while Western Europe is moving to the right, the left has triumphed in former Soviet bloc lands that once rejected anything smacking of their Communist past.
 The Social Democratic parties that won in the Czech Republic this month, in Hungary in April and in Poland last September bear little if any resemblance to the Communists of old. 
 But they are led in at least two cases by men who were members of the Communist Party: Hungary's prime minister, Peter Medgyessy, even confessed in Parliament this month to having worked for the Communist-era secret police.
It is a measure of changed times that his confession brought no huge outcry. His conservative opponents, still smarting at their narrow electoral loss to him in April, called for his resignation, but Mr. Medgyessy (pronounced MEHD-yeh-shee), a financial expert very much in the mold of the staid new politicians of Central Europe, seems in no danger of losing his job. 
A half-dozen years ago, a strong showing for Central or Eastern Europe's left would have meant a vote for a watered down, rose-tinted version of Communism over anti-Communist free marketeers, who championed individual initiative rather than government intervention.
Now the Social Democrats have appropriated the very themes that were once the hallmark of the right: membership in the European Union and NATO, a functioning judiciary, an end to corruption and the economic privilege of the political elite, and a rejection of rigid ideology.
Thus the lament of the conservative Czech politician Vaclav Klaus, about the recent elections here being "a tragedy for every democratic party" and a triumph only for the Communists, rings somewhat hollow. In today's Central and Eastern Europe, the only significant difference on the political landscape appears to be the speed with which different parties prefer to embrace the European Union and how much weight they give to nationalism.
Staunch pro-market parties have virtually disappeared, and almost every significant party in the region supports a well-woven welfare safety net. Such an appeal that may carry leftists to power when Slovakia votes in September, and already worked in Romania to restore Ion Iliescu -- a Socialist and former top Communist -- to the presidency in 2000.
"There is no left-right divide in Central Europe," said Charles Gati, professor of European Studies at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington. "The socialists are as market-oriented as their opponents. The issue is increasingly not Communist versus anti-Communist. The issue is pro-integration versus nationalist."
Economic issues and the desire for progress on that score have compressed the whole political spectrum to the center, said Jiri Pehe, a professor of political science at New York University's Prague center.
"We are in a transformation period," he said, "where left-of-center parties have to take steps that are not normally taken by left-of-center parties in the West, like privatization or freeing prices, and the right-of-center parties realize that joining the E.U. is in their interest, so they have to adopt traditionally leftist measures like the European Union's social charter."
Jacques Rupnik, a professor at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris who has long specialized in Central and Eastern Europe, agrees that the regional pendulum has effectively swung toward the middle.
"They have completed this transition of dismantling the Communist system and building a market economy," he said.
Indeed, the left-right labels have been maintained mostly by the dislike each side feels for the other. 
While they have drifted away from the positions each staked out immediately after the fall of Communism, there are still sufficient differences to enable the left to tar the right as isolationist, nationalist and protective of the privileged, and the right to accuse the left of going soft on the sins of the Communist past.
Both Mr. Klaus and Hungary's recently defeated prime minister, Viktor Orban, have flirted with extremists of all stripes, including, in Mr. Klaus's case, even the otherwise despised, and unreformed, Czech Communists, who share his skepticism about Europe and foreigners.
By contrast, Central Europeans appear to view their socialist parties as able to get things done without upsetting the relative comfort that many in the region have come to enjoy.
"The general trend is to pick leaders with whom they feel comfortable, who don't scream and who are experienced," Mr. Gati said. "The Czechs, for instance, want to be able to leave on Thursdays for their cottages, and that's it. They don't want to work as hard as American-style capitalism would require of them."

HEADLINE: The World's Unschooled 

 BODY:
Americans take universal schooling for granted. Nearly a quarter of a billion children worldwide cannot. Last week's promise by Washington and other rich countries to increase their aid budgets for Africa is welcome, but even better would be an increase in the pitifully small share of those aid budgets that goes toward expanding access to primary education worldwide. 
 Basic education is one of the most powerful development tools -- every extra year of school in very poor countries can raise earnings by an average of 10 to 20 percent. Without increased efforts, scores of countries will fall short of the internationally declared goal of providing a full primary education to all children by 2015. 
 Roughly 130 million boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 11 are not enrolled in school. Another 150 million drop out with less than four years of education under pressure of their parents' poverty. Born poor, these children are virtually condemned to stay poor and rear their own children in poverty. 
The problem is most acute for girls. Fewer than half of Africa's girls finish primary school. That is a huge loss. Educating girls has dramatically positive effects, including lower birth rates, reduced infant mortality and higher incomes. In countries like Pakistan, making free public schooling more widely available would give poor families alternatives to the kind of radical Islamic madrasas that funneled their young graduates into Afghanistan's battlefields. 
The first steps need to be taken by the governments directly involved, as 180 countries agreed when the international goal of universal primary education was set. They are expected to increase their own education spending, improve school quality and incorporate education into effective development strategies. Those that do were promised sustained financial help from the developed world, but that has not yet been provided. 
The amounts needed are not impossibly large. The World Bank estimates it would take around $5 billion a year from all aid donors. America's fair share would be about $1 billion. Washington now contributes roughly $200 million a year.
The World Bank has identified 18 countries whose efforts to improve education qualify them for immediate outside help. These include Ethiopia, Mozambique, Uganda, Nicaragua and Vietnam. Five others, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Congo, which do not yet qualify, are home to more than a third of the children not in school. They need increased international help so that they can meet the standards and qualify for international assistance.
Those countries already able to make good use of aid should not be left waiting. President Bush, who has rightly made such an issue of education in this country, should seek substantially increased financing for it in next year's foreign aid budget. Other rich nations should do likewise. Poor countries not yet qualifying for outside help must intensify their educational efforts. As Mr. Bush has said, no child should be left behind.

HEADLINE: Russia Glances to the West for Its New Legal Code 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia, June 27 

 BODY:
For 13 years, Pavel P. Khovrachyov has been a criminal prosecutor, investigating and convicting people for crimes large and small. Everything about his job is about to change.
 "It will be more complicated to prove someone's guilty," he said, somewhat wistfully, during a break in an assault trial in this town north of Moscow. 
 On Monday, Russia will adopt a new legal code that governs the prosecution of criminal cases and protects the rights of those accused. In a country where the criminal justice system remains ossified in its Soviet past, the introduction of the code is being called the first step of a judicial revolution. 
Anyone accused of a crime must now appear in court within 48 hours, codifying the concept of habeas corpus into Russia's system. As of Monday, defendants may demand a lawyer from the moment they are arrested and, when acquitted, will no longer be subjected to double jeopardy, except in the rarest instances.
The code enshrines the fundamental concept of presumption of innocence and gives new responsibilities -- and, in theory, independence -- to judges, while it will gradually strip prosecutors of the enormous powers they have wielded over almost every step of any prosecution, from arrest to trial. Defense lawyers will have the right to challenge the admissibility of evidence, throwing out, among other things, evidence collected by wiretaps without a warrant.
The changes spelled out in Russia's revised Criminal Procedural Code represent one of the most dramatic of the reforms pushed by President Vladimir V. Putin, who has repeatedly vowed to break the legal, economic and social practices of the Soviet Union by establishing what he has called a "dictatorship of law." 
The code, which replaces one written in 1960 when Nikita S. Khrushchev ruled the Soviet Union, was adopted by the legislature and signed by Mr. Putin late last year after years of fitful debate and vehement opposition from prosecutors and law enforcement officials.
Dmitri N. Kozak, who as Mr. Putin's deputy chief of staff oversaw the drafting of the new code, said the goal was to force Russia's judicial system to become something comparable to those in Western Europe and the United States.
"We can say that as of July 1, we will have a criminal procedure that corresponds to that of world standards and of civilized countries," he said in an interview in the presidential offices not far from the Kremlin. "It means, first of all, that we have made a big step in placing the interests of the individual higher than the interests of the state."
It remains to be seen just how successfully the code will be applied in the day-to-day practice of Russian justice, where corruption is rife and resistance to change deeply entrenched. Many of the rights included in it were written into Russia's new Constitution in 1993 but remain mere abstractions nearly a decade later.
Russia is still a country where suspects can be detained indefinitely, where arbitrary, politically and even economically motivated prosecutions are common, where coercion of suspects is rampant, where the police can stop anyone on the street without any reasonable cause -- including a foreign journalist on his way to interview Mr. Kozak about the new code.
Revising the code has been a slow and contentious process. The lower house of Parliament passed a first draft in 1997, but fierce opposition derailed it. Mr. Putin revived the process last year and pushed it through the legislature.
A commission headed by Mr. Kozak produced some 3,500 amendments to the old code, using judicial systems in Western Europe and the United States as a model. Mr. Putin, who was trained as a lawyer, proposed 100 amendments himself, Mr. Kozak said.
One provision that was eliminated allowed trials in absentia. Only days ago, a court in Moscow convicted Oleg D. Kalugin, a retired K.G.B. major general, of treason, even though he now lives in the United States and did not respond to summons to stand trial in Russia. 
Many of the code's most revolutionary changes are being phased in, something that has raised concerns among liberals and human-rights advocates here, who worry that the delays could scuttle them yet.
By Jan. 1, jury trials will be required for all serious crimes, expanding experiments that have had mixed results in 9 of Russia's 89 regions since they began in 1994. By January 2004, only courts will be able to issue warrants for arrests, searches or seizures of property -- a delay that Mr. Putin's government agreed to as a compromise to assuage the nation's prosecutors.
At its most basic, the new code is intended to introduce an adversarial process, with prosecutors required to argue the facts of a case while the defense will have new powers to challenge evidence, witnesses and procedures. Judges, who until now have worked closely with prosecutors, are supposed to act as detached arbiters.
Supporters say the new code will bring order and fairness to the dispensation of justice. They say it should reduce unwarranted arrests, thereby easing overcrowding in Russia's notoriously abysmal prisons, where there are today nearly 1 million prisoners. 
In courtrooms like the one here in Sergiyev Posad, the new code has elicited elation, apprehension and uncertainty. 
Today, in one of the court's last sessions under the old code, two suspects, Aleksandr L. Grishin and Andrei M. Kozhuknov, sat inside a metal cage and listened to the closing arguments in their latest trial for robbery and assault they are accused of having committed in February 2000. 
Their first trial ended when the court declared there was insufficient evidence to convict them. The prosecutors' office responded by simply opening a new trial. They have been held in prison for more than two years, a situation that is far from unusual.
Mr. Khovrachyov, the prosecutor, spoke perfunctorily, recounting the case and asking the judge to sentence them to 8 years and 12 years, respectively.
The defendants' lawyers then disputed almost every point of the state's case, saying that the two men had been tortured in prison, that witnesses had been coerced in some instances and granted leniency in others, and that items allegedly stolen in fact belonged to Mr. Kozhuknov's girlfriend. 
"For us, this new code will change everything," one of the defense lawyers, Aleksei M. Vasilyev, said afterwards. "It will not be like what you saw today, where we just gave a speech. Now we will be able to petition from the beginning that all this is inadmissible evidence."
Both the defense lawyer and the prosecutor said they had concerns about how the code would be put into practice. Mr. Khovrachyov said he believed that the new code was necessary, though "maybe not to this full extent." He wondered, for instance, how fair it would be for the court to approve an arrest within 48 hours and then be asked to issue a verdict of guilt or innocence later. 
"Is this really how it is done in America?" he asked.
Other worries are less philosophical. The guarantee of habeas corpus has brought on the realization that judges, prosecutors and lawyers will now have to work nights and weekends.
Aleksei S. Bogunov, the chief of Sergiyev Posad's 13 judges, called it a historic moment for Russia, but added that the new responsibilities would tax the system. "To put it simply, we need more judges," he said. "In Russia today, there are 18,000. We need 50,000."
Mr. Putin's government has pledged $1.5 billion to hire more judges, to raise their salaries and to provide new personnel and equipment to prosecutors, but it will take four years. 
There are other difficulties, as well. The new code guarantees a suspect legal representation from the moment of arrest, but it does not spell out how the lawyers will be paid when the defendant cannot afford them. In vast swaths of Russia, it is unclear whether there will even be enough lawyers.
"We are certain that this will require a process of perfecting," said Elena B. Mizulina, a prominent member of the lower house of Parliament who helped draft the new code. "This is not finished. What is important is that we establish the basic conditions."

HEADLINE: For Well-Heeled, Stock Tips Are Served With the Canapes 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
From Greenwich to East Hampton, on private helicopter pools ferrying investment bankers into town from Long Island's South Fork and in the steam room of Park Avenue's Racquet Club, the cognoscenti can readily recognize one familiar facet of the tale of Martha Stewart and her friend, the now-former biotechnology chief executive Samuel D. Waksal: they were entwined in a Manhattan grapevine where the exchange of corporate information is a burgeoning social custom, not necessarily a crime. 
 In Manhattan and its environs, friendships like theirs often coincide with business relationships. And where power, access and social advantage intersect, information that most Americans would think of as exceedingly privileged is passed at cocktail parties and over linen-clad dinner tables as casually as canapes. 
 In the latest case, however, investigators are asking whether a few social figures went over the line. On June 12, Dr. Waksal, then chief executive of ImClone Systems, was arrested on charges of insider trading. Ms. Stewart's actions are being examined in several investigations. She and Dr. Waksal say they did nothing illegal or wrong. 
Insider trading is the buying or selling of securities for personal gain, with the knowing use of confidential information. While the whispers of the moneyed crowd are not usually the kind of information that will send its purveyors away in federally issued orange jumpsuits, the chattering classes do trade data on the subtle level of plain old sociability.
The investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who spends his weekends in the socially conscious town of Southampton, said that the people who divulge information and pass along tips are most likely concerned with improving their social status.
"As a general observation, people leak stuff to be big shots," said Mr. Ross, who entertained guests like the financier Carl C. Icahn at a Southampton cocktail party Saturday evening.
With a wink and a nod among friends and acquaintances, information heard along the boulevard is used to lubricate a promising personal or business relationship, impress a dinner table and repay a favor.
Jeffrey T. Leeds -- a former Supreme Court clerk, former lawyer at Cravath Swaine & Moore and former Lazard investment banker -- said that it is impossible to go to a dinner party or a hospital charity fund-raiser, sometimes known in the brusque patois of the socially energetic as "a cancer dance," and not run into someone who probably has valuable information to pass along to others. 
"Say your friend at dinner is a senior investment banker, someone who is on the board of a couple of companies," Mr. Leeds said. "At dinner, people talk about what they do, and their observations." 
And their observations are traded by a group as old-fashioned and exclusive as the 400 well-to-do New Yorkers who could fit into Mrs. William Backhouse Astor's ballroom in the 19th century. 
If the group is larger now, the quarters are still close. This spring, Peter E. Bacanovic, friend and stockbroker to both Dr. Waksal and Ms. Stewart, remarked to another friend that he had been to a charity dinner the previous evening and had found himself seated -- small world, he marveled -- at a table with five of his clients. 
But Mr. Leeds, a co-founder with the former Massachusetts governor, William F. Weld, of Leeds Weld, which invests in private companies, added that the atmosphere in which information is socially traded has loosened up dramatically in the last decade.
When he trained as a lawyer two decades ago, "the rules regarding any social conversation were clear," he said. "You were constantly reminded that a complete duty of confidentiality applied to all matters involving public, and for that matter, private companies. Dinner parties included." 
That has relaxed, Mr. Leeds said, as the memories of 1980's-era white-collar crime have faded. 
"Now we're onto the next generation, and their memories are not as fresh," he said. "Information -- not all of it good, remember -- is passed from bedroom to boardroom to dinner table and back." 
The art of trading money-making data over social occasions has even sneaked into the latest popular culture. 
In "Social Crimes," a novel by Jane Stanton Hitchcock that takes place among the wealthy set of Park Avenue and the Hamptons, the narrator hardly gets three pages in before mentioning the Billionaire Reading Group, "referred to that way because all the women in it had rich husbands and because between our discussions of Proust, Trollope and Flaubert, the stock tips were reputed to fly faster than a covey of quail." 
Ms. Hitchcock, whose book's publication was feted at lunches and cocktail parties hosted by A-list socialites in Washington and Manhattan, said that it was simply an accepted part of patrician culture that the wealthy trade morsels of information over the dinner table that might be useful down the line. 
"One would certainly hope so, or why else would you go?" Ms. Hitchcock said. (She added, however, that if she heard any hot stock tips, she wouldn't know what to do with them. "It all sounds like 10th century Chinese poetry to me," she said.) 
In the halcyon days of the 1980's and 1990's, trading privileged information was far more attractive than in today's scandal-plagued market. If an insider told a friend or family member it might be a good idea to buy stock, he also benefited because more people would invest, so the company would get a boost in the markets. 
Promoting a stock -- and offering up some authoritative-sounding spin as you swirled and sniffed your Puligny-Montrachet -- was a way to sound smart, the equivalent of discussing Wittgenstein at a college keg party to impress the cute coed in horn-rimmed glasses. 
"At cocktail parties in the Hamptons, people talked about stock and recommended it," said Muriel F. Siebert, who heads her own investment firm. "Even the women got involved because it was the thing to do, but it wasn't necessarily inside information." 
In today's unpredictable marketplace, investors are more concerned about avoiding loss than reaping gain, and the most valuable information is less about what to buy, and more about what to unload fast. 
Ms. Stewart, who has denied having any inside information, cashed in her ImClone stock for $227,824 on Dec. 27 of last year, one day before Dr. Waksal's company, ImClone released the news that the Food and Drug Administration would not accept the company's application for its widely anticipated cancer drug, Erbitux. Her broker, Mr. Bacanovic, and his assistant have been put on paid leave by Merrill Lynch. They say they have done nothing wrong.
If Dr. Waksal, who is accused of tipping off two relatives and trying to sell shares of his own, passed any information along to anyone, it was not in his own financial interest to do so. 
Now, those with a tidbit of information to pass down the social gravy train would gain more by selling off their stock as unobtrusively as possible and keeping their possibly privileged information to themselves. Sharing the information only increases the chances that the value of one's remaining stock will decline even further as others sell -- as ultimately happened with Dr. Waksal's stock. 
But Dr. Waksal's interest in sharing valuable information with anyone, if he did, could have been more about currying social favor than about financial gain. As a man who famously used his company to make friends and who used friends to put money into his company, he may have been afraid of losing Ms. Stewart's friendship and the social entree she offered by being his visible comrade-in-arms. 
If Ms. Stewart showed up at Dr. Waksal's annual December holiday reception at his SoHo loft, as she has, the party's social value -- and his own -- was ratcheted up a notch or two. Throw in some models, a dozen silver buckets overflowing with beluga and a couple of writers for The New Yorker magazine (who also entertained Dr. Waksal's friends during the year with informal salon-style lectures on cinema and literature), and Dr. Waksal's annual cocktail party became an event as eagerly anticipated among the fiscally versed beau monde as the World Economic Forum or a Renaissance Weekend.
What the socially connected do may have an impact on a far wider circle than those few who sip sundowners at East Hampton's Maidstone Club or who play golf together at Deepdale Golf Club, as do Henry R. Kravis and Theodore J. Forstmann, the leveraged buyout kings. 
One of the key issues in the Stewart-Waksal matter could turn out to be the rippling influence it could have on investor confidence. For capital markets to function effectively, individual stockholders -- the meat and potatoes of the market, the ma and pa buyers -- must feel secure in the integrity of the markets and the companies populating them, or else they will not bother investing. 
"That could be a lasting, and damaging legacy," Mr. Leeds said. "When individual stockholders begin to sense that there is a lack of fairness in the market, when they aren't getting all the information other people are, when the Marthas and Sams of the world seem to be getting ahead of them, they don't want to participate."

HEADLINE: Korea Takes A Breather From Seesaw In the Market 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 1 

 BODY:
Like the national soccer team, South Korea's stock market has a way of defying the odds makers.
 The special holiday called to celebrate the success of the team and of the World Cup tournament here and in Japan meant there was no trading today, giving investors a breather after a wild week of bouncing in strange directions. 
 Korean stocks were among the world's hottest in the first quarter, racking up gains on signs of revival in the economy and signs of resolution in several long-running broken-company dramas, including Daewoo Motor and Hynix Semiconductor.
But after peaking in April, the main stock index, the Kospi, gave back nearly all its gains, as the Hynix rescue fell apart and the Korean won rose too fast against the dollar for many exporters' comfort. Bellwether Korean products like cars and computer chips still depend heavily on being able to undersell competitors in markets like the United States, so a strong won is a big headache. 
Despite the holiday, the commerce ministry reported today that exports in June were virtually flat, after a strong year-to-year gain in May, and analysts expressed worry that export growth might slip into reverse over the summer.
Worries over the exchange rate nearly turned to utter rout last Wednesday, when the Kospi index plunged by more than 7 percent.
"There's a panic due to the American market and the strength of the Korean won," said Sohn Won Gihl, the treasurer of Woori Finance Holdings.
Mr. Sohn had more reason for concern than most. He had just returned from a nine-day trip to Europe to talk up the prospects for his company's stock, which began trading last Monday. Investors who had bought shares of Woori, a largely government-controlled bank holding company, in late May were free to sell for the first time, and many did, pushing the stock down sharply; it finished the week off more than 12 percent. 
But the market reversed direction abruptly on Thursday and posted its biggest gain in months on Friday, leading all Asian markets, apparently on hopes that the nascent economic recovery in the United States is gaining strength. 
The seesaw week prompted a perennial question: What is it about the Korean market that sends it plunging one day or one week, and then rocketing the next? Perhaps more than in most countries, analysts said, Korean investors treat their stock market more like a gambling casino than a capital clearinghouse, and they dart in and out accordingly. 
"Korea is a place of extreme optimism and extreme pessimism," said Elizabeth Soon, head of Pacific Basin investment for Standard Life Investments, who came to Seoul on a risk-assessment mission from her base in Hong Kong. "My advice is, 'Don't get carried away.' "
Ms. Soon pointed to Samsung Electronics, often regarded as the closest thing South Korea may have to a blue-chip widows-and-orphans kind of company. "In January or February, every phone call was, 'Buy Samsung,' but in June barely anyone spoke to me about Samsung," she said.
Samsung was hit in the spring by falling demand for PC's and a petering-out of a chip price revival earlier in the year, and it winced as the won rose to an 18-month high last week. But even Samsung rode the market updraft on Friday.
One reason for South Korea's good fortune is rising consumer spending, which has made the country somewhat less dependent on exports than it was several years ago.
Another is that the conglomerates have actually buckled down, under government pressure, to significant restructuring.
Korea's case contrasts with that of Japan, where the titans of finance and industry have difficulty admitting they are doing anything wrong.
"You don't want to become like Japan where there's no confidence in the economy," she said. "As long as they invest and do the right things, the economy will be fine."

HEADLINE: More Than the Patch: New Ways to Take Medicine Via Skin 

BYLINE:  By YUDHIJIT BHATTACHARJEE 

 BODY:
Human skin is like a tightly woven fabric, seemingly impervious but porous at the microscopic level. Through its millions of tiny openings, the body oozes sweat and absorbs some substances applied to the skin.
 For decades, this sponge-like quality has inspired the creation of cosmetic creams and pain-relieving sprays, and in recent years, the development of nicotine and hormone patches. But fewer than a dozen drugs can be delivered through the skin because it can effectively absorb only a handful of compounds under ordinary conditions. 
 Now, researchers are developing techniques to move a wider range of drugs across the skin barrier. Some work by making the skin more permeable, either by widening its pores through ultrasound waves or by softly puncturing the skin with a grid of microscopic needles. Other techniques use a mild electric current to propel the drug through the skin or tag drug molecules with compounds that help it slip in through pores.
Drug delivery with these techniques offers several advantages over pills and injections. It can ensure the steady release of medication into the patient's bloodstream over long periods, improving the efficacy of a dose. It can prevent the rapid breakdown that many drugs taken orally undergo when they pass through the digestive system. 
Transdermal drug delivery is also painless and convenient -- a big advantage for patients who hate injections or forget to take their pills on time.
"Consider the estradiol patch, which delivers a form of estrogen and is used in hormone replacement therapy," said Dr. Samir Mitragotri, a researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara. "You can put a single patch on the skin and get the drug for seven days. It's difficult to achieve the same effect with a pill or an injection."
Unlike nicotine and oestradiol molecules, which can pass through the skin easily, the molecules of drugs like insulin are too large to pass. To deliver such compounds transdermally, Dr. Mitragotri and his colleagues are developing an ultrasound device that can enlarge pores by striking them with shock waves. A vibrating metal rod in the device sends sound energy rippling through a column of liquid to generate the shock waves.
A patient could strap the battery-operated device around an arm and switch it on for a few seconds. The skin in the area becomes highly permeable for 12 hours or so. A patch placed on the arm in this period could deliver medication that the patient's skin would ordinarily be unable to absorb. 
"The device itself you could leave in the closet, and the patch you could wear to work," Dr. Mitragotri said. Sontra, a Cambridge, Mass., company founded by Dr. Mitragotri and his research partners, plans to sell the device as a system for delivering drugs like insulin and erythropoietin, which is prescribed for anemia. The two are now administered by injection. The company acknowledges that a commercial product is still a long way off.
Some transdermal systems are close to the pharmacist's shelf or already there. Most are based on a technology called iontophoresis, which involves using a low electric current to propel drugs through the skin. Since the drug molecules themselves bear a small charge, the current drives them across the skin barrier.
One system is being developed by Vyteris, a company in New Jersey. Designed to deliver lidocaine, an anesthetic, the system is a small wearable device containing a patch filled with the drug. The patch is connected to an electronic controller that can be programmed to deliver a desired level of current. Vyteris says the system has gone through trials and could be on the market by the end of next year.
"The nice thing about the technology is that you can increase or decrease the flow of the drug by ramping up the current or turning it down," said James Garrison, who oversees business development at Vyteris. 
A wearable device developed by Cygnus in Redwood City, Calif., uses iontophoresis to monitor glucose level in diabetes patients. It actually performs the reverse of drug delivery, using a current to draw glucose through the skin. A sensor measures the glucose level, which shows up on an electronic display. GlucoWatch, as the device is called, can be worn around the wrist and provides a fresh reading every 20 minutes.
If more systems come to market, said Dr. Richard Guy, a pharmaceutical scientist at the University of Geneva and an adviser to Vyteris, transdermal delivery could become feasible for a wide variety of drugs. But most transdermal technologies, Dr. Guy said, are still far from ready.
"Technologies like ultrasound can open up the skin quite effectively for drug delivery," he said, "but reducing them to a form that is practical and economic is not a done deal."
Dr. Mark R. Prausnitz, a researcher at Georgia Tech, said the development of new drugs, especially proteins that cannot be administered orally, would help the transdermal market expand significantly. He said he hoped one product in that market would be what his group was developing at Georgia Tech: a microneedle patch for delivering vaccines, DNA drugs and other large, unwieldy molecules. 
Dr. Prausnitz and his colleagues have designed arrays of microneedles, a "microscopic bed of nails" that can painlessly pierce the skin. The needles serve as channels for a drug to diffuse into the patient's bloodstream.
"A complete microneedle device could be the size of a Band-Aid, cost well under a dollar, require no batteries and cause no pain," Dr. Prausnitz said.

HEADLINE: Japan's Business Confidence Is Rising, Survey Shows 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1 

 BODY:
Executives at Japan's largest manufacturers, encouraged by rising exports and production, were more upbeat about business conditions for the first time in nearly two years, a central bank poll showed today.
 The results, unveiled in the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan report, underscores the growing view that this $4.2 trillion economy is slowly emerging from its third recession in a decade. 
 While the survey showed that pessimists still outnumber optimists, confidence is improving in corporate boardrooms, thanks to swelling demand overseas for Japanese autos, electronics and other finished goods.
In the June report, the index of the sentiments of managers of large manufacturers jumped a record 20 points, though it remained in negative territory, at minus 18. Many managers said they expected conditions to improve further in the next three months. 
After a bruising downturn following the collapse in spending on technology-related equipment, manufacturers said they expected sales to rise about 1 percent this fiscal year and profits to jump more than 30 percent.
Small companies and service providers, two groups that often feel the effects of a recovery later than large companies, were also less glum about their prospects, thanks to the renewed vigor of the country's name-brand exporters.
The surprisingly strong numbers added fuel to the rally in the yen, which has gained 11 percent against the dollar since April. The dollar fell about one-third of a yen in Tokyo trading today.
Despite today's promising report, the yen's strength shows that Japan's recovery is tenuous, said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Securities in Tokyo. "The recovery is entirely down to improving exports, and if the exchange rate moves up sharply, then renewed recession could follow," he said.
Companies surveyed by the Bank of Japan are basing their 2002 profit forecasts on the yen depreciating to near 126, although the dollar now buys about 119 yen. Companies will have to lower their bullish profit forecasts to compensate, economists said.
Japan has tried to temper the yen's rise for fear it may smother the recovery. Last week, finance officials in Japan, the United States and Europe sold yen to halt its rise.
The Bank of Japan also voiced concern that the yen's rise could derail the recovery, minutes from the bank's May 20-21 board meeting showed.
The other side of the yen's rise has been weakness in the dollar, which has sagged because of increasing doubts about the health of America's economy. In addition to the series of accounting scandals that have rocked Wall Street, sales at technology companies in the United States are still depressed, a condition that is casting a shadow over many Japanese companies.
"I can't read the outlook from July," said Koji Nishigaki, president of the NEC Corporation, a big maker of semiconductors and other electronics. "It looks like U.S. equipment makers have hit bottom and are not getting up."
Anticipating an uneven recovery, Japanese managers said that they would cut capital spending by more than 8 percent this year, the Tankan showed. Burdened with too many factories and bloated payrolls, companies continue to eliminate jobs, helping push the unemployment rate to a near-record 5.4 percent in May. With their jobs in doubt, Japanese are spending less on cars, homes and other expensive items. 
With consumers sitting tight, Japanese companies are unlikely to benefit from a turnaround at home, something that needs to happen for the current recovery to pick up speed. With that possibility still in doubt, managers have little choice but to pin their hopes on the rise in exports, analysts said.
"At best, people are saying that things aren't getting much worse," said Marshall Gittler, a strategist at Bank of America in Tokyo. By forecasting big gains in profits for this year, "managers are setting themselves up for disappointment."

HEADLINE: Pump Extends Lives, and Raises Questions 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: SUMTER, S.C. 

 BODY:
With tens of thousands of Americans dying of heart failure each year, and a dire shortage of donated human hearts, cardiologists have long dreamed of a device that could be permanently implanted in people too old or sick for a heart transplant. Now, the Food and Drug Administration is considering just such a machine. 
 It is a $60,000 heart pump that experts say may extend the lives of as many as 100,000 people a year. But the decision is generating social and economic questions: who should get the costly pumps, who should pay for them, and are they worth the expense? 
 Called left ventricular assist devices, or LVAD's, the implantable pumps have been used since 1998 to keep transplant patients alive while they await donor hearts. The F.D.A. is deciding whether to approve them as permanent implants, for what cardiologists are calling "destination therapy." 
Approval by the agency, which the pump's manufacturer expects within several months, would open a huge market for the devices and, proponents say, offer dying patients the closest thing to an artificial heart. But the pumps are hardly perfect; they often break, and some patients who receive them suffer fatal infections, while others die before ever leaving the hospital.
"What are we willing to pay for an extra year of life, and what quality of life are we giving these people?" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, who recently served on a committee of experts that voted 8 to 2 to recommend that the agency approve the devices.
The vote was based on a study that found that the implants kept dying heart patients alive for 408 days, as opposed to 150 days for patients receiving conventional drug therapy. But the committee also raised questions about the pumps' reliability. 
"I'm troubled by this," said Dr. Nissen, who cast one of the two dissenting votes, "and a lot of people are troubled by it."
One person who is not troubled is Sherri Selph, a 49-year-old patient who learned about the heart pump on the Internet and talked her way into the clinical trial. Three years ago, too weak from heart failure even to dress herself and too overweight to receive a donated heart, she signed what she calls "my death warrant," an order for doctors not to revive her if her heart gave out.
Today, the heart pump ticks away, 80 beats a minute, inside Mrs. Selph's chest. During the day, she wears a battery pack slung around her shoulders, holster style, that attaches to the pump through a line protruding from her abdomen. She plugs into a power charger at night. Her friends call her "the electric lady."
Most of Mrs. Selph's fellow study subjects have died, and Mrs. Selph is on her second pump; the first one broke. "Sure, it cost $100,000 to have the surgery to get this," she said. "But I've had almost no medical bills, compared to what I had before the pump. And it's kept me alive."
At a time when lawmakers in Washington are debating how to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare recipients, the pump controversy suggests that medical devices will also affect the cost of health care in the coming years.
"Everyone is concerned with the cost of drugs," said Dr. Roger Evans, a health care consultant and expert in the economics of organ transplants. "But that could be trivial compared to what we could do with devices."
Dr. Evans and other experts say the pump controversy recalls the debate in the early 1970's over whether Medicare should cover kidney dialysis, a treatment that has helped thousands of patients in what the government calls its end-stage renal disease program.
The program began in 1974 with about 600 patients. Once the government decided to pay for dialysis, its use skyrocketed. Over time the technology improved, extending people's lives for decades. Today, Dr. Evans said, the program covers more than 300,000 people, at a cost to taxpayers of roughly $12 billion a year, about 5 percent of what Medicare spends.
Should the heart pumps come into widespread use, Dr. Evans has calculated that insurers, including Medicare, would pay $15 billion to $24 billion a year for them, along with a relatively small amount for heart transplants.
Sensing the parallels to the dialysis debate, Dr. Eric Rose, chairman of the department of surgery at Columbia University and the heart study's principal investigator, took the unusual step of including a cost-benefit component in his experiment. Experts say that if this analysis finds heart pumps comparable in cost to dialysis, it will offer a compelling argument for coverage. 
"The skeptic would say, 'Look at end-stage renal disease -- it costs society a fortune,' " Dr. Rose said. "I would argue that the end-stage renal disease program is an absolute triumph of humanity."
To Dr. Rose, there is no question the pumps help patients. His study, a nationwide clinical trial, enrolled 129 patients from May 1998 through July 2001 in 20 cardiac transplant centers around the country. Sixty-eight patients received the pumps, while 61 were treated with medicine. At the end of two years, 23 percent of the pump patients were still alive, compared with 8 percent of those on drugs.
The study was partly financed by the National Institutes of Health, which has been investing heavily in heart device research since the early 1960's. The research has proceeded along two tracks: artificial hearts, which are now the subject of a continuing experiment, and the heart pumps, which work by taking over the left ventricle of the heart, its main pumping chamber, that pumps oxygen-rich blood from the lungs throughout the body.
"People have been paying their taxes to do this research for 40 years," Dr. Rose said. "Now that we have made progress are we going to turn our backs on it? It makes no sense."
Also at issue is which hospitals and which doctors will be able to offer the pump surgery, said Dr. Robert Kormos, director of the artificial heart program at the University of Pittsburgh. "This is a very complex procedure," Dr. Kormos said. "If you haven't got the background, you shouldn't dabble in it."
In the United States, three pumps are on the market as bridge-to-transplant devices. The one closest to receiving Food and Drug Administration approval for destination therapy is made by the Thoratec Corporation. Another company, the World Heart Corporation, will seek approval for a similar device.
The current European and American market for bridge-to-transplant pumps is $125 million to $150 million a year, said D. Keith Grossman, Thoratec's chief executive. If the devices come into widespread use as permanent implants, Mr. Grossman estimated, the market will grow to $6 billion to $8 billion a year.
Mr. Grossman said that even if Thoratec got only 1 percent of that business, its revenues would roughly double. "I think it will be a very, very big opportunity for this company," he said.
Anticipating F.D.A. approval, the company is waging an intense campaign to persuade Medicare officials to reimburse hospitals for the pumps, relying in part on recipients who by their very survival are making the case better than any medical expert.
Among them is Mrs. Selph, who told of her experience over a glass of iced tea one recent afternoon in the modest brick house where she lives with her husband, Danny, and the grandson they are rearing, Keith.
In 1994, Mrs. Selph, then a district manager for a chain of convenience stores, learned she had congestive heart failure. Doctors recommended a heart transplant, but she said she was nervous and not convinced that she needed one. As her condition worsened, she put on weight, and by 1999, she said, she weighed 233 pounds, 43 pounds over the limit for a new heart.
"At that point, they didn't give me six months," Mrs. Selph said.
On Oct. 29, 1999, a Friday, surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham sliced Mrs. Selph's chest open, from neck to navel, and implanted the device. By Tuesday, she said, "I was walking up a flight of stairs, just to see if I could do it."
Still, she is not back to normal. Mrs. Selph can no longer go camping, which she loves, or swim in her backyard pool, or bowl -- her arm gets caught on the battery pack when she tries to release the ball. She cannot leave the house alone for fear her batteries will go bad and she will not be able to get help. It takes her "a good 30 minutes and a lot of aggravation" to get ready for the shower, she said.
But these, she says, are minor inconveniences.
"I feel like this is the reason I'm here, to test this pump," Mrs. Selph said. "It's like that was my calling."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND; 
In Stamford

BYLINE:  By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
Yale & Towne, originally a lock manufacturing company, put Stamford, Conn., on the business map in the 1840's and was a major economic presence for over 100 years. In the 20th century, manufacturing gave way to commerce, and by the late 1960's, the first corporate offices appeared in the city's central core.
 Today Stamford is home to a handful of Fortune 500 companies -- including Pitney Bowes, Xerox and International Paper -- as well as to Clairol, GE Capital and many others. UBS Warburg, a Swiss investment banking firm that set up its American headquarters here in 1997, is now the city's largest employer, with more than 4,000 workers, and has the world's largest trading floor. A $280 million waterfront development called Admirals Wharf will provide additional office buildings and housing as well as high-speed ferry service to Manhattan. 
 That is a lot of corporate activity for a city of 117,000 on Long Island Sound, 35 miles from New York City.
Stamford's economic vigor is reflected in the unemployment rate, generally two or three percentage points below the national average. And its fleet of yellow-shirted "ambassadors" with walkie-talkies who roam the streets on bikes to give directions, recommend restaurants and fix flat tires help make the city's crime rate one of the nation's lowest.

HOTELS
All four major hotels in Stamford have recently been renovated and offer full-service amenities: swimming pools, gyms, high-speed Internet access and shuttle buses.
The STAMFORD MARRIOTT (203-357-9555, $249-$269) offers a "female-friendly floor" with makeup mirrors in the rooms. There's a running track on the roof, and the Northern Lights Bar makes martinis with Godiva chocolate liquor. The Marriott and the HOLIDAY INN SELECT (203-358-8400, $179 to $235), which has a pool table in its Bristol Cafe, are the best bets within walking distance of downtown.
For a relaxed atmosphere, try the WESTIN (203-967-2222, $129 to $334) where twinkling candles fill the open lobby in the evening. If you stay at the SHERATON STAMFORD (203-359-1300, $259) you can jog in Scalzi Park.
A few miles down the road in Greenwich, HOMESTEAD INN (203-869-7500, $250 to $495), built in the late 1700's, has just 19 rooms, each with its own decor. Last year, it gained membership in the Relais and Chateaux group, and you can impress clients by holding a meeting around the conference room's 18th- century French oak farm table and taking them to the four-star restaurant afterward.

DINING
The downtown's 15-block radius percolates with some 75 restaurants, from Southwestern to Asian fusion. Recent regulations allowed sidewalk cafes, and now they are everywhere. On Thursday nights in the summer, live music fills the air.
ZANGHI ON SUMMER STREET (203-327-3663, $40 for two for lunch, $120 for two for dinner, including tip and wine) is hot right now. Kathy Cullin, president of Puig USA, a fragrance and personal-care company in New York City who lives in Stamford, likes the uniquely prepared food, while Richard Taber, the chief executive of First County Bank, likes the quiet after hours. "I can hear who I'm talking to," he said.
BANK STREET (203-325-2739, $30 for lunch), in an 89-year-old former bank, serves light American fare and beer brewed on the premises under a domed, stained-glass ceiling.
Robin Hogen, executive director of public affairs at Purdue Pharma, says he likes the "sympatique" atmosphere at TELLURIDE (203-357-7679, $110 for dinner), its proximity to business destinations and its excellent menu and fast service. "They cater to businesspeople," he said. "You can get in and out quickly."
For waterfront dining, try BEACON RESTAURANT AND BAR (203-327-4600, $100), featuring open-fire cooking. And the LANDMARK CLUB (203-348-7381, $125), a private club on the 22nd floor of Stamford's tallest building, offers views of the city, the water and the Manhattan skyline (and a telescope for guests to take it all in) and serves dinner to the public on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

ENTERTAINMENT
The RICH FORUM and PALACE THEATER at the Stamford Center for the Arts (203-325-4466) offer plenty of opera, ballet, theater and jazz September through June. Sports fans can unwind at BOBBY VALENTINE'S SPORTS GALLERY CAFE (203-348-0010), a "good place to get a burger, watch the game and kick back and talk sports," according to Mr. Taber, the banker. Serious drinkers can tuck into an Irish breakfast any time of the day, or order traditional Irish fare like bangers and mash, at the TIGIN IRISH PUB (203-353-8444), which was dismantled and shipped to this country from Ireland. In warm weather, FJORD CATERING AND CHARTERS (203-622-4020) offers twice-a-week dinner cruises, and in any season you can enjoy Sunday brunch cruises or charter a boat for business conferences.

ON YOUR OWN
You can get a quick shave, haircut and shoeshine at MONTANA FOR MEN (203-964-1234), and a massage at NOELLE SPA FOR BEAUTY AND WELLNESS (203-322-3445).
Outside, it would be hard to miss "IMAGES OF URBAN LIFE," a summer exhibit of 25 sculptures by J. Seward Johnson Jr. that are sprinkled along the streets and in the parks. ATLANTIC SQUARE across from the Old Town Hall is great for people watching. To shop for an unusual gift, swing by UNITED HOUSE WRECKING (203-348-5371) for that vintage mantelpiece or antique lamp.

HEADLINE: The Market Can Transform Our Schools 

BYLINE:  By Milton Friedman; Milton Friedman, the 1976 recipient of the Nobel Prize in economics, is a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court's voucher decision clears the way for a major expansion of parental school choice. Opponents of choice can no longer use the First Amendment's religious Establishment Clause to attack voucher programs, now that the Supreme Court has declared the Cleveland program constitutionally acceptable even though most voucher recipients went to parochial schools.
 The state of Ohio provided vouchers worth up to $2,250 to low-income parents in Cleveland who chose to send their children to private schools that charge them tuition of no more than $2,500 per child. The voucher was offered as an alternative to government schooling costing nearly three times as much per student. Yet some 4,000 low-income parents still found the private alternative preferable -- enough so to pay 10 percent of private school tuition out of their own pockets. What an indictment of government schools. 
 Most schools that accept vouchers are religious for a simple reason, and one that is easily corrected. That reason is the low value of the voucher. It is not easy, perhaps not possible, to provide a satisfactory education for $2,500 per student. Most private schools spend more than that. But parochial schools are able to accept that low voucher amount because they are subsidized by their churches. 
Raise the voucher amount to $7,000 -- the sum that Ohio state and local governments now spend per child in government schools -- and make it available to all students, not simply to students from low-income families, and most private schools accepting vouchers would no longer be religious. A host of new nonprofit and for-profit schools would emerge. Voucher-bearing students would then be less dependent on low-tuition parochial schools.
Parents would then truly have a choice, and the quality of schooling -- in both public and private schools -- would soar as competition worked its magic. This has happened in Milwaukee, where the voucher program has evolved over the past 10 years. Since that program's creation, 37 new schools have opened, nearly two-thirds of them nonreligious.
Assumption of responsibility by government for educating all children does not require that schooling be delivered in government-run institutions -- just as government food stamps need not be spent in government grocery stores.
Besides, an emphasis on school choice is not new, even in public programs. The G.I. Bill enacted at the end of World War II demonstrates how well choice can work. That program provided vouchers for higher education -- for use in religious and nonreligious institutions -- to millions of veterans; it transformed higher education and provided the educational leadership that has played a major role in political and economic change in the postwar period.
When the G.I. Bill was enacted, doubts were expressed that the colleges could expand rapidly enough to handle the flood of new students. Yet the number of students enrolled in colleges nearly doubled in the two years after the end of the war. The supply expanded to meet the surge in demand.
The market will respond as fully and rapidly to the increased demand for private schools generated by the expansion of vouchers for elementary and secondary education. Private voucher programs, financed by foundations and individuals, plus the limited government programs so far enacted have already brought forth a market response.
School vouchers can push elementary and secondary education out of the 19th century and into the 21st by introducing market competition on a broad scale, just as competition has made progress possible in every other area of economic and civic life.
The biggest winner from such an educational revolution would be American society as a whole. A better schooled work force promises higher productivity and more rapid economic growth. Even more important, improved education could help narrow the income gap between the less skilled and more skilled workers and would fend off the prospect of a society divided between the haves and have-nots, of a society in which an educated elite provides for a permanent class of unemployables.

HEADLINE: Collateral Costs in Fighting a New Court 

BYLINE:  By Paddy Ashdown; Paddy Ashdown, former head of the Liberal Democrat party in Britain, is high representative of the international community in Bosnia and responsible for implementation of the Dayton peace accords.

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina 

 BODY:
Since taking over the job of leading the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina a month ago, I've been struck by two things: how much has been achieved since the war and how much work remains. That work could soon become a lot more difficult.
 Why? Unless the United Nations mandate for Bosnia and Herzegovina is renewed by the Security Council by tomorrow -- which depends on the Bush administration rescinding the veto it issued on Sunday -- the international community will have to revise its strategy for helping this country. We all want success here in Bosnia and Herzegovina, no country more so than the United States. But a failure to renew the United Nations mandate will put that success a little further away, particularly in terms of law-enforcement training that is central to removing terrorists and organized crime from Bosnia. 
 The reasons for the disagreement in New York have nothing to do with Bosnia. (American troops will remain here as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military stabilization force -- at 18,000 members, a much larger group than the United Nations' 1,500-person contingent, of which just 46 are American.) The Security Council quarrel over the International Criminal Court is not a matter for my office, but the consequences of a failure to agree on a way forward are.
Should the mandate not be extended, the United Nations mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina would have to pull out. That mission has a particular responsibility for training local police forces so they serve all the communities of this country impartially. This is a vital part of bringing law and order back to a war-torn country and giving refugees the confidence to return to the houses they were forced out of by paramilitary thugs. 
Early withdrawal of the United Nations mission would rush the transition from the International Police Task Force to the European Union police mission, scheduled for the end of this year, and make it much harder to achieve the next stage in our work with the police here: tackling organized crime.
The fight against organized crime is at the top of the international agenda for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sixty percent of the drugs entering Western Europe pass through the Balkans. Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants also come this way. There is evidence that organized crime syndicates and terrorist organizations exploit the absence of law and order by operating out of Bosnia.
If we see our job through properly, I see no reason for the international community to remain here for another seven years. We have achieved a huge amount since the war ended. Today, more than 850,000 refugees and displaced persons have registered as residents in the municipalities they were forced to flee during the war. Significant progress has been made in professionalizing the armed forces and the police. Work has begun on implementing a nationwide education syllabus that turns schools into places of reconciliation rather than nationalist indoctrination. There is a stable currency, almost no inflation and a profitable commercial banking system. Gross domestic product in 2000 and 2001 grew by around 5 percent, despite a decline in aid flows.
My goal here is to wind down the interventionist peace-building process of the postwar years, with its major North Atlantic Treaty Organization military component, and to help bring about a more normal presence based on extensive engagement by the European Union and private investors. In a few years' time there will be no more need for soldiers and international bureaucrats like me. Instead, I hope Sarajevo will be full of bankers and businessmen, the sort of people we increasingly see in all the other capitals of southeastern and central Europe.
A successful and prosperous country, increasingly integrated into Europe: This is the future for Bosnia and Herzegovina. But it will only arrive if we in the international community see the job through.

HEADLINE: Study Warns of Stagnation in Arab Societies 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
A blunt new report by Arab intellectuals commissioned by the United Nations warns that Arab societies are being crippled by a lack of political freedom, the repression of women and an isolation from the world of ideas that stifles creativity.
 The survey, the Arab Human Development Report 2002, will be released today in Cairo. 
 The report notes that while oil income has transformed the landscapes of some Arab countries, the region remains "richer than it is developed." Per capita income growth has shrunk in the last 20 years to a level just above that of sub-Saharan Africa. Productivity is declining. Research and development are weak or nonexistent. Science and technology are dormant. 
Intellectuals flee a stultifying -- if not repressive -- political and social environment, it says.
Arab women, the report found, are almost universally denied advancement. Half of them still cannot read or write. The maternal mortality rate is double that of Latin America and four times that of East Asia.
"Sadly, the Arab world is largely depriving itself of the creativity and productivity of half its citizens," the report concluded.
An advisory team of well-known Arabs in international public life was assembled to oversee the study. They included Thoraya Obaid, a Saudi who is executive director of the United Nations Population Fund; Mervat Tallawy, an Egyptian diplomat who heads the Economic and Social Council for West Asia; and Clovis Maksoud, who directs the Center for the Global South at American University in Washington and was formerly the Arab League's representative at the United Nations.
A team of nearly 30 authorities in various fields, including sociologists, economists and experts on Arab culture presented papers. A core group drawn from these authors and representing a wide variety of Middle Eastern and Arab majority African nations then completed the report.
Nader Fergany, a labor economist and director of the Almishkat Center for Research in Egypt, was chosen as the lead author. The report was published in Arabic, English and French, with an editorial team in each language. Women were represented at all stages of the formulation and writing of the report.
Planning for the report "started over a year ago, when we thought that there was a serious development problem in the Arab countries," Rima Khalaf Hunaidi, director of the United Nations Development Program's Arab regional bureau and the driving force behind the survey, said in an interview in her New York office. "There were some very scary signals that were specific to Arab countries and not other regions."
Then came the attacks on the United States, giving the report unexpected new relevance as explanations for Arab anger against the West are being sought. 
The report, the first United Nations human development report devoted to a single region, was prepared by Arab intellectuals from a variety of disciplines, who do not fault others for what they see as the "deficits" in contemporary Arab culture, Ms. Khalaf Hunaidi said.
Ms. Khalaf Hunaidi, 49, a former deputy prime minister of Jordan who led its economic policy team, said that she had asked the authors, "to come and look at this problem and decide: Why is Arab culture, why are Arab countries lagging behind?"
"It's not outsiders looking at Arab countries," she said. "It's Arabs deciding for themselves."
There are 280 million people in the 22 Arab countries covered by the report, which was co-sponsored by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, a development finance institution set up by members of the Arab League. The number of Arabs is expected to grow to between 410 million and 459 million by 2020.
For the Palestinians in particular, the report says, human development is all but impossible under Israeli occupation. Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict "has been a cause and a pretext for delaying democratic change," contended Ms. Khalaf Hunaidi, who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents. She studied at the American University of Beirut and Portland State University in Oregon, where she received a doctorate in systems science.
The report does not directly criticize Islamic militancy and its effects on intellectual and economic growth, although Ms. Khalaf Hunaidi said this was implicit in passages that refer to a less tolerant social environment.
Despite growing populations, the standard of living in Arab countries on the whole has advanced considerably. Life expectancy is longer than the world average of 67 years, the report noted. The level of abject poverty is the world's lowest. Education spending is higher than elsewhere in the developing world.
But the use of the Internet is low. Filmmaking appears to be declining. The authors also describe a "severe shortage" of new writing and a dearth of translations of works from outside. "The whole Arab world translates about 330 books annually, one-fifth the number that Greece translates," the report said. In the 1,000 years since the reign of the Caliph Mamoun, it concludes, the Arabs have translated as many books as Spain translates in just one year.
Laila Abou-Saif, an Egyptian writer and theater director whose theater in Cairo was closed in 1979 after she produced a play that satirized polygamy, said in an interview that the Islamic factor must be acknowledged in explaining the condition of the Arab world, which was a center of arts and sciences.
Ms. Abou-Saif, a Coptic Christian who now lives in the United States, said that creativity among Arabs now often hewed to religious themes.
Books are not being translated, in part because of Islamic pressures, said Ms. Abou-Saif, the author of "Middle East Journal: A Woman's Journey Into the Heart of the Arab World" (Scribner, 1990). "A whole gamut of religious literature are best sellers," she said.
Fouad Ajami, director of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University and the author, most recently, of "The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation's Odyssey" (Vintage Books, 1999) said in an interview that there is a pervasive sense that life in the Arab world is repressed by both the state and religious vigilantes.
"Arabs today feel monitored," he said, attributing a decrease in intellectual freedom to the growing power of a lower middle class whose members are literate but not broadly educated.
This group shows "its lack of hospitality to anyone of free spirit, anyone who is a dissident, anyone who is different," he said.
Mr. Ajami said that for many Arab intellectuals the only option has been exile. "There is a deep, deep nostalgia today in the Arab world," he said. "Societies looking ahead and feeling a positive movement never succumb to nostalgia." 
Above all, there is no movement in politics, he said. Rulers, even elected, stay in power for life and create dynasties. "People just don't know how to overthrow, how to reform, how to change them."

HEADLINE: Bolivian Congress to Decide Tight Presidential Election 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, July 1 

 BODY:
Bolivian voters, frustrated with economic turbulence and grinding poverty, supported an unusually diverse array of politicians in presidential balloting on Sunday, shaking up traditional politics in the country's most important election in 20 years of democracy.
 Exit surveys early today gave Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a former president and pro-market reformer, a razor-thin edge over Manfred Reyes Villa, a populist former mayor of the country's third-largest city, Cochabamba. 
 But voters also gave unexpected support to the leftist leader of the coca farmers, Evo Morales, who favors nationalizing private companies and often criticizes the United States government for its involvement in Bolivian affairs.
None of the 11 presidential candidates came close to the majority of more than 50 percent needed to win outright. Mr. Sanchez received 22 percent of the vote, according to the exit polls, and Mr. Reyes received 21 percent. 
As a result, the senators and representatives elected on Sunday will choose a president from the two front-runners. The official vote count is expected to continue for some days, and the decision-making process in Congress could last through July. The winner is to be inaugurated on Aug. 6.
Other longtime players in Bolivian politics, like the governing Nationalist Democratic Action party and the left-leaning Condepa party, fared poorly. "This signifies a big change in the party system," said Carlos Toranzo, a leading analyst here. "What we have is a new map of Bolivia's political parties."
The presidential contest now depends on bargaining among the strongest parties in Congress, a process that favors Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, since his National Revolutionary Movement won at least 11 of the 27 seats in the Senate and one-third of the seats in the 130-member lower house.
Whoever becomes president, analysts say, must put together a coalition representative of this multicultural country, where 50 percent of the 8.3 million people speak an indigenous tongue.
"If this new government is not going to be able to be more inclusive, then there's going to be a lot more turbulence," warned Elizabeth Spehar, who is overseeing an electoral observer mission for the Organization of American States.
Bolivia has been hit hard by a three-year recession and growing social unrest. Many people say the country's 17-year experiment with pro-market reforms, including privatizing government agencies and opening the economy to foreign investment, have done little for most people. 
Coca farmers, often led by Mr. Morales, have protested forcefully against Washington-led efforts to eradicate coca plantations.
Both Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, who was president from 1993 to 1997, and Mr. Reyes Villa, a former army captain, have expressed a willingness to work with other parties. But it remains doubtful that Mr. Morales will support either man.
Mr. Morales, who was expelled from Congress last year after he was accused of instigating violence among coca farmers, has called the traditional parties and their leaders corrupt. The platform of his party, the Movement Toward Socialism, is far different from their programs, arguing for the end of coca eradication efforts and market reforms.
"The other parties need not waste their time talking to us about an alliance," Mr. Morales said. "We will not negotiate our vote with the thieves and the corrupt ones."
That presents problems for any future president, because his party took 6 seats in the Senate and 25 in the lower house. 
Analysts say Mr. Morales benefited from a speech on Wednesday by the United States ambassador, Manuel Rocha, who told Bolivians that voting for Mr. Morales could jeopardize aid from Washington and access to American markets. The comments infuriated many here.
Mr. Morales is not seen by political observers as a one-issue phenomenon. He has the support of intellectuals, many union workers and others who reject the market reforms.
"What you have here is something very strong and new that has to do with everything that is happening in Latin America," Mr. Toranzo said.

HEADLINE: Democratic Senator to Bow Out, Fueling Hopes for a G.O.P. Gain 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 1 

 BODY:
State Senator Richard A. Dollinger, an outspoken Rochester Democrat, said today that he would not seek re-election in the fall, increasing the likelihood that the Republicans might pick up a seat in Monroe County.
 Mr. Dollinger, a liberal Democrat known for his passionate debating style, said he was dropping out because he would have to raise more than $500,000 to compete against the candidate being backed by the Senate's Republican majority. He said the money would have to come from big business and other "special interests" determined "to preserve the outdated and antiquated Albany power structure." 
 "I can no longer justify participating in that system," he said.
Mr. Dollinger, a lawyer from Brighton, N.Y., first won office in 1992. This year, he faced an unusual challenge from a former Democrat, Assemblyman Joseph E. Robach, who agreed in May to run for the Senate seat on the Republican ticket.
Mr. Robach, a conservative who sides with the Republicans on some issues, is receiving the full backing of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. Along with that endorsement comes a hefty infusion of money from the Senate majority's campaign fund.
Mr. Robach said he intended to join the Republican Party if he won. He said party loyalty meant less to him than bringing more money into his district for economic development and health care. "Whether they want to call me a traditional Democrat or a moderate Republican, it doesn't matter to me," he said.
Mr. Robach, a career public servant whose father was also a member of the Assembly, is a formidable candidate in the Charlotte neighborhood of Rochester, where he grew up, and in the town of Greece, where he lives. He decided to switch parties because much of that base was excised from his district during redistricting. It remained unclear last night whom the Democrats would find to face him.
Mr. Dollinger came to the Senate as an idealistic reformer, and he relished the role of loyal opposition. On the floor, he was known for questioning each bill sponsor persistently about the ramifications of major legislation and delivering passionate speeches justifying his vote. He acknowledged today that he had been worn down by the relative powerlessness of the Democratic minority.
"I can't deny part of me says life in the minority in the State Legislature is not a piece of cake," he said. "It's difficult to stand every day and highlight deficiencies in bills."
Mr. Dollinger said he might run for a judgeship, but his career in legislative politics was over.

PERSON: Frederick O'R. Hayes 

HEADLINE: Frederick O'R. Hayes, 78, Top Lindsay Aide 

BYLINE:  By ARI L. GOLDMAN 

 BODY:
Frederick O'R. Hayes, New York City's budget director for four years in the early, optimistic days of the administration of John V. Lindsay, died on Sunday in Utica, N.Y. He was 78 and lived in Utica.
 The cause was cancer of the esophagus, his family said. 
 Mr. Hayes came to New York City to join the Lindsay administration in 1966 from Washington, where he was a rising star in the Bureau of the Budget. He joined Lindsay's inner circle, which attracted bright and accomplished idealists from around the country who wanted to solve the problems of the inner city. 
Over the years, as the city's finances began to deteriorate, Mr. Hayes became a strong advocate for state and federal aid to cities, saying that the cities could not bear the burdens of poverty and municipal services alone.
Later, when he left government for a career in consulting and teaching, Mr. Hayes continued to defend the Lindsay administration against charges that its spending and accounting practices led the city to the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970's.
"The fiscal problems of 1974," he wrote last year, "were rooted not in 15 years of mismanagement but in the unexpectedly large decline in city revenues in 1970 and later years that resulted from the severe recession in the local economy that began in 1968 or 1969."
Frederick O'Reilly Hayes was born in Utica on Oct. 4, 1923. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and earned two advanced degrees from Harvard.
He spent three years in finance jobs for New York State government before going to Washington, where for 10 years he was an economist at the Bureau of the Budget, which later became the Office of Management and Budget.
In 1964, Mr. Hayes joined President Lyndon B. Johnson's task force on the war on poverty, where he was a senior member of the group that developed the Community Action Program. After the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, Mr. Hayes joined the newly created Office of Economic Opportunity under Sargent Shriver.
When Mayor Lindsay came calling in 1966, Mr. Hayes at first hesitated, concerned that the Johnson administration would not be happy about his working for a leading Republican figure like Lindsay. But the lure of a senior position in New York on Lindsay's team was in the end too strong and Mr. Hayes made the move.
He was generally given credit for modernizing the city's Bureau of the Budget, introducing cost-effectiveness analysis as a basis for budget and policy decisions in the operating agencies as well as at the budget bureau.
In the first two years of his four as director, Mr. Hayes managed to balance the city budget without borrowing to cover deficits. In the third year, the budget was balanced from reserves accumulated in the first two years. In the years that followed, the recession, coupled with rising expenses, led to the city financial crisis of the 1970's.
Mr. Hayes was especially proud of the young people whom he helped bring into government, including Peter C. Goldmark Jr., chairman and chief executive of the International Herald Tribune, who had an earlier career in government. "Fred was my mentor, that magical early boss who teaches you the important values, gives you your head, backs you through your early mistakes," Mr. Goldmark said.
After he left city government in 1970, Mr. Hayes became a consultant on public policy and management issues.
Mr. Hayes is survived by his wife of 53 years, Ann; three children, Sara of Oakland, Calif., Reilly F. of Mill Valley, Calif., and Christopher R. of Washington; and one grandchild. He also leaves two sisters, Alice Gorton of Utica and Sarah Cunningham of New Hartford, N.Y.; and two brothers, Richard and Peter, both of Utica.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Range of Fears Pushes Stocks To Big Losses

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply yesterday, led by technology shares, pushing the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in more than five years on worries about additional accounting scandals, new terrorist attacks and the true health of the economy. 
 It was a day of dismal superlatives. 
 The sell-off in the Nasdaq pushed the index back through its post-Sept. 11 floor to its lowest level since June 10, 1997. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is nearing its September low, opened the third quarter with its biggest loss in a month. The Dow Jones industrial average was also punished, though it closed at a level that is still a good distance above its Sept. 21 low. 
And WorldCom became the first American stock to trade more than a billion shares in a single session. The share price dropped 93 percent on news that WorldCom had told the Securities and Exchange Commission that its accounting irregularities might stretch as far back as 1999, or two years earlier than previously disclosed.
By the close, the Nasdaq fell 59.41 points, or 4.1 percent, to 1,403.80. Only three of its biggest companies moved higher. So far this year, the index is down 28 percent.
The S.& P. 500 fell 21.17 points, or 2.1 percent, to 968.65, the steepest one-day drop since June 3. Computer-related stocks and pharmaceutical companies accounted for half the decline. And the Dow fell 133.47, or 1.4 percent, to 9,109.79, dragged down by big declines in I.B.M., General Motors and J. P. Morgan Chase. 
Stocks began to weaken soon after a government report in the morning showed a sharp drop in construction spending during May. Talk of a terrorist attack on or about the July 4 holiday began circulating, as did rumors about which company would be the next to report serious accounting irregularities. 
"In this market, the one-eyed man is king," said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock market research firm from Stamford, Conn. "The difference between the bear market in the 1970's and this one is that then the concerns and fears were much more visible. Today, there is an awful lot of 'could be' and 'might be.' " 
WorldCom-related concerns hit Electronic Data Systems after the company said problems at WorldCom, which is an E.D.S. client, would hurt profits. Shares of E.D.S. fell $6.70, to a four-year low of $30.45.
I.B.M., which was criticized for not properly accounting for the sale of a subsidiary to JDS Uniphase late last year, gave investors more details about the deal yesterday but was still punished. I.B.M. lost $4.40, to $67.60.
G.M. dropped $2.63, to $50.82, and Morgan Chase fell $2.56, to $31.36.
"It was a pretty weird day," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "The economic and corporate earnings fundamentals are definitely improving. What is not improving at all is investors' confidence. Right now equity investors are scared to death." 
Drug stocks were among the chief losers. Johnson & Johnson fell $1.76, to $50.50, after the Food and Drug Administration denied approval for an injected twice-a-month form of a popular medicine for schizophrenia. Eli Lilly tumbled for a second day, sliding $2.64, to $53.76. Merck lost $1.89, to $48.75. The company put off for the second time in less than a week its planned $1 billion initial offering of Medco Health Solutions.
In one of the few positive developments, 3M shares jumped $4.40, to $127.40, after the company said second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating analysts' expectations. 
Tyco International, which has been struggling with its own scandal, advanced 24 cents, to $13.75. An initial public offering of its CIT finance unit raised $4.6 billion, less than the $5 billion that had been expected. Tyco shares are down 77 percent since the start of the year. 
Just more than 1.5 billion WorldCom shares changed hands yesterday. The stock plunged 77 cents, to 6 cents, after the company said in a report filed with the S.E.C. that its audit committee was reviewing booking for "reserve accounts" during 2000 and 1999. 
Some market analysts saw some good in all the bad news. 
"It's good we are back to the September lows," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "At least that issue now is behind us." 
"I think we are getting close to a bounce" in the market, he added. "We have brought stocks down 15 percent or more since March. At the same time, 10-year bond yields have fallen from 5.08 percent to 4.75 percent or so. I think we are getting close to a bond yield level that will hopefully lift the equity market." --------------------

Treasury Prices Increase
By Bloomberg News
Treasuries gained again as a tumble in stocks spurred demand for the safety of fixed-rate government securities. 
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased 6/32 , to 100 22/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.78 percent from 4.81 percent on Friday. 
The 30-year bond rose 15/32 , to 98 16/32 . Its yield dropped to 5.48 percent from 5.51 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. vs. U.N. Court: Two Worldviews 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
The showdown between the United States and other members of the United Nations Security Council was the latest and strongest confirmation that the international solidarity forged after the terror attacks on Sept. 11 was probably superficial and temporary.
 The immediate issue at the United Nations was Washington's demand that American troops and all other United Nations peacekeeping forces be exempted from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which came into existence today under the shadow of intense hostility from the Bush administration. 
 Unless either the United States or other Council members back down before midnight Wednesday, the United Nations police-training mission in Bosnia will be abruptly terminated. If the standoff continues, all other United Nations peacekeeping operations will be jeopardized as they come up for renewal, starting with the mission in Lebanon later this month. 
The immediate impact in Bosnia was likely to be largely organizational. Only 46 Americans serve in the police-training mission, and the entire operation was to be turned over to the European Union in six months.
But the very notion of Americans threatening to pull forces out of Europe in a dispute, even if symbolic, carried troubling connotations on a Continent where the American presence had represented a shared commitment for decades. 
Even if all parties involved heed a call from Secretary General Kofi Annan and find a solution for the peacekeeping missions, the very fact that the United States cast a defiant veto in the teeth of its closest allies -- and that Britain and France were prepared to do likewise against Washington -- spoke of sharp differences and a growing mutual irritation.
At the heart of the divergence was a fundamentally different vision of global organizations. The Europeans, accustomed by their history and geography to think in terms of multilateral arrangements, have always placed a greater premium on international organizations. To them, the end of the cold war brought an era for building international institutions and a global justice system, of which the European Union was the shining example.
In the United States, international organizations like the United Nations have always been viewed with suspicion, much of it affirmed by the anti-American and anti-Israeli votes of the cold war. The emergence of the United States as the sole military, economic and cultural superpower has only deepened the resistance, especially among American conservatives, to any potential international restraints on American powers.
"An 800-pound gorilla just doesn't like anything to restrict its freedom of action, unless it thinks it can control it completely," said Stephen M. Walt, professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School at Harvard. 
Beyond that, Professor Walt said, there was a sincere fear among many American officials that Americans engaged in military or other operations overseas could become subject to politicized prosecution. "The fairly extensive role the U.S. military has taken around the world makes it leery of being tried by a tribunal whose standards we can't control," he said.
For the Europeans, however, the American stand amounts to a double standard: one set of rules for the United States, another for the rest of the world. Several stands taken by the United States since the end of the cold war -- against the Kyoto Protocols on greenhouse gases, against biological weapons testing, against a ban on land mines -- have especially irritated the Europeans.
"There you see the beginning of a real problem," said a senior European diplomat at the United Nations. "If the U.S. says we are from a different nature, we cannot be compared with others, discipline is good for others, but not for the United States, then the future of humanity is at stake. If the United States believes it doesn't need to respect multilateralism and international rules, how do you get China to respect them?"
The tensions were already there long before Sept. 11. But in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks, most of the world lined up in solidarity behind the United States, and the Security Council passed resolutions requiring all United Nations members to act against terrorism.
Many members hoped that the United States would become more active in multilateral organizations out of a recognition that terrorism was a universal problem requiring international effort. That sense began to erode when the United States made clear that it intended to prosecute the war on its own terms. 
In the vote on the Bosnia mission, the conflicting perceptions came to a head. The Europeans saw the Americans as trying to undermine a prime example of the new world order, the International Criminal Court, which was created to take action if local authorities failed to prosecute especially heinous war crimes, human rights violations or genocide. 
The United States saw a confirmation of a world deaf to America's genuine needs and concerns. 
The contest began in May, when the Bush administration formally gave notice that it would not abide by President Clinton's signature on the Rome treaty creating the court. That month, The United States demanded that a resolution extending the United Nations force in East Timor include immunity from international prosecution. The Security Council refused, and Washington gave way.
This time, when the Bosnia resolution came up, no one blinked.
For the Europeans, the issue is the sense that the Bush administration was actively trying to curtail a court that they regarded as a major achievement in the struggle for global justice and human rights, issues on which the United States regarded itself as the global standard.

Cingular Wireless arrives late in New York, but comes bearing orange umbrellas and M&M's.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
CINGULAR WIRELESS is hoping that its risky and expensive effort to break into the crowded New York market will be received more like the return of the Dodgers to Brooklyn than the resumption of alternate-side-of-the-street parking after a holiday weekend.
 Cingular, the nation's second-largest provider of wireless telephone services, plans to spend about $20 million on the extensive effort. The campaign, which begins this week with elements that include print advertisements, commercials, a dedicated Web site, promotions and retail marketing, is tailored to the tastes and "all right, already" tone of New Yorkers. 
 New York icons like taxicabs, subway tokens, the Statue of Liberty, pizzas and manhole covers will play prominent roles in the ads, along with sayings like "We would have been here earlier, but we got stuck in traffic." 
The campaign's budget would be hefty for a national campaign, the equivalent of what Chrysler spent last year to advertise its Voyager minivans, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending. But such lavish spending on so elaborate a campaign is necessary, according to executives at Cingular and its agency, BBDO Worldwide, because New York is the country's biggest wireless market and is already home to Cingular's principal national competitors, among them AT&T Wireless; Nextel; Sprint; Verizon, which is the biggest wireless provider; and VoiceStream.
"New York is a 'go big or go home' market, so you're not going to miss us," said Daryl Evans, vice president for advertising and marketing communications at Cingular.
The entry into the New York area comes 18 months after the introduction of the Cingular brand by the BellSouth Corporation and SBC Communications to replace 11 regional brands like BellSouth Mobility and Pacific Bell Wireless. Cingular, which is based in Atlanta, and now operates in 43 of the 50 biggest metropolitan areas, spent $411.3 million nationally last year, according to CMR. By comparison, Verizon spent $644.2 million on its national ads and AT&T Wireless spent $522.4 million, CMR reported.
Typically, to arrive so late to a marketing party is injurious, even fatal, to the prospects for a brand to survive, much less thrive. However, the lengthy lag for Cingular may not be as disadvantageous in wireless services as it would in categories like packaged goods.
"Even though the New York market is very dominated by AT&T Wireless and Verizon, if Cingular can sufficiently differentiate itself, there is an opportunity there," said Knox Bricken, senior analyst for the wireless communications practice at the Yankee Group, a consulting company in Boston.
"New Yorkers are known to be demanding in terms of the quality of service they receive in wireless," she added, particularly in the realms of coverage and price. So a newcomer could be welcomed by disgruntled New Yorkers who have already found other carriers wanting or are looking for the hottest new product.
In interviews last week, the executives at Cingular and BBDO, a division of the Omnicom Group that is handling the Cingular account from its Atlanta and New York offices, said they had developed the campaign with those distinctions in mind.
"Wireless phones are part of the fabric of New York, and most people in the market have them," Mr. Evans of Cingular said. "Something we recognize is that New York is a 'switcher' market, which brings to the fore the type of products we sell, the type of innovations we offer and the attitude we have."
So, for example, the campaign plays up a promotional offer of a new Motorola handset, the V70 model, which is billed as "now in New York, only from Cingular." The ads rewrite the national campaign's focus on "self-expression" to proclaim, "The company that champions self-expression nationwide is now in the most expressive city on earth."
"Attitudinally, it's very New York-oriented, as it should be," said Charlie Miesmer, vice chairman and senior executive creative director at BBDO New York. "And the more humorous you get, the better it works."
"If this were any other city, we'd be worried" by the head start the competition has attained, he added, "but we're the talking-est city on earth."
As part of its marketing push, Cingular plans to open 55 stores this month in metropolitan New York, with another 45 by the end of the year. The flagship store is at 575 Fifth Avenue, at 47th Street, designed to resemble a cafe, complete with upholstered chairs and a so-called Live Bar where products and services can be sampled.
There will also be attention-getting promotions like giveaways of packages of M&M's in the Cingular orange color, orange Cingular umbrellas on rainy days and make-believe business cards with snappy sayings by Jack, the stylized dotted X that is the Cingular brand symbol. Some examples: "Want to find tickets to 'The Producers'? Me too." and "Do not read this. Wow. Reverse psychology actually works."
Cingular will also wrap ads around double-decker Gray Line tourist buses, some of which will "pull over to the Cingular store and a quintessential New York celebrity gets on and gives a tour," said John B. Osborn, executive vice president and director for integrated marketing at BBDO New York. He declined to identify them, but look for personalities like Joan Rivers.
"Everything is designed around creating a Cingular sensation," Mr. Osborn said.
A love of puns . . . so New York. A disdain for puns . . . so New York, too.

HEADLINE: Crime Rate Increases Sharply In New York (State, Not City) 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Though the crime rate continues to slide in New York City, the number of homicides, rapes and robberies rose sharply outside the five boroughs last year, particularly in a few upstate cities, according to new statistics recently posted on the Internet by state officials.
 All told, violent crimes fell by 9.9 percent in New York City in 2001, but rose elsewhere in the state by 2.3 percent, the State Division of Criminal Justice Services reported. 
 The biggest disparity between the city and the rest of the state was in homicides: in the city, the number reported to the police fell by 3.6 percent last year, while reported killings surged by 14.1 percent throughout the rest of the state. 
The statewide statistics come with two asterisks, however. First, officials caution that the statewide numbers are estimates that are based on actual police reports in New York City, the six next largest cities and nearly 500 other municipalities and agencies. The statistics may change, therefore, once data trickles in later this year from several dozen other locales.
Second, a single city -- Buffalo -- is almost entirely responsible for the striking change in the number of homicides outside New York City, which jumped to 266 from 233. Spurred by a record 19 killings in May 2001, Buffalo recorded 64 homicides last year, up from 39 in 2000, according to the state's new data.
The Buffalo police commissioner, Rocco J. Diina, called the city's 2001 homicide total an anomaly, and said that so far this year the murder rate had returned to the levels of other recent years, when the city typically recorded 30 to 40 killings annually.
Mr. Diina said the May murder total, which briefly prompted the city's homicide detectives to seek reinforcements from the state police, had causes ranging from drug-gang battles to a few random multiple killings to the inexplicable. "That's like asking why did Sammy Sosa hit so many homers in June, and not in July," he said.
Buffalo also had a 30 percent surge in rapes, to 229 last year from 176 in 2000. But Mr. Diina said nothing should be read into that swing, since the annual total has hovered around 200 for years, and was as high as 269 as recently as 1996. The 53 additional rapes in Buffalo in 2001 accounted for much of the increase of 115 rapes -- or 8.1 percent -- in areas of the state outside the five boroughs of New York City.
In Syracuse, meanwhile, robberies jumped by 25 percent, to 567, while motor vehicle thefts climbed 15.8 percent, to 901.
More broadly, criminologists have cited the bleak economic picture in much of upstate and western New York as a main factor in the region's crime troubles, which have affected Lockport, Niagara Falls and other parts of Niagara County, among other places. The Niagara County sheriff, Thomas A. Beilein, reported earlier this month that major crimes increased 23 percent last year, with larcenies up 34 percent in the same period.
Police departments, of course, are not immune to fiscal pressures, and despite Buffalo's troubling violent-crime totals for last year, Mr. Diina said that he would lay off 32 police officers; the force has roughly 900 officers. He has also consolidated and disbanded several units and demoted some detectives back to patrol duties, moves that have drawn opposition from the police union and local community groups.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Surprising Limit On Ground Zero Design 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
When Gov. George E. Pataki said on Saturday that nothing would be built where the twin towers once stood, he all but took the pencils out of the hands of the urban planners hired to consider options for the site of the World Trade Center.
 His remarks also seemed to give credence to something that critics have been saying privately for months -- that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the panel created by Mr. Pataki to oversee the rebuilding process, is essentially under the governor's control, and that he alone will determine much about the future of the site. 
 Supporters and aides to Mr. Pataki insist that is not the case. Rather, they say, the governor was merely expressing his personal opinion to the family members of victims of the attacks Sept. 11 about a memorial at the site. And they point out that Mr. Pataki had previously said little about what he believed should happen at ground zero because he did not want to be accused of squelching the public discussion. 
But his statement on Saturday, "We will never build where the towers stood," came at a awkward moment. A team of urban planning and transportation experts hired by the development corporation is scheduled to unveil six proposals for the site, including a place for a memorial, in the next two to three weeks.
And on July 20, some 5,000 people from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are to meet at the Javits Convention Center for a day-long public discussion of ideas for the site and the memorial, including the six proposals from the design team.
"To draw a conclusion before the designers have had a chance to think it through is probably premature," said Holly Leicht, the director of design, planning and advocacy for the Municipal Art Society and a co-director of Imagine New York, a series of 250 public hearings and workshops on rebuilding Lower Manhattan, which concluded last month. "It may well be a good conclusion to reach about the placement of a memorial, but we haven't gone far enough through the process."
Mr. Pataki's remarks came at a day of remembrance ceremony sponsored by the Coalition of 9/11 Families at the Javits Center. The event was attended by several hundred relatives of the victims.
In addition to calling the place where the towers stood "hallowed ground," Mr. Pataki said the footprints "will always be a lasting memorial for those that were lost." He added, "Their sacrifice must be remembered for all times to come, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that happens."
Michael McKeon, the communications director for Mr. Pataki, said the governor had been reluctant to express his opinion about many issues concerning the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan because those statements would "take on added weight." And despite the forceful nature of his statement, Mr. McKeon said the governor "wants to be respectful of the process, and he wants to have an open and inclusive discussion."
Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker who represents downtown and who also lives in the area, said Mr. Pataki's comments did preempt a public discussion. 
"The governor set up the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation," Mr. Silver said. "He picked the appointees. Then he usurped them by not allowing them to deliberate on these issues.
"I don't oppose what the governor said, nor do I oppose it as a possible conclusion of a vigorous public debate," Mr. Silver said. "But I oppose proceeding with it as if by fiat."
Most of those attending the ceremony gave Mr. Pataki a standing ovation, however, and they also cheered remarks by former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who repeated previous calls for a "soaring, dramatic memorial" at the site.
And many who attended contrasted those statements with recent comments by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said last month that "less is more" when it comes to a memorial and that any plans should be balanced with the needs of residents of the area and commercial interests. He also said that downtown residents and businessmen did not want "a cemetery" on the site.
It is interesting to note, however, that the views of the governor and the mayor are not necessarily incompatible. Mr. Bloomberg did not say anything specific about the location of a memorial. Mr. Pataki, meanwhile, did not say anything about the size of a memorial. In fact, in referring specifically to the footprints of the towers, Mr. Pataki spoke only of two one-acre patches of ground, a small portion of the 16-acre site.
The question remains whether any of the six site plans being developed by Beyer Blinder Belle, the architecture and urban planning firm hired by the development corporation, will include any alternative sites for a memorial.
Officials of Beyer Blinder Belle did not return phone calls seeking comment on the plans. But architects and planners who have worked on redevelopment ideas for various civic groups said they believed that Mr. Pataki's remarks unnecessarily preclude many desirable options. 
"I think it's really very restrictive in terms of the options for the best development of the site," said Bruce S. Fowle, the senior principal at Fox & Fowle Architects who helped to oversee a report by the New York New Visions civic group on possible configurations and uses of ground zero.
"You can't even find the footprints right now because everything has been taken away," Mr. Fowle said. "To think of it as sacred ground is purely symbolic. And once you're in symbolic mode, you have to ask whether there are other alternatives you could consider that might be better."
Among the alternatives that have been talked about by directors of the development corporation and others is the construction of a cultural or performing arts center at the southern end of the site, using some of the street bed of Liberty Street as well as property that is now a parking lot immediately south of the site.
But those plans call for some of the building to impinge on the footprint of the southern tower. It is unclear, therefore, if Mr. Pataki's statement precludes that sort of development or only an office or retail building.
Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who owns the commercial lease to the World Trade Center site, said Mr. Silverstein "has said he'll certainly work closely with the governor on his concept."
Not building on the footprints of the towers "would affect the configuration of the area," Mr. Rubenstein said. "But it certainly would not impede the eventual redevelopment of the whole area."
Officials of the development corporation also said that despite the fact that the governor's opinions carry a lot of weight, all of the decisions about the site have not been made. 
"We believe the governor is committed to an open and inclusive process," said Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the development corporation. "If ideas emerge that are so much more compelling than others, we're confident that the governor, along with the families and the public, would give them due consideration."

HEADLINE: Arizona Fire Scars Apache-White Relations 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY with NICK MADIGAN 

DATELINE: CIBECUE, Ariz., July 1 

 BODY:
On the first of every month, Bernice Caddo cashes her Social Security check and heads 35 miles north to Show Low to shop for food, clothing and other family needs.
 Today, Ms. Caddo decided not to go. She was frightened, she said, and many other members of the White Mountain Apache living here were, too. "Maybe I'll go in a few weeks, after things calm down," she said. "But not now." 
 Ms. Caddo, 61, and the others said they feared hatred and retribution from white communities for the act of one Apache, Leonard Gregg, 29, a contract firefighter who was arrested on Sunday and charged with starting a fire that converged with a smaller one and grew into the largest wildfire in Arizona history. Known as the Rodeo-Chediski fire, it has consumed more than 467,000 acres and is only 45 percent contained. 
Hot, dry conditions almost guarantee that the fire will burn at least a week more.
The blaze has caused economic devastation across an area famous for hunting, fishing and scenic beauty, and it has not discriminated. Show Low and other communities north of here, mostly populated by whites, have lost more than 420 homes. The Apache have lost pine forests that supported a timber industry employing tribe members.
But as Mr. Gregg awaits a court appearance on Wednesday in Flagstaff to enter a plea, psychological devastation is evident as well.
Here in Cibecue, home to 2,000 Apaches, it has taken the form of fear, anxiety and even anger. Since Mr. Gregg was arrested for starting the Rodeo fire, Apaches say their northern neighbors have shown little sympathy for their losses, and rumors are spreading across Cibecue that Apaches are unwelcome in white communities and that restaurants will not serve them.
"This has been there a long time," Belinda Colelay, 23, a teacher's assistant, said of years of friction between the whites to the north and the Apaches. "Now it's only going to get worse. Now they have a reason to hate us; they don't have to look for excuses. Leonard gave them one."
Whether or not the rumors are true, Ms. Colelay and others say they feel growing enmity from residents of Show Low and other towns. Ms. Colelay said she and friends recently waited 45 minutes at an empty Show Low fast-food restaurant before someone took their order.
But just the perception of discord has convinced many Apaches that they have to change their lives. They no longer feel comfortable, they said, driving to Show Low to shop or see a movie. Now, they said, they will drive 60 mountainous miles south to Globe. 
"Show Low is going to direct their anger at us," said Richard Collateta, 39, who said he had Apache friends who recently got into parking-lot fights with whites in Show Low. "Look, I understand it. If they say something to me, I say something to them. It turns into a fight. I don't know how long it's going to take to cool things down, but we're not going to Show Low anymore."
To some whites in Show Low, the largest of the white communities north of the Apaches, the change is understandable. David Marley, 46, a plumber who has lived in Show Low for eight years, acknowledged mutual resentment, but suggested it was stronger on the part of the Apaches.
"The Native American tribes have a large amount of resentment toward those who are not of the tribe," Mr. Marley said. "They go to a bar and they keep to themselves."
Mr. Marley said he had stopped going to his favorite bar and dance hall, the Lion's Den, in Pinetop a few miles southeast of Show Low, "because a lot of the Native Americans go there and it's hard for the white people to have fun."
Kelvin Beach, 59, a plumbing contractor whose house in Linden was saved, although barely, said: "A lot of people are upset that it was started by one of the Indians. They're the first ones crying about how their timber industry is destroyed."
For many Apaches, the feelings of fear and anger are heightened by a sense of judicial betrayal. The authorities investigating the cause of both fires said they had interest in Valinda Jo Elliott, 31, a white woman who became lost while hiking and is believed to have set the smaller blaze, the Chediski, by lighting underbrush to gain the attention of a passing helicopter.
So far, no one has been charged in the Chediski fire, which burned west of the Rodeo one in an area of thick pines. Even though the circumstances were different -- prosecutors said Mr. Gregg started the fire to earn money as a contract firefighter, and he all but admitted his guilt in court on Sunday -- it did not make sense to many Apaches that he was in a Flagstaff jail and Ms. Elliott remained free.
"That's not equal justice," said Enoch Lupe, 50. "That lady burned all our timber. She also burned sacred Indian sites. We say, 'Who did this?' We hear, 'It was a white lady.' So here there is blame for everybody. But only one person is in jail."
Ms. Caddo said: "One Apache. One white. The way I look at it is, they're equal. So no one should say anything against each other."
Mr. Marley, the Show Low plumber, said the Apache were using the two incidents as an excuse to charge racism.
Not that any Apache was willing to exonerate Mr. Gregg, who was being held in a Coconino County jail. He was routinely derided by residents here as stupid and selfish for trying to solve his financial problems through fire.
Many said he had deprived the tribe of its most valuable asset: timber from forests the Indians regard as sacred. As a result, the town's lumber mill has closed, costing hundreds of Apaches their jobs and adding to a tribal unemployment rate already over 60 percent.
"Sure, we're angry at him," said Mr. Collateta, once a logger and avid hunter who now hunts only for work as an auto mechanic. "If a lightning bolt had struck, then it would have been different. But for him to start the fire, just to make some money, that's ridiculous."

HEADLINE: Fledgling Business Owners Say They're Unemployed, Too 

BYLINE:  By MARCOS MOCINE-McQUEEN 

 BODY:
Most New Yorkers who collect unemployment checks -- and right now there are almost 200,000 statewide -- must spend their days looking for work, or risk losing their benefits. But almost a thousand of them are doing something different: creating their own small businesses and becoming their own bosses.
 New York's eight-year-old program to turn the unemployed into entrepreneurs, created by Congress and run with state and federal money, has become the country's biggest. But now some of the entrepreneurs-to-be are complaining that the program is shortchanging them. 
 Deborah Cummings is one of those people. Her fledgling export-import business is her best shot at making a living, she said, explaining that she is 51 years old and has found that most employers want to hire younger people.
Yet for Mrs. Cummings and the other people in the program, called the Self Employment Assistance Program of the New York State Department of Labor, regular unemployment benefits are running out after six months. And unlike unemployed people who are not in this program, they have been told that they do not qualify for 13 extra weeks of unemployment insurance payments that the federal government agreed to pay for in March as part of a national economic stimulus plan.
"If I had known we weren't going to get the extension, I might not have done the program," Mrs. Cummings said. Other participants said they knew they were not automatically eligible for the extension when they signed up for the program, but had still hoped to be included.
Like 10 similar programs across the country, the one in New York is intended for people who are likely to run out of unemployment benefits before they can find jobs. Many of these people are in their 40's and 50's and would have a difficult time finding jobs that paid as well those they lost. That age group has also been one of the hardest hit in the last year; in New York City, the number of people between the ages of 45 and 54 who are collecting unemployment has gone up by about 60 percent.
The entrepreneurs must submit business plans, receive training and prove that they have expertise in the industry they plan to enter. Many have started consulting firms; others do things like design packaging or produce videos.
Economists say such efforts are good not just for the entrepreneurs, but also for the economy as a whole. "The jobs that are going to be created in this economy are going to be created by entrepreneurs and small businesses," said Richard J. Van Ness, the author of "Life After Layoff," which Whitston Publishing will publish this fall.
That is why some participants in the program contend that they should receive 13 weeks of extended benefits. "The reason they passed the extended benefits was part compassion and a greater part economic stimulus," said Timothy M. Ryan, a former banker who started a consulting business. "And for both reasons, I don't see why they wouldn't include the S.E.A.P. participants in this extension."
Robert M. Lillpop, a spokesman for the Department of Labor, said that this issue was decided at the federal level and the state had no choice in the matter.
The United States Labor Department considers trying to start a business a job, said Emily S. DeRocco, an assistant secretary of labor. "Unemployment compensation is for people who are temporarily unemployed and are willing and able to take work."
Mrs. Cummings remains hopeful that the state will find a way to get an extension for the program's participants.
"This business is tough," said Mrs. Cummings, who has dipped into her pension for money to keep her business afloat. "I could just use the same help the other people being paid unemployment are getting."

HEADLINE: California Lawmakers Vote To Lower Auto Emissions 

BYLINE:  By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

 BODY:
After a long and bitter debate, lawmakers in California today passed the nation's strongest legislation to regulate emissions of the main pollutant that can cause warming of the planet's climate, a step that would require automakers to sell cars that give off the least possible amount of heat-trapping gases.
 By the narrowest of margins, the State Assembly passed the California Climate Bill, which for the first time gives the agency that regulates air pollution in the state the power to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas that scientists say is building up in the atmosphere and causing a warming of Earth's climate. 
 The vote was 41 to 30, with 9 members not voting and with a majority of 41 needed to pass the bill. Democrats control the Assembly 50 to 30, and the vote was mostly along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. 
With the California Senate having passed the measure, 23 to 16, on Saturday, the Assembly's action seemed to signal that the bill would soon go to Gov. Gray Davis for his signature, though a few procedural hurdles might still derail it.
Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Mr. Davis, said the governor made this statement about the bill: "This bill represents good public policy, but it has been subject to many amendments over the past several days. I will read all the amendments when the bill arrives on my desk before making a final decision."
Environmental advocates called the bill the most significant step ever taken to control heat-trapping gases in the United States, which is the world's leading source of such pollutants but which, under President Bush, has refused to join a global pact to restrict their emissions.
Automakers contend that California is taking a unilateral step to increase the fuel efficiency of vehicles, something the federal government has not done for years. Because carbon dioxide is given off whenever gasoline is burned, the only way to cut how much of it vehicles produce is to make ones that burn less gasoline or to sell ones driven by electricity or by other means.
The measure would not take effect until 2005, and the first models that would come under its restrictions would be sold in 2009. Even so, environmental groups said this was the most important step to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases since global climate change first came to public attention some 20 years ago.
Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense, a group that lobbied hard for the bill, said it was a sign that "solutions are at hand" for the threat of global warming.
"Finally," Mr. Krupp said, "somewhere in our governmental system, one state has taken action."
But other states, including Massachusetts, have taken steps, though more modest, to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. 
Assemblyman Dario J. Frommer, a Los Angeles Democrat who supported the bill, said today: "In the long term, we'll all be served by cleaner air and reducing global warning. We have four of the dirtiest cities in the nation in this state. It is time for us to lead the nation in a responsible and measured approach, which is what we have in this bill."
But Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth, Republican of Murrieta, who opposed the bill, said: "This will cost lives. 'The reason it will cost lives is that it will price people out of the market. So they will keep their older cars, which do not have the safety features of newer cars."
Automakers sought to thwart the bill with a vigorous campaign of television commercials and other publicity suggesting that the measure would result in a ban on sport utility vehicles and large cars.
In a compromise, the Assembly required that the bill not impose taxes or other prohibitions on large cars, and provided that automakers could pay other companies that emit heat-trapping gases to reduce their pollution, offsetting cuts that automakers would otherwise have to make.
Even so, the automakers reacted negatively to the measure passed today.
"This is another form of regulating fuel economy," said Chris Preuss, a spokesman for the General Motors Company. "That is strictly the right and authority of the federal government. There are more proactive ways of dealing with the environmental issues in California than this type of legislative approach."
Environmentalists argued that while fuel economy standards were regulated only by federal laws, California had the right to regulate all forms of air pollution, and that the current bill was carefully written to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, not fuel efficiency.
California is the largest market for automobiles in the United States, as well as the state with more serious air pollution problems than any other. Under federal clean air legislation, the state's air quality regulators are allowed to set standards for automobile pollution that are stricter than those imposed by federal law. In the past, many other states have followed California's lead in setting pollution rules on vehicles, and ultimately American automakers have been forced to build cars that meet California's standards and to sell them nationwide.
Heat-trapping gases, which are given off mainly when people burn fossil fuels, come from many sources; cars, homes, factories, power plants and farms are the most important. But transportation is the leading source.

HEADLINE: Longshoremen Negotiate Beyond Deadline 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Shipping companies and longshoremen continued negotiating yesterday after a contract deadline as the two sides vowed to redouble efforts to reach an agreement to prevent a shutdown of 29 West Coast ports.
 The longshoremen's union says it has made no plans to strike. But officials with the management group, the Pacific Maritime Association, said they feared that the union would engage in a work slowdown that would cripple port operations. 
 The two sides agreed late last night to extend their contract on a day-to-day basis during the talks, The Associated Press reported.
Earlier, Joseph Miniace, the association's president, sought to discourage a slowdown by warning yesterday that the ports would lock out the 10,500 longshoremen if management detected a slowdown.
A lockout or a severe slowdown at ports from San Diego to Seattle could hurt the nation's economy by delaying shipments to tens of thousands of stores, auto dealers and factories. The West Coast ports handled about $300 billion in cargo last year.
"If the union strikes with pay by staging slowdowns at the terminals, the Pacific Maritime Association will be forced to consider a defensive shutdown," Mr. Miniace said in a statement. "The P.M.A. will not engage in an offensive lockout of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union."
Steve Stallone, a union spokesman, said union members had no intention of staging a slowdown. But in words that raised the possibility of a clash, Mr. Stallone suggested that many workers might exercise their right to refuse to work overtime, a move that would essentially slow work.
The maritime association said it would take a hard line toward any slowdown. Many companies accused it of knuckling under in the 1999 negotiations after many union members refused to work overtime or took other measures to slow operations.
Mr. Miniace said the main issue in the talks was technology, specifically management's desire to increase the use of computers to speed shipments.
He said the ports and shipping companies sought the free flow of information so port computers could talk to other computers without having longshoremen engage in the expensive process of re-entering information that was already in the computers. Mr. Miniace said no longshoremen would lose jobs as a result of increased technology, but he said some workers would be retrained for other jobs.
Mr. Stallone said the union was not opposed to increased use of technology. But he added that many companies had already seized on new technologies to give nonunion employees work that had been done by union members.
"Our concern is that they will use this technology to outsource our jobs," Mr. Stallone said.
The union says the average longshoreman is paid $80,000 a year; management puts the average at $106,000.
Union officials said the main issue was management's refusal to maintain health and pension benefits at the current levels. They said management's health proposal would require union members and retirees to begin contributing toward their medical expenses.
Mr. Miniace insisted that under management's proposal, the workers would not have any out-of-pocket expenses for their medical care. He said the longshoremen were part of the small group of workers who have 100 percent of their health expenses covered. 
The National Retail Federation has asked President Bush to press the two sides to do their utmost to avoid a shutdown of the ports. Some business have asked him to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act.
White House officials say they are monitoring the situation.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans To Resume No-Interest Financing 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1 

 BODY:
General Motors will announce a return to interest-free financing deals Tuesday. 
 G.M., the world's largest automaker, offered interest-free financing across much of its lineup for several months after the Sept. 11 attacks. Early in the year it switched to rebates and lesser financing deals. But sales fell 12 percent in May from a year earlier, the first significant drop after months of growing sales. 
 The company will return to some interest-free deals on three-, four- and five-year purchase plans across much of its lineup, according to a person close to the planning who insisted on not being identified. 
The deals are more good news for consumers. Even before the new G.M. offer, the Big Three had been selling the average car with more than $2,500 in discounts through rebates or inexpensive financing. In addition, mortgage rates are at their lowest point in decades and the Federal Reserve passed up a chance to raise interest rates last week.
Incentive costs are quite high for General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group and put them at a disadvantage against foreign competitors like Toyota and Honda, which have maintained sales with far lower incentives because of better quality rankings. 
Financial analysts and investors are increasingly questioning what the spending levels say about the underlying health of the Big Three. There are also questions on Wall Street about whether the relatively strong car sales this year will last once the supply of extra buyers attracted by lower prices has been exhausted. 
"There are two schools of thought," said Andrew Newton, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "One is that these incentives are holding up the consumer and once they go, the bottom falls out." 
The second camp, he said, held that the incentives would spur buying until an economic recovery increased demand. "I tend to be in the second camp," he said. "Bears would say once the incentives come off the bottom falls out."
But one bearish hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the increasing reliance on incentive spending "keeps getting more and more desperate." 
Christopher Manuel, an analyst at McDonald Investments, a Cleveland investment firm, said: "It shows sales right now are clearly driven by incentives to a large extent. If they tried to cut back, they'd see their sales drop."
But Mr. Manuel said he believed that G.M. had made significant gains this year by gaining in quality and productivity and by raising its earnings estimates. 
"They have a lower cost structure than some of the others, particularly Ford," he said. "General Motors has been able to sell a lot more vehicles and made more money."
G.M.'s new interest-free financing offers could also be harder on Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, than on G.M., analysts said. The Big Three closely monitor each other's deal making and generally match each other when one of the others steps up the level of deals. Ford and Chrysler are in a weaker financial condition than G.M. and are expected to suffer more if they respond with new deals of their own.
Ford said today that it would offer some interest-free deals in a new incentive program, but only on a few models. Many of its new deals will be driven by a combination of rebates as high as $3,000 for the Crown Victoria and the Windstar minivan combined with low financing. But the plan was developed last week and did not account for G.M.'s new plan.
"We monitor the market on a regular basis and on a daily basis," said Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman. "At any time, if we need to make minor adjustments to the program, we will do so. The bottom line is we will remain competitive."
Jan Zverina, a spokesman for the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, said: "We have programs that run through July 8 so I'm not sure we would do anything to respond immediately. We will remain competitive. We'll look at the details of G.M.'s new program."

HEADLINE: A CONVERSATION WITH: HAROLD SHAPIRO; 
Weighing Medical Ethics For Many Years to Come

BYLINE:  By HOWARD MARKEL 

 BODY:
Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, the economist and former university president, tackled some of the most contentious ethical issues in medicine, including stem cell research and the cloning of human cells, while heading the National Bioethics Advisory Commission from 1996 to 2001.
 Then, last summer, President Bush proposed a ban on all cloning experiments, including work on discarded embryos directed toward developing medical therapies. At the same time, Mr. Bush appointed Dr. Leon R. Kass as chairman of a new bioethics commission with the express purpose of readdressing these controversial questions. 
 Last July, the House of Representatives approved a ban on all cloning experiments for reproductive and therapeutic purposes. But when the bill reached the Senate in June, a deadlock was created, killing any hope of a solution this year.
Dr. Shapiro, who headed Princeton and the University of Michigan, recently discussed the ethical questions. "None of these issues are likely to be resolved soon," he said.

Q. As chairman of the national bioethics commission, you presided over 100 public hearings. What impressed you most?

A. In addition to the experts' testimonies, a critical component was the opportunity for citizens to express opinions about the topics under discussion. What impressed me was that the comments of the majority of these people were largely about their fears about a particular scientific technology or medical practice. My view is that when a lot of people have fears, you must try to understand them. We all need to get used to the fact that we are going to be confronted by complex moral challenges all of the time as a result of scientific progress.

Q. What are your views on reproductive cloning?

A. There is so much unjustified hysteria about reproductive cloning, but I think it is much ado about nothing. There are no new ethical issues raised by reproductive cloning that are not raised by the use of genetic engineering and other reproductive technologies. Ethically, it is a subset of these broader problems.
But putting aside issues such as safety or reliability, which will be resolved someday, cloning is a bad solution to just about any problem you can think of in reproduction. What can you gain from it? For normal people who want to have children, this is the worst possible way to do it. Some worry about others who may want to clone themselves or particularly gifted people, but in my view this will never become a widespread social practice.

Q. How should we approach the current debate over stem cell research?

A. The isolation of embryonic human stem cells and the production of stem cell lines from them are enormous accomplishments. I continue to believe that the federal government ought to fund research both to derive stem cells from embryos, provided that their source is limited to embryos created as part of a reproductive project and that appropriate consents were obtained, and from existing or future stem cell lines.
What I think is ethically problematic is the attempt to distinguish the derivation from the use of these cell lines or public versus private sponsorship of these activities.
If one believes that the destruction of an embryo to isolate these cells is the moral equivalent of homicide, then why do we distinguish between public and private sponsorship of these activities? With the policy that exists now, stem cell research will obviously continue, but it will do so in the private sector, where no one can see it. I think we have gotten ourselves into the worst possible situation. There's no oversight, we don't know what's going on and it is hidden from the public eye.

Q. Do you have concerns about the close relationship between university-based scientists and for-profit biotechnology companies?

A. I don't think there has ever been a time in the history of modern scientific research when such a large proportion of those engaged in academic biological research are so involved with for-profit biotechnology companies. Now there are a lot of benefits to these activities, such as technology transfer. On the other hand, it is hard to find scientists who are not potentially conflicted by their financial interests in these companies.
Full disclosure solves a lot of these issues, but when you think of the erosion of the confidence the public may have in what scientists say, these conflicts, real or perceived, become very important.

Q. What are your views on experiments with humans?

A. We must accept that medical research is an enormously ethical activity. But to use human beings in medical research is a special privilege that carries special responsibilities. Every participant needs to be covered by two principles: independent review and voluntary informed consent based upon respect for the autonomy and rights of the individual participant.
The medical institutional review boards that supervise these activities are overburdened and tend to focus on properly filling out forms rather than substantive protection. We need to increase the public accountability of these boards, to include members of the outside community, to compel them to produce annual reports of what they approved, disapproved and why, and to require an annual system of auditing on a random basis of a certain percentage of those studies.
We also need to look at how we obtain informed consent from human subjects. This should be seen as a continuing process throughout the experiment rather than a moment that ends with the participant's signature on the dotted line.
While there is a uniform set of requirements enforced for F.D.A.- and N.I.H.-funded studies, these regulations do not apply to those investigators conducting privately funded or privately conducted research. We need a set of universal regulations and a certification process for everyone who conducts research on human subjects. Finally, we must consider participants in these studies to be heroes, nothing less.

Q. While many areas of scientific advancement raise compelling ethical issues, something that gets less attention is access to health care, especially for the nation's poorest children. How do we strike a balance?

A. We have done a horrible job of prioritizing our health care expenditures and have allowed the market to determine too much. Now, I am an economist, and I believe in the market a lot, how it mobilizes resources and generates creativity, but it doesn't do everything and it is often wrong. That's one of the reasons we need governments, because the market often generates inappropriate solutions. It is a scandal that we spend so much on very expensive medical products or procedures when we have these basic needs that are completely unattended to for a very large number of children and that we can fix for a far smaller investment.
Reproductive cloning is little more than a dot on the wall compared with these problems. Taking care of tuberculosis or immunizing children may not be nearly as energizing to the public as the possibility that science fiction might come true, but we must change that orientation.

HEADLINE: Mexican Corruption Suspect Surrenders to U.S. in Houston 

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 1 

 BODY:
A crucial figure in a mushrooming Mexican corruption scandal, Rogelio Montemayor Seguy, surrendered to United States authorities here today, ending an international manhunt of nearly two months. His legal case has become a focal point in the struggle between President Vicente Fox and his powerful opposition in the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
 Late this afternoon, United States and Mexican officials were discussing how to handle the case of Mr. Montemayor, who has not taken into custody but was expected to return to meet with the American officials on Tuesday. 
 Mexican prosecutors had been searching since May 8 for Mr. Montemayor, a former director of the state oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, on charges that he approved over $200 million in questionable payments to the labor union of the oil giant, which is called Pemex.
Investigators in the case, already dubbed Pemex-gate by the Mexican press, have alleged that some of the money was funneled through the union to the presidential campaign of Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in the 2000 elections, in which Mr. Fox won. 
In dueling corruption inquiries, just one day before the arrest warrant for Mr. Montemayor was issued, a federal elections tribunal re-opened an investigation of Mr. Fox, alleging that his National Action Party accepted illegal contributions from foreign companies during the same campaign. Either party could lose vital federal elections funding if the allegations are proven, according to legal experts.
For a man at the center of a firestorm in his native Mexico, Mr. Montemayor, who was formerly governor of the northern state of Coahuila, seemed cool and confident as he prepared to enter the federal courthouse here this morning with his lawyers. 
"I intend to face the charges that have been filed against me, and I place my trust fully in the judiciary of the Republic of Mexico and in the independence and honesty of the judges and justices there," he said.
In surrendering today, Mr. Montemayor requested bail and an extradition hearing, giving Mexico 60 days to show probable cause that a crime was committed and that he was responsible. A United States judge would then decide if he is to be returned to Mexico for trial.
For the Mexican political system, and for Mr. Montemayor, much is at risk. Until Mr. Fox won the presidency, the PRI had controlled Mexico's government for 71 years. It had substantial influence in Pemex, which provides about a third of the Mexican government's revenues. Charges of graft had haunted the oil monopoly for decades. 
Mr. Fox has pledged to fight corruption and privatize some parts of Pemex, thus pitting himself against the old guard of the PRI, which defends Pemex as a symbol of Mexican nationalism. Both camps are using the scandals in a public relations battle leading up to the 2003 mid-term elections.
Mr. Montemayor, 55, denied today that he had made unauthorized disbursements to the union. The disputed funds covered a backlog of nearly $500 million in obligations due the union from Pemex, he said, involving legal settlements, overdue bills from equipment purveyors, and workers' compensation that included housing, medical expenses, and even sports complexes.
"These payments were approved by the Pemex board of directors, by the finance minister, and by the Congress through their approval of the annual budget," said Mr. Montemayor, adding: "This case is a political persecution," he said.
Mr. Montemayor also denied any knowledge of more than $100 million that investigators allege eventually ended up in PRI party coffers. "I was concentrating on solving the problems between the company and its employees," he said. "I had no suspicions about how the money might ultimately be used."
Mr. Montemayor, an economist with a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted of the charges. He said that although the Mexican government had offered him access to a witness protection program, he declined. "That is an insult to me," he said of the offer. "I am not a criminal."
Five other Pemex employees are also charged in the case. The Pemex union's leader, Carlos Romero Deschamps -- who is believed by Mexican investigators have transferred the funds to the PRI -- has immunity from prosecution because he is a member of Congress, although that immunity can be revoked.
Mr. Montemayor was appointed to lead Pemex in December 1999 and served until the Fox administration took over in December 2000.

To the Editor:
 In his entirely valid critique of President Bush's moral clarity ("Mr. Bush Talks the Talk," column, June 28), Nicholas D. Kristof ought to have taken his own advice. 
 In mocking Canada, the host of this year's Group of Eight summit conference, for being "wimpishly peaceful," he demonstrated his own American chauvinism.
Canada has its blemishes, to be sure, but the more nuanced moral judgment about your neighbor's lower tolerance for gun abuse might lead to the conclusion that it is possible to live well in North America with universal medical insurance, lower income disparities and, yes, lower homicide rates.
Does this demonstrate a wimpishly peaceful or simply a more civil society?

HEADLINE: Dreams of Land Collide as Israeli Settlers Grow in Numbers 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: GIVAT ESHKODESH, West Bank 

 BODY:
There is no discernible charm to this barren hilltop, but the young, Israeli settlers who have occupied it say they will do whatever they must to defend it.
 "If you have faith, there is no force that can move you," one 24-year-old settler, Shalom Israeli, said, smiling as he clutched the grip of his M-16 assault rifle on a recent day. "This is just one hill, but it points straight up to God." 
 Palestinians in the village of Singil can see the outpost from their terraces. To them, it makes no difference that such settlements are not officially sanctioned by the Israeli government. Their land is disappearing, the villagers say, and only the settlers have the army on their side. 
"The Jews here believe they have been chosen by God and that we are animals," said Khaled Hussein, 35, a stonecutter in Singil. "They are coming closer all the time. Now, I think, there are only two possibilities: either Israel will destroy us, or we will destroy Israel."
Settlements like Givat Eshkodesh are at the epicenter of the consuming rage in the Middle East, as two dreams of land collide with renewed intensity in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
 On July 1, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced the dismantling of 11 small settler outposts, all but 2 of which were uninhabited. Defense officials said 9 more of the illegal outposts, which they would not name, would be removed in the coming weeks. 
But despite repeated Israeli pledges to halt their expansion, the occasional evacuation of outposts and sporadic appeals from the United States, the settlements have grown steadily. Although the number of recognized settlements has remained fairly stable in recent years, their population in the West Bank has about doubled over the last decade, rising from 100,500 in 1992 to an estimated 198,000 last year, according to official figures.
Behind the growth, officials and analysts said, lies an elaborate system of government incentives and a powerful network of political support. The government provides the settlers with cheap land, discounted loans, tax breaks and other aid. The settlers, in turn, have become a potent constituency of the right-wing political parties that support them -- a force powerful enough to command the actions of important ministers or to destabilize government coalitions.
Israeli policy has largely been shaped by the most militant settlers, Jews who occupy land they believed was deeded to them in the Bible. But as the incentive system has evolved, officials said, it has steadily lured more and more secular families looking for affordable suburban homes.
Asaf Mani, a 27-year-old computer programmer, said it was an easy choice for him and his young wife, Almog, to leave behind a cramped Tel Aviv apartment and join some of her family in the isolated West Bank settlement of Homesh.
Their new hilltop home, with views that stretch for miles, cost only about $60,000 before renovations. The government gave them a cut-rate mortgage, and they will receive a 7 percent break on their income tax. Schools, public transportation and community activities are all heavily subsidized. 
"I am a dreamer," Mr. Mani said, looking past the army bunker in his front yard to the distant haze of the Mediterranean. "I can already see the chicken and the sheep over there, the little steps down to the road. A little time. A little money. It will come."

An Obstacle to Peace Talks
How much Israel spends to sustain and defend the settlements remains a closely held secret. Estimates run upward of $1 billion a year, including security costs, even as the country struggles with its most severe economic crisis in decades.
A former finance minister, Avraham Shochat, calculated the cost of the government's incentive system at perhaps $400 million. Based on supplemental defense appropriations since the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, began in September 2000, he estimated that the security forces are also spending more than $1 billion in additional funds each year, part of it to protect the settlements.
As the United States seeks to revive the peace negotiations and help formulate boundaries for an eventual Palestinian state, American officials say that Israel's settlement machine stands as one of their most formidable obstacles. The sharp rise of the settler population over the last decade has come despite Israel's vow, under the Oslo peace negotiations, not to "change the status" of the occupied territories pending final negotiations.
 In his speech on the Middle East on June 24, President Bush echoed the familiar American appeal, saying, "Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop." 
Israeli governments have pledged repeatedly to stop building new settlements, insisting that any expansion of those in place (now about 125 in the West Bank and 10 more in the Gaza Strip) would be limited to the "natural growth" of the population. But while the West Bank settlement population grew at an annual rate of about 8 percent over the last decade, the birth rate alone would have caused an annual increase of only 3.1 percent, analysts said.
Until recently, the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has also shown tolerance for the outposts -- the clusters of trailer homes that sprout among Palestinian villages in the West Bank regions that the settlers call Judea and Samaria. According to the advocacy groups that monitor them, about 40 new outposts have appeared since Mr. Sharon took office in February 2001.
In Givat Eshkodesh, which was forcibly evacuated during peace efforts three years ago and remains unauthorized, signs of official support are now everywhere: new electrical lines, a new government-built road, and a flush confidence among the settlers that the country is again behind them.
But while the outposts are major sources of friction between settlers and Palestinians, much more of the new building has taken place within the expansive municipal boundaries of existing settlements. Local officials refer to those new communities as "neighborhoods."
On the hills in and around East Jerusalem, where more than 175,000 settlers now live, the communities rise in gleaming stone blocks of duplexes, town houses and single-family homes. A short commute from Tel Aviv, they come in neat rows of tile-roofed tract homes that look like the gated suburbs of the American Southwest. "People don't come here for ideology," said Zvika Ma-Yafit, the can-do mayor of Oranit, a community of about 5,200 people near Tel Aviv. "They come here for the quality of life."
Drive through Oranit's well-guarded gates and there is a swatch of tennis courts, a busy community swimming pool and a matched set of good schools. Behind the soldiers and sturdy fencing, the settlers often say they feel safer than they do in the cities, what with suicide bombs that have killed hundreds of Israelis.

Surging Political Strength
That such settlements thrived during the 1990's under the left-leaning Labor Party was in part the victory of right-wing ministers in the governing coalition. Under Mr. Sharon, who was once the most ardent of those minister-advocates, the settlers' political strength has surged and their tactics have grown more sophisticated.
"P.R. used to be a bad word in Judea and Samaria," said Yuli Edelstein, the deputy minister in charge of absorbing Jewish immigrants and an important advocate for the settlers within the government. "But we live in the modern world. You had to show that you had a right to be there, that you were not some crazy fanatic."
Yet after waves of attacks by Palestinian militants, the character of some less "ideological" settlements has begun to shift in the opposite direction. In Homesh, where Mr. Mani, the computer programmer from Tel Aviv, now lives, the community's 20-year-old charter stipulates that it should remain secular and democratic. But after a relative and a friend of Mr. Mani's wife were killed last year in Palestinian ambushes, some families began to move out. Yossi Dahan, the settlement administrator, said that while the government has provided more security, he had little choice but to turn to religious settlers' groups to replace those who had left.
"I am sure that if the government came here today and said it would give people homes in a safe place, 75 percent of these people would go," Mr. Dahan said. "Maybe all of them."
Mr. Sharon, however, has insisted he will defend the settlers to the last, saying of one of the smallest and most isolated settlements, "The fate of Netzarim is the fate of Tel Aviv." 
Despite new fiscal austerity, his government has maintained the flow of incentives and subsidies, cutting bus fares, bulletproofing settlers' cars and financing activities for children who can no longer travel safely outside their communities. 
The government is also taking at least an indirect role in promoting the settlements to new immigrants. Although Israeli policy is to allow new immigrants to live wherever they choose, several officials acknowledged privately that government-financed agencies are helping the settlements to market themselves to prospective immigrants.
The government's aid to the settlements is difficult to trace because much of it moves through complex bureaucratic conduits or is hidden in vaguely described budget items. Housing support, for example, might be spread across both settlement communities and other "national priority areas" like the Negev Desert.
There is little question, though, that such support has been the will of the prime minister and his Likud Party, of which settlers are an important constituency. As agriculture minister in the late 1970's, Mr. Sharon called for the settlement of two million Jews in the territories by the year 2000. As foreign minister in 1998, he called on settlers to "grab hilltops" before they were ceded to the Palestinians in negotiations.
As under previous coalitions, government support for the settlers is also the work of independent-minded ministers with important portfolios and of settlement officials who administer central-government funds.
Natan Sharansky, the housing minister, said he spends only a modest part of his budget on the settlements. But settlement officials said his support also includes helping them with strategy, lobbying Parliament and cajoling other ministers. Chief among those is the defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, who has authority over new settlement construction but also faces critics of the settlements within his Labor Party.
"There is no doubt that we are paying an increasing price, and an increasing financial price as well," Mr. Sharansky said in an interview. "But the major price is paid by the settlers themselves. And as long as there is no decision to the contrary, we have to defend the settlements."

Power and Population
Political operatives like Pinchas Wallerstein are a critical line of that defense. An old-guard veteran of the militant settler movement Gush Enumim, Mr. Wallerstein once orchestrated roadblocks and rock-throwing against Palestinians, and protests against Israeli prime ministers. Now, he fashions himself a pragmatist.
As the rough equivalent of a county executive for the settlements that surround the Palestinian administrative capital, Ramallah, Mr. Wallerstein's power is partly financial: He administers government grants that are twice what comparable municipalities within Israel receive, according to a recent study, along with local revenues and increasing donations from abroad. He has easy access to government ministers, and consults with them closely.
But he also pursues his own agenda, with an ostensible independence that often suits officials in Jerusalem. He makes no secret, for example, of his dream to use outposts like Givat Eshkodesh to link isolated settlements in the Jordan Valley all the way across the West Bank to Ariel, the settlement city that is a gateway to Tel Aviv.
"In a few years, all of this area will be covered by Jewish population," he said as he stood on a hilltop near the settlement of Shiloh. "I can show you how you can connect this area to Tel Aviv without any major Arab population inside."
Mr. Wallerstein helped establish one new outpost, called Migron, by using a permit for a cellphone antenna to put down a road, fencing and power lines. While the work went on, settlers quietly moved into trailer homes that had supposedly been brought in for the workmen.
Palestinians look out on the same landscape, but see it more darkly.
In Singil, a contractor traced a map of what had been lost: Palestinian farms swallowed by a settlement over there, Palestinian lands taken for an outpost, Palestinian olive groves that had been placed off-limits by the military to safeguard the transit of the settlers.
"Every day that the occupation continues, we lose more of our land," the contractor, Fathi Shabaneh, said. "Every day that the occupation goes on, more of the hope that we have for a just peace evaporates."

HEADLINE: Law Firm Plans Move to Times Square Skyscraper 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A week after Arthur Andersen abandoned plans to move into new headquarters in Times Square, a major downtown law firm is negotiating to move into the same space in the skyscraper, which is under construction on 42nd Street.
 If the deal is completed, the law firm, Pillsbury Winthrop, would move to the Times Square Tower, a 47-story building between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, from Lower Manhattan, where it has made its home for nearly 150 years, according to real estate executives and a partner at the firm. 
The deal would help in efforts to get other companies to lease space in the building, which is being developed by Boston Properties. But it would also undermine efforts to rebuild the economy downtown after the attack on the World Trade Center last Sept. 11. 
Andersen signed a contract two years ago to be the anchor tenant and to lease about half the 1.2-million-square-foot tower. But the Enron scandal doomed the company's fortunes. Last week, Boston Properties and Andersen tore up the lease.
The deal with Pillsbury Winthrop would signal the continuing viability of the Times Square project, the executives said, at the expense of Lower Manhattan.
To offset the departure of investment banks and other financial companies from downtown, state and city officials have offered cash grants and tax breaks to retain jobs or lure new ones there. KPMG, the accounting firm, and several law firms have considered taking advantage of the incentives and lower rents. But few deals have been signed.
"I hope they don't leave downtown," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "Many Midtown law firms are considering moving down here, because the economics are so compelling and the opportunity to be in on the revitalization of one of the great districts of the world is so exciting."
John F. Pritchard, vice chair of Pillsbury Winthrop, said yesterday that the firm had "made no decision yet on what it is we're going to do."
He added, "All our options remain open."
But real estate executives and a partner at the firm said that Pillsbury Winthrop was negotiating the terms of a deal for about 200,000 square feet with Boston Properties and that a "substantial faction" at the firm favored the move uptown. The firm, which is currently at 1 Battery Park Plaza on State Street, hired brokers at Julien J. Studley to look for a new home when its lease expires in 2004.
Pillsbury Winthrop's roots date from the 1800's in Lower Manhattan.
After a slowdown in business last fall, Pillsbury Winthrop and other firms cut their staffs by 10 percent. But it would cost millions of dollars a year more in rent every year at a new Midtown tower. The firm has told city and state officials that its competitors and its clients are uptown, while many of its partners find it easier to get to Times Square.

HEADLINE: Now, at Least in Math, Those Who Can, Teach 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
By some standards, it seems a rather odd state of affairs. Schools cannot find enough mathematics teachers. Yet people proficient in math -- engineers, accountants, stockbrokers and others who want to teach math -- are often turned away because they did not major in the subject in college.
 Consider Malia Jackson, who majored in astronomy at Cornell University, took advanced differential equations and linear algebra and earned a perfect score on the mathematics portion of the Graduate Record Examinations. When she decided to teach high school math rather than college astrophysics, she discovered she did not qualify to become a certified math teacher. 
 Or Lisa Culbertson, another Cornell graduate, who completed two years of calculus in high school, took advanced statistics in college and taught a math SAT prep course for Stanley Kaplan. The New York City Board of Education told her that she also would not qualify.
Both of these aspiring teachers are now part of a new program intended to help certify people who would not qualify as math teachers.The program, which started last month with 120 participants, plunges recruits into classes in square roots, quadratic equations and other high school topics, as well as 200 hours of pedagogical training and student teaching. If they pass the necessary state licensing exams by the end of the summer, including a math test that covers the high school math curriculum, they will begin teaching in city classrooms in September. 
Much is riding on the pilot program because both the State Education Department and the federal government are requiring that only qualified teachers be allowed in classrooms. Finding qualified math teachers is also a severe problem across the country because many states, wanting teachers to have depth in the field, require that math teachers major or minor in math, or take the equivalent number of courses.
But the number of college math majors has dropped steadily. Only about 1 percent of all college graduates are math majors, and they have better-paying career opportunities.
New York City's two-year-old Teaching Fellows program, which has attracted thousands of desperately needed new teachers in other subjects, failed to solve the math teaching problem. Of 1,100 fellows last year, only about 15 majored in math.
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy created the new immersion program for people who showed proficiency in mathematics.
"We needed to jump-start the process," he said. "Investment bankers, bond traders and C.P.A.'s who choose to become teachers need training to know how to teach teenagers. But they shouldn't have to become math majors to do that."
In May, the State Board of Regents approved the pilot program, which Last month started at City, Lehman and Brooklyn Colleges and at St. John's University.
Johnny W. Lott, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, argues that anything short of a major is not enough.
"Teachers have to know more than their students know to be good teachers," he said. 
However others like Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute say that requiring a certain college major is not necessarily the best guide for screening potential teachers.
"The problem with a major is that you could find a math major who spent all his time in an obscure area of topology and did not know much at all about algebra, geometry or trigonometry."
Johanna Duncan-Poitier, deputy commissioner for higher and professional education at the State Education Department, said the state would study the pilot program, to see how teachers do.
"We are not lowering standards," she said. "These individuals will still have to pass the mathematics content specialty test, and they will continue their studies in mathematics.
"We're not saying the math major isn't necessary yet. But if this works, it may be a way for us to bring in more science teachers and teachers in other shortage areas as well. Or we may find this is not as promising as we expected."
Some of the new recruits come from Ivy League colleges. Others left lucrative jobs in finance and consulting. Most were good at math when they took it, though some, like Levi Litman, a Trinity College economics graduate who worked in investment banking and consulting, took little or no math in college. The Board of Education selected them because their college records and current jobs suggested they had an aptitude in math.
"They would not have qualified under state rules," said Alfred S. Posamentier, dean of education at City College, "but the board has not had such qualified applicants in years."
The students in one of the math immersion classes at City College last month seemed to have little problem following their teacher as he moved rapidly through secants, tangents and geometric proofs.
It was 4:00 p.m. on a Friday. Class had been in session for seven hours. But neither the teacher-trainees nor their instructor, Michael R. Richardson, a former high school math teacher, showed any sign of fading as he drew circles and secants on the board with colored markers and quizzed them on exponential numbers.
"What's five cubed?" he asked. "What about five squared? Five to the first power? Five to the zero? Five to the negative one? Five to the negative two?"
The material was not difficult, but many trainees said they were grateful for the refresher.
"My high school math is not that rusty, but some of the stuff is in the recesses of my brain," said Ms. Jackson, the Cornell astronomy major.
State Education Department officials said they did not have specific guidelines for certifying whether the trainees had enough math, but would rely on the judgment of the colleges and on the trainees' scores on the state math test.
The City College instructors cobbled together a practice test last month. Of the 16 students in Mr. Richardson's class, most did very well. Only two failed. Ten scored 95 or above. Six -- including Ms. Jackson, Ms. Culbertson and Mr. Litman -- earned perfect scores.

HEADLINE: G.M. Bucks Detroit Trend And Reports Higher Sales 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 2 

 BODY:
A day after introducing an aggressive incentive plan, General Motors reported stronger June auto sales today even as sales by its Detroit-based rivals and the rest of the industry sagged.
 G.M. said its vehicle sales rose 4.3 percent in June compared with figures in the month a year earlier. Its market share climbed both for June and for the first half of 2001, thanks in part to its willingness to continue stimulating the market with incentives. In contrast, sales at DaimlerChrysler dropped 3.6 percent in June, while Ford Motor's sales dropped 10.7 percent. 
 Though analysts say the latest round of incentives is costing the auto companies about $2,200 a vehicle, Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, said the automaker saw no reason to hold back. "We have the ability and we have the desire to be on the offensive in the marketplace and show leadership," Mr. Ballew said.
"G.M. has a lot of energy and they are trying" to keep pressure on their rivals, said Ron Pinelli, an industry analyst with Autodata Inc. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. "You have to get in there and play the game. Either that, or you lock the doors."
But G.M.'s better performance is not translating to higher showroom prices, even as it has been publicizing the healthy sales of its overhauled lineup of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which were intended to help the company gain both market share and improve its profits.
Prices paid for G.M. vehicles dropped 2 percent in the second quarter on top of a 1.5 percent decline in the first quarter, Mr. Ballew said. He contended the declines reflected the inability of a variety of companies to persuade consumers to pay more. "We are not unique," he said. "Many industries have negative pricing, and the question is how you grapple with that."
But industry analysts noted that the lower prices reflected G.M.'s inability, or unwillingness, to wean the market from incentives. By contrast, several foreign companies have discounted their vehicles far less than has G.M., which on Monday reintroduced the interest-free loan programs that helped it increase sales after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
John McCandless, a spokesman for Toyota, said his company had no plans to match the G.M. program, even though its sales dropped 0.6 percent in June, saying its main problem was a shortage of vehicles as the end of the model year approaches.
Ford, however, announced its own incentive program almost immediately, though it is less generous than the G.M. plan. And DaimlerChrysler said today that it, too, would offer a zero-percent financing plan. It had hesitated in the wake of G.M.'s original offer last year to match the program but its sales plunged as a result.
A DaimlerChrysler executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he hoped G.M.'s offer would spur showroom traffic this summer and help his company clear its inventories of 2002 vehicles ahead of the 2003 model year, which officially begins in October. "We'd like to take advantage of their backdraft," he said.
June's performance translated to an annual selling rate of 16.4 million vehicles, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. That was better than the 15.7 million rate recorded in May but below the 17.4 million rate in April. In all of 2001, automakers sold 17.2 million vehicles in the United States, their second-best performance in history despite the effect on the economy from the Sept. 11 attacks.
For the most part, foreign companies turned in a mixed performance last month. Among Japanese companies, Honda said its sales rose 1.8 percent last month, when it began selling the new Pilot sport utility vehicle, but Nissan, like Toyota, had flat sales. Sales at Mercedes-Benz of Germany dropped 3.1 percent, but sales at its rival BMW, which last spring introduced the latest version of its 7-series sedan, were up 15.2 percent. Hyundai of Korea reported a 19.6 percent increase in June sales, while Kia, another Korean automaker, said its sales climbed 10.3 percent.
Mr. Ballew said he did not expect the latest incentives to have the same effect as last fall's programs. Indeed, some buyers may find that the vehicles they want to buy are not covered by the plans, which apply generally only to 2002 models, not to 2003 vehicles that have been introduced before the start of the model year.
Also, Mr. Pinelli, the Autodata analyst, said the soft economy was making many consumers cautious, a reason that he thinks that sales by Korean companies are surging. "They are not looking to spend money foolishly," he said of consumers.
Unless, of course, a vehicle strikes their fancy. Attracted by a special lease offer, Mr. Pinelli went to his Porsche dealer two weeks ago to check out a Boxster, which runs for about $56,000 fully equipped. Instead, he took home a $90,000 Porsche 911, to the delight of his teenage son. Asked why he spent nearly twice as much as he initially planned, Mr. Pinelli replied, "It was talking to me."

HEADLINE: World Bank Deal to Help Poorest Nations 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
The World Bank welcomed a deal today to provide an additional $13 billion for projects in 79 of the world's poorest countries, reached after months of bickering by donors on how the money should be used.
 Talks had been delayed by heated debate over a proposal by the United States to increase the amount of money given as grants from less than 1 percent to around 50 percent. 
 The plan met with stiff opposition in Europe, and delayed an agreement on the increased financing by more than half a year. The donors eventually agreed that 18 percent to 21 percent of the financing should be given out in grants.
Including this new money, funds available to the bank's lowest cost financing arm, the International Development Association, will total $23 billion over the next three years, up 18 percent over previous levels.
The agreement is "an important step forward in addressing the goals highlighted at the recent development conference in Monterrey," said the bank's managing director, Sven Sandstrom, who headed the lengthy negotiations. 
The previous three-year deal expired at the end of June.

HEADLINE: Construction Is to Start in Fall On Central Harlem Supermarket 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Construction will finally begin this fall on central Harlem's first full-size supermarket, a long-delayed project that is expected to be a catalyst for further development in the Bradhurst section, city officials said yesterday.
 The new 45,000-square-foot supermarket, a Pathmark, is part of Bradhurst Court, a $52 million project that is being financed in part with $6.4 million in grants and low-interest loans from the city. It will take up a full block from 144th Street to 145th Street and from Frederick Douglass Boulevard to Bradhurst Avenue, and will include 126 cooperative apartments for middle-income buyers, 6,000 square feet of other retail space and underground parking for 118 cars. 
 Christopher Cirillo, the director of large-scale development for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that this site, one of the largest undeveloped tracts in Harlem, has been the key element in the city's long-term goal of building up Bradhurst as a middle-class community. "This is the thing that is going to tie this together," Mr. Cirillo said. "This is such a pivotal piece. Its impact will be felt throughout the area."
The project has already led to plans for two other nearby residential buildings, one with 77 units and the other with 200, he said. Several other buildings are being rehabilitated, and other requests for proposals will be issued this summer to develop city land to the north of Bradhurst Court, Mr. Cirillo said.
The development team for Bradhurst Court, which is headed by the Related Companies, the company building the AOL Time Warner headquarters on Columbus Circle, was chosen by the city in June 1999. A lot of time was lost because two candidates to operate the supermarket, Pathmark and then ShopRite, withdrew from consideration and subsequently sought bankruptcy protection.
"That was a real stumbling block," said Jerry Salama, one of the developers, "finding a viable supermarket that knew how to run a big store in the Bradhurst area. There were others that expressed interest, but they didn't know Harlem."
Pathmark, which had opened East Harlem's first full-size supermarket on Lexington Avenue and 125th Street in 1999, eventually recovered and renewed its bid for Bradhurst, a site the company had been considering for more than a decade. As the time for signing a lease approached, Pathmark faced opposition from Mauricio and Matthew Fernandez, who own several medium-size grocery stores in Harlem. 
The Fernandez brothers argued that the city was favoring a large chain at the expense of local entrepreneurs. They enlisted the help of Richard Lipsky, the lobbyist who had battled the East Harlem Pathmark on behalf of local grocery store owners, many of them Dominican.
They had the support of a number of Hispanic politicians and of Rudy Washington, a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration who was able to block financing for the project from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city economic development program. Other city officials, however, questioned whether the Fernandez brothers were ready to make the leap to a 45,000-square-foot store.
Mr. Lipsky said yesterday that he hoped the city would find another location where the Fernandez brothers can open a supermarket.
The new Pathmark, which is expected to be completed in 2004, will create about 200 jobs, said Harvey Gutman, a senior vice president. Its lease requires the company to hire three-quarters of its workers from the local community. "That is something we do because it's good business," Mr. Gutman said. "People want to shop in stores where their friends and children work."

HEADLINE: Argentine Leader Moves Election Forward 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 2 

 BODY:
With his political support crumbling and his country's economic crisis showing no signs of abating, Eduardo Duhalde, the caretaker president of Argentina, moved up the election to choose his successor by six months today so he could leave office early. 
 "We need a government strengthened by the popular vote that is capable of putting into practice the great reforms" that Argentina needs to emerge from the worst economic crisis in its history, Mr. Duhalde said in a brief television address to his nation tonight. He said primary elections would be held within four months and a new president selected four months after that. 
 Mr. Duhalde took office on Jan. 1, designated by Congress to head an emergency "national unity government" in hopes of ending a period of street rioting and political chaos in which Argentina had four presidents in a little more than two weeks. At that time, he said he would serve until the end of 2003, when elections were scheduled. He said that he would not seek a full four-year term in the elections.
From the start, however, Mr. Duhalde has found it difficult to exercise the authority that normally goes with his office. He has had to share power with the 14 provincial governors from his own party. They have repeatedly challenged and sometimes even defied his efforts to get them to reduce spending and stop issuing currencies of their own, which they must do for Argentina to reach any agreement with the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.
Hoping that the government could regain access to an $18 billion credit line suspended in December, Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna traveled to the United States late last week and met with Argentina's creditors. But he was unable even to persuade some lenders to roll over debt payments due at mid-month, and returned to Buenos Aires today empty-handed.
Mr. Duhalde also has been shaken by violence that erupted last week, when two demonstrators participating in a march demanding jobs and food were shot and killed, apparently by the police. The protests were organized by groups closely allied with and in some cases financed by Mr. Duhalde's own Peronist Party. They made clear that Mr. Duhalde's support, which had fallen to 8 percent in recent polls, was shrinking even within his own party.
"The economic and social deterioration and the situation of public security and conflict control are making the government go back and forth," said Carlos Maestro, the Senate leader of the opposition Radical Party. "The situation is getting out of hand," he said, adding: "Duhalde realizes things are getting complicated."
Before, in moments of frustration, Mr. Duhalde had threatened to step down early, seeking to force unruly party leaders to confront the unwelcome possibility of having to manage the crisis by themselves. But he had also implied he would leave only if Argentina's economy was growing again, a prospect that now seems more distant than ever in spite of his claim tonight that his country "is very close to an accord" with the I.M.F. and other creditors.
Mr. Duhalde's decision to move the presidential election forward by six months means that Argentina will shift almost immediately into campaign mode. 
As many as half a dozen members of Mr. Duhalde's Peronist Party had been expected to make a run next year, with the former race car driver Carlos Reutemann and the former president Carlos Menem, Mr. Duhalde's bitter personal enemy, the favorites in early polls.
But a prominent constitutional lawyer, Ricardo Monner Sans, suggested tonight that by advancing the date of the vote, Mr. Duhalde has in effect blocked Mr. Menem, who left office in December 1999 after a decade in power, from running again. The Argentine Constitution, he noted, clearly states that a former president must be out of power four years before he can hold office again.
For his part, Mr. Maestro complained that Mr. Duhalde's decision, which he said was taken "in haste and without consultation," would complicate the electoral chances of his Radical Party, which had been in power until December.
"We are not even halfway well positioned," he said. "In reality, we are badly positioned."

HEADLINE: U.S. MIGHT REFUSE NEW PEACE DUTIES WITHOUT IMMUNITY 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned today that America might not send its forces to join future peacekeeping missions without a grant of full immunity from the jurisdiction of the new International Criminal Court.
 Mr. Rumsfeld aggressively defended the administration's demand that American troops and government officials be exempt from the court, two days after the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution extending the United Nations' peacekeeping mandate in Bosnia. The veto, which was based on American perceptions that the court violates American sovereignty, has generated sharp criticism from Britain and other American allies, which see it as further evidence that the administration is adopting a go-it-alone, unilateralist stance. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld and senior administration officials insisted that the United States would not withdraw wholesale from its current peacekeeping commitments overseas. But they did say that without promises from the international community or host nations that American troops would not be handed over to the court, the United States would carefully review the importance of its international missions, case by case.
"It would be inaccurate to say that the United States would necessarily withdraw from every engagement we have in the world," Mr. Rumsfeld told reporters at the Pentagon. "We have no plans to do that. In other words, we're engaged. We have forces in countries all over the globe. We have no intention of pulling back."
The administration worries that the new court could be driven by politically motivated prosecutors and that American military personnel would not have the constitutional rights granted all Americans in criminal proceedings -- for example, the right to be tried by a jury of peers and to have access to evidence.
A senior Defense Department official said the United States was seeking three types of protections for its military personnel and civilian government officials: a Security Council resolution granting blanket immunity to Americans taking part in United Nations peacekeeping missions; bilateral agreements with countries around the world guaranteeing that Americans on their territory would not be transferred to the court without American consent; and adjustments to current Status of Forces Agreements -- pacts negotiated with nations accepting American military personnel -- to reflect Washington's wishes on the court.
One proposal was being discussed late tonight at the United Nations, where diplomats are working against a deadline of midnight Wednesday to resolve the United Nations dispute over the Bosnia mandate. It would give 12 months of immunity in cases involving peacekeepers from any country that had not yet ratified the treaty establishing the war crimes court. The immunity could then be renewed by the Security Council.
The administration's concerns about the International Criminal Court extend beyond protecting American soldiers: it is also worried that the court could prosecute police officers or civilian officials involved in formulating peacekeeping policies and American combat operations.
"The I.C.C. is broad enough to not only prosecute those within the military chain of command, but also people in the political and policy chain of command," a senior administration official said.
"When you look back to Nuremberg, to Yugoslavia and Rwanda, there are people that need to be prosecuted for their decisions and policies," the official said. "But the broad end of the spectrum is that the process could be politicized."
The administration policy toward the court says much about how the lone superpower will project force abroad. It also presents America's partners and the world with a stark choice: If American military power is needed to quiet international trouble spots, the rules of that operation will be written by America. 
"The very fact that countries do want to cooperate with us and do want our protection and do want our participation in peacekeeping and other missions gives us the ability to go and talk with them and be listened to," a senior Defense Department official said.
The official said the administration was trying to defend the nation's sovereignty from subjugation to a treaty that carried neither a president's signature nor Senate consent.
Over the objections of the Pentagon and Congressional Republicans, President Bill Clinton signed the treaty that brought the court into being. But he expressed deep reservations and did not submit it to the Senate. His argument for endorsing the treaty was that Washington's ability to improve it from inside would be strengthened. The Bush administration revoked Mr. Clinton's signature on the treaty this year.
"The United States is not attempting to impose its will on other countries," a senior Pentagon official said. "In this debate, it is the parties to the International Criminal Court Treaty who are attempting to impose their treaty on non-parties."
The international lawyer who was chairman of the committee that wrote the court's statutes said today that it was "far-fetched" that a prosecutor was "going to run away with the process and target some poor American service member holding a peacekeeping function in some remote part of the world, just because that prosecutor dislikes the United States."
The lawyer, M. Cherif Bassiouni, a professor at DePaul University's law school in Chicago, said prosecutors for the court were selected by its 75 member-states.
He said the court's statutes also "contain all of the due process guarantees available in the U.S. legal system, and even go beyond that." He added, "The only thing it does not have is a trial by jury." 
At the State Department today, officials acknowledged that the administration had taken a hard line on the criminal court precisely because the United States' unmatched military, economic and diplomatic power made it unique in the world.
"We're going to end up having to deal with this issue for Americans all around the world, because we do have a special role," Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, told reporters. "The United States plays a role in the world unlike any other, and therefore this affects us unlike any other nation."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has spoken on the subject to more than half a dozen European ministers over the last three days, including, today, the European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, and the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, Mr. Boucher said.

HEADLINE: Corporate Tax Deal Ends Trenton Budget Standoff 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 2 

 BODY:
An exhausted State Senate finally delivered a budget for New Jersey today, in a quick vote that approved a restructured corporate income tax that is expected to raise $1.8 billion, more than twice the amount collected this year.
 The 21-to-17 vote to provide enough revenue for a $23.4 billion budget was the result of a deal to resolve an ugly dispute between Gov. James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, and mutinous members of his own party who scuttled a budget agreement Sunday night. 
 The dispute, concerning a proposed $355 million sports arena for Newark, was put aside today as arena supporters led by Mayor Sharpe James of Newark agreed to support the budget in return for an agreement to hold committee hearings this summer on plans for the state's professional sports teams. 
The budget plan pulls together enough revenue to close the largest shortfall in the state's history, estimated most recently by Mr. McGreevey at $6 billion. Its centerpiece, and the proposal that nearly paralyzed the Legislature for weeks, was the corporate tax proposal. 
The Senate had already approved other new taxes, fees and borrowing in an extended legislative session Sunday when Mr. James and several other Democrats stopped the vote on the corporate tax bill, the last part of the budget package, to force a hearing on the arena. 
The budget was the first big test of the new governor's leadership. He had labored and bargained for nearly six months to stitch together a plan that avoided raising the personal income tax or sales tax, both politically perilous in this state, but steps that seemed practically inevitable as revenue began to plummet last year.
It was an enormous political hurdle in a state where the last Democratic governor, Jim Florio, doomed himself in 1990 with a $1.2 billion income tax increase, a decision that is still providing a campaign theme for Republicans.
Mr. McGreevey always referred to "closing loopholes" in the corporate business tax, although the law was substantially rewritten.
In a statement today, he said the legislation "will necessarily ensure that major corporations pay their fair and equitable share" after 20 years of declining business tax revenue, and he pointed out once more that the budget did not raise income or sales taxes. 
The budget itself, the appropriations for the 2003 fiscal year, was approved by both houses Sunday, the last day of the fiscal year, and the governor signed the bill early Monday morning, averting a government shutdown. 
Mr. McGreevey ordered the Senate to meet until it approved the $1 billion in new revenue from the corporate business tax to finance it. 
In the last few days, Democrats and Republicans alike questioned Mr. McGreevey's leadership as he lost control of the Democratic caucus, and Republicans continue to attack the budget. "It's unfortunate that the governor looked unfocused Sunday when the tail of the Newark arena was wagging the dog of the entire state budget," said State Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican and a member of the budget committee. "This budget is still a dog." 
In addition to the business tax, the budget relies on borrowing $1.1 billion against the state's expected share of the settlement with tobacco companies. It also raises the cigarette tax by 70 cents, to $1.50 a pack, increases scores of state fees, like those for boat licenses and construction code violations. About half the new revenue comes from sources known as "one-shots," like the diversion of money from the state unemployment insurance fund.
Soon after winning election in November, Mr. McGreevey anticipated the budget shortfall and loudly and consistently blamed years of borrowing and spending by Republicans, who had controlled the governorship and the Legislature for eight years.
His own budget plan turned to the business tax as a source of new money. The governor, arguing that many big corporations had escaped their fair share of the tax burden, said three-quarters of the corporations in the state and 30 of the 50 largest employers were paying only the $200 minimum required under the old law.
His plan came under attack, though, as an advertising campaign and thousands of faxes and calls to legislators' offices called it an undue burden on small and medium-sized businesses and a drag on the state's economy. 
The retooled plan imposes an "alternative minimum" tax on a graduated basis, which is calculated according to gross receipts or gross profits, whichever is higher. The plan also taxes royalties from out-of-state subsidiaries of New Jersey companies and taxes out-of-state sales that are not already taxed by other states. 
Since the budget package draws on borrowed money and one-shot revenue raises, it does not significantly reduce the recurrent imbalance between steady revenue and state spending. 
Wall Street bond-rating agencies, worried about the gap, have lowered New Jersey's credit rating in the last year. 
Republicans and Democrats have never agreed on the size of Mr. McGreevey's budget increase. Total spending is about $500 million more than the budget adopted a year ago, but fiscal problems forced spending reductions of about $1.5 billion during the year. 
In the end, the Republicans agreed to supply the one vote needed on each of the budget-related bills to get them through the Senate. On Sunday night, they did so, and were delighted when it was the Democrats who tripped up the governor. 
Last night and this morning, after Mr. McGreevey and Mr. James had each made a public show of intransigence, the two men met in Newark. With other Democratic leaders, they worked out a deal to approve the budget today and convene hearings this summer on the arena and other sports facilities in North Jersey. 
The senators spent less than five minutes this afternoon on the vote, then scattered for the doors amid calls of "Have a nice summer!" Mr. McGreevey signed the bill quickly, in his office. 
Republican leaders, emerging with little to show for months of budget negotiations, stayed long enough to take a last shot at the legislation just enacted. Senator John O. Bennett, the Republican Senate co-president, called the corporate business tax a horrible piece of legislation that had been somewhat improved.
"It's his budget," Mr. Bennett said of Mr. McGreevey. "It's a Democratic budget. If the people like it and they think it's a great budget, then Jim McGreevey will be a happy man." 
Senator Bennett would speak only obliquely about the chaos of Sunday night and the Democrats' disarray. He said he and the Democratic Senate co-president, Richard J. Codey, had talked about how to make it a more orderly process.

 BODY:
 Poland's finance minister, Marek Belka, left, resigned after he lost a battle with left-wing cabinet colleagues over restraining the country's budget deficit. Mr. Belka, an economist trained in the United States, was widely seen as a guarantor of the Socialist government's fiscal probity as it leads Poland to membership in the European Union, expected in 2004, and tries to tackle a slumping economy with 17 percent unemployment.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Looking Anew at Value Of a Corporate Pedigree

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
George W. Bush is the first president with an M.B.A., and his administration once proudly promoted its corporate experience as evidence of how it could bring boardroom smarts to governance and policy.
 But as the hard-charging, profit-producing, globe-conquering chief executive of the 1990's gives way in popular culture to the disgraced, book-cooking defendant of the post-boom era, the political appeal of a corporate pedigree is no longer so certain. 
 It could hold particular peril for Mr. Bush and his team as they respond to the wave of corporate financial scandals by taking a hard line against executives found to have misled investors. In essentially saying there should be a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to corporate ethical breaches, the president has opened the door to a re-examination of his own business record, as well as the records of Vice President Dick Cheney, members of his cabinet and other administration officials who have logged time in the corner office. 
While Mr. Bush and other officials have always said they have nothing to hide, they are already finding their effort to position themselves as guardians of investor trust complicated by questions about their own handling of accounting issues, stock sales and the like.
Just today, Mr. Bush was asked about his sale of stock 12 years ago in the Harken Energy Corporation, a company whose board he had joined after selling it another company he had run. Mr. Bush sold the stock as it was falling in value, and before the company publicly disclosed a loss that sent the stock down further.
The transaction was examined at the time by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which took no action against him. The issue came up again today after Paul Krugman, a columnist for The New York Times, recounted the transaction and noted that the commission's decision not to pursue the case came while Mr. Bush's father was president.
"Everything I do is fully disclosed, it's been fully vetted," Mr. Bush said when asked about the topic by reporters as he visited Milwaukee today. "Any other questions?"
As the corporate scandals have unfolded, driving down stock prices as the economy struggles to recover from last year's recession, Mr. Bush has been increasingly outspoken about the duties and responsibilities of corporate executives -- and about his belief that executives who defraud investors and cost employees their jobs should be prosecuted aggressively.
He has proposed initiatives to tighten oversight of accounting, make better information available to investors and to hold executives more accountable for any wrongdoing. He is expected to lay out additional proposals next Tuesday in a speech in New York.
"No violation of the public's trust will be tolerated," Mr. Bush said on Saturday in his weekly radio talk. 
But Democrats sense in the corporate scandals an issue that might finally dent Mr. Bush's approval ratings. They are making a case that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, during their time in the corporate world, would not have been able to live up to the policies they are advocating now.
"Perhaps the reason the Bush administration took so long to take action on this issue is because they want to avoid having fingers pointed at the president and vice president who engaged in the behavior they are now attempting to reform," the Democratic National Committee said today in documents it distributed to reporters.
As Democrats pointed out, the Securities and Exchange Commission found that Mr. Bush filed the required disclosure forms about his Harken stock sales weeks or even months late. Yet this spring he proposed that corporate officers be required to disclose sales of company stock within two days.
There is also increased attention on Mr. Cheney's tenure as chief executive of Halliburton, the oil field services company. The securities commission disclosed in May that it had begun an inquiry into Halliburton's accounting practices during 1998, while Mr. Cheney was running the company. Mr. Cheney has declined to comment on the inquiry.
Harvey Pitt, the commission chairman, said last weekend that his agency would follow the inquiry wherever it led. "We don't give anyone a pass," Mr. Pitt said on ABC's "This Week."
Given that his cabinet includes former corporate executives like Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, who ran Alcoa, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who headed G. D. Searle and General Instrument, Mr. Bush is sure to find the rest of his administration's corporate past scrutinized by journalists and his political opponents. Political analysts and pollsters also said the change in public opinion about business and its relations with politics and fund-raising might be only beginning, presenting a continuing challenge to Mr. Bush and his party -- especially since more and more voters own stock directly or through retirement plans.
"The transformation is clearly under way, and I don't see any signs that it's about to peak and go away," said Kevin Phillips, the political commentator and the author of "Wealth and Democracy: A Political History of the American Rich." "The nature of the transgressions makes it likely that we're only seeing the one-tenth of two-tenths that are above the surface. This is a major problem for the administration."
Republicans said that Democrats had failed to do any political damage to Mr. Bush on other issues and that they were unlikely to succeed in painting him as a tool of corporate interests now as long as the president continued to take a hard line against corporate wrongdoing.
"Bush is using the word that matters more than anything else, and that's 'accountability,' " said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. "That's exactly what Americans want to hear. The language the Democrats use is too angry, and it doesn't resonate because it's too political. No one thinks they're doing it for the average working man or woman. They're doing it for political reasons, and that's why they lose credibility."

HEADLINE: General Is Paid $183,372 For Domestic Security Role 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
If there was ever any doubt that there is money in security these days, just ask Maj. Gen. Bruce Lawlor. 
 As the director for protection and prevention in the Office of Homeland Security, General Lawlor is the highest-paid member of the White House staff, with an annual salary of $183,372. His job description: protect the nation in the event of chemical, biological or nuclear attack. 
 His pay level, which is higher than the vice president's, was reported in a list of salaries for all White House staff provided to Congress this week in response to demands by House Democrats.
For those with less dire duties, the rewards are less -- but only slightly, according to the list. Virtually all of President Bush's top advisers earn $145,000, the report shows.
Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, earns $145,000, as do Nicolas E. Calio, the president's assistant for legislative affairs, and Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, Joseph Hagin, the deputy chief of staff, and Albert Hawkins, a presidential assistant.
Also in that top echelon are Lewis Libby, the vice president's chief of staff; Lawrence B. Lindsey, the director of the National Economic Council; Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser; and Karl Rove, the ubiquitous adviser.
President Bush's message makers also receive salaries of $145,000. That includes Karen P. Hughes, the influential presidential counselor who is leaving Washington with a "homesick" family, and Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, who admits that his job hinges at times on knowing what not to say.
Michael J. Gerson, the director of speechwriting, earns $130,000.
Vice President Dick Cheney's salary last year was $174,475, tax records show.
The C.E.O. of the operation, Mr. Bush, earns $400,000, more than twice as much as any staff member. 
A White House spokeswoman, Anne Womack, said tonight that General Lawlor, who is retired from the military, earns more than his boss, Tom Ridge, director of domestic security, who earns $145,000, because the general is detailed from the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: LESSONS; 
Defining Failed Schools Is Harder Than It Sounds

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE Supreme Court ruled last week, in a case involving Cleveland schools, that public money in the form of vouchers could subsidize the tuition of students who choose to attend religious schools. It was only partly a legal judgment that such aid does not violate the separation of church and state. What propelled the court was also a policy conclusion that vouchers may be a way to rescue children from failing public schools. 
 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said that his majority ruling was "not an endorsement of religious schooling," but only a means "to assist poor children in failed schools." Justice David H. Souter, in dissent, acknowledged that if ever there was reason to support religious schools, Cleveland's failed public schools would provide it. 
 But nobody really knows how to identify failing schools, the justices included. Policy makers have been so anxious to punish school failure that they have worried too little about defining what failure is.
Typically, a failing school is deemed one with low scores. By this measure, Cleveland schools do fail, prompting parents to seek radical alternatives.
But while low scores can result from failed schools, they can also have other causes. Poor performance can also result from parents who do not read to young children or otherwise support learning at home. It can result from inadequate exposure to art and music. It can result from insecurity bred of violent surroundings, from emotional stress in broken families or from parents suffering severe economic hardship. In combination, these factors almost ensure failure.
How can policy makers distinguish schools that fail because of low expectations, poor teaching and disorderly classrooms from those that seem to fail because of social and economic pressure?
Cleveland vouchers highlight the problem. The State of Ohio commissioned studies to evaluate the program. If Cleveland schools were truly failing, then public school students who used vouchers at successful private schools should have higher scores than comparable students remaining in public schools.
But if voucher students did as poorly as comparable public school students, then Cleveland's public school "failure" is likely attributable less to what public schools do than to obstacles all schools, public and private, face in educating disadvantaged children.
The studies were conducted by Kim K. Metcalf of Indiana University, and reviewed by outside experts, including supporters and opponents of vouchers.
In his most recent report, Dr. Metcalf compared students who got vouchers with public school students who wanted vouchers but did not get them because there were too few to go around. The two groups had no significant differences in scores.
When voucher students were compared with public school students who did not apply for vouchers, voucher students did better in language arts (like grammar) but not in math or other reading skills. The voucher students' language scores were only slightly higher. 
Susan Tave Zelman, Ohio's superintendent of public instruction, concluded: "We don't see anything one way or another from these studies on the academic results of vouchers. The lack of dramatic results is neither a negative nor positive judgment on the program."
Meanwhile, state test data show how complex definitions of failure can be. Cleveland, where 80 percent of students are from low-income families, certainly seems to be failing; most students are not proficient in most subjects.
Like many other urban areas, Cleveland is surrounded by suburbs with growing minority populations. Most people would think that these districts succeed because their overall scores are still above standard. But minority students' average scores are much lower, and the gap between white and black students in these "successful" districts is comparable to the gap in "failing" Cleveland schools.
Ohio permits Cleveland students to transfer not only to private schools, but also to public schools in these suburbs. But no suburb would take any Cleveland students. Officials at suburban schools that already had some poor students recognized that if they added too many more, their schools could be termed "failing" even if instruction remained adequate.
Of course, many Cleveland schools may fail because they do not rise to the challenge of educating disadvantaged students. Others may be more successful, although their test scores are still low. Roman Catholic schools in Cleveland, which accept most of the voucher students, may be in either category. We simply can't tell them apart because scores are low in both cases.
When Supreme Court justices thought they found a way for urban students to escape failing schools, they ventured into an area beyond their judicial expertise. They should not be blamed. The expertise is pretty scarce, no matter where you look.

HEADLINE: Arabs at the Crossroads 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
President Bush was right to declare that the Palestinians need to produce decent governance before they can get a state. Too bad, however, that he didn't say that it's not only the Palestinians who need radical reform of their governance -- it's most of the Arab world. 
 By coincidence, though, some other important folks had the courage to say that just this week: The U.N. Development Program, which published, along with the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, a brutally honest Arab Human Development Report yesterday analyzing the three main reasons the Arab world is falling off the globe. (The G.D.P. of Spain is greater than that of all 22 Arab states combined.) In brief, it's due to a shortage of freedom to speak, innovate and affect political life, a shortage of women's rights and a shortage of quality education. If you want to understand the milieu that produced bin Ladenism, and will reproduce it if nothing changes, read this report. 
 While the 22 Arab states currently have 280 million people, soaring birthrates indicate that by 2020 they will have 410 to 459 million. If this new generation is not to grow up angry and impoverished, in already overcrowded cities, the Arab world will have to overcome its poverty -- which is not a poverty of resources but a "poverty of capabilities and poverty of opportunities," the report argues.
Though the report pays homage to the argument that the Arab-Israeli conflict and Israeli occupation have been both a cause and an excuse for lagging Arab development, it refuses to stop with that explanation.
To begin with, it notes that "the wave of democracy that transformed governance in most of Latin America and East Asia in the 1980's and early 1990's has barely reached the Arab states. This freedom deficit undermines human development." Using a standard freedom index, the report notes that out of seven key regions of the world the Arab region has the lowest freedom score -- which includes civil liberties, political rights, a voice for the people, independence of the media and government accountability. In too many Arab states women can't vote, hold office or get access to capital for starting businesses. "Sadly, the Arab world is largely depriving itself of the creativity and productivity of half its citizens," the report says of Arab women.
On education, the report reveals that the whole Arab world translates about 300 books annually -- one-fifth the number that Greece alone translates; investment in research is less than one-seventh the world average; and Internet connectivity is lower than in sub-Saharan Africa. In spite of progress in school enrollment, 65 million Arab adults are still illiterate, almost two-thirds of them women. No wonder half the Arab youths polled said they wanted to emigrate.
The report concludes that "What the region needs to ensure a bright future for coming generations is the political will to invest in Arab capabilities and knowledge, particularly those of Arab women, in good governance, and in strong cooperation between Arab nations. . . . The Arab world is at a crossroads. The fundamental choice is whether its trajectory will remain marked by inertia . . . and by ineffective policies that have produced the substantial development challenges facing the region; or whether prospects for an Arab renaissance, anchored in human development, will be actively pursued."
Well said -- and here's the best part: The report was written by a "group of distinguished Arab intellectuals" who believed that only an "unbiased, objective analysis" could help the "Arab peoples and policy-makers in search of a brighter future." 
There is a message in this bottle for America: For too many years we've treated the Arab world as just a big dumb gas station, and as long as the top leader kept the oil flowing, or was nice to Israel, we didn't really care what was happening to the women and children out back -- where bad governance, rising unemployment and a stifled intellectual life were killing the Arab future.
It's time to stop kidding ourselves. Getting rid of the Osamas, Saddams and Arafats is necessary to change this situation, but it's hardly sufficient. We also need to roll up our sleeves and help the Arabs address all the problems out back. The bad news is that they've dug themselves a mighty deep hole there. The good news, as this report shows, is that we have liberal Arab partners for change. It's time we teamed up with them, and not just with the bums who got them into this mess.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, It's Art For the City's Sake; 
Bloomberg's Hearty Embrace Signals A Whole New Approach at City Hall

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Something out of the ordinary happened when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented the annual Art Commission Awards this May. It wasn't the mayor's proclamation that public spaces should be beautiful, or that he stood around for an hour after the awards were presented, sipping cocktails. Rather, it was that he was there at all.
 "As an art commissioner with eight years of understanding that we were second-class citizens who were labeled obstructionists," said Bud Konheim, a commission member, "this sends a real signal. It always was, the mayor showed up once or twice and then the commissioner gave out the award. This year, we got reserved seats, he thanked each one of us personally and he gave out the award." 
 Since assuming office six months ago, Mr. Bloomberg has taken a quiet but significant interest in the arts, especially those in public spaces. His administration has borrowed sculptures from the Museum of Modern Art for the lawn at Gracie Mansion, and nine paintings and three sculptures on loan from the Whitney Museum of American Art came rolling into City Hall for use in Mr. Bloomberg's office. More sculptures will soon go up in historic City Hall Park.
Mr. Bloomberg has revived arts awards that were rarely given after Mayor Edward I. Koch left office, and he makes a point of attending the presentation ceremonies for them. When he swore in his cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, he did so at Gracie Mansion, and invited the city's art world to attend. Even the most prosaic of city property -- the Green Book, which is the official directory of city government -- will now have its cover graced by a reproduction of a Keith Haring image of the Statue of Liberty.
The Department of Cultural Affairs received among the most gentle of cuts to the city's budget this year, about 5 percent, compared with the 7 percent to 15 percent cuts most agencies had to endure. And this fall, the mayor made an "anonymous" $10 million gift from his personal fortune to help out arts groups.
"Mike was a strong supporter of the arts at his company," said Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris, who plays an important role in all things art-related in the administration. "As mayor, he realizes the arts and culture are the reason people want to live and stay here, and that they are strong economic engines. An arts organization in a community often transforms the environment."
Mr. Bloomberg has a long history of philanthropy in the arts. Before he was elected, he served on the boards of three cultural institutions in New York, two in London, and regularly gave money to various arts groups. His company, Bloomberg L.P., sponsors audio guides to cultural attractions in New York, and various public art projects through the Public Art Fund, such as the erection of 13 Keith Haring sculptures along Park Avenue in 1997. He adopted a sculpture on Randalls Island and sponsored its restoration.
Mr. Bloomberg has extended his interest in the arts to public life, in large part through Ms. Harris, who worked in the Koch administration when the city was one of the country's biggest recipients of federal art money in the country.
"Excellence in public design will be one of the hallmarks of my administration," Mr. Bloomberg told those assembled for the Art Commission awards. "It will be a guiding principle in city projects ranging from the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan to the reclamation of the city's waterfront for public use and enjoyment to the economic revitalization of communities in all five boroughs." And when the arts do not have money, he has made it clear to friends that he will dig into his own substantial checking account, particularly to support smaller arts groups.
As with all things related to art, subjectivity plays a role in the civic life of art, and Mr. Bloomberg's sensibilities are not shared by everyone.
For instance, the mayor supports resurrecting Christo's "The Gates, Project for Central Park, New York City," a proposal to drape trees in the park in saffron -- an idea many New Yorkers loathe. And one of the great historic buildings of the city, the Tweed Courthouse, will not be used as a museum as planned, but will instead house the Board of Education. Then there are the dog sculptures to be placed all over the city beginning in August. Some consider them cute; Rodin would probably not be jealous.
Mr. Bloomberg's eclectic taste in art is demonstrated by the wide range of paintings and sculptures from the Whitney he selected for his office, which he sometimes uses for meetings (the mayor spends most of his time in an open bullpen with his staff). There is a "Standing Lincoln" figure by Daniel Chester French, who designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, and "Big Orange," by the abstract expressionist painter Robert Motherwell. There is another piece by Keith Haring (yes, him again, a favorite of Mr. Bloomberg's), and a stunning 1913 painting of the Brooklyn Bridge, by Samuel Halpert.
The museum's curator gave the mayor several pieces of work to choose from, with Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Harris making the final cut. Many of the artists whose works were selected live or have lived in New York. Discussion of the work is encouraged. "My sense is that the mayor believes it is nice to work with beautiful objects," said Ms. Levin, whose agency was among the first Mr. Bloomberg visited after his election. "Just as important is being able to provoke discussion, to make people really think and be conscious."
Several of Mr. Bloomberg's more arts-friendly acts have garnered applause from the city's art leaders, many of whom were less than thrilled under the prior administration's sometimes combative stance toward the arts.
While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani earmarked huge capital budgets for the city's larger cultural institutions toward the end of his term, he alienated many arts groups by constantly proposing deep budget cuts, taking on the Brooklyn Museum after he found its "Sensation" exhibition offensive and then forming a decency commission to study what type of art was suitable for public financing.
"The arts community was very demoralized at the end of the Giuliani administration," said Susan Freedman, the president of the Public Art Fund. And Ms. Harris said Mr. Bloomberg would ensure that the Art Commission would regain the autonomy it had lost in recent years, when City Council members and Giuliani officials wanted to close the agency. (Former Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern once derided it for "arrogance, elitism and a patronizing attitude.")
Deborah Bershad, the executive director of the Art Commission, said yesterday: "This administration has brought a great sensitivity for the arts and culture. I think as a businessman he knows that how the city looks is very important."

HEADLINE: At the Front On Pollution 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
California has once again declared its intention to challenge the federal government for the lead in setting environmental policy in the United States.
 If signed by Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, a bill given final approval in the Assembly on Monday night would require cuts in the tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases by cars and light trucks. The law would be a major defeat for the auto industry in the nation's largest car market and a victory for a coalition of environmental groups and leading national Democrats. 
The state's action would be the first significant regulatory prod the auto industry has faced since standards on gas mileage were raised in the 1980's. It follows a failed effort in March in the United States Senate to increase fuel standards, the latest in a string of measures defeated by Republicans and Democrats from Midwestern states. 
The California legislation could alter what automobiles look like on the outside and under the hood over the next decade, and not just in California. The domestic auto industry fears that it could slow the huge growth in production of sport utility vehicles and pickups and put more pressure on General Motors and the Ford Motor Company to catch up to Toyota and Honda, which already make cars with hybrid engines that would help meet greenhouse gas standards. Toyota recently said it planned to have 300,000 hybrid vehicles on the road worldwide by the middle of the decade, putting its plans far ahead of those of the Big Three.
"This is rooted in the fact that California is the center of the environmental regulatory universe," said Christopher Preuss, a spokesman for General Motors, which opposed the legislation. "Whether it's feasible, reasonable or in the best interest of the citizens often takes a back seat to the environmental agenda."
Lawmakers around the country paid close attention to the legislation's progress. Two weeks ago, as the proposal appeared stalled, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, sponsors of a failed proposal to raise federal fuel economy requirements, wrote California legislators, urging them to put aside the auto industry's arguments in considering the bill.
"Be assured, California has an opportunity to do what we in Washington failed to achieve," they wrote, "to base your policy on sound science, instead of wildly distorted rhetoric."
In addition, over the weekend, the office of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, contacted a Democratic state assemblyman who was reportedly on the fence, telling him that Mr. Lieberman would be grateful if he voted for the legislation.
The legislation will have to survive an expected challenge in the courts by the auto industry, which has had mixed success in fighting previous efforts by California to push regulation far beyond the federal government's. Because its clean air regulations came before the passage of the federal Clean Air Act in the 1970's, California was allowed to keep its own standards, which other states are permitted to choose over federal standards.
The bill does not specify how much state regulators should cut emissions or propose how to do it. Instead, it directs the California Air Resources Board, an 11-member panel appointed by the governor, to develop by 2005 a plan for the "maximum feasible reduction" in emissions of the heat-trapping gases from cars and light trucks that are linked to global warming.
The Legislature would have a year to review the plan, though a further vote is not required. The regulations themselves would not take effect until the car model year 2009.
The final version of the bill left room for alternative methods of complying with the regulations but specified that the board could not impose mandatory weight reductions on vehicles, which the industry had held out as a safety risk. Nor could it impose taxes on miles traveled, lower speed limits or levy additional taxes on fuels or vehicles.
Left open is the most obvious avenue to environmental groups and automakers: forcing the industry to make cars that consume less gas, thus emitting less carbon dioxide, by adding fuel-saving technologies like hybrid engines that use gasoline and electricity, continuously variable transmissions or special starter-generators that shut off idling engines. The Big Three view such technologies as prohibitively expensive.
"If the industry believes California is a precursor to what will happen to the rest of the country, as it has been in the past," said John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, "then it would make sense to design cars to sell nationwide." 
The plan's vagueness disturbs automakers, who fear they could see the undoing of provisions they have defended in federal regulations, like a separate mileage standard for S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans that allows them to consume a third more gas than passenger cars.
"The industry took this piece of legislation very seriously," said Stuart Schorr, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, referring to the California measure. 
"Fuel economy is associated with some of the most important issues affecting automobiles, including safety, cost and the choice of what vehicles you can buy," Mr. Schorr said. 
Certainly the legislation might make it more difficult for General Motors to sell its Hummer, a sport utility version of the military transport and a favorite of the California resident Arnold Schwarzenegger. A newly released version of the Hummer, called the H2, intended for a wide audience, gets about 13 miles a gallon and is representative of the bulking up of the American automobile fleet. 
Last year, S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans outsold cars for the first time, a trend that has driven the gas mileage of the average new automobile to its lowest point in two decades.
In 1990, the state air resources board said it would require a certain percentage of each automaker's new vehicle sales to be vehicles with no tailpipe emissions, or ultra-low emission vehicles. The plan is still the subject of court challenges, and last month a federal court granted General Motors and DaimlerChrysler an injunction in a suit challenging it. But the air resources board interprets the ruling as speaking only to an amendment to the plan and expects automakers to comply starting next year.
Mr. Preuss of General Motors said the company was prepared to meet the standard by using credits from hundreds of electric vehicles it sold in the 1990's in the state and from neighborhood electric vehicles, which are like beefed-up golf carts, that it is donating to public institutions.
Industry officials say they are undecided whether to challenge the latest emissions bill now or wait until the air resources board comes up with a plan.
"There's been debate over whether California can regulate carbon dioxide because of their special status under the Clean Air Act," said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a coalition that includes all the major automakers except Honda. "We have viewed this in terms of its effect on federal fuel economy standards because the area of fuel economy is broadly reserved for the federal government."
Ms. Bergquist added that the alliance was also considering a referendum campaign in California.
Russell Long, executive director of Bluewater Network, a San Francisco environmental group that drafted the original version of the bill, said, "We will fully expect and will be prepared for a legal challenge from the auto industry."
"They have a long history of litigating any regulation that would improve fuel mileage and safety standards," Mr. Long added, "and I'm sure this one will be no exception."
According to a poll of 2,029 Californians released last week by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, 81 percent favor requiring automakers to further reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 2009, as outlined in the legislation passed on Monday. In addition, of the 23 percent of Californians who reported owning or leasing a sport utility vehicle, 77 percent supported the provisions in the measure. 
Cars and light trucks emit about 40 percent of greenhouse gas pollution in California, according to the Monday legislation.
An earlier version of the legislation foundered this spring, after the auto industry and its allies waged a campaign asserting that Californians would face higher taxes and maybe even have to give up driving S.U.V.'s if the measure passed. But with the bill's sponsors agreeing on some amendments, the environmental lobby struck back, hiring prominent political consultants and enlisting celebrities like Paul Newman. 
"The enviros weighed in like professionals," said John Burton, a Democrat and president pro tem of the State Senate who pushed the legislation through that chamber. 
Phillip L. Isenberg, a former assemblyman who represented the automakers and business interests aligned against the measure, agreed.
"It was a terrific lobbying campaign," said Mr. Isenberg, who asserted that the bill's backers went to California because they had been thwarted in Washington. "If you create enough commotion in enough states to get Bush and Congress to change their minds about mileage standards, that might be a good strategy."

HEADLINE: The Argonauts of 1776 

BYLINE:  By David McCullough; David McCullough is the author of "John Adams," which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for biography.

DATELINE: WEST TISBURY, Mass. 

 BODY:
"You will see in a few days a Declaration setting forth the causes which have impelled us to this mighty revolution . . . ." 
 From his boardinghouse in Philadelphia, John Adams was reporting to his wife, Abigail, in a letter dated July 3, 1776. Filled with emotion over events of the preceding day, Adams prophesied that July 2 would be celebrated for generations as a national festival. "It ought to be commemorated as the Day of Deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty," he wrote. "It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward ever more." 
 For on July 2, after weeks of intense debate behind closed doors, the Continental Congress had voted to proceed with a declaration of independence for the "United States of America," and this to Adams and others was the crucial decision. The die was cast. 
July 4, the day Congress adopted the final edited version of Thomas Jefferson's draft of the Declaration, seemed at the time to carry less historic importance. Nor was July 4 the day the document was signed. That took place a month later, on Aug. 2, and even then not all members were present. Those who were absent would sign later still. Only the president and the secretary of Congress, John Hancock and Charles Thomas, affixed their signatures on July 4, and Congress ordered the document printed and distributed to the press and the public at large.
It was the year after, 1777, when July 4 became the national day of festival. And so we will celebrate it today, "from one end of this continent to the other," just as Adams foresaw, except that in the present national mood, in the aftermath of last Sept. 11, there will be differences. We are at war again, and with patriotism running as strong as at almost any time in memory, our feelings will be abundantly on display, and from the heart, as perhaps never before.
But if Adams, or others of the 56 patriots who put their names on the Declaration of Independence, could imagine us celebrating what they did, how should we imagine them?
To begin with, they were not gods. Indeed, had they been they would deserve less honor and respect. Gods, after all, can do largely as they please. They were human and imperfect; each had his flaws and failings. Jefferson made the point in the very first line of the Declaration of Independence: "When in the course of human events . . . ." The key word is human.
The miracle was that imperfect mortals could so rise to the occasion, that such noble ideals and brilliant political leadership came to the fore as they did, that so few could, in the end, accomplish so much for all humankind.
With the exception of Benjamin Franklin, who was 70, and a few others, they were also younger than we usually think of them. Hancock was 39; Adams, 40; Jefferson, all of 33. The remarkable Benjamin Rush was younger still, 30. Further, the man in whom Congress had entrusted command of the fledgling American army bore little resemblance to the white-haired president with awkward teeth who looks out from the dollar bill. George Washington was 44 in 1776.
The odds against them in challenging the might of the British empire were overwhelming. None had had any experience in revolution-making. Or nation-making. And let us never forget they were setting out not only to triumph over the British Army and Navy, but to establish an entirely new nation. There was little at hand with which to fight a war -- almost no gunpowder, no navy and no money to speak of. There were few trained officers. Washington himself had never commanded an army in battle.
As daunting as almost anything was the lack of popular support for independence. Though war had broken out near Boston the year before, in the spring of 1775, the Americans who fought at Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill had been defending their rights as Englishmen, not fighting for independence. When, in late summer of 1775, Jefferson confided to a kinsman that he hoped still for a reconciliation with Great Britain, he was only expressing what was widely felt. By early 1776 about a third of the people were for independence, while another third remained adamantly opposed. The rest, in the old human way, were waiting to see who came out on top.
Had they been poll-driven, "risk-averse" politicians gathered in Philadelphia that fateful summer of 1776, they would have scrapped the whole idea of a "mighty revolution."
Those for independence argued passionately that there could be no real freedom without independence, no chance to "begin the world over again," as said in Thomas Paine's little pamphlet, "Common Sense."
We think we live in a dangerous, uncertain time, and we do. But theirs was worse, and they had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out, any more than we do. Their courage and determination, their commitment to what they called the Cause of America, were almost beyond our imagining. To sign your name to the Declaration of Independence was to declare yourself a traitor to the British Crown. If caught by enemy forces, you would almost certainly be hanged.
And consider that in that same first week of July 1776, the British fleet appeared in New York Harbor and began landing on Staten Island the largest force ever sent to crush a rebellion, fully 32,000 troops by the time they were all ashore. This was more than the entire population of Philadelphia, the largest city in America. When the signers of the Declaration pledged "our lives, our fortunes, our sacred honor," that was no mere rhetorical flourish.
The delegate Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, who was nearly as old as Franklin and suffered from palsy, is said to have remarked when his turn came to sign his name, "My hand trembles, but my heart does not."
When we see them in paintings, with their ruffled shirts and powdered hair, they look a little like fops, softies. But life then, at best, was tougher than we know, and they were, too, and the women no less than the men. John Adams predicted a long, costly struggle. "I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure it will cost us to maintain their Declaration," he told Abigail. "Yet through the gloom I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory. I can see the end is more than worth all the means."
For her part, at home in Massachusetts, raising their children, running the family farm, she had to cope with rampant inflation, shortages of all kinds, epidemic smallpox and her husband's endless absences in the service of the country. "Posterity who are to reap the blessings," she would write, "will scarcely be able to conceive the hardships and sufferings of their ancestors."
The Revolutionary War lasted eight years. Except for Vietnam it was the longest war in our history, and it was the most important. It was the birth of the nation. It made possible everything that followed. It gave us those "self-evident" truths at the heart of our whole way of life.
No one in Congress spoke for the need for a Declaration of Independence with greater force than John Adams. As is often said, Jefferson was the pen of independence; Adams, the voice.
Half a century later -- amazingly, unbelievably -- Jefferson and Adams died on that same day, July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. That spring, in a letter that touched Adams deeply, Jefferson had recalled how once in younger days, as "Argonauts," they had faced the perilous storms of a "heroic age." If ever there was a time to draw strength from their example, and renew our commitment to their Cause, it is now. Today's the day, their day of days. And we might well begin, as John Adams suggested, with expressions of gratitude to God Almighty.

PERSON: Harold Haley Haskin 

HEADLINE: Harold Haley Haskin, 87; Specialized in Saving Oyster 

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Harold Haley Haskin, a marine biologist who championed the cause of the oyster, died June 23 at his home in Cape May Court House, N.J., on the banks of his beloved Delaware Bay. He was 87.
 He was best known for his co-discovery of MSX, the parasite that nearly wiped out the once lucrative Delaware Bay oyster beds, and for breeding a strain of oysters resistant to it. He also helped the oyster navigate treacherous political waters by earning the trust of government authorities and the bay's oystermen, a crusty lot not overly fond of regulation. 
 "If you asked about oyster management in Delaware Bay, it would all come back to Hal Haskin," said John Kraeuter, the associate director of Rutgers University's Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory in Bivalve, N.J. (The laboratory was named for Dr. Haskin in 1991.) "What Hal said, or what he convinced the oystermen about, was the way it happened."
Dr. Haskin was born Harold Haley in Niagara Falls, N.Y., on Jan. 3, 1915. His parents died in the flu epidemic of 1918, and he was adopted by a family friend, Frederick J. Haskin, who moved with him to Salem, N.J., near Delaware Bay. 
While studying at Rutgers College, he got a summer job on the Jersey Shore studying the biology of the oyster drill, a snail that eats oysters. After serving in the Army during World War II and earning his Ph.D. from Harvard in the physiology of algae (the oyster's favorite food), he returned, in 1946, to the Rutgers zoology department, and stayed for the rest of his career.
Dr. Haskin is survived by his wife, Peggy; their five children, Kathleen Haskin of New York City; Jean Haley of North Kingstown, R.I.; Elizabeth Haskin of Cape May Court House; Frederick James Haskin of Piscataway, N.J.; and Mary D. Haskin of Washington; and four grandchildren.
Working in a succession of laboratories, from a houseboat to the modern facility named for him, Dr. Haskin devoted himself to studying the oyster and its habitat. 
During the first half of the 20th century, oyster schooners brought up to 2.4 million bushels a year into Bivalve, one of the nation's oyster capitals. But the industry relied heavily on young "seed oysters" transplanted from other waters, and by the 1950's, the combination of overfishing and deterioration of the seed beds was depleting stocks.
Dr. Haskin persuaded the state management agency to start collecting data on oyster populations and convinced oystermen that the harvest needed to be restricted. He and his wife also lobbied state officials to preserve water quality throughout the Delaware River Basin.
"He started worrying about oyster biology and the populations and the fisheries 40 or 50 years ago, when it really wasn't the trendy thing to be doing," said Sandra Shumway, the editor of The Journal of Shellfish Research.
After the parasite MSX (for multinucleated sphere unknown) killed almost all the oyster of Delaware Bay in 1957, Dr. Haskin helped guide the industry to recovery, but in 1990, another parasite, Dermo, again wiped out large numbers of oysters.
The Delaware Bay oyster industry is still alive, though struggling, bringing in about 50,000 bushels a year. To the end of his life, Dr. Haskin continued to work to bridge economic and ecological interests and train the next generation of oyster researchers.
"I am not one of those who believes in keeping everything just the way it is in the name of conservation," he once said. "I think we can arrange things to serve many different needs, but we have to recognize we have a very valuable, renewable resource here, and the pressures on it are already great."

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Proposes End to Tax Benefit on Executives' Insurance 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service proposed rules today that would eliminate the tax benefit on life insurance policies used by corporations to pay their executives. 
 The proposed regulations, which were issued for public comment, would require that executives pay annual income tax on the cash accumulated in whole, universal or variable universal life policies when their companies pay the premiums. The payments amount to an interest-free loan, the agency said. An estimated 115,000 executives and employers will be affected by the rules. 
 The regulations deal with the tax on so-called split-dollar life insurance arrangements, or ownership and premium payment arrangements that involve some kind of cash-value life insurance. Many companies offer such policies to executives as compensation by paying premiums on insurance held by the executive or by a trust set up by the executive. 
The I.R.S. became concerned about the arrangements in 1996 because investment accounts financed with corporate dollars were building cash value tax-free for the executives, who can borrow against the buildup or use it as a death benefit. 
The regulations would for the first time differentiate between policies owned by employers and those owned by employees. The rules would not apply to existing policies. 
Employees who own policies with premiums paid by employers would owe taxes unless they pay market-rate interest on the premium, the regulations say.
Experts say the proposal reverses a decision by the I.R.S. in February that suggested that taxes were owed only on the cash value when a policy was terminated.
"The employee is going to have to come up with the cash to pay for this tax," said Ivan Taback, a lawyer in the personal planning department at Proskauer Rose in New York. "This will make an equity split-dollar arrangement less attractive as a matter of executive compensation." 
The decision is a setback for the life insurance industry, which has fought any effort to tax the cash buildup in split-dollar life insurance or at least postpone collection of the tax until the policy was terminated. 
"This would be a sea change," said Laurie Lewis, chief counsel for tax policy at the American Council of Life Insurers.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
New chips can keep atight rein on consumers, even after they buy a product.

BYLINE:  By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. E-mail: hal@sims.berkeley.edu.

 BODY:
AS chips get cheaper, products get smarter. Sometimes they can get too smart for their own good.
 Consider the following examples of products that are capable of limiting how they are used: 
 *Some inkjet printers have chips in their ink cartridges that prevent operation if the cartridge has been refilled. 
*Cellphones sometimes come with chips in their batteries that prevent operation if the battery isn't the right brand.
*Compact discs can have copy-protection systems that keep them from being played in personal computer drives.
Until recently, the after-purchase use of a product has been crudely controlled via contracts, licensing or mechanical design, but now it can easily be controlled through chips and cryptography.
Microsoft recently announced Palladium, a plan for creating secure computing platforms. The Palladium architecture creates an operating environment that allows only digitally signed software to be executed. That should, in principle, help eliminate computer viruses and other sorts of security problems.
But Palladium can also be used for digital-rights management on your PC. This means that only certified programs could be run, and only certified content could be displayed. At the level of bits, censorship and digital-rights management are technologically identical.
Ross Anderson, a computer security expert at the University of Cambridge, described some of the implications of Palladium at a recent conference in Toulouse, France.
What are the economic implications of technologies that can control after-purchase use? The answer depends on how competitive the markets are. Take the inkjet printer market. If cartridges have a high profit margin but the market for printers is competitive, competition will push down the price of printers to compensate for the high-priced cartridges. Restricting after-purchase use makes the monopoly in cartridges stronger (since it inhibits refills), but that just makes sellers compete more intensely to sell printers, leading to lower prices in that market. This is just the old story of "give away the razor and sell the blades." 
But if the industry supplying the products isn't very competitive, then controlling after-purchase behavior can be used to extend a monopoly from one market to another. The markets for software operating systems and for music and video content are highly concentrated, so partnerships between these two industries should be viewed with suspicion. Such partnerships could easily be used to benefit incumbents and to restrict potential entrants, a point made by Mr. Anderson.
But there is another set of problems associated with controlling after-purchase use: these technologies can reduce innovation.
Eric von Hippel, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has documented the importance of "user innovation" in industries as diverse as integrated circuits and mountain biking.
Professor von Hippel's surveys show that roughly a quarter of the users of computer-aided-design software report developing innovations for their own use. One-fifth of mountain bike users do the same thing.
Manufacturers invest heavily in research and development to discover new uses for their products. But the users are often better innovators. After all, the users are closer to the problem: they rely on the products every day for a variety of tasks in a variety of environments, so it is not surprising that they come up with uses the manufacturer never thought of.
Professor von Hippel argues that user innovation is such a strong force that companies should provide tool kits that allow users to experiment with their products.
Such innovation may be sharply curtailed if manufacturers are able to control after-purchase use. Consider the three examples previously mentioned.
A hot area of computer-chip research design involves taking off-the-shelf inkjet printers, loading the cartridges with magnetic ink and squirting integrated circuits onto metalized plastic. That technology may revolutionize integrated circuit production -- but it definitely requires using products in ways the manufacturer didn't intend.
What about cellphone batteries? There are now hand pumps that allow you to produce enough juice to charge your own batteries. Inventors are experimenting with putting such pumps in your shoes so you can charge your cellphone by merely walking around. This would be great for users, but it is hard to experiment with such technologies if you can use only certain power sources in your cellphone.
Digital-rights management can also reduce innovation. The No. 1 song in England today is a remix of a 30-year-old Elvis B-side single, "A Little Less Conversation." Nike commissioned a Dutch disc jockey, JXL, to do the remix for its World Cup ad campaign. He tweaked the instrumental balance and added a techno back beat to create a fresh new sound.
That sort of thing will be simply impossible if digital rights management becomes commonplace.
One might argue that impediments to user innovation could be overcome by negotiation. After all, Nike got permission from Elvis's estate to do the remix. Surely companies will see that it is in their interest to encourage customers' innovations?
Maybe not. Typically, innovators need to experiment before they approach manufacturers or rights owners. But once they have made the investment to figure out whether the innovation is promising, their bargaining power is reduced. At that point, the rights' owners hold all the cards, and they can choose licensing fees to extract most of the benefits of the innovation. That, of course, reduces the incentives for user innovation in the first place.
Could the innovators approach rights owners before they experiment? Well, anyone can claim to be an innovator. How would the rights owners know who should get permission to circumvent their technology?
Either way, innovation is discouraged, hurting not only consumers but also producers. Too much control can be a bad thing, particularly when innovation is a critical source of competitive advantage.

HEADLINE: Signs of Growth in Economic Indicators 

BYLINE:  By Dow Jones/AP 

 BODY:
The services sector grew for a fifth consecutive month in June but at a slower pace, while factory orders in May rose more than expected, according to reports released yesterday. In addition, weekly jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since March 2001, the government said.
 In the service sector, the Institute for Supply Management, formerly known as the National Association of Purchasing Management, said its nonmanufacturing index for June moved to 57.2 after rising to 60.1 in May from 55.3 in April. Index readings above 50 indicate expansion of activity and prices in the nonmanufacturing sector, while readings under 50 denote contraction. 
 The nonmanufacturing index mostly comprises services, and covers the two-thirds of the economy that is not involved in manufacturing. 
Economists had expected the index to have cooled a bit, forecasting a drop to 59.0. 
Ralph Kauffman, who directs the survey for the institute, said businesses were "cautiously optimistic" about the outlook. 
"Responses from our members indicated that there is no hurry to hire workers," Mr. Kauffman said, but "rather a hesitation until they can be more confident that the recovery will continue." 
The institute's new-orders index moved to 56.9 for June, from 56.8 in May. The June reading was the highest since February. The service sector employment index weakened, standing at 44.3, after 49.5 the previous month. 
The jobs component comes as the Labor Department reported yesterday that weekly claims for jobless benefits fell to a 15-month low. For the week ending June 29, new applications for unemployment insurance fell by a seasonally adjusted 11,000, to 382,000, the department said. 
That was the lowest level since March 24, 2001, and the fifth consecutive week below 400,000. The more stable four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, dipped to 392,000, the lowest in just over three months. 
Economists considered the decline as an encouraging sign that the pace of layoffs was stabilizing.
In another report by the Commerce Department, orders to factories rose by 0.7 percent in May, the same increase as the month before and the third month in a row of growth in factory orders. 
The report offered additional evidence that manufacturers, hardest hit by last year's recession, continue to revive. 
Computers, machinery and metal products were among the categories posting gains in orders, while cars and household appliances showed declines.
Orders for nondurable goods, like food and clothes, went up 0.4 percent, down from a 0.9 percent increase the month before.

HEADLINE: Southwest Losing Its Immunity To Labor Conflicts of Airlines 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines, long known for warm relations with its employees, has run into a cold front.
 Its 4,111 pilots began voting yesterday on a contract extension that their own union leaders do not endorse because it falls short of the pay parity with other airlines that the union promised to win for its members. 
 A rejection by the pilots is unlikely to ground the airline, based in Dallas, because the pilots operate under a 10-year agreement that does not expire until 2004. But their frustration suggests a summer of potential labor problems for Southwest, the only profitable major carrier in the United States. 
On Monday, Southwest's 1,300 mechanics, after a two-year contract dispute with the airline, asked a federal mediator to try to work out a new contract after they rejected an offer that included raises below those won by mechanics elsewhere in the industry.
Talks are under way with Southwest's flight attendants, and the airline will soon open negotiations with its reservations and customer service agents.
Moreover, Southwest and its union representing ground workers have yet to settle a lawsuit over Southwest's use of government employee-screening data to discipline and even fire some workers.
Southwest's chief executive, James F. Parker, said in an interview that he saw no threat that the contract disputes would cripple relations between workers and management. And some analysts agree.
Betsy Snyder, transportation analyst at Standard & Poor's, remarked, "It's troubling, but I don't see things getting as acrimonious as they do at other airlines." 
And Kevin C. Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, an industry group in Philadelphia that represents corporate travel departments and business travelers, said: "If this were any other airline, I'd say, 'Look away and sell your stock.' Here, there is trust."
Southwest employees share directly in the airline's success, with a lucrative profit-sharing plan tied into the company's pension program -- an arrangement, analysts say, that has made paper millionaires of some pilots, even with salaries 30 to 70 percent lower than those at other airlines.
"The average employee and union leaders alike realize the key success factor is the ability to be the low-cost airline," said Vaughn Cordle, an industry analyst who is also a pilot with United Airlines.
Nonetheless, Southwest's pilots, spurred by the airline's financial success at a time other carriers were struggling, had planned to reopen negotiations last fall, but put them off after the attacks on Sept. 11.
The disagreement over pay remains unresolved. The union, the Southwest Airline Pilots Association, argued that pilots at United Airlines, for example, earned $190.50 an hour flying Boeing 737 jets, which make up Southwest's entire fleet. A Southwest pilot, the union said, earns about $140 an hour.
Pay parity was the crucial platform plank for the current group of union leaders, who were elected in 2000 on a pledge to win significant raises. With elections again scheduled in September, the pilots' union sought to resume contract talks this spring, only in a much different competitive atmosphere. Though Southwest was profitable in 2001 and is likely to remain profitable, Mr. Cordle estimates that Southwest's revenue will decline 12 percent. Over the last 20 years, revenue has increased on average by 14 percent annually.
In his latest offer to the union, Mr. Parker proposed an extension of the current contract by two years, through 2006, and raises totaling 35 percent over the next four years. But that deal did not bring the union close to levels at other airlines. After a 27-hour meeting last month, the union's board deadlocked on recommending the offer to the pilots.
"As a matter of principle, I think we can do better," said Jonathan Weaks, president of Southwest's pilots' union. The union leaders said they nonetheless sent the offer to the members for a vote because they thought that the pilots should have a chance to express their opinions directly. Mr. Weaks said he favored a complete overhaul of the contract.
Analysts say Mr. Parker can afford to pay Southwest's pilots the same rates as at other airlines, given the carrier's financial strength and labor productivity. Southwest pilots, for example, fly an average of 80 to 90 hours a month, compared with about 50 hours a month at other major airlines. Southwest can also turn planes around more quickly than its competitors, and its maintenance costs are lower because it focuses on just one type of aircraft. At the same time, its low fares attract budget-conscious fliers, to the disadvantage of its rivals.
Southwest wants to do everything it can to protect that advantage, said Mr. Cordle, the analyst and pilot. Union officials, he maintained, accustomed to the company's history of friendly relationships and to the idea that employees' compensation is tied to the company's financial success, will not press Southwest for the last penny.
Mr. Parker said employees understand that the competitive landscape has significantly changed since Sept. 11. While he does not expect the airline industry's lower passenger traffic to be permanent, "what is normal is that people care about how much it costs to fly," he said.
Still, a rejection of the pilots' contract extension would be the second no vote in two months for Mr. Parker, who became chief executive of Southwest in June 2001. In a vote last month, 98 percent of the airline's mechanics rejected its offer of annual raises of 2 and 3 percent through 2006. 
Members of the Transport Workers Union, representing the ground workers, are awaiting a judge's ruling on their suit seeking to block Southwest from using information from government background checks to discipline employees. At least one worker was fired based on government data that Southwest would not have otherwise obtained, said Edward Cloutman, a Dallas lawyer representing the union in the suit.
The union is seeking an agreement similar to one that Northwest Airlines reached with its unions, in which Northwest agreed not to use information more than 10 years old.
Mr. Cloutman, who has dealt with Mr. Parker for years, said employees' frustration has increased as the airline grew in size. Management is "is not as familiar as it used to be," he said, "and they are not as flexible as employees would like them to be," although he agreed that cordiality remains.

HEADLINE: Blocks; 
In Downtown Brooklyn, Too Tall Suddenly Fits

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
UNDER the height limits for Downtown Brooklyn enacted last summer, buildings are measured in feet. It turns out that the height limits themselves, at least on one block, could be measured in months.
 Revising its own 120-foot cap along Boerum Place that it enacted just 11 months ago, the City Planning Commission last week unanimously approved Brooklyn Law School's plan to build a 265-foot, 22-story dormitory at the corner of State Street. 
 There is nothing unusual about rezoning; the city would calcify if the rules were not periodically revised. But changes are usually accompanied by the rationale that the existing zoning was drafted in the distant past by planners who could not have foreseen the consequences of their actions. 
In this case, though, eight of the nine commission members who voted for the dormitory were those who favored height limits a year ago. That includes the chairman at the time, Joseph B. Rose, who still sits on the commission.
Amanda M. Burden, the current chairwoman, said she fully supported the dormitory plan even though she voted for the original limits. "The density proposed for the dormitory is appropriate for the Boerum Place corridor," Ms. Burden said, "and the rest of the district rezoned last year will continue to act as a buffer to the adjacent neighborhoods."
Boerum Place is a wide and busy thoroughfare on which buildings north of the dormitory site already exceed 120 feet. The area "will benefit from a vibrant use that will populate the streets," Ms. Burden said. "Just getting to Brooklyn Law School occupies at least half the time of these students. Providing this needed amenity seems critical to me." 
There would be room for 407 students, almost three times the number the school can currently house. "We're not a rapacious developer that's trying to make more money," said the dean, Joan G. Wexler. "This is a critical need."
Moreover, Ms. Wexler said, the building "will add immeasurable beauty to a block that is currently an eyesore." The designers are Robert A. M. Stern Architects and Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron Architects. The $70 million project is to be completed in 2004. Mr. Stern designed the recent addition to the law school's main building two blocks away on Joralemon Street. 
THE brownstone neighbors in Boerum Hill and Brooklyn Heights say they appreciate the law school and would welcome a dormitory at a smaller scale.
But they worry that the 265-foot proposal will set a precedent. "With the pressure to rebuild New York, any other private developer who doesn't like height limits is going to be emboldened to seek variances," said Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association.
More than anything else, they are dismayed that regulatory controls they had been seeking for more than a dozen years are already being eroded. The limits are meant to create a transition between the high-rise towers downtown and the abutting brownstone blocks.
"What is the point of empowering residents to recommend regulations if variances are granted that are antithetical to the ideals that the zoning restrictions were based on?" asked Assemblywoman Joan L. Millman, who represents the district.
Most of the dormitory's bulk would not be on Boerum Place but set back in the middle of the block, where the tallest building is a five-story parochial school. This setback accommodates the south-facing windows in the co-op apartment next door, at 96 Schermerhorn Street.
Borough President Marty Markowitz has proposed that the dormitory be allowed to rise 210 feet on Boerum Place, akin to its neighbors, but drop down to 120 feet on State Street. Community Board 2 and the Brooklyn Heights Association are among those who have endorsed his proposal.
But Ms. Wexler said the plan would reduce the number of beds to 301, thereby reducing the income necessary to pay off the debt by 29 percent. "Even 400 beds isn't going to meet our needs," she said. Besides that, the borough president's plan would block windows at 96 Schermerhorn Street, she said.
The matter goes next to the City Council. Councilman David Yassky, who represents the district, will recuse himself because he is a faculty member of the law school, currently on leave.
Although the height limits took effect on his watch, Mr. Rose said the rezoning was handled appropriately.
"This was done expeditiously for a good reason, through the proper public process and in response to a new set of facts," he said. "What remains to be done -- and the communities have a right to demand -- is an explanation of how this particular action relates to a coherent and predictable set of zoning regulations for this part of Downtown Brooklyn."
However, Heloise Gruneberg, president of the Boerum Hill Association, fears that the damage has already occurred. 
"Why did we work so hard to get the 120-foot limit?" she asked. "You can't convince people to work for the good of their neighborhoods any longer because a year later someone will come along and say, 'Legislation is made to be changed.' That breaks the spirit of civic-minded people."

HEADLINE: Continental-US Airways Talks Break Off 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Continental Airlines said yesterday that it was breaking off negotiations with US Airways about a partnership in which the two carriers would have booked passengers on each other's flights.
 The partnership, called a code-share alliance, would have allowed the airlines to advertise more destinations by listing both carriers' flights in their computer reservations systems. Under such arrangements, passengers can choose which airline's frequent-flier program will be credited with miles. Continental and Northwest already have such an alliance. 
 Continental has said for the last month or so that it was in talks with US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest carrier, about forming an alliance. US Airways has been talking to every major carrier except Delta Air Lines about a partnership in hopes of bolstering a restructuring plan. Continental and United, a unit of UAL, were regarded by many people in the industry as the two front-runners.
But Continental, the fifth-largest carrier, said yesterday that the discussions had ended.
"Continental made the decision after it determined that an agreement would not be reached in the near future," the company said in a statement. A person close to the discussions said that "Continental thought that it had a deal, and US Airways reneged and kept coming back for more." He declined to elaborate.
David Castelveter, a spokesman at US Airways, declined to comment yesterday on Continental's decision.
That move leaves United, the second-largest carrier, as the leader in the talks. Last week, Greg Taylor, senior vice president for planning at United, said his airline was "far and away the best fit" and that an agreement was close to being reached. But the agreement would be subject to approval by the pilots' union at each airline, he said.
"There's no change in discussions," Susana Leyva, a spokeswoman for United, said yesterday.
Mr. Taylor said that the alliance could generate "north of" $200 million a year for each carrier. Airlines do not share revenue in such an arrangement. Instead, they pay the other carrier a booking fee if a reservation is made on the other airline. Most of the additional revenue would come from passengers booking multileg flights that end up using both airlines to destinations that neither airline could reach alone.
If United and US Airways reach an agreement, it will then be submitted to the Department of Transportation, which would review it for antitrust issues. If the department takes no action -- the review process normally takes a month but can be extended up to six months -- then the code-share alliance can take effect. Last July, the Justice Department blocked a proposed buyout of US Airways by United, but a code-sharing arrangement would be different because the two carriers would still be expected to compete against each other.
Although the entire industry was hit hard by the Sept. 11 attacks and the downturn of the economy, US Airways and United have suffered more than the other large carriers. US Airways reported a loss of $269 million last quarter and $2 billion last year, while United lost $510 million last quarter and a record $2.1 billion last year. Both airlines have applied to the federal government for loan guarantees, and a code-share alliance between them would help those applications.
On the air-fare front, American Airlines, a unit of AMR, raised fares on companion round-trip leisure tickets by $20 yesterday afternoon, and United and Delta quickly matched the increase. The rise is unlikely to stick, however, unless all the major carriers match it. There have been three attempts since April by a major carrier to raise leisure fares, but they were short-lived because competitors did not follow suit.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Buys Time For a Budget Full of Risk 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 3 

 BODY:
The budget adopted by the Legislature on Tuesday allows Gov. James E. McGreevey to claim credit for closing a projected multibillion-dollar deficit without resorting to the kinds of tax increases that doomed his Democratic predecessor, Jim Florio, to a single term.
 But Mr. McGreevey's $23.4 billion budget plan, which relies on increased cigarette taxes, business taxes and an assortment of one-time revenue sources, does little to address the state's underlying fiscal problems and may be merely postponing the painful choices about program cuts until next year, legislators and experts on state finance say. 
 Each year, New Jersey's operating expenses exceed its expected sources of income by about $3 billion. That structural deficit leaves state officials to choose between spending cuts, tax increases, borrowing or fanciful accounting.
Gov. Christie Whitman relied largely on borrowing: state debt more than doubled during her two terms. Mr. Florio opted for steep increases in broad-based sales and income taxes, inciting a political uprising. Mr. McGreevey, who preached about austerity and fiscal restraint, actually increased state spending by 9 percent and paid for it by borrowing, draining the surpluses from a variety of special state funds and enacting carefully targeted increases in certain taxes and fees.
By exhausting most of the available one-time sources of income, and leaving the state with a modest $100 million reserve fund, the governor will have few easy options to finance next year's budget. Given the weak economy, and New Jersey's reliance on income and capital gains taxes derived from the stock market, many analysts suspect that the budget shortfall will be worse next year unless Wall Street rebounds remarkably.
"There's still a substantial need for New Jersey and other states to readjust their spending," said Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service. "So the state is not out of the woods by any means. There are very difficult decisions still ahead."
For now, most Democrats are delighted to revel in Mr. McGreevey's short-term victory. The backlash that followed the Florio tax increases of 1990 cost Democrats both houses of the Legislature and a decade in political exile, so they are willing to stand behind Mr. McGreevey's plan and cross their fingers for an economic turnaround.
"We did make a lot of sacrifices in this budget -- freezing aid to schools and municipalities, cutting aid to colleges and universities, restricting enrollment to the family care health care program," said Assemblywoman Loretta D. Weinberg, a Democrat from Bergen County. "But it's unrealistic to think that one budget can solve all the problems with the economy and all the borrowing of the past eight years. The governor deserves credit for getting us through this crisis and waiting to see whether an economic recovery can handle the rest. If we can do that, and avoid inflicting more pain, why wouldn't we do that?"
But Republicans say the governor did not even begin to address some of the factors that drive New Jersey's spending -- its school funding formula and state payroll. They also charge that it is hypocritical of Mr. McGreevey, who has harshly criticized his predecessors for raising the state debt, to plug his own budget gap by borrowing $1.1 billion against the state's proceeds from the tobacco settlement.
"This budget does nothing to reform budgeting in New Jersey; we're simply papering over the problems with the tobacco bonds," said Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon County. "The administration is simply forestalling the inevitable."
The governor did manage to rein in one of the most visible signs of wasteful state spending, however, the supplemental expenditures for legislators' pet projects known as "Christmas tree" items. In the past, those projects have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Instead, Mr. McGreevey formed several grant funds, totaling $46 million, that will be used to finance pet projects that meet criteria set by the governor's office.
But in addition to the recurrent structural deficit and the bad economy, New Jersey faces several worrisome prospects this year. Mr. McGreevey's budget counts on receiving $478 million in federal money for nursing home care and health care that is not guaranteed to come through. The state's contribution to the employees' pension fund is also expected to increase $700 million to $800 million this year, according to budget experts.
Barring an economic recovery, those factors are likely to force Mr. McGreevey to once again face some of the unpopular options he managed to sidestep in this budget, like raising the gasoline tax, cutting spending for social services or curtailing the property tax rebate program.
But Mr. McGreevey said the budget was an important first step in putting the state's finances on stable footing.
"The most important thing we did was to achieve a balanced budget based on realistic revenue assessments," he said. "If things are still difficult next year, we'll continue the treatment."

Toy Importer Settles Suit On Violating Safety Rules
A California company, Ameri-China International, and its president have agreed to pay $140,000 to settle a suit by the Consumer Product Safety Commission that accused it of importing 755,000 toys with small pieces that could harm children younger than 3.
 The settlement is the third case in four months against importers in the Los Angeles area. In all the cases, the companies specialize in importing inexpensive toys that are sold in independent discount and neighborhood stores or on the street. Page C3. 

Continental Ends US Airways Talks
Continental Airlines has broken off talks with US Airways about a partnership in which the two carriers would have booked passengers on each other's flights. The decision was a setback for US Airways, which had been seeking such an arrangement, and leaves United as the front-runner for any possible agreement. C2.

Factory Orders Rose in May
Factory orders rose 0.7 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported, an indication that manufacturers, hardest hit by last year's recession, are seeing a recovery. The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index for June moved to 57.2 after rising to 60.1 in May. In addition, weekly jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since March 2001, the government said. C3.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.22 points, to 9,054.97. The Nasdaq composite index was up 22.35 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,380.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.90 points, or 0.6 percent, to 953.99. C6.

Xerox Pays Auditor $71.6 Million
Xerox, in a 2001 proxy statement, reported that it had paid $71.6 million last year to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting company that replaced KPMG. The fees covered auditing as well as consulting duties. C6.

California Fines Energy Companies
Several energy companies, including Dynegy, Reliant and Williams, were fined a total of $122 million during California's power crisis for failing to deliver energy, the California Independent System Operator disclosed. C3.

I.R.S. Is Ending Insurance Benefit
The Internal Revenue Service has proposed to eliminate the tax benefit on life insurance policies used by corporations to pay their executives. The change would require that executives pay annual income tax on the cash accumulated in life insurance policies when their companies pay the premiums. C3.

Brazil and Mexico Sign Trade Pact
The presidents of Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two biggest economies, have signed a bilateral trade deal. The two countries trade little with each other now, $2.6 billion worth of goods and services last year, and hope the deal bolsters their struggling economies. World Business, Section W.

Changes at Credit Suisse
The Credit Suisse Group, facing waning investor confidence, announced that Lukas Muhlemann would step down as chairman next year but continue as chief executive. Investors had been pushing Mr. Muhlemann to give up one post, attributing many of Credit Suisse's problems to his strategy of mixing banking and insurance. World Business, Section W.

Different Controls on Products
Until recently, the after-purchase use of products like cellphones, inkjet printers or CD's, has been crudely controlled by contracts, licensing or mechanical design. But now, use can be controlled through chips and cryptography. The economic implications of such control depend on how competitive the markets are. Economic Scene: Hal R. Varian. C2.

Inquiry Finds Effort at Delay At WorldCom

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD and SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Before he was dismissed, the former chief financial officer of WorldCom urged an internal corporate auditor to suspend her review of certain company accounts that ultimately turned up almost $4 billion in misallocated expenses, people involved in the case said yesterday.
 Postponing the internal audit might have enabled WorldCom to take a write-off for the expenses eventually, rather than disclose the bookkeeping problems that led to the current crisis. 
 The chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan -- who was removed from his post last week after the board learned of the accounting problems -- tried to persuade the internal auditor, Cynthia Cooper, to postpone her review of the capital accounts shortly after she began the audit in May, these people said. 
Instead of demanding that Ms. Cooper abandon the audit project completely, Mr. Sullivan urged her to take it up again later in the year, they said. Such a delay might have enabled the company to begin recognizing the expenses that had been deferred. Indeed, on June 20 -- four days before he was fired -- Mr. Sullivan told the audit committee of WorldCom's board that he had been planning to "write down" the expenses in the second quarter, according to a document filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
People examining the matter say that the effort to defer the audit was part of an effort by Mr. Sullivan to explain away bookkeeping practices that he also tried to justify in a June 24 memo he submitted to the board in an eleventh-hour effort to save his job. A copy of that memo was given to The New York Times yesterday by a person involved in the investigation of WorldCom's accounting.
Also yesterday, a federal judge in Manhattan overseeing the S.E.C.'s fraud suit against the company appointed a former S.E.C. chairman, Richard C. Breeden, to review payments to the company's officers and see that WorldCom does not destroy documents as that case proceeds. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court, set late March as the date for the government to begin formally presenting its case.
The shifting of expenses at the heart of the WorldCom accounting scandal was orchestrated by Mr. Sullivan, whose determination of how financial outlays would be expensed enabled WorldCom to report profits that the company now says should have been recorded as losses. 
Investigators have determined that no documentation exists to support the dollar amounts in each shift, people involved in the case said. That would indicate that Mr. Sullivan was making his determinations without any empirical data to support his judgments. The amounts of those shifts, however, perfectly coincided with what WorldCom needed to hit its projected profit margins. 
Aron Raskas, a lawyer for Mr. Sullivan, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Witnesses have already informed investigators about the attempt by Mr. Sullivan to postpone the internal audit, people involved in the case said. A result, lawyers said, is that Ms. Cooper could prove to be a critical witness if prosecutors determine that the bookkeeping shifts were intentionally fraudulent criminal acts. 
Ms. Cooper is already being seen as an important witness in the criminal investigation, these people said. Yesterday, the House Financial Services Committee, which is investigating the WorldCom debacle and plans a hearing on Monday, withdrew its invitation for Ms. Cooper to testify, in response to a request from the Justice Department. The committee also withdrew its invitation to Max E. Bobbitt, the head of the WorldCom board's audit committee, who also played a central role in the internal inquiry.
"When you have a key witness to certain events, the last thing you want to do is force them to testify on the record before it's absolutely necessary," one person involved in the case said. "All that does is create prior testimony that can be used to attack the witness."
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Ms. Cooper met with resistance when she confronted Mr. Sullivan with evidence of what she had found during the May audit. But the new disclosures are the first indication that Mr. Sullivan tried to impede and delay the audit that eventually proved his undoing. 
Once Ms. Cooper went past Mr. Sullivan, the effort to determine the facts behind the accounting problem moved quickly. On the morning of June 12, they said, she brought the information to Mr. Bobbitt's attention. By that afternoon, Mr. Bobbitt, Ms. Cooper and the lead partner on the WorldCom account from KPMG, the company's new auditors, had discussed the matter by phone. The next day, Mr. Bobbitt, and the KPMG partner, Farrell Malone, went to Clinton, Miss., where WorldCom is based, to meet with Ms. Cooper and discuss her findings. 
Over the next several days, these people said, Ms. Cooper and then Mr. Malone met with Mr. Sullivan and another WorldCom executive to discuss the matter. After each interview, Mr. Bobbitt was briefed. Ultimately, they said, Mr. Bobbitt decided to alert other members of the audit committee, as well as the group's lawyers, to disclose what had been discovered.
Meanwhile, people close to the company say that they are awaiting the next step by KPMG, with some fearing that the accounting firm may choose to walk away from the account. As more years of WorldCom's performance fall under review, these people said, they fear that KPMG may find itself in conflict because of other client representations it had in the past.
"KPMG has some significant decisions to make," one person close to the company said. "Can we restate the results of 2001 without restating 2000? And do we even want this engagement?"
George Ledwith, a spokesman for KPMG, declined to comment. 
Ultimately, KPMG proved critical in the internal investigation that began after Ms. Cooper's discovery of the improper accounting. When Mr. Sullivan made a presentation to the audit committee on June 20, offering his reasons for the expense shift, KPMG auditors delicately explained that the explanation did not meet accounting rules. Afterward, Mr. Sullivan was asked to put the information in writing, in a memo that is now known as "the white paper." 
In that three-page memo, dated June 24, Mr. Sullivan explained that WorldCom had signed deals to obtain more capacity than it needed, believing that the growth of the industry would mean the capacity would be needed in the future. Thus it would be paying for capacity it could not use in the early years.
"The decision to significantly increase capital investment was based upon the common belief at the time that the Internet and data demand would continue at the eight times annual growth factor the industry was experiencing," Mr. Sullivan wrote in the memo.
The essential part of Mr. Sullivan's argument is that arranging for the capacity was necessary to get customers to sign up, and that therefore it amounted to a cost of obtaining customers. And that cost, he said, could be amortized over the life of the revenue stream from the customer.
Mr. Sullivan cited as authority an S.E.C. accounting bulletin, No. 101. But Lynn Turner, who was the commission's chief accountant at the time that bulletin was issued, said yesterday that it provided no support for Mr. Sullivan's arguments.
"It is very clear, in no uncertain terms, that the accounting standards require that rental payments for the use of someone else's assets are an expense in the income statement, not an asset on the balance sheet," he said.
Mr. Turner said that a similar argument had been used by a construction company when he was a practicing auditor with Coopers & Lybrand. That company argued that it needed to have construction equipment to attract customers, and that it could therefore defer the leasing expense of equipment that it was not able to use during a downturn in business. That argument was rejected by the auditors, Mr. Turner said.
Mr. Sullivan said in the memo that he was not alone in gauging the risks from his accounting strategy. "At all times, management understood that an expense or loss would be recognized upon evidence that previously recognized future economic benefits of an asset would not be realized," he wrote. 
But senior executives at other telecommunications carriers said yesterday that most companies in the industry recorded the cost of their network leases as those costs were incurred. By contrast, Mr. Sullivan's memo essentially says that WorldCom intended to defer those costs until the company signed up customers to use those network assets.
"From an accounting standpoint I guess the first reaction is that this is just wrong," one senior telecommunications executive said. "The memo is written to be almost believable, but it's just wrong."
Another telecommunications executive drew an analogy to a company that leases office space with the intention of subletting that space to potential clients. The executive said that the cost of that lease must be recognized as it is incurred, even if no one to sublet had yet been found. Likewise, the executive said, WorldCom should have recognized its network costs even if it was still looking for customers.
Accounting guidelines do allow companies to spread out some customer-acquisition costs over the life of a contract. For instance, if a company runs a credit check on a potential customer, the company can sometimes recognize the cost of that credit check over the life of the customer's contract. In the memo, Mr. Sullivan appears to argue that some of WorldCom's network costs could likewise be deferred until customers signed up to use those networks.
That argument fails, the communications executives said, because WorldCom's network leases were not associated with particular customers.
"He's capitalizing costs for a period for which he does not have revenue and for a period over which he does not have a customer contract," one executive said.

HEADLINE: An Arab Call to Action 

 BODY:
For the past quarter-century people across the world have successfully pressed for freedom and more accountable government. Latin America shed its military tyrants. Eastern Europe chased out its Communist dictators. In Asia, countries like South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand are building new democracies. Africans in increasing numbers are exchanging despots for newly elected governments. 
 Only the Arab world remains substantially unchanged, something now receiving surprisingly frank and clear-minded attention from a panel of Arab intellectuals commissioned by the United Nations and the Arab League's development fund. Their findings on the state of the world's 280 million Arabs make for grim reading. The rapidly expanding population of the Arab world is falling further behind the rest of the world due to a lack of freedom -- in politics, intellectual life and for women. 
 The study, titled the Arab Human Development Report, found that Arab countries have the lowest level of political freedom of any region in the world. The situation is particularly acute for Arab women, who have lower rates of political and economic participation than women anywhere else. And it found that Arabs have less access to the Internet and personal computers than people in any other region. 
The report urges "free, honest, efficient and regular elections," strengthening local government, loosening bureaucratic controls over independent civic organizations and permitting a freer press. It calls for the rule of law, human rights and an independent judiciary and prescribes an overhaul of government agencies and publicly owned companies. 
The development report's language is blunt, but not all its findings are negative. It cites the positive examples of recent democratic reforms in Morocco and Bahrain and strongly praises the achievements of Arab women's associations in breaking down old taboos. It also notes that the Arab world has lower rates of extreme poverty and income inequality than other developing regions. 
Recently President Bush demanded democratic reform from the Palestinians. Washington should support similar demands for the entire region. For too long, America embraced corrupt and autocratic Arab leaders, asking only that they accommodate Western oil needs and not make excessive trouble for Israel. As a result, too many young Arabs now identify the United States more readily with the repressive dictators it supports in the Middle East than with the tolerant democracy it practices at home. Islamic terrorist groups are adept at manipulating their anger and despair.

 Re "The Market Can Transform Our Schools," by Milton Friedman (Op-Ed, July 2): 
 I anticipate a much different transformation. A transformation led by corporate leaders so focused on profits and stock prices that they will cook their student performance data the way they manipulated their balance sheets at Enron, Rite Aid and WorldCom. 
Or a transformation led by religious leaders whose focus on protecting their religious institutions led them to conceal crimes against children while shifting clergymen among parishes. 
Transformation? No thanks! I much prefer our "government schools" the way they are: accountable to local voters across our great country.

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Jupiter May Leave Nasdaq 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News (Compiled by Harvey Dickson) 

 BODY:
 Jupiter Media Metrix Inc., whose reports on Web-site traffic once helped lift the stock of unprofitable Internet companies like Drkoop.com Inc., said yesterday that its shares might be removed from trading on the Nasdaq. Jupiter shares, which rose as high as $74 in 1999, have traded for less than $1 since February, falling below the minimum bid required by the Nasdaq. 
Media Metrix's reports were used by companies to attract investors and advertisers. Analysts including Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley pointed to statistics on money-losing Internet companies like page views and "stickiness," the amount of time spent on a site. Media Metrix acquired Jupiter Communications Inc. in 2000. Jupiter's directors approved a plan last week to sell off assets. The company, based in New York, has not had a profit since 1999, when it first sold shares to the public.

HEADLINE: The War Against Spam 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Spam: An Escalating Attack of the Clones" (June 27): Spam isn't really a technology problem -- it's an economic one. Spam has a cost to the network infrastructure and to the recipients, but virtually none of it is charged to the spammer. 
Whenever a resource is priced below cost it will be overused by some to the detriment of others. Typically the only penalty for sending spam is that the spammer loses a free e-mail account when the provider is inundated with "Remove Me" replies. But the spammer doesn't care. 
 If sending e-mail cost as little as one-hundredth of a cent per message, there would be a lot less one-time spamming. While this is easier said than done, it would start to bring the economics of spam back into balance and set the stage for a long-term solution.

HEADLINE: Running a Festival On a Hot Shoestring 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN ELLIOTT 

DATELINE: AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. 

 BODY:
Well-to-do vacationers flock to this northeasternmost spit of Florida for its temperate climate, sandy beaches, historic homes and chic resorts. Another draw has been added this year, one whose runaway success has shocked even its organizers. The first Amelia Island Chamber Music Festival had a two-week, 15-concert run, finished in the black and sold every ticket.
 "It has been magical, amazing," said Donna Gibson, proprietor of Addison House, one of eight bed-and-breakfasts in the seven-square-mile historic district of Fernandina Beach (population 10,549), Amelia Island's only city. John Gibson, her husband, is president of the bed-and-breakfast association, which he estimates donated about $30,000 worth of rooms to house the artists in the hope of increasing tourism at the start of the off season. The Chamber of Commerce says June's high temperature is close to 90, but it climbed into the 100's this year; the rest of the summer can be even more intense. 
 While it is too soon to assess the event's impact on the economy, a midfestival visit found organizers, artists and audiences swept up in the spirit of success. The cellist Lynn Harrell described the mood of his 20 colleagues, many of whom had not played together before, when he said: "It has all that virginal, excited, teenage nervousness because it's the first time. The energy of 'Will it succeed?' 'Will it be O.K.?' 'Will the music be on a high enough level?' 'Will we really like playing together?' We've all known and liked each other for a long time. But the idea of being bound together by music is quite different."
Christopher Rex, the festival's founder and artistic director (and principal cellist of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), recruited some notable performers on very short notice. They included the violinist Hilary Hahn, the American String Quartet and the pianists Valentina Lisitsa, Misha Dichter and Stanislov Ioudenitch, a Van Cliburn gold medalist last year. They performed over the two weeks with a rotating nucleus of other professional musicians. The artists accepted lower fees than usual in exchange for what was loosely an expense-paid vacation. The organizers were all volunteers, and the budget of about $500,000 came largely from private sources, about half of it in goods and services.
Mr. Rex said that the idea was to involve the major artists with regional artists from Atlanta, Jacksonville, Charlotte and Houston. He said: "We were not just acting as a presenter bringing in pre-existing chamber groups or importing big-name talent for solo recitals; we're giving audiences a chance to hear high-profile artists interact on an equal footing with lesser known but high-caliber musicians."
Mr. Rex, 51, has vacationed with his wife and daughter on Amelia Island for nearly 15 years, and he said it had long been his dream to start a chamber music series here. The idea clicked with merchants and other residents, and they donated housing, transportation, pianos (from Steinway, which recently opened a gallery in Jacksonville), potted palms flanking the modest stages, baby-sitting services, massages and golfing privileges. Residents with pianos opened their homes for practice sessions.
Mr. Rex's idea was to present concerts at historic places in Fernandina Beach, among them the Palace Saloon (est. 1878); the barracks of Fort Clinch, a Civil War fort; a historic courthouse; and the First Baptist Church. Most of these hold 150 to 300 people.
"I wanted to attract a different crew," he said. "I wanted to get people who have absolutely no interest in chamber music. But maybe they'd buy a ticket to an event that was in a bar and had tango dancers, a bandoneon player and a few string players besides."
That concert, called "Dirty Dancing," was one of two in the Palace Saloon's Beer and G-Strings Concerts, the first series to sell out long before the June 2 opening concert, "From Russia with Lynn," which featured standard chamber repertory from Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Chopin.
Introducing the saloon's evening of short pieces by Bach, Ravel, Piazzolla and others, Mr. Rex told his popcorn-munching audience that the program was an exploration of how dance forms affected classical music. The bar was open and the atmosphere casual (though highly attentive). Most of the 10 instrumentalists, including Mr. Harrell, introduced their pieces from the stage, throwing in a bit of context and personality. The program lasted over three hours, but no one, from seated middle-aged women in long denim skirts to the young standees in shorts and T-shirts, appeared to be less than captivated.
Audiences at the more conventional concerts seemed equally enthralled. "Already I feel like the barriers are coming down," Mr. Rex said midway through the event. "There's a trust built up. People know they are not going to be intimidated, that they're not going to be made to feel like an idiot. I can say to them, 'Hey, you understand this music about as well as the rest of us, so just sit back, relax, and let your imagination go.' "
When the event ended on June 15, Mr. Rex and his fellow board members decided to produce the festival again next year with few changes. 
"We put this thing together in nine months," said the board president, Diane Bradstock-Jones, who has doctorate in psychology and moved here from Westport, Conn., with her husband seven years ago. She said of Mr. Rex: "We believed in Christopher. We believed it would work, and we never looked back."

HEADLINE: Mexico and Brazil Sign Bilateral Trade Pact 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, July 3 

 BODY:
With prospects for global trade liberalization looking bleak at the moment, the presidents of Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two biggest economies, signed a bilateral trade deal today instead, opening their markets to each other in 800 industrial and agricultural product categories.
 Meeting in Brasilia, the two presidents -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Vicente Fox of Mexico -- signed the pact at the start of a tour by President Fox that analysts see as a reorientation of Mexico's interest and attention toward its Latin American neighbors and, in some measure, away from its Nafta partners, the United States and Canada. 
 Brazil and Mexico trade little with each other now -- just $2.6 billion worth of goods and services last year -- and both could use a boost from the expansion of bilateral commerce that the new agreement is meant to produce. 
Brazil is facing its most serious market crisis in three years and urgently needs to bring in more foreign earnings to help it service $250 billion in public debt and allay market fears that it may have to reschedule loans or default on them.
An additional pact to liberalize trade in the automotive sector between Mexico and the four Mercosur nations -- Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay -- is expected on Friday, when Mr. Fox will be in Buenos Aires and when leaders of the Mercosur countries are scheduled to gather there, Brazilian trade officials said.
Today's agreement came against a backdrop of mounting frustration in Latin America over recent United States trade policy, widely criticized here as turning increasingly toward protectionism. Hopes are fading in the region that a new round of global trade talks that began last year in Doha, Qatar, will succeed in improving developing nations' access to the markets of the rich industrialized nations anytime soon.
"I have little to add about the sense of disappointment we feel when rich countries insist on maintaining all sorts of barriers to free trade," Mr. Cardoso said at a ceremonial lunch in Mr. Fox's honor today. Mr. Cardoso stressed that Brazil and Mexico together formed a market of nearly 300 million consumers and that closer commercial ties between them could lift the fortunes of Latin America as a whole.
Brazilian trade officials declined to put a figure on how much extra trade they expected the new Brazil-Mexico agreement to yield. Instead, they cited statistics showing that Mexico now imports $30 billion worth of goods a year in the sectors covered by the deal.
Brazil desperately needs to step up its exports as a source of foreign exchange, because flows of foreign investment into the country have been erratic. The Brazilian currency, the real, and the country's stock and bond markets have plunged in recent weeks, mainly because opinion polls consistently show Luiz Inacio da Silva, a left-wing candidate, far ahead in the race to succeed Mr. Cardoso as president; the campaigning culminates with voting Oct. 6.
Investors worry that a left-wing victory will be followed by repudiation of the country's foreign debts and a full-blown economic meltdown like the one that has afflicted Argentina.

HEADLINE: Nixon's Spirit Speaks 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
From a small but oval office in purgatory, as he expiates his sin of suspending the convertibility of the dollar into gold, Richard Nixon occasionally grants his former speechwriter an interview: 
 What's your view of the current market slump? 
 I am not a broker. But let me say this about that: The howling mob that used to worship at the feet of dot-com whiz kids and celebrity wheeler-dealers now wants blood. Fine, put the greedy richies in the slammer, but put the blame where it belongs -- not just on the crooked bean-counters and conflicted analysts, but on the financial press that never got off its fanny to give tycoons the same unfair treatment you give politicians. And S.E.C. enforcement has been the Pitts. Heh-heh. 
Will the general distrust trigger a double-dip recession?
Sure, unless Bush does the unexpected. The lefties expect him to make a speech on business ethics wagging a finger at his contributors, which will make him look like a hypocrite. The bankers expect him to say the economy is "fundamentally sound," making him look like Herbert Hoover. No, he's got to get ahead of the curve, find a new villain, ride a fresh news cycle. Are you getting this all down? You can use a recorder.
And the new villain should be --? 
The hedge funds. There are a half-trillion dollars in assets, John Mitchell tells me, sloshing around in 6,000 or 7,000 hedge funds. Nobody regulates them the way we do mutual funds. The hedge funds' short-selling and rumor-churning and fast covering -- all in secret -- are what has turned stock exchanges into casinos. Flush 'em out and zap 'em.
A Bush "hedgehog" speech?
You got it. Now ask me about the Middle East.
Uh-oh. 
You won't agree, I know. And by the way, those unfortunate remarks on the tapes -- I wasn't referring to you or Henry or Arthur or Len, but only to that peacenik crowd of New York liberals.
Unforgivable. 
You have to say that, I know, but I'm glad you asked about Palestine: It's a mistake for Bush to think he can make it a democratic state. Arabs ain't democrats. They need a strong leader who'll crack skulls when the time comes to make a deal.
But what about postwar Germany and Japan -- weren't we able to help their people build democracies? 
Muslims are different. My old friend Rabin -- he's not here in purgatory, he went up direct -- Rabin used to say he needed to negotiate with a Palestinian who could control his people "without begatz and without betselem."
Which means? 
You're asking me? It's Hebrew, has to do with Israel's dovish Supreme Court and its human rights activists. My point is, fear works better than love. Arabs need a strong Arab hand to take charge, ready to jail or shoot all the terrorists who won't follow orders. Somebody tougher than Arafat. But Bush shouldn't pin his hopes on Arabs electing a Mr. Nice Guy -- he isn't there. 
As you predicted, I don't agree. If we set up a free Palestine while knocking off Saddam, we can change that world. New subject: What about our fight with the Europeans over the global criminal court? 
No U.S. veto, no deal. Bush is right, Clinton was wrong: We can't let some nutty foreign prosecutor make a political reputation by trying Americans overseas -- snatching not just ex-presidents but peacekeeping troops. It would be like letting the U.N. General Assembly run the world, and its first target would be us. F.D.R. insisted on a veto in the Security Council for good reason. Gotta go; don't sell short my tip about hedge funds.
Correction: I objected to Colin Powell's reported presence at the American Foreign Service Association's award to the V.O.A.'s Andre de Nesnera for giving taxpayer-supported airtime to terrorists. Secretary Powell informs me that although he was present to honor other awardees, "I left before A.F.S.A. presented the award to Mr. de Nesnera, nor did I mention him. I disapprove of his action in allowing the broadcast in question." The V.O.A.'s dismaying actions continue despite State's disapproval.

HEADLINE: California Agency Fined Energy Suppliers 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: FOLSOM, Calif., July 3 

 BODY:
Several energy companies were fined a total of $122 million during California's power crisis for failing to deliver electricity during emergencies, a state energy agency disclosed today.
 The fines by the agency, the California Independent Systems Operator, were imposed months ago but were made public as a result of a public request for information. They cover failure to comply with requests from Dec. 8, 2000, to June 20, 2001, when the agency had power to impose such fines. 
 The largest fines were assessed against Dynegy Inc., $44.8 million; the Williams Companies, $25.5 million; and Reliant Energy Inc., $25.1 million, the agency said. Several California utilities were also fined, along with the California Power Exchange, which is now defunct, and the Automated Power Exchange.
The agency, which controls most of California's electricity grid, no longer impose fines, a power that was granted by federal regulators during the state's power crisis.
A spokeswoman, Stephanie McCorkle, said the agency was not making any allegations about the intent of the generators in failing to deliver the power.
She said the level of the fines reflected market prices at that time and could be reduced if California manages to have prices reset at lower levels as part of a refund case currently before federal regulators.
The companies are expected to dispute the fines.
California experienced six days of rolling blackouts in early 2001. An economic recession helped to reduce demand for power, and there have been no rolling blackouts during the last 12 months.
State officials have blamed power providers and marketers, including Enron, for running up prices through complex schemes of market manipulation.
Bloomberg News reported that in addition to the fines, the agency withheld $129 million in payments that 29 energy suppliers had expected to collect for providing backup generating capacity. 
The agency withheld payments to Dynegy, Reliant Energy, Williams and other suppliers from June 14, 1999, to April 30, 2002.
The Duke Energy Corporation, which had $14.4 million withheld, is "disputing over 90 percent of that, because we feel their records aren't accurate and we believe we can show that we did provide the majority of those services," a spokesman, Patrick Mullen, told Bloomberg News.

HEADLINE: The Cycle of Revenge Can Be Broken 

BYLINE:  By Mark Mathabane; Mark Mathabane is the author of "Kaffir Boy."

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
We are all capable of learning hatred even the kind of hatred that produces suicide bombers. If conditions are ripe, and if no steps are regularly taken to inoculate us against this all too common human poison, it can make anyone kill without remorse. It is only by accepting this human truth that we can turn back violence in places like the Middle East today, as it was turned back in my homeland, South Africa, a decade ago.
 For me, learning to hate was as simple a process as learning how to love. All it took was a gradual twisting of my humanity while I was growing up under apartheid in the impoverished ghetto of Alexandra. I concluded early that white people could not be human. If they were, why did they not feel my pain? Why were they complicit in an inhuman system that confined me and my family to a shack without running water or electricity and made me sleep on pieces of cardboard, scavenge for food at the garbage dump, wear rags, and watch helplessly as black children died from preventable diseases? 
 Frequently white policemen enforcing the hated pass laws would invade our neighborhood in the middle of the night, break down our door and march my parents half naked out of bed, interrogate and humiliate my father and then arrest him for the crimes of being unemployed and harboring his family as illegal aliens in "white" South Africa. Had I had a gun, I would have killed the police with relish. But they had all the guns. So all I could do was nurse my hatred and water its poisonous tree with the stories of the collective suffering of black people.
As a teenager when the black rebellion against apartheid began in 1976, I was gleeful at the news that collaborators with the apartheid system had been necklaced -- embittered mobs had put gasoline-soaked tires around their necks and ignited them. I echoed the demand of my radicalized peers that liberation movements like the African National Congress and the Pan African National Congress should stop talking about peaceful change and instead provide us with AK-47's and bombs so we could storm white homes, kindergartens, shopping centers, schools, buses and playgrounds in the name of revenge.
The main reason why I didn't succumb to the powerful urges to violence was my mother. Over the years her example had imperceptibly taught me lessons that, when the devil of hate came to collect his due, awakened that inner restraint -- call it conscience -- without which no one is beyond evil. The most pivotal of those lessons, which I remember learning when I was 7, was that not all white people were unfeeling monsters like the police.
My mother had been repeatedly denied a birth certificate for me -- a necessary document for school registration -- because she did not have a permit proving that our family had a right to live in Alexandra. But we couldn't get the permit without the birth certificate. My mother asked a white nun for help. When she realized the Catch-22 my mother was trapped in, the nun cried. I remember being stunned by her tears, for they were the first I'd ever seen streak a white face. I remember saying to myself: "She feels my mother's pain. She's human after all, not a monster."
Such experiences, few though they were, made me wonder, during those years when black hatred of apartheid made even sane people do the unconscionable, if by killing whites I would also kill people like the nun whose empathy had given my mother hope and whose help had saved me, by making it possible for me to get an education, from the dead-end life of the street and gangs. As long as there was that chance, I couldn't bring myself to kill in the name of hate.
Guns, bombs and tanks cannot defeat hatred. It can be vanquished only by humanity, and the best way I know to do it is that which South Africans, under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, used to prevent hatred from becoming the legacy of the next generation. Against all odds, and some will say against human nature, South Africans chose a path that moved their beloved country beyond the darkness of mutually destructive hatred and revenge into the light of reconciliation and forgiveness.
To travel that arduous path, which alone offers us the security we crave, requires a recognition that one is not fully human until one acknowledges and affirms the humanity of others -- including one's enemies. Ultimately, the enemy is within the human family and not without. And once we acknowledge that, we will all have the courage to speak the language of reconciliation empathetically as we work to conquer hatred.

 In the same issue, you report that over the last year, 104,000 private-sector jobs vanished and that 267,000 people are looking for work in New York City ("New York: Comeback (After a Lag) Kid," Job Market, June 30).
At what price is such a monument being promised? 
Declaring the entire World Trade Center site for a monument would mean that we are ready to forgo a tremendous amount of economic development for that area. This means jobs.

A few months ago, P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center announced a survey of contemporary art from Mexico City as its big summer show. It would include more than two dozen young artists, among them Gabriel Orozco, Damian Ortega and Daniela Rossell, who are already known in New York; in Mr. Orozco's case, well known. 
 For some reason, plans changed. What's been delivered is a theme show with almost one-third fewer artists. (Mr. Orozco and Mr. Ortega are among the missing.) In principle, less could be more, making a big-picture sweep into something leaner and sharper. 
 As it turns out, "Mexico City: An Exhibition About the Exchange Rates of Bodies and Values," while a show of interest, feels far too lean for the space it's been given and so sharp in the case of at least one work as to raise ethical qualms. 
Certainly, anyone expecting an upbeat, fiesta atmosphere will be disappointed. As organized by Klaus Biesenbach, chief curator at P.S. 1, the show is as idea-driven and unwilling to please as its title, which automatically puts it at a disadvantage in New York at present. 
The current fashion is for tasty, bright, sexy things that demonstrate quantifiable skills. New conceptual art is being dismissed as tired and derivative, while derivative painting -- which is much painting now -- is O.K. So the conceptual part is the problem. We're back to the well-made Object again, big time. 
That's not at all a bad place to be: objects can be wonderful, though there's nothing intrinsically wonderful about objecthood in itself. The real issue may come down to what you want or need art to be. New York, which has museums, collectors and endless money to spend, wants these objects to be solid, refined, a good investment. Much of the rest of the world -- where materials are scarce, markets are nonexistent and the threat of social disruption constant -- needs art to be portable, politically dynamic and just plain doable day by day.
Such a difference in perspective helps explain, at least a little bit, why issue-oriented third-world-intensive affairs like the current Documenta, as polished and expensive as they may be, can make the Manhattan gallery scene look, by comparison, like Toys "R" Us. It also helps explain the flimsy-heavy character of "Mexico City."
Mr. Biesenbach does some explaining of his own in an exhibition handout. He sees Mexico City as a nightmare of abjection: poor, polluted, violent, death-ridden, a world of predators and victims where anything can be bought and everyone is dispensable. If his take feels sensationalist, a form of reverse exoticism, it's the picture he stays with, and he shapes it carefully throughout the show. 
This is true right from the start. A gallery near the entrance to the show holds a series of gruesome images of car crashes and suicides by Enrique Metinides, a veteran Mexico City police photographer. The exhibition itself begins with aerial shots of the city's most downtrodden neighborhoods. Taken by the artist Melanie Smith, they suggest surveillance photographs of alien terrain. 
These images could as easily be of the South Bronx as of Mexico: impoverished urban neighborhoods tend to share a "look." And, indeed, cultural sharing, positive and negative, with global capitalism as the binder, is a theme touched on by many of the show's 17 artists. 
Gabriel Kuri digitally alters American-style breakfast cereal boxes to insert news photographs of natural catastrophes and military maneuvers. A music video by Jonathan Hernandez, made in collaboration with the design group Torolab and the band Fussible, documents regular nighttime visits by California teenagers to Tijuana, where they get drunk, flash their money and aggressively act out. 
In five portrait photographs titled "Think Global -- Act Loca" by Minerva Cuevas, Mexican men wear crisp Nike and Tommy designer T-shirts. Are the men workers in border factories where these shirts are made? Are they street vendors advertising the knockoff versions they sell on the street? Either interpretation would make sense. 
The show spends a lot of time in the street, a tough place to be. Crime is a problem, and Miguel Calderon and Yoshua Okon have ostensibly done their bit to contribute to it. They've filmed each other breaking into a car to steal a radio and stacked 120 such radios in the gallery as evidence their outlaw exploits.
How much of their larcenous behavior is real, however, and how much has been invented as a theatrical comment on the link between economics and violence they leave ambiguous.
Francis Alys, an artist to treasure, is represented by two series of projected slide images: one of peddlers struggling to move their wares through the city, the other of homeless men lying in public places. Eduardo Abaroa and Ruben Ortiz Torres turn street garbage into aesthetic gold: they gather chewed corncobs and replicate them as Super-Realist sculptures. And Mr. Abaroa has cooked up a funky portable version of Barnett Newman's grand 1967 "Broken Obelisk" from awning material used in open-air markets. Very tall and very pink, it looks like a battered kite in a nose dive. 
There are other shrewdly whimsical entries. In Gustavo Artigas's video "The Rules of the Game," two American basketball teams and two Mexican soccer teams play their different sports in the same space, risking collision but weaving in and out of each other's way with balletic precision. Pedro Reyes has woven a set of beautiful, basketlike seats from colored plastic strips. Suspended from the ceiling, they are meant to protect their occupants from earthquakes. 
Certain work that seems benign on the surface has a disquieting underside. Such is the case with Ms. Rossell's series of photographs of rich young Mexican women preening in homes that are monuments to conspicuous consumption. It is also true of Teresa Margolles's "Vaporization." For this installation a gallery is suffused with a ghostly mist produced from water that the artist has used, in a ritual gesture of tenderness and respect, to wash unclaimed corpses in the morgue of a Mexico City hospital where she studied forensic medicine. (The water used in the installation has been disinfected.)
Ms. Margolles is best known for an earlier installation in which she displayed the severed tongue of a teenage Mexican boy killed in a street fight. She got permission from the boy's family to remove and keep the tongue in exchange for paying for his burial. The results shocked and infuriated many people, and so, no doubt, will a piece by Ivan Edeza in "Mexico City." 
It's an edited version of a film, reportedly made in Brazil in the 1970's and available on the Mexican black market, of what Mr. Biesenbach describes as wealthy hunters in helicopters tracking down Brazilian Indians in the forest, picking them off with rifles and mutilating their dead bodies. Although Mr. Edeza has blurred the image with a kind of visual static, there is no doubt about what's taking place. 
What do you do with such an obscene document, if it is indeed a document? Like the photographs of lynched African Americans exhibited in a New York gallery two years ago, it belongs in a museum of atrocities, not in a group show in an art space. But to direct outrage at the artist -- censuring him for telling us things we don't want to know in the only language he has -- is misguided. The focus should be on the realities he's revealed: crimes against humanity, and a society, still in place, that permits them.
But what happens if or when this piece, which is an outtake from a mass snuff film, goes on sale, moves from the black market to the art market, is used to enhance a career, enrich a gallery, burnish a collection as it gains value from notoriety? Apart from the stunning insult to the film's victims, it becomes an operative part of the very system -- why do we keep pretending that everything's not connected? -- that produced the original film and permitted the murders to take place. 
That a similar film of Holocaust killings could be similarly exhibited and marketed is unthinkable. P.S. 1 said that Mr. Edeza, who is not represented by a gallery, owns the piece, which has been exhibited once before in Mexico. What he will do with it and where it will end up I don't know. But its presence in an exhibition stretches the art world's studied position of moral ambivalence to the snapping point. Everybody had better start doing some examining, and right now.
Despite its impact, there's almost nothing to Mr. Edeza's piece, formally speaking: a bit of film and a monitor in an otherwise empty room.
This is true of most of the work in "Mexico City." In his case, "almost nothing" is still too much.
In others, where the ideas are elusive or thin, it feels like not enough, an impression exacerbated both by a stretched-out installation and by the knowledge that some of these artists have appeared to better advantage elsewhere.
Personally, I ended up taking the whole show as a single, multipart conceptual piece; and given its thematic coherence, this seems plausible.
I also ended up thinking about how much more there is going on in contemporary Mexican art -- in and out of Mexico City -- than what we see here. Which leaves the door open for someone to do another, different, update soon.

"Mexico City: An Exhibition About the Exchange Rates of Bodies and Values" remains at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, through September, (718) 784-2084. It travels to Kunst-Werke Berlin and the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo Carrillo Gil, Mexico City.

HEADLINE: Job Track or 'Mommy Track'? Some Do Both,in Phases 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For years, women -- particularly those whose husbands earn a healthy income -- have felt they had to choose between an all-consuming job and staying at home to raise their children. But the evidence now suggests that more and more women are finding a middle way that rejects both extremes.
 Distrustful of dawn-to-dusk child care and unable to negotiate flexible work schedules, a growing number of women are conducting their lives in chapters, devoting their adulthood largely to careers but taking time off to be full-time mothers while their children are young. 
 This approach, which seems to go beyond all the talk of either a childless professional life or a career-limiting "mommy track," may help to explain a recent rise in the percentage of stay-at-home mothers with children younger than 3. But staying home for more than a few years is not the intention of most of these women, judging by the array of data that measure labor force trends. 
In interviews and surveys, women from 25 to 45 years of age are now more likely than they were in the past to describe staying at home with their children as a phase in a life that gives equal importance to paid employment.
That is particularly true of college-educated mothers, whose numbers in paid employment keep rising, even as many of them spend more time at home before their children are ready for schooling. Contrary to expectations, studies also show that time spent at work is climbing fastest among women with high-earning husbands -- the women who can most easily afford to stay at home. "Opportunity keeps drawing women into work regardless of how much their husbands make," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
For those who have a choice, the middle way is turning out to be a critical phase in the constant intertwining of family and work. Arlene Correa in South Orange, N.J., tells her story in these terms, although, like many others, she recognized the compromise only after it was forced upon her.
When Ms. Correa's first child was born in 1997, her boss held out the hope that she would work part-time hours after maternity leave. But because of cost cutting, the boss disappeared and so did Ms. Correa's job as an organizer of neighborhood health centers for a Manhattan hospital.
Unable to find another job that meshed motherhood and work, Ms. Correa joined the ranks of stay-at-home-moms. Her husband's six-figure income took the pressure off job-hunting. A second child was born 18 months ago. But at 35, with a master's degree in public administration and a decade of work experience, Ms. Correa insists on resuming her career.
"I think about going back to work all the time, and when this one goes to school in four years, I'll go back," Ms. Correa said, nodding toward her younger son, Benjamin, who played near her while she sat chatting in the dining room of a friend's home in South Orange, a commuter town.
This "sequencing" in and out of work, as the women call it, is not without anguish. Take Ms. Correa's friend Diane Thomson, a 44-year-old dance therapist who held a managerial job at a hospital psychiatric ward. After her son, Jared, was born four years ago, she returned to work and tried to negotiate a 25-hour week, only to find that the hospital was laying off workers while putting pressure on the remaining employees to work more hours.
"I quit," said Ms. Thomson, whose husband earns nearly six figures. "I did not feel philosophically right. It hit me when Jared was exploring how to use a spoon. The day care place could not take the time to explore with him."
But do not misunderstand, she said: "The general gist with a lot of us, we are looking for ways to continue our careers."
Such decisions to stay home for a while are leading to claims, even among women's groups, that women are thus rediscovering the satisfactions of motherhood and for that reason are withdrawing indefinitely from paid employment. Or that women who rise to high-paying posts often do so by sacrificing marriage and children. Some have also warned that young women who concentrate on work and put off child-bearing are at greater risk of infertility than they realize -- a fear at the heart of Sylvia Ann Hewlett's new book, "Creating a Life: Professional Life and the Quest for Children" (Talk Miramax Books). "I am not saying, 'Dump your career,' " Ms. Hewlett, an economist, said in an interview, "but for women in their late 20's and early 30's, when having a family and children are relatively easy, that should be the priority, not work."
Some truth runs through each of these assertions, economists and sociologists say. But they are sideshows, diversions from work as the main event. Whatever the hurdles, nearly every analysis of government data shows that the participation of women in paid employment keeps rising. One set of studies, by Kevin Murphy and Casey B. Mulligan, economists at the University of Chicago, found that hours spent at work have been rising fastest among women whose husbands are at the high end of the wage scale, earning $80,000 a year or more. For this group, 42.5 percent of the wives are now working, up from 40.1 percent in 1996.
Employers who offer mothers flexible, less-than-full-time schedules are still rare, however. Women's groups constantly raise this issue, and those who temporarily drop out often say they would not have done so if flexible hours had been available.
That argument is not without challengers, among them Susan De Ritis, 47, a founder of Family and Home Network, an organization that encourages mothers to raise children full time until they are nearly adults.
"Women want to have children and raise them, and they are finding ways to do it full time," she said, citing her own 10-year-old car as a saving that helps to keep her at home. Married to a civil servant, she quit her job as an art expert at the Smithsonian Institution when the first of her two sons was born 19 years ago. Now she argues that other mothers are finally taking her path, and she cites as evidence the Census Bureau report, issued last October, that first disclosed a drop in the percentage of mothers with children under 3 in the labor force.
The decline was to 57.5 percent in 2001 from a record 60.9 percent in 1997. Census officials say they do not know the reason; they wonder if it is a temporary blip. That uncertainty has not stopped people of various views from seizing on the number.
"There is a real resistance to women becoming economically equal to men," said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a group in Washington that supports women in the work force. "And every time you get a little slowdown in the statistics, you get a big news story about it."
Yet the evidence that American women have not stopped moving into the labor force is overwhelming, says Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard. Going back more than 100 years, she has traced the lifetime work experience of married women born in each decade. She found that each succeeding age group put a higher percentage of wives into jobs outside the home. The pattern is pronounced for college-educated married women. 
Through last year, 73.1 percent of all women with children under 18 were in the labor force, either holding jobs or actively seeking them -- up from 66.7 percent in 1990 and 56.6 percent in 1980. Among the nation's 56.7 million married women, 65.7 percent held jobs in 2000, and the majority worked full time.
Among married women from 25 to 64, with four years of college or more, the portion in the labor force is the highest of all, fluctuating from 81 to 83 percent over the last decade. That is up from 74.3 percent 20 years ago -- and now only 10 points below the level of college-educated men, compared with a gap of 23 percentage points in 1980.
"What you get is this constantly rising entry of women into the labor force for a multiplicity of reasons, not the least being the shift to a service economy and to office work that women can do as easily as men," Ms. Goldin said.
Opportunity and demand help to draw women, particularly to the professions. More than 40 percent of the young people trained in law and accounting, for example, are now women, and the major firms say they cannot function without them.
"For 10 years, 50 percent of our hires were women, and in the early 1990's we realized that only 6 percent of the partners were women," said Sue Molina, a partner at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. "The men in the firm thought it was women resigning to have children and stay home. But we found in follow-up interviews that 90 percent soon came back into the work force, primarily at corporations where they assumed they would have more control over their hours and the hours would be shorter. I am not sure that assumption was correct."
Ms. Molina, 53, never sought that for herself. 
"I never worked fewer hours," she said, explaining that she often put in 15-hour days, including 3-hour stints at home in the evening after her two children, now grown, had gone to bed. But women increasingly resist that kind of schedule. So, in the mid-1990's, Deloitte & Touche asked her to become, in effect, an ombudsman for women, with authority to help them stay on the partnership track even if they worked schedules more conducive to motherhood.
Still, the going is slow. Today, 1,100 of Deloitte & Touche's 28,000 American-based workers are on flexible schedules, although not necessarily shorter hours, Ms. Molina notes. Sixteen percent of the partners are now women.
"We are trying to create an environment where women can go to a child's soccer game, leaving at 4 p.m.," she said. "They can't do it every week, but they can schedule it into their client assignments. And they take the computer home and work at home, 9 to midnight."
Rejecting that sort of limited freedom, Ms. Correa and Ms. Thomson became members of Mothers and More, a group that promotes more flexible work situations. 
Mothers and More was founded by Joanne Brundage, a college graduate who went to work for the Postal Service, thinking that the job of a letter carrier would allow her to hold a job and raise children simultaneously.
That strategy worked in the infancy of the first child, a placid daughter. The second child turned out to be colicky and restless, requiring a lot more care. Ms. Brundage, now 49, found herself forced to stop working. "I went to the post office," she said, "signed my resignation papers, put Zach in the car and drove around sobbing, just sobbing. I loved my baby, but I did not want to stop working."
Out of that experience came a national organization, now with 7,500 members, that encourages women to deal with life as a series of transitions -- usually beyond their control -- as they negotiate family and work. That is how Ms. Correa is dealing with her life. "I could have looked for a new job by now," she said, "but I wanted to be with my children."
A few minutes later, seeing no contradiction, she announced that she would soon join a committee studying race and real estate in South Orange, contributing her training in statistical analysis.
"I want to exercise my skills," she said, "and begin to network again."

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on July 5 about women who devote their adulthood largely to careers but take time out while their children are young misstated the background of Susan De Ritis of Family and Home Network, a group that supports parents who cut back employment to spend more time caring for their children. While she was an early volunteer in the organization, she was not a founder. Before leaving her job, she worked in the library at the Smithsonian Institution and was a volunteer tour guide; she was not an art expert.
The article also referred incorrectly to her children. They are a son and a daughter, not two sons.

Gambling in Las Vegas Shouldn't Extend to Airport Security

BYLINE:  By ANDRES MARTINEZ

 BODY:
They are, in gambling-town argot, unacceptable odds. As USA Today reported earlier this week, half the fake weapons that undercover officers tried to sneak past security checkpoints went undetected at Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport. That was one of the worst performances in a recent test conducted by the Transportation Security Administration. Nationwide, screeners at 32 major airports failed to detect the fake weapons one in four times.
 Las Vegas, a top tourist destination and the nation's fastest-growing city, is a monument to the resilience of Americans' wanderlust, and to their willingness to spend a considerable amount of disposable income on travel. Last fall, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it was the first major destination to see its passenger loads rebound to 80 percent of previous levels. 
 Ever since, Las Vegas promoters have been selling the notion that a weekend in Vegas is a suitably patriotic response to the terrorists' assault on our freedoms. A quarter-million visitors are expected to heed the call this holiday weekend. Almost half will fly in, making McCarran the city's economic lifeline. Outside of Hawaii, no other American locale may be as dependent on the health of the nation's aviation system, and public confidence in it. 
"We understand that this lifeline is discretionary, that people for the most part don't have to come here," said Rosemary Vassiliadis, McCarran's deputy director. 
Some of its attributes make McCarran a rather unusual operation. Its busiest time is around midnight, it netted $28 million from its terminals' slot machines last year, and it makes a sizable amount of money selling ads for buffets and magicians. Still, in other ways McCarran, the nation's second-busiest airport in terms of nonconnecting passengers, is a microcosm of all the logistical challenges facing federal officials as they take charge of security at 429 airports. 
A spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration, the agency created last November to meet the challenge, said the USA Today report was based on incomplete results. But he acknowledged that during the transition to federal control, some airports still suffered from unacceptably lax security. 
Baltimore-Washington International is the only major airport where federal personnel have taken full control of security. McCarran's screeners are still the private firm's guards originally hired by the airlines. But the catch-all excuse for security lapses that is advanced by the government -- "Hey, we didn't hire these folks" -- is growing wearisome. The security agency, after all, assumed oversight responsibility for checkpoints in February. 
By Nov. 19 the agency must have tens of thousands of newly hired and trained federal screeners at all airports. Presumably then there will be no more excuses. In Las Vegas alone, it is estimated that 1,100 security agents will be needed. With hiring getting off to a slow start around the country, the government will have to avoid the temptation of retaining too many of the private screeners, who may not meet tough new standards. New uniforms alone will not improve their performance. 
In May the agency hired its first federal security director for McCarran -- Jim Blair, an Air Force veteran who once directed security at nearby Nellis Air Force Base, as well as at the local Mirage resort and casino. His main challenge will be to avoid compromises for the sake of convenience. That will be particularly true if his powerful former employers in the casino industry object to time-consuming airport procedures that might dissuade weekend revelers from flying. 
Last fall, with passengers frequently waiting an hour just to make it past security -- much to the casinos' distress -- McCarran reconfigured space to add 70 percent more lanes with X-ray machines, and postponed expansion projects to focus on the new security imperative. 
The year-end deadline imposed by Congress for all checked bags to be screened for explosives presents airport operators and the security agency with another challenge. McCarran is one of 39 major airports lobbying Congress to push back the deadline, arguing that it is unrealistic. The agency is rightly determined to meet it. Last September Las Vegas had none of the costly explosive-detection machines that use cat-scan technology, but it now has eight. No final agency plan has yet been developed for the airport, but Ms. Vassiliadis expects to have 21 of the machines in place by year's end, to screen nearly half of all checked bags. The other half will presumably be subjected to explosive trace-detection systems that still must be certified for use with checked luggage. 
McCarran's bulky explosive-detection machines are being placed next to ticket counters. The estimated cost of someday integrating the 55 or so units required for all checked bags into the flow of luggage behind the scenes is a staggering $300 million, as it entails reconstructing terminals. 
A more pressing concern is that unless Congress soon passes $4 billion in supplemental funding for the security agency, it will have to scrap its efforts to hire a new security force and cancel its purchase of bomb-screening machines. Then travelers everywhere will be facing unacceptable odds for years to come, and transportation officials will have a foolproof excuse for failing to prevent weapons and explosives from getting aboard planes.

Japan's Bad-Loan Agency Turns a Profit

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4 

 BODY:
The agency charged with cleaning up Japan's banking problems turned a profit collecting bad loans last year. But for all its initial gains, the operation is still far from achieving its goals and lawmakers are mulling whether to speed up the process by allowing it to use taxpayer money.
 The Resolution and Collection Corporation, which buys nonperforming loans from failed and healthy financial institutions, is at the center of the government's efforts to rid the banking industry of its bad debts. Under current law, the organization, which was modeled in some ways on the agency that bailed out the savings and loan industry in the United States in the late 1980's and early 1990's, can only buy assets at prevailing market prices and is not allowed to lose money. 
 These restrictions have hamstrung the agency and stymied efforts to reinvigorate the country's debt-laden banks. The 11-year slide in real estate prices and a struggling economy mean that many bank loans are worth a fraction of their original value. But banks are unwilling to unload these devalued assets at current prices because they would generate losses on their already beleaguered balance sheets.
Lawmakers sympathetic to the banks want the agency to start buying loans at their original book value, which is often many times higher. That tactic would amount to a subsidy for the banks and likely require the government to use taxpayer money to fund the more expensive purchases. Financial regulators, fearful of a public outcry, have opposed the idea.
But late Wednesday, a key committee of the Financial Services Agency, Japan's top financial regulator, softened that stance, suggesting that the loan concern be allowed to use taxpayer money to buy loans at higher prices. The committee, however, restated its resistance to giving money directly to the banks.
The sense of crisis that normally triggers change in Japan is currently not present, so no laws are likely to be rewritten soon. But with banks holding as much as 150 trillion yen ($1.25 trillion) in questionable loans, analysts say the use of taxpayer money to finance the loan collection agency is only a matter of time.
"If you are to collect loans but not use public funds to incur losses, you are not going to be effective," said James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings Securities in Tokyo. "In the last few decades, 20 to 30 countries have realized that public funds were needed to clean up bad loans. The million dollar question is when Japan realizes this, too."
Washington spent more than $100 billion in taxpayer money to clean up the savings and loan mess in the United States.
For now, the loan agency is able to turn a profit buying cut-rate loans. In the year ended March 31, the group posted a 284 billion yen ($2.37 billion) net profit by buying loans valued at 1.08 trillion yen ($9.02 billion), Takayuki Okuno, a spokesman for the agency, said. The organization overall recorded a net loss of 84.4 billion yen ($704.6 million) because legal changes require it to transfer profits it makes on loans from failed lenders to its parent, the Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
The loan agency will have a tougher time collecting nonperforming loans this year, even though new, aggressive accounting standards have forced banks to reclassify more loans as distressed. The banks have already unloaded their most troublesome assets and must now grapple with more marginal loans. The agency aims to collect only 667 billion yen ($5.57 billion) in bad assets this fiscal year, Mr. Okuno said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reaches Partial Deal With Mexico Over Water 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 4 

 BODY:
In a remarkable coincidence of nature and politics, it started raining in drought-stricken Texas hours after Mexico and the United States reached a partial agreement on settling their long water war. 
 But the agreement, made public on Monday, is only a drop in a very big bucket. Mexico promised to send Texas about 30 billion gallons of water, roughly 6 percent of the nearly half-trillion gallons it owes under a 1944 treaty. 
 Mexico's failure to deliver water, which under the treaty it owes to Texan and Mexican farmers alike, has caused growing despair on both sides of the border. The debt accumulated over a decade, much of which was marked by drought. 
Now, after months of increasingly heated arguments, the deal may be the beginning of the end to a dispute that damaged relations between the two countries. 
"It was a very difficult situation, a zero-sum game," said Enrique Berruga, Mexico's deputy foreign minister. 
The dispute endangered the friendship between President Bush and President Vicente Fox, who discussed it with each other this spring. without resolution. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell also took it up with his Mexican counterpart, Foreign Minister Jorge G. Castaneda, opening one conversation by pleading like a man dying of thirst, "Water, water, water!"
Now, under the new agreement, the United States and Mexico have set a goal of spending $210 million over the next four years on water conservation and irrigation programs in Texas and the Mexican border states of Coahuila, Chihuahua and Tamaulipas. The deal is the first joint effort at an international water program between the two nations. 
Mexico will send more water into two international reservoirs on the Rio Grande, and spend about $40 million on efficient-water-use programs in its border states, whose rivers and reservoirs help feed South Texas under the treaty. The White House will request $100 million from Congress for similar efforts in Texas and Mexico over the next two years. 
Other money is to come from a request, set in motion by the agreement, for a multimillion-dollar investment in water programs on both sides of the Rio Grande Valley by the North American Development Bank, a financial institution created by the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
When those programs are in place, "we can use water more efficiently, using the little water we have more wisely and beginning to deliver what we owe to the United States," Mr. Berruga said. 
But even with the rain that has fallen in the Rio Grande Valley over the last few days, the agreement is too little and too late to save farmers' crops this season on either side of the border, said Ruben Quintanilla, river operations manager at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. 
"It's not very much water, and we need a lot," Mr. Quintanilla said by telephone. "It's over for the farmers for this season, even though everybody got at least an inch of rain. We've got to start looking at our future." 
That may call for a reworking of the 1944 treaty, written when the population of the Rio Grande Valley was about 1 percent of what it is today.
The treaty says Mexico must allow water from six tributaries to flow into the Rio Grande. One-third of the water is supposed to go to South Texas, and two-thirds to cities and farmers in the Mexican border states. In these years of drought, Mexico has maintained that it simply does not have the water to send the United States, though in recent months Texas farmers have contended that water owed them has been diverted by Mexico away from the border.
The new agreement leaves unresolved precisely how Mexico is supposed to pay back the rest of what it owes to the Texans and to its own people. But Mexican officials said clearing the debt would take at least five years. 
If the drought continues, thousands of farmers, who have already suffered losses that they place in the billions of dollars, may still be left wanting.

HEADLINE: The Fall of Jean-Marie Messier 

 BODY:
Jean-Marie Messier was France's answer to the charge that Europe couldn't produce nimble, entrepreneurial corporate leaders. He was a turbocharged replica of the American model. That may be why -- despite having been the object of much veneration on both sides of the Atlantic just two years ago -- he now finds himself unemployed. The crash of American business values has been that swift. Now French corporate elites may embrace Continental staidness with a renewed passion. 
 Smart, relatively young at 45 for a C.E.O., boyish-looking and brash, Mr. Messier's is a Hollywood tale, but one that ends on a sour note more common to angst-ridden French movies. His ambition was to build a global media empire bridging Hollywood's and France's cultural establishments. His unlikely vehicle was a venerable French water utility, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux. In 2000 Mr. Messier, a former civil servant and investment banker, engineered the $34 billion acquisition of Seagram and its Universal music and film business. 
 Combined with its media and telecom interests in Europe, the renamed Vivendi Universal became one of the world's largest media conglomerates. Like AOL Time Warner's chieftains, Mr. Messier preached the gospel of synergy, not only between purveyors of content but between content producers and their delivery systems. If his bigger rival was betting on high-speed Internet access via cable, Mr. Messier believed he could persuade millions of customers to pay to download Shania Twain, or the latest blockbuster movie, onto hand-held wireless devices. 
In what was taken as a snub back home, Mr. Messier moved to New York to a $17.5 million corporate pad on Park Avenue, and parroted American business jargon with the exuberance of a convert. In fairness, his company performed no worse than other media giants, but his timing was simply awful. He dragged his French shareholders into the dot-com maelstrom just as the market was about to drop precipitously. Moreover, wireless technology may be years away from being able to sustain Mr. Messier's digital vision.
America's seduction of Mr. Messier was bicoastal. He preached Wall Street's message that a new economy required new ways of valuing companies -- such as the now infamous "ebidta" measure, which essentially stands for earnings before all the bad stuff, like interest payments -- and thus allowed his company to assume too much debt. The company may now have to be broken up, and there will be much rethinking of the wisdom of assembling these media empires.
Hollywood's seduction of Mr. Messier was part of another familiar story line, the timeless procession of outside investors attracted by glamour and by the belief that they could manage film studios better than the natives could. As a water utility, Vivendi was also part of an intriguing subplot -- liquid-peddling investors who flopped in Hollywood, including Coca-Cola (which owned Columbia Pictures before selling it to Sony) and the Bronfman family (whose Seagram spirits empire acquired Universal from Matsushita, then sold it to Vivendi). 
As Vivendi's losses mounted and its share price plummeted, shareholders lost patience with Mr. Messier and his efforts to mimic (however charming the French accent) the dated incantations of the dot-com era. He was ousted this week, but not before securing for himself a lavish, $17.8 million severance deal. How very American.

HEADLINE: Modest Anti-AIDS Efforts Offer Huge Payoff, Studies Say 

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, July 4 

 BODY:
Wider application of measures known to stem the spread of AIDS would prevent 29 million people in the world from becoming infected by 2010, according to two new studies reported today.
 In concluding that there is overwhelming evidence that simple, relatively inexpensive steps can greatly reduce transmission of H.I.V., the AIDS virus, the reports said the number of adults infected each year would drop drastically if the measures were implemented. Some of those measures include improving the status of women, condom promotion and distribution, voluntary counseling and testing, and education programs for students and workers. 
 But if countries fail to adopt the measures, about 46 million people, most in sub-Saharan Africa, China and India, would become infected by 2010, the reports estimated. 
The costs of a sustained aggressive program would be $10 billion a year, or $1,000 for each infection prevented, much less, prevention advocates argue, than the cost of treating people once they become ill.
The studies began after the United Nations General Assembly special session on AIDS last year set goals of reducing the number of infected young people by 25 percent by 2005 among young people in the hardest-hit countries, and by 25 percent elsewhere by 2010. The goals can be met, said the authors of the reports, who are experienced AIDS workers from government health agencies, universities, advocacy groups and private foundations in all continents.
The reports were issued in advance of the 14th International AIDS Conference, which begins here on Sunday.
One report, by researchers from a variety of government and private groups, including the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the United States Census Bureau, is being published on Saturday in The Lancet. The researchers analyzed 86 published reports of prevention programs around the world and trends in new H.I.V. infection in 126 countries to calculate what impact prevention programs would have in each country in slowing the spread of the virus.
The second report, sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, is a blueprint for reducing infections worldwide. That report will be discussed at the conference next week. Among other things, this report calls for efforts to improve the status of women in poor countries, which it says is central to limiting the spread of AIDS.
Though AIDS rivals history's worst epidemics, and many people have expressed a fatalistic attitude about its continued spread, "none of this is inevitable," Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, a W.H.O. official and an author of the blueprint, said at a news conference. "We can very substantially alter the course of the epidemic if we scale up interventions rapidly and aggressively." But, he added, "there is no time to lose."
A more aggressive effort would focus on providing accurate information about how to prevent infection, because only one in five people at risk of acquiring the virus now has access to such information. For example, in China, which is on the verge of an explosive epidemic, most people do not know what causes AIDS, Dr. Peter Piot, the director of the United Nations AIDS program, said in an interview.
The blueprint is based on measures that a small number of countries have used to reduce transmission of the virus. It outlines the main steps countries can adapt to fit their own needs.
"We know what works, but we are not using it," said Dr. Helene Gayle, an epidemiologist from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although experts probably could have issued a similar blueprint five years ago, Dr. Gayle said, "there is a lot more evidence now for what works and what it takes to overcome obstacles to make prevention work."
A key to successful prevention efforts would be to increase the economic, legal, political and social empowerment of women to reduce their vulnerability to H.I.V., the blueprint said.
Additional measures include drugs and other steps to help prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child; education programs in the workplace and in schools, and elsewhere for dropouts; treatment of sexually transmitted infections; peer counseling for prostitutes and men who have sex with men; and programs to make clean needles and syringes available to injecting drug users.
Applying the measures would prevent a varying percentage of infections, ranging from a low of 40 percent in countries with stable or declining prevalence (like Senegal and Thailand), to a high of 70 percent in countries with rapidly growing epidemics (like Cameroon and China). Nearly a third of the benefits from the prevention measures will accrue to two countries, India and China, with an additional 40 percent in sub-Saharan Africa.
The reports emphasized that conquering AIDS requires combining prevention with treatment programs. A more aggressive effort to prevent the spread of AIDS would be far less expensive than treating those infected in an epidemic.
Money is only one obstacle to prevention, said Dr. David Serwadda of Makerere University Institute of Public Health in Kampala, Uganda. Dr. Serwadda has worked on AIDS for 20 years and was co-chairman of the group of more than 30 experts that wrote the blueprint.
For example, fewer than 5 percent of pregnant women in Uganda are able to get a drug, nevirapine, that can prevent mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. if mothers take it during labor. The problem is not simply the drug's cost, he said, but rather the logistics of making it available to women who may not know that they are infected and most of whom deliver at home, as is the case in Uganda. These problems are greatest in rural areas.
Promoting use of condoms and programs for voluntary testing and counseling programs has worked, but more such efforts are needed in rural areas, Dr. Serwadda said.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Making Ownership Easier For Lower-Income People

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
After living in a two-family house in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn for 10 years, Maria and Luciano Genao, who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, wanted a house of their own. But they had only a sketchy idea of how much they could afford and how much the down payment and closing costs would add to their purchase. They also had no idea how to find a mortgage, a real estate agent or a lawyer, or what questions to ask, once they had found them.
 This year, however, they enrolled in a 10-hour seminar for potential homeowners offered by Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a nonprofit organization in Brooklyn. The Genaos, bolstered by what they learned, bought the two-family house they had been living in, and now they rent out the other half. 
 Antonia Zambrano and her parents lived in an apartment in Brooklyn after moving to the United States from Mexico 18 years ago. But this year Ms. Zambrano and her father enrolled in the Neighbors Helping Neighbors seminar (one conducted in Spanish). Soon thereafter they bought a two-family house in the Grasmere section of Staten Island -- a house that easily accommodates Ms. Zambrano, her parents and two sisters, one of whom is married and has two sons.
Neighbors Helping Neighbors is one of several community counseling agencies that walk people of low to moderate incomes through the steps required to buy a house, condominium or cooperative. 
Eight such agencies are sponsored by the Manhattan-based New York Mortgage Coalition. In addition to Neighbors Helping Neighbors, the others are Asian Americans for Equality, Cypress Hills Development Corporation, Housing Action Council, Long Island Housing Partnership, Neighborhood Housing Services of Jamaica, Neighborhood Housing Services of the North Bronx and Southern Brooklyn Community Organization. 
The 10 banks in the New York Mortgage Coalition -- Astoria Federal Savings, Banco Popular, Bank of New York, Citibank, Fleet, GreenPoint, HSBC, J. P. Morgan Chase, M&T and Washington Mutual -- contribute money for the coalition's education and counseling services and offer qualified borrowers discounted interest rates as well as low points and fees. 
Several of the banks belong to a first-time home-buyers program that gives up to $5,000 in matching funds for low- and moderate-income home buyers to apply toward down payments and closing costs. 
Most of the lower rates offered by the 10 participating banks are for borrowers in low- and moderate-income households, as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The guidelines specify that income be less than 80 percent of the area median income: this year, $50,250 in New York City, $73,120 in Westchester County and $66,400 on Long Island. Last year, the median loan amount for people who were counseled by any of the eight agencies was $146,850. But the banks also made bigger loans, depending on the type of home and the borrower's credit rating. 
The Genaos in Borough Park, for example, bought their house with a $256,000 30-year mortgage at 6.25 percent interest from J. P. Morgan Chase, while the Zambranos in Grasmere bought their house for $255,000, also with a 30-year mortgage from Chase at 6.25 percent interest. Ms. Genao and Ms. Zambrano each said she got half a percentage point taken off the interest rate and almost $4,000 taken off closing costs of about $15,000 for attending the seminar and a counseling session. 
Some bargain rates offered by banks grow out of a law passed by Congress in 1977 that essentially requires federally regulated banks to make loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, while some of the other bargain rates are proprietary or offered by a relative handful of banks. 
Fleet, for example, allows qualifying home buyers who are paying less than 20 percent down, and who would therefore usually be required to buy mortgage insurance, to obtain the loan without the monthly insurance payment, said Tim McDonnell, a Fleet senior loan officer. That savings, he said, usually averages $80 to $200 a month. 
"Each bank in the coalition," said Caroline Samuels, the director of the New York Mortgage Coalition, "has its own set of incentives, depending on borrowers' credit, whether their income is slightly higher than the area median income or whether they are buying rental properties. Our purpose is to remove any barriers that may exist for traditionally under-served communities to enter the mainstream mortgage credit market." 
From the coalition's inception in 1993 through last December, 13,889 potential home buyers received counseling and 2,585 households received loans -- 2,372 becoming first-time home buyers.

HEADLINE: Farm Subsidies That Kill 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
J'accuse! I hate to condemn a colleague this way, but our tax dollars are going to pay an indolent New York journalist for not growing wheat on the West Coast.
 Could there be a worse indictment of American agricultural policy, rendered even more scandalous by the new $180 billion farm bill signed by President Bush? 
 Actually, there is a worse indictment. By inflating farm subsidies even more, Congress and the Bush administration are impoverishing and occasionally killing Africans whom we claim to be trying to help. 
Last week at the G-8 summit conference in Canada, Mr. Bush and other world leaders spoke piously about their desire to help Africa help itself. Earlier, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill traveled around Africa with Bono complaining about African governance (but in a compassionate sort of way).
Our compassion may be well meant, but it is also hypocritical. The U.S., Europe and Japan spend $350 billion each year on agricultural subsidies (seven times as much as global aid to poor countries), and this money creates gluts that lower commodity prices and erode the living standard of the world's poorest people. 
"These subsidies are crippling Africa's chance to export its way out of poverty," said James Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, in a speech last month.
Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the United Nations Development Program, estimates that these farm subsidies cost poor countries about $50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports. By coincidence, that's about the same as the total of rich countries' aid to poor countries, so we take back with our left hand every cent we give with our right.
"It's holding down the prosperity of very poor people in Africa and elsewhere for very narrow, selfish interests of their own," Mr. Malloch Brown says of the rich world's agricultural policy.
It also seems a tad hypocritical of us to complain about governance in third-world countries when we allow tiny groups of farmers to hijack billion of dollars out of our taxes.
For example, the U.S. has only 25,000 cotton growers, but they are prosperous (with an average net worth of $800,000) and thus influential. So the U.S. spends $2 billion a year subsidizing them, and American production of cotton has almost doubled over the last 20 years -- even though the U.S. is an inefficient, high-cost producer. The result is a glut that costs African countries $250 million each year, according to a World Bank study published in February. 
And when a poor cotton farmer in West Africa goes bust because of our cotton subsidies, he has no savings to fall back on. Rather, he starves. He cannot afford medicine for his sick baby, and the child dies. He cannot afford a midwife when his wife is pregnant, and so she is crippled in childbirth. He cannot afford worming medication for his children, and so they grow anemic and do poorly in school -- and cannot concentrate when Americans lecture them about their poor governance.
Back to the freeloading journalist, whom I'll rat on in a moment. He defends himself by saying that his plot of farmland was put into a federal subsidy program by a previous owner. So he gets $588 each year for what rural America calls "farming the government, rather than farming the land."
Such absurdities -- and particularly the latest farm bill, a transparent political payoff -- accomplish nothing. I grew up in rural America, and if the farm bill revived small towns like Wapato, Ore., a hamlet that once flourished near my family's farm and has now completely disappeared, then I would be sympathetic. But the fact is that 60 percent of American farmers get no subsidies at all, and 47 percent of commodity payments go to large farms with average household incomes of $135,000.
The subsidies go overwhelmingly to farmers tilling the ground, not those raising livestock. When I was a kid, we raised sheep -- a lousy idea, since fewer and fewer Americans eat lamb or wear wool. So in the absence of a good sheep subsidy, we bowed to market forces, and now the only sheep left on my parents' farm are a few family friends. That's the way a market economy is supposed to work. 
The bottom line is that farm subsidies cripple Africa and go to people who don't really need them -- like that grasping journalist who gets $588 a year for not growing wheat. Who is that person? Er, it's me.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLAN FOR IRAQ IS SAID TO INCLUDE ATTACK ON 3 SIDES 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4 

 BODY:
An American military planning document calls for air, land and sea-based forces to attack Iraq from three directions -- the north, south and west -- in a campaign to topple President Saddam Hussein, according to a person familiar with the document. 
 The document envisions tens of thousands of marines and soldiers probably invading from Kuwait. Hundreds of warplanes based in as many as eight countries, possibly including Turkey and Qatar, would unleash a huge air assault against thousands of targets, including airfields, roadways and fiber-optics communications sites. 
 Special operations forces or covert C.I.A. operatives would strike at depots or laboratories storing or manufacturing Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to launch them. 
None of the countries identified in the document as possible staging areas have been formally consulted about playing such a role, officials said, underscoring the preliminary nature of the planning. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld visited American bases in Kuwait and Qatar and the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain on his most recent trip to the Persian Gulf region in June. 
The existence of the document that outlined significant aspects of a "concept" for a war against Iraq as it stood about two months ago indicates an advanced state of planning in the military even though President Bush continues to state in public and to his allies that he has no fine-grain war plan on his desk for the invasion of Iraq. 
Yet the concept for such a plan is now highly evolved and is apparently working its way through military channels. Once a consensus is reached on the concept, the steps toward assembling a final war plan and, most importantly, the element of timing for ground deployments and commencement of an air war, represent the final sequencing that Mr. Bush will have to decide.
Mr. Bush has received at least two briefings from Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the head of the Central Command, on the broad outlines, or "concept of operations," for a possible attack against Iraq. The most recent briefing was on June 19, according to the White House. 
"Right now, we're at the stage of conceptual thinking and brainstorming," a senior defense official said. "We're pretty far along."
The highly classified document, entitled "CentCom Courses of Action," was prepared by planners at the Central Command in Tampa, Fla., according to the person familiar with the document.
Officials say it has already undergone revisions, but is a snapshot of an important, but preliminary stage, in a comprehensive process that translates broad ideas into the detailed, step-by-step blueprint for combat operations that the Pentagon defines as a "war plan." 
Still, the document, compiled in a long set of briefing slides, offers a rare glimpse into the inner sanctum of the war planners assigned to think about options for defeating Iraq.
"It is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to develop contingency plans and, from time to time, to update them," Victoria Clarke, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said today. "In fact, we have recently issued new general planning guidance, and that generates activity at the staff level."
Officials said neither Mr. Rumsfeld, nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff or General Franks had been briefed on this specific document as yet.
The source familiar with the document described its contents to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, expressing frustration that the planning reflected at least in this set of briefing slides was insufficiently creative, and failed to incorporate fully the advances in tactics and technology that the military has made since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Administration officials say they are still weighing options other than war to dislodge Mr. Hussein. But most military and administration officials believe that a coup in Iraq would be unlikely to succeed, and that a proxy battle using local forces would not be enough to drive the Iraqi leader from power.
Nothing in the Central Command document or in interviews with senior military officials suggests that an attack on Iraq is imminent. 
Indeed, senior administration officials continue to say that any offensive would probably be delayed until early next year, allowing time to create the right military, economic and diplomatic conditions.
Nonetheless, there are several signs that the military is preparing for a major air campaign and land invasion.
Thousands of marines from the First Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton, Calif., the marine unit designated for the gulf, have stepped up their mock assault drills, a Pentagon adviser said. The military is building up bases in several Persian Gulf states, including a major airfield in Qatar called Al Udeid. Thousands of American troops are already stationed in the region.
After running dangerously low on precision-guided bombs during the war in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said it has stepped up production of critical munitions. The Air Force is stockpiling weapons, ammunition and spare parts, like airplane engines, at depots in the United States and in the Middle East.
"We don't know when or where the next contingency will be," Gen. Lester L. Lyles, head of the Air Force Materiel Command, said in an interview this week. "But we want to fill up the stock bins."
The Central Command document, as described by the source familiar with it, is significant not just for what it contains, but also for what it leaves out.
The document describes in precise detail specific Iraqi bases, surface-to-air missile sites, air defense networks and fiber-optics communications to be attacked. "The target list is so huge it's almost egregious," the source said. "It's obvious that we've been watching these guys for an awfully long time."
Dozens of slides are devoted to organizational details, like the precise tonnage of American munitions stored at various bases around the Persian Gulf, deployment time lines for troops leaving East and West Coast ports for the gulf region, and the complexities of interwoven intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance networks.
At the same time, according to the source, the document is silent on or barely mentions other important aspects of any operation, suggesting that there are several highly classified documents that address different parts of the planning.
For instance, the "Courses of Action" document does not mention other coalition forces, casualty estimates, how Mr. Hussein may himself be a target, or what political regime might follow the Iraqi leader if an American-led attack was successful, the source said.
Nor does the document discuss the sequencing of air and ground campaigns, the precise missions of special operations forces or the possibility of urban warfare in downtown Baghdad, with Iraqi forces possibly deploying chemical weapons.
In fact, the discussion about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction is relatively terse. The document discusses the broad threat such weapons pose to American forces and surrounding countries, the need to deter Baghdad from using them, and, failing that, devising ways to counter them.
It describes the number of Marine and Army divisions, air expeditionary forces, and aircraft carriers. These and other forces add up to as many as 250,000 troops, the source familiar with the document said, but there is little detail about those forces beyond that.
Nor does the document contain a comprehensive analysis of the Iraqi ground forces, including the Republican Guard and various security forces that are believed to be fiercely loyal to Mr. Hussein. This again suggests that such analysis is either incomplete or is contained in another planning document.
By emphasizing a large American force, the document seems to reflect a view that a successful campaign would require sizable conventional forces staging from Kuwait, or at least held in reserve there.
An alternative plan, championed by retired Gen. Wayne A. Downing of the Army, calls for conquering Iraq with a combination of airstrikes and special operations attacks in coordination with indigenous fighters, similar to the campaign in Afghanistan. Relying solely on that approach appears to have been ruled out.
General Downing resigned last week as Mr. Bush's chief adviser on counterterrorism, reportedly frustrated by the administration's tough talk against Iraq but lack of action. 
Among the many questions the military and the administration must address before staging an invasion is where to base air and ground forces in the region.
Geography and history, specifically the gulf war, would suggest that countries like Kuwait, Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain would be likely candidates for staging troops or air combat missions. 
Any mention of using bases in Saudi Arabia, from which the United States staged the bulk of the airstrikes in the gulf war, is conspicuously missing from the document, said an official familiar with the briefing slides. The United States would need permission to use Saudi airspace adjacent to Iraq, if not Saudi bases themselves, officials said.
The Saudis have allowed the United States to run the air war against Afghanistan from a sophisticated command center at Prince Sultan Air Base, outside Riyadh, but have prohibited the Air Force from flying any attack missions from Saudi soil.
Senior Air Force officials have expressed mounting frustration with restrictions the Saudis have placed on American operations, and the Central Command is developing an alternate command center at the sprawling Udeid base in Qatar, should that be needed.
The Central Command document does not contain a time line of when American forces could start flowing to the gulf or how long it would take to put all the forces in place. Nor does it answer one of the big questions administration officials are wrestling with: how will Mr. Hussein react if there is a large buildup of conventional forces, such as the United States had in the gulf war.
"The Iraqis aren't just going to sit on their butts while we put in 250,000 people," a military analyst said.

 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"ABOUT A BOY," starring Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz (PG-13, 101 minutes). In this sweet, breezy comedy of redemption, Mr. Grant plays Will Freeman, a rich London slacker who has made it his goal in life to be as shallow as possible. Devoted to clothes, videos, pop music and nice stuff, Will decides to take up a sideline: seducing single mothers. This project leads him to Marcus, an awkward 12-year-old with a depressive mother (Ms. Collette). For no good reason, the boy decides to become Will's best friend and ends up teaching him valuable lessons about the importance of other people. The story, based on Nick Hornby's novel, is thoroughly sentimental, but the Weitzes bring it off with a light, knowing touch (A. O. Scott).

"BAD COMPANY," starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 111 minutes). Mr. Rock plays Jake, a chess hustler and ticket scalper who learns that he had a twin brother, Kevin (also played by Mr. Rock), who worked under cover for the C.I.A. He is asked to replace his assassinated twin in a mission to apprehend a Eurotrash arms dealer (Peter Stormare). Mr. Hopkins is the agent who recruits Jake; the closest thing to wit in his performance is the way he intently chews gum while blowing away bad guys, terrorizing the always screaming Jake. The real suspense would come in asking why Mr. Rock would bother to star in a movie like this one. The film has the whiff of something stale, like many of the nonpolitical terrorist-as-villain spectaculars that have had their expiration dates changed since Sept. 11; it's not "Bad Company" so much as a bad movie (Elvis Mitchell).

"THE BOURNE IDENTITY," starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman (PG-13, 113 minutes). Mr. Damon plays Jason Bourne, a C.I.A. superassassin with amnesia who is chased across Europe in the company of a charming German waif (Ms. Potente) by his employers. There are espionage writers who use the genre to explore the complexities of geopolitics, but Robert Ludlum, on whose novel this competent, enjoyable picture is based, was not one of them. At a time when thrillers are shadowed by real-world anxieties, the implausibility and irrelevance of this movie, which amusingly imagines the C.I.A. as a supercompetent, virtually omniscient operation, comes as something of a relief. Mr. Damon handles his character's existential crisis with fierce adroitness, and Mr. Liman's direction has an old-fashioned swiftness and efficiency (Scott).

"CQ," starring Jeremy Davies and Gerard Depardieu. Directed by Roman Coppola (R, 91 minutes). Set in 1969, "CQ" is a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a femme fatale spy movie. Sitting on the periphery of the tumult is Paul (Mr. Davies), an editor and second-unit director working on a small, personal film of his own in his dreary Parisian apartment. He has dreams of making a hot, personal movie -- his own life as a series of journal entries -- and is so self-obsessed that he's almost paralyzed by the real world. The film, Mr. Coppola's directorial debut, has a pixilated spirit; the filmmaker splatters the scene with his love for the movies, comic books and music, and the movie vibrates with that affection. These elements are the building blocks of pop, and he uses a dry, sharp wit to delineate the story (Mitchell).

* "THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS," starring Kieran Culkin, Emile Hirsch and Jodie Foster. Directed by Peter Care (R, 105 minutes). What gangling, hormonally challenged 14- or 15-year-old boy hasn't imagined transcending the miseries of adolescence by becoming an action-adventure superhero? The screen adaptation of Chris Fuhrman's cult coming-of-age novel captures that age of embarrassment with an accuracy (and compassion) that eludes most Hollywood teenage films. Mr. Culkin and Mr. Hirsch are schoolmates, pranksters and collaborators on a comic book whose characters are extensions of events and people in their lives. The movie vents their frustrations with clever animated fantasy sequences. As their acts of vandalism and mischief increase in daring, there are dire consequences (Stephen Holden).

"DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD," starring Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn and Ashley Judd. Directed by Callie Khouri (PG-13, 110 minutes). The sudsy film adaptation of two best-selling novels by Rebecca Wells tells of mother-daughter strife, alcoholism and other ills besetting a Louisiana family over three generations. Ms. Bullock is a New York playwright dragged home by her mother's friends on a family peace-making mission. Ms. Burstyn is Mom, a dithery drama queen, and Ms. Judd the same Mom as a harried, embittered young mother with a drinking problem. Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight and Maggie Smith are the three childhood friends with whom Mom formed a pact of friendship more than half a century earlier. The connections between past and present feel tenuous, and the Oprah-ready mood of uplift is tainted with a strain of cuteness (Holden).

"ENIGMA," starring Dougray Scott, Kate Winslet, Jeremy Northam, Tom Hollander, Corin Redgrave and Saffron Burrows. Directed by Michael Apted; written by Tom Stoppard (R, 117 minutes). Set among the World War II British code breakers in Bletchley Park, Mr. Apted's film explores a fascinating chapter in military history and concocts a story full of intrigue, sex and mystery. The main mystery, sadly, is why such a promising subject and so much talent among the filmmakers and the cast should have produced such a talky, unsatisfying muddle. Mr. Scott plays a troubled mathematician, who with the help of Ms. Winslet's dowdy file clerk, tries to find his former girlfriend (Ms. Burrows), who has disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Much of the film is told in flashback, and so many subplots swirl about in the clammy English air that the concision and dramatic focus needed to make this historical thriller thrilling are never achieved (Scott).

* "THE FAST RUNNER (ATANARJUAT)," starring Natar Ungalaaq and Sylvia Ivalu. Directed by Zacharias Kunuk (no rating, 172 minutes). This epic, the first feature film made in the Inuit language, is not merely an interesting document from a far-off place; it is a masterpiece. Mr. Kunuk's adaptation of an ancient folk tale, which won the Camera d'Or for best first feature at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is much more than an ethnographic curiosity. It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story, about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality and is full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape. Mr. Kunuk and his cast have accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing his archetypal characters with complicated psychological motives and responses. The combination of dramatic realism and archaic grandeur is irresistibly powerful (Scott).

"HARVARD MAN," starring Adrian Grenier, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams. Written and directed by James Toback (R, 100 minutes). Another maddening, fascinating mess from Mr. Toback, one of the most undisciplined American filmmakers, and also one of the most intelligent. Ms. Gellar, taking a break from vampire slaying, plays a cyncial, sexually confident cheerleader whose father is a powerful mobster. Her boyfriend (Mr. Grenier), the title character, plays point-guard for the Crimson and dabbles in existential philosophy, student-teacher sex and LSD. These interests involve him in all kinds of trouble, and he ends up spinning through Cambridge in a hallucinogen-induced frenzy, pursued by wannabe-wiseguys, kinky F.B.I. agents and the comedian Al Franken. Coherence and plausibility are beside the point; the movie has an antic, feckless vivacity, and even its silliest moments hum with intellectual energy and artistic daring (Scott).

"THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST," starring Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Frances O'Connor, Reese Witherspoon, Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by Oliver Parker (PG, 94 minutes). Hyped up with fantasy sequences, a hot-air balloon and music that sounds more 1920's than 1890's, Oscar Wilde's 1895 comic masterpiece has been reduced from a scathing satire of upper-class superficiality to a goofy, gimmicky costume comedy. If the playwright's dazzling language is intact, the embellishments interrupt its rhythms, and the low-key, realistic performances don't synchronize with the style of the play. The classic 1952 film adaptation, starring Edith Evans, is far preferable (Holden).

* "INSOMNIA," starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Directed by Christopher Nolan (R, 116 minutes). In this noir thriller, Detective Will Dormer (Mr. Pacino) is tracking a murderer in a small Alaska town while pursued by his own guilt. Back in Los Angeles, Will is the object of an internal affairs investigation. His chase is preordained to end in tragedy, and he knows it. This intensely sharp-witted remake of a 1997 Norwegian film also stars Mr. Williams as the subject of the detective's chase, a canny murderer with no one to brag to except Will. The suspense in Mr. Nolan's film comes not in the standard whodunit plot turns but from another question: will having too much in the hero's head bring him down? (Mitchell).

"JUWANNA MANN," starring Miguel A. Nunez Jr. and Vivica A. Fox. Directed by Jesse Vaughan (PG-13, 90 minutes). There is very little new in this picture about an arrogant pro basketball player who becomes a better man by spending time as a woman. Its basically "Slamdunk Tootsie." While in disguise, the hero falls in love with a teammate (Ms. Fox) who regards him as a sisterly confidante, and fends off the advances of a besotted hip-hop dandy, played with demented exuberance by Tommy Davidson, who in his scenes lifts the picture from moderately amusing to the intermittently hilarious (Scott).

* "LILO AND STITCH," with the voices of Chris Sanders, Daveigh Chase, Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames. Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois (PG, 89 minutes). In this charming exercise in intergalactic multiculturalism, Stitch, the snaggle-toothed, ill-behaved result of an alien genetic experiment, crashes to Earth, where he is adopted by a young Hawaiian girl named Lilo. The pair must contend with extraterrestrial law enforcement and a nosy earth-bound social worker, and their triumph over these adversities involves the usual Disney blend of comic anarchy, musical numbers (this time with an Elvis theme) and heart-tugging sentimentality. The movie's family relationships are addressed with low-key realism, and the animation has a lovely, gentle precision, with plenty of room for visual comedy but less of the noise and chaos that have become the hallmarks of 3-D animation. This movie suggests that the old-fashioned, flat, painted kind of animation still has much to offer (Scott).

* "LOVELY AND AMAZING," starring Catherine Keener, Brenda Blethyn, Dermot Mulroney and Emily Mortimer. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener (R, 91 minutes). This smart, acidic comedy by the director of "Walking and Talking" could be described as a West Coast answer to "Sex and the City," minus that series' high-gloss glamour and erotic joie de vivre. Ms. Keener and Ms. Mortimer are sisters, both attractive and in their 30's, who have major self-esteem problems and poor taste in men. Ms. Blethyn is their vain mother who develops complications after liposuction. The movie zeroes in on contemporary narcissism with a needling accuracy that illustrates exactly the way some people allow their insecurities to poison their intimate relationships. But once it has limned its characters (Ms. Keener's is by far the most vivid), it doesn't go anywhere in particular (Holden).

"MEN IN BLACK II," starring Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle , Rip Torn, Rosario Dawson and Tony Shalhoub. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 82 minutes). If your memory of the first one is a little hazy, don't worry: that was the point all along. And in any case this sequel provides the same pleasant, pointless mixture of whimsy and kineticism. Of course, like the "Ghostbusters" and "Austin Powers" sequels (to give only two out of several thousand possible examples), the fun has diminished because the novelty has worn off. Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones coast along, joined by Mr. Torn and Mr. Shalhoub (and a talking bulldog) from "Men in Black," and a host of creepy, scaly, funny aliens, including Ms. Boyle, her icy charms enhanced by hundreds of slimy tentacles and an extendable green tongue (Scott).

"MINORITY REPORT," starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). This atmospheric new thriller is a muscular and dense exercise of skill and verve. (Ironically, this exercise may be the most adult film that Mr. Spielberg has made in some time; it's about the bloody blurring of passion and violence -- a compassionate noir.) In 2054, a law enforcement unit called Pre-Crime exists to stop murders before they begin; three Pre-Cogs -- beings who float in a nutrient-rich fluid -- can predict when a crime will be committed and know the identity of the perpetrator. When the unit's chief, John Anderton, is accused of a crime he hasn't yet committed, he's soon on the run. Mr. Cruise does as much sprinting in this picture as he has in his entire filmography. The fluid bursts of quick-cut images seen on the monitors also show that Mr. Spielberg isn't about to be shown up by those quick-fingered, compulsively exhibitionistic upstarts like David Fincher. With "Minority Report," he toys with the idea that there's more -- and less -- to Mr. Cruise than meets the eye and says we shouldn't trust our eyes anyway. But doesn't he always? (Mitchell).

"MR. DEEDS," starring Adam Sandler and Winona Ryder. Directed by Steven Brill (PG-13, 91 minutes). It could be said that the remake of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Mr. Sandler in the title role, is redundant, since the actor has been remaking Capraesque movies for most of his career. As in Capra's original 1936 classic, Longfellow Deeds still lives in Mandrake Falls, is an aspiring greeting-card poet and has no patience for pretension. And once again, he is left a fortune by a distant relative: adjusted for inflation, the amount is $40 billion instead of $20 million. He's taken to New York, where he'll presumably be enticed by the city. Mr. Sandler's films are always about the arrogant getting a deserved comeuppance at the hands of humbler types, but this is the first time he seems a little smug himself. "Mr. Deeds" has him rehashing a role he has performed so many times before he could be doing this picture in his sleep. The result is likely to be that he'll put audiences to sleep (Mitchell).

* "THE PIANO TEACHER," starring Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel. Directed by Michael Haneke (not rated, 130 minutes; in French with English subtitles). Ms. Huppert and Mr. Magimel won best acting awards in Cannes last spring for their unblinking portrayal of the sadomasochistic relationship between an imperious, sexually repressed piano teacher at a Viennese conservatory and a handsome younger student who idolizes her. The powerful, deeply disturbing film is neither titillating soft-core porn nor a psychiatric case study, but a platform for the director, a serious moral theorist, to explore voyeurism (the audience's as well as the main character's). The movie also addresses sex and power and the relationship between art and life. Be warned: the lovers' climactic encounter, in which Ms. Huppert is physically brutalized, is hard to watch (Holden).

"PUMPKIN," starring Christina Ricci, Hank Harris and Brenda Blethyn. Directed by Adam Larson Broder and Tony R. Abrams (R, 116 minutes). In his uneasy mixture of satire and sentiment, Ms. Ricci plays Carolyn McDuffie, a southern California sorority sister who risks everything -- the respect of her peers, her tennis-star boyfriend, her very sanity -- to pursue a love affair with a young retarded man named Pumpkin (Mr. Harris). The movie is sometimes sweet, and often incisive in its mockery of social ambition and phony compassion, but the filmmakers have not figured out how to balance earnestness and mockery, and they end up sneering at the charming, naive love story they have, perhaps in spite of themselves, created (Scott).

"SCOOBY DOO," starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG, 105 minutes). The old Hanna-Barbera cartoon was cheap, silly and occasionally charming in its blithe stupidity. This adaptation, combining live action with 3-D computer-generated animation, looks pretty expensive, and its stupidity is, for the most part, charmless. The human cast -- Mr. Prinze, especially -- does a good-humored job of sending up and paying homage to the old show, but its efforts are overwhelmed by a relentless pop music score, hideous special effects and a plot that violates all the rules of the old series for no good reason (Scott).

"SPIDER-MAN," starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and J. K. Simmons. Directed by Sam Raimi (PG-13, 120 minutes). The most amazing thing about Mr. Raimi's franchise-founding adaptation of the 40-year-old Marvel comic book is that its high-tech special effects are overshadowed by witty writing and inventive performances. Mr. Maguire rediscovers the smart, alienated adolescent underneath the superhero's mask and mocks the heroic crime-fighter conceit without subverting it. Mr. Raimi and David Koepp, the screenwriter, are masters of pop realism, tossing off easy jokes and corny sentiment with gratifying enthusiasm. The romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Ms. Dunst) is as ripe as an old Hollywood melodrama, and its minor-key conclusion is like something out of Henry James. The cold, thin, computer-generated action sequences and a fatigued performance by Mr. Dafoe dampen the fun a little, but Mr. Maguire, Ms. Dunst and Mr. Simmons, in an uproarious turn as the irascible tabloid editor J. Jonah Jameson, manage to save the day (Scott).

"STAR WARS: EPISODE II -- ATTACK OF THE CLONES," starring Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee. Directed by George Lucas (PG, 132 minutes). Early and late, in a starship chase sequence and in a light-saber duel between Yoda and the nefarious Count Dooku (Mr. Lee), some of the old "Star Wars" magic returns. But otherwise the mixture of grandeur and whimsy that made the first three movies so thrilling has been sacrificed to self-importance, an incomprehensible plot and some of the worst screen acting of the year. Mr. Christensen and Ms. Portman are dreadful as Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, who are reunited (and fall in love) in the midst of a messy political crisis that threatens the stability of the republic and the power of the Jedi order. Millions of people will see this dreary, joyless picture, but only those pursuing advanced degrees in "Star Wars"-ology will be able to appreciate it (Scott).

"THE SUM OF ALL FEARS," starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Phil Alden Robinson (PG-13, 124 minutes). Given our national jitters after Sept. 11, the updated film adaptation of Tom Clancy's 1991 novel about a terrorist nuclear attack on Baltimore is inescapably gripping. But the scenario, in which cartoonish neo-Nazis carry out the secret attack hoping to draw Russia and the United States into war, is bogus. And Mr. Affleck, the third actor to play Mr. Clancy's C.I.A. hotshot, Jack Ryan, in a Hollywood movie, lacks the gravitas for the role. Even so, the movie succeeds in churning up a froth of suspense before finally collapsing into a swamp of sentimentality (Holden).

* "SUNSHINE STATE," starring Edie Falco, Angela Bassett, Mary Alice, Mary Steenburgen and Timothy Hutton. Written and directed by John Sayles (PG-13; 141 minutes). Mr. Sayles's panoramic exploration of life in Delrona Beach, a fictional Florida coastal town in the throes of development, is as rich and even-handed a mosaic of American life as any filmmaker has brought to the screen. The overlapping stories revolve around two families, one white, the other black, who are being pressured to sell their property to greedy developers. Among more than a dozen characters who cross paths in the course of the story, the most compelling are Marly Temple (Ms. Falco), a sardonic young woman who runs her family's motel, and Desiree Perry (Ms. Bassett), a former teenage rebel who returns after a 25-year absence to confront her straitlaced mother (Ms. Alice). More than a probing civics lesson, the movie takes the political and spiritual pulse of our restless national psyche (Holden).

* "13 CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING," starring Matthew McConaughey, John Turturro, Clea DuVall, Amy Irving and Alan Arkin. Directed by Jill Sprecher; written by Karen Sprecher and Jill Sprecher (R, 102 minutes). This movie's general subject -- that mysterious thing that might be called fate, serendipity, happenstance or luck -- has inspired recent movies, but the Sprecher sisters wield their pop mysticism with breathtaking intelligence and control. Four stories, all involving adrift, unlucky Manhattanites, spiral around each other in a chronological scheme that is as lucid and complex as a piece of music. Mr. Arkin, in one of his best recent performances, plays an insurance executive with a fatalistic view of the universe and a guilty conscience, and the actor's dry, precise sense of comedy gives the movie the absurdist kick of a Beckett play (Scott).

"WINDTALKERS," starring Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach. Directed by John Woo (R, 134 minutes). In this epic of war and lesson in tolerance, Mr. Woo is meticulous in melding his own intimate style into the cliches of a large-scale war movie, paying homage to all the tired conventions of the genre; it's an honor these cliches don't deserve. Driving the plot is the tension between Sergeant Enders (Mr. Cage) and Ben Yahzee (Mr. Beach), a young marine who is being trained along with other Navajos during World War II to transmit information from the battle front because their native language is a code that cannot be broken by the Japanese. "Windtalkers" short-sheets the real-life premise: imagine becoming a marine, the elite of United States soldiers, only to be baby-sat and kept from becoming part of the action. The picture invents an angle -- kill the Navajos if they're captured, a battle condition of which there's no known record -- and ignores the more compelling truth: that the Navajos are prevented from being active participants in the same war in which a Native American helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima. The filmmakers seem to have decided that this issue and the attendant question -- how do you prove you're a patriot if you're treated like a second-class citizen? -- are unimportant (Mitchell).

HEADLINE: Pennies an Hour, and No Way Up 

BYLINE:  By Tom Hayden and Charles Kernaghan; Tom Hayden is a writer and former California state senator. Charles Kernaghan is director of the National Labor Committee in New York City.

 BODY:
In last week's meeting in Canada, the Group of Eight industrial nations grappled with the question of how to better economic conditions in poor nations. One powerful means would be to improve the conditions of workers in sweatshops. Two billion people in the world make less than two American dollars a day. As voters and consumers of sweatshop products, Americans can make a difference in ending the miserable conditions under which these people work.
 Some argue that sweatshops are simply a step up a ladder toward the next generation's success: the garment worker at her loom is carrying out some objective law of development, or the young girl making toys for our children is breaking out of male-dominated feudalism. This line of thinking recalls the mythic rise of our immigrant ancestors to the middle class and beyond. 
 But the real story of those white ethnic ancestors was hardly a smooth ride up the escalator. Life in a New York was better than oppression abroad, but people worked 16 hours a day for paltry wages, lived in cellars with raw sewage, died of starvation and fever and were crowded into tenements. Their misery shocked reformers like Jacob Riis and Charles Dickens. They fought their way out -- marched for economic justice, built unions, voted and finally forced the Gilded Age to become the New Deal.
Today young, mostly female workers in Bangladesh, a Muslim country that is the fourth-largest garment producer for the United States market, are paid an average of 1.6 cents for each baseball cap with a Harvard logo that they sew. The caps retail at the Harvard bookstore for $17, which means the garment workers, who often are younger than the Harvard students, are being paid a tenth of 1 percent of the cap's price in the market. Also in Bangladesh, women receive 5 cents for each $17.99 Disney shirt they sew. Wages like these are not enough to climb the ladder with.
There are similar conditions in China. Three million young Chinese women working for wages as low as 12 cents an hour make 80 percent of the sporting goods and toys sold in the United States each year. Companies like Mattel spend 30 times more to advertise a toy than they pay the workers in China to make it.
Each year Americans buy 924 million garments and other textile items made in Bangladesh and $23.5 billion worth of toys and sporting goods from China. Don't we have the consumer and political power to pressure our corporations to end sweatshop wages paid to the people who make these goods? These workers are not demanding stock options and Jazzercise studios. Women in Bangladesh say they could care for their children if their wages rose to 34 cents an hour, two-tenths of 1 percent of the retail price of the Harvard hat.
Some economists argue that even the most exploited and impoverished workers are better off than those who are unemployed or trapped in slave labor. But that argument is not about offering anyone a ladder up, but about which ring of Dante's inferno people in developing nations are consigned to. We don't want Disney, Mattel, Wal-Mart or other major American companies to leave the developing world. We simply want to end the race to the bottom in which companies force countries to compete in offering the lowest wages for their people's labor. There should be a floor beneath which no one has to live.
Our elected officials should end their subservience to corporate donors and begin asking some big questions: Aren't we entitled to know the addresses of corporate sweatshops in developing countries so they can be open to monitoring by local advocates? Why should our tax dollars subsidize government purchases from companies that operate sweatshops?
Under our customs laws, we ban imports made with inmate and indentured labor, so why not extend the ban to include those made with sweatshop and child labor? And if we insist on enforcement of laws against pirate labels and CD's, why not protect 16-year-olds who make CD's for American companies? We should be helping these workers elbow and push their way up from squalor just as American progressives once helped our immigrant forebears.

HEADLINE: Vatican Blames Economic Slowdown for First Deficit in 9 Years 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: VATICAN CITY, July 5 

 BODY:
The Vatican today reported its first deficit in nine years, blaming the worldwide financial slump, aggravated by the Sept. 11 attacks, for the shortfall.
 Increased contributions last year from dioceses around the world were not enough to balance investment losses, according to the economic director, Cardinal Sergio Sebastiani. 
He presented the Vatican's financial statement for 2001, which showed a deficit of $3,062,000.
The Vatican went through 23 money-losing years until 1993, but then bishops worldwide agreed to directly assist the Vatican. Those contributions, known as Peter's Pence, reached $51.9 million in 2001. Cardinal Sebastiani provided no breakdown from individual countries, but in the past, dioceses in Germany and the United States have been the biggest givers.
The sex-abuse scandals that have shaken the church in the United States and other countries have raised concern that some Catholics may hold back on contributions, but Cardinal Sebastiani said he had no information on this year's donations.
The biggest expenses are costs of the Vatican's 2,700-member work force, including an expanding diplomatic presence around the world.
In a separate report, the Vatican said the government of the city-state registered a surplus of about $14 million last year, down from $22 million a year earlier. Much of those funds came from museum fees, which were particularly high during the 2000 Holy Year.
The Vatican's real estate is listed as worth about $650 million, not including such priceless holdings as St. Peter's Basilica. That is listed at a symbolic one euro, said Ivan Ruggiero, a Vatican accountant.
But, Cardinal Sebastiani said, "it doesn't mean it's for sale."

A Card Allows U.S. Banks To Aid Mexican Immigrants

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 5 

 BODY:
Before migrating illegally to the United States, many Mexicans throw away various forms of personal identification in an effort to avoid prosecution if caught by United States authorities. Recently, they have found an unexpected ally in their struggle to regain a legal identity once they are across the border: United States banks.
 For years, the banks had refused service to most Mexican immigrants because they could not verify their identities. But an unforeseen twist to an initiative by Mexico's government has allowed banks in the United States to court the millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants and the billions of dollars they represent. 
 After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Mexican government feared that the estimated 3.5 million Mexican citizens in the United States who had no identification -- no passport, Social Security card or driver's license -- could be mistaken for terrorists. It began lobbying the United States government to recognize as a valid piece of identification a consular identification card that it has been issuing for more than a decade.
Although the United States government has not agreed to accept the consular ID card, the card has been gaining legitimacy elsewhere. Los Angeles County and the City of Chicago recognize it, for instance, as do many police departments. And much to the surprise of Mexico's government, the cards have been opening the doors into -- and for -- the banking world.
Mexico's government hopes that with access to banks, its citizens will find cheaper vehicles than money-transfer businesses for sending billions of dollars in remittances to relatives back home. United States banks hope to reach out to the large and growing number of Hispanics, who are expected to surpass blacks as the largest minority group in the United States by 2005.
"If we're to be successful and continue to grow, we're going to have to become the bank of choice for the Hispanic community," said Jeffrey Bierer, a spokesman for Bank of America. Undocumented Mexican immigrants, he said, make up a large chunk of that community.
"It is a significant market now," he said. "It's growing every year."
The bank, which has most of its franchises in states with large populations of Mexican immigrants, like California, Texas and Florida, has recently introduced a $40 million advertising campaign aimed at Spanish-speaking customers. It is one of some 60 banks nationwide, mostly in Hispanic communities, that have begun catering to illegal immigrants, who often gain legal residence and become loyal customers.
The consular ID card "is a form of identification that the private sector finds acceptable," said John Byrne, senior counsel and compliance manager at the American Bankers Association. "We feel fairly comfortable" with the consular ID "as a form of identification, and we're becoming more comfortable the more we speak" with the United States government, he said.
Though the federal government has not officially sanctioned the card, it has not spoken against its increased use across the country. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service has warned that the ID should not be mistaken as a security blanket for illegal immigrants.
"The bottom line is that if these people, regardless of whether they have bank accounts -- and they could be big accounts -- if they are not legally here, they're still not legally here," said Bill Strassberger, an I.N.S. spokesman in Washington.
But because banks must prove only the identity of their customers, not the legality of their immigration status, the ID card has helped the banks pursue a mostly untapped market.
"Right now it's like a landslide -- the bankers come to us," said Enrique Berruga, under secretary for foreign affairs in Mexico's foreign ministry. "It's very good news for the American banking industry that all that money that was under the mattress is now in their arteries and their financial systems."
Mr. Berruga said that the 18 million legal and illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States represent at least $450 billion in purchasing power, an amount that is roughly 70 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product.
Much of this money makes its way back to Mexico in the form of remittances, which have steadily increased over the last decade. Mexico's central bank expects the figure to surpass $10 billion this year, meaning that it will soon eclipse tourism as Mexico's second-largest source of foreign revenue, after oil exports.
The Mexican government believes that remittances have become a permanent fixture of its relationship with the United States, a relationship that it increasingly defines along business terms -- the United States' demand for cheap labor and Mexico's plentiful supply of it.
"These people might be our single most important economic partner in the world," Mr. Berruga said.
Although only a small portion of United States banks have begun accepting the consular ID card, many of the largest institutions are leading the way.
Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, was the first bank to accept the consular ID, and in six months it opened more than 30,000 bank accounts for previously undocumented immigrants. It has a money transfer service and plans to offer credit cards and mortgages to those presenting the card.
Citibank, after recently spending $12.5 billion to buy Banamex, one of Mexico's largest banks, now accepts the consular ID as a way to increase its Mexican customers on both sides of the border.
This is good news for President Vicente Fox, who, before the terrorist attacks, had hoped to reach an immigration agreement with the United States to bring Mexican immigrants "out of the shadows." Though he has not been able to gain political recognition for his citizens, he has achieved at least some acknowledgment of them through the banks.
"I never thought I'd be a market advocate," said Manuel Orozco, a researcher at the Inter-American Dialogue, a hemispheric research group in Washington. "But Mexican immigrants find that for the immediate relief of their basic needs, their best ally is the market."

Japan Battles Bond Rating

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4 

 BODY:
Tacked up in banks and post offices across Japan, the posters of a fresh-faced beauty could be advertising a new financial thriller: Bond Girl vs. Botswana.
 "National Bonds -- could be a good idea," Norika Fujiwara, a popular model and actress, says as she looks to a blue-sky future. Ms. Fujiwara, in a sensible white shirt, is the poster girl for a new ad campaign to persuade Japan's small investors to plow their collective billions in summer bonuses into government bonds. 
 Pitted against Ms. Fujiwara and the constructive forces of good, Finance Ministry officials intimate, are New York-based bond ratings agencies and the speculative forces of evil. In the latest of a series of snubs, Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the bonds by two notches, to A2, or one grade below Botswana's rating. While Japanese bonds also have worse ratings than the bonds of Chile and Hungary, officials here have zeroed in on the African nation of Botswana. 
Although no James Bond movie has been filmed in Japan since "You Only Live Twice" in 1967, the stage is set for an action-packed struggle over competing visions of Japan. But it turns out that good and evil are not quite as clear as in the movies.
How, officials here ask, could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana's, has the world's largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world's largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people, which rules out any default similar to Argentina's. "It is nonsense to say that Japan's national strength is lower than African countries to which Japan is providing assistance," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said recently. Last year, Japan's aid to Botswana totaled about $12 million in grants and $106 million in loans.
On June 12, a hostile parliamentary committee grilled two Moody's officials about the downgrade. A week later, Takeo Hiranuma, minister of economy, trade and industry, joined the fray.
"Half of the people of Botswana are AIDS patients," he said, later apologizing for his remarks. "It is outrageous the rating is lower than such a country."
In an interview, Oteng Jenamo Tebape, Botswana's ambassador here, diplomatically avoided commenting directly on Japan, a major source of aid and, after the United States, the second-largest buyer of Botswana diamonds. But on the subject of government fiscal sobriety, he used the word "prudent" five times in five minutes.
"We have tried not to live above our means," he said. "We spend on a very, very conservative scale. From the 1980's, we have always run a budget in surplus, with the exception of one year, when we had a drought."
With a debt standing at less than 10 percent of gross domestic product, foreign reserves 10 times the size of its debt, and a 2001 growth rate of 9 percent, Botswana has won an A1 rating from Moody's, the highest for any African nation.
The Botswana envoy said he had no fault with Moody's rating system. "For us, a good credit rating is good advertising," he said. "It draws attention to us as a potential partner for development and investment."
Defenders of the ratings agencies say that by attacking Botswana, the Japanese government's real goal is to undermine the credibility of the agencies, which include Fitch Rating and Standard & Poor's. Japan, critics say, prefers to focus on the messenger, not the message. Frank discussion of Japan's finances might scare buyers from government bonds, no matter how bewitching Ms. Fujiwara's smile.
Indeed, using the same credit rating yardsticks, Japan fails where Botswana shines.
Japan's total debt to G.D.P. is expected to hit 157 percent at the end of this year, according to the International Monetary Fund -- almost triple the level of a decade ago, and triple the American level. That is the highest any major industrialized country has faced in about 50 years.
Japan's stock of government bonds has risen 15 to 20 percent a year lately, to the equivalent of $4,000 for each Japanese citizen last year. Although few people doubt the willingness of Japan to pay its debt, many say the burden is only worsening Japan's economic problems.
Although Japan's government plans to increase bond issuance by only 1.5 percent this year, to about $1.1 trillion, this figure may come under pressure if tax receipts continue to fall. On Thursday, the Finance Ministry reported that because of an economic contraction, Japan's tax revenues last year were 5.5 percent below projections.
Over the last decade, the economy has stagnated. After shrinking by 1.3 percent last year, Japan's economy is expected to tread water this year. At the same time, the average age has crept up to 41, the highest in the world.
Japan's foreign reserves and overseas assets look small when compared with its $5 trillion in primary government debt, $3.7 trillion of which is bonds.
The reserves "are just a drop in a bucket against its outstanding debt, equivalent to $4.6 trillion, unless the government is contemplating paying off investors with U.S. Treasury bills at 9 cents on the dollar or foresees the day when the U.S. dollar is trading at 1,463 yen," Marshall Gittler, currency strategist here for the Bank of America, wrote recently.
Even $11 trillion in private savings looks less impressive in light of Japan's mountain of debt, which stands at $9.3 trillion if government loan guarantees and unfunded pension liabilities are included, said Takashi Asia, author of a financial newsletter.
The poster campaign, to be joined by a television blitz, is a $3 million taxpayer-financed effort to persuade taxpayers to keep investing in bonds. Ms. Fujiwara, a versatile model who has won both swimsuit and kimono contests, has a successful acting career, ranging from appearing in the "Love Generation" soap opera to a new Hong Kong police action movie to advertisements promoting cellphones, airlines and World Cup soccer. 
Ultimately, Japan's best hope for easing its debt burden is through inflation. In a move that seems destined to devalue savings accounts eventually, the government is aggressively expanding the base money supply, by 36 percent in April over the levels of a year earlier.
In this environment, Mr. Asia urges clients to get out of both the yen and government bonds. Adam Posen, another bear on Japan's bonds, argues from his post as an economist at the Institute of International Economics in Washington that Japanese investors are already starting to migrate to gold and offshore currency accounts.
In this highly charged debate, Japan has received some foreign support in recent weeks.
Moody's downgrading was "based on a one-dimensional judgment," Goldman, Sachs said in one report. "Expansion of the fiscal deficit and cumulative growth in government debt do not directly signify an increase in debt default risk."
Similarly, HSBC wrote that "the government deficit is fundable, and there is no bankruptcy risk."
"As long as the current account surplus looks sustainable, there is no basis for a substantial downgrade of Japanese government debt," concluded the report, by Peter Morgan, the bank's chief Asia economist.
Lined up in the opposing camp, Fitch Ratings, in announcing it would review in September its AA rating of Japan sovereign debt, forecast last week that the country's indebtedness would hit 200 percent of its annual economic output by 2008. And Nikko Salomon Smith Barney recently issued a 10-page report titled "Fiscal Problems Begin to Worry Investors."
Japanese officials have campaigned against the rating agencies partly out of injured pride. "The current ratings on Japan's government bonds do not properly reflect our economic power," Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, said in May after Moody's upgraded long-term ratings on Italy's foreign debt and euro debt to Aa2, leaving Japan with the lowest-rated debt among major developed economies.
But Japanese promises of fiscal reform and economic revival are increasingly met with polite skepticism. In Canada last month, the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, promised at a meeting of finance ministers to revive Japan's economy. Kyodo News said the promise "fell on a silent audience," adding, "The lack of supportive remarks was equally prominent."
Also pushing government spokesmen to action is the fear that dropping ratings for government debt will also drag down ratings for debt of private companies. Haruhiko Kuroda, deputy finance minister, has warned in interviews that a low rating unfairly punishes good corporations.
In general, companies rarely receive better bond ratings than their country. Indeed, several Japanese companies have been downgraded in recent weeks, Minolta to B2 and Casio Computer to Baa3. But in a break with conventional wisdom, about 30 blue-chip Japanese companies, including Toyota and Honda, have higher ratings for their bonds than the government does for its bonds.
Further confusing foreigners, the same Finance Ministry that defends the debt level as manageable supports the Tax Commission, which uses the same statistics to argue that the out-of-control budget deficit justifies raising taxes.
Last month, at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Hiromitsu Ishi, chairman of the Tax Commission, spelled out the fiscal drama in a series of graphic slides. Japan's deficit yawned larger and larger in the 1990's, like the gaping jaws of an alligator, with 13 percent of general expenditures going to social security payments and 20 percent to debt service.
While the government officials present may have liked his conclusion -- higher taxes -- they may have grimaced at his premise.
"Many Japanese people are shocked by the downgrading of Japan's debt," Mr. Ishi, an economic professor, lectured. "But it is quite rational to have this kind of downgrading with this kind of debt."

PERSON: Evo Morales 

HEADLINE: THE SATURDAY PROFILE; 
From Llama Trails to the Corridors of Power

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: ORURO, Bolivia 

 BODY:
AFTER finishing third in the presidential election on Sunday, Evo Morales was cornered by supporters at a simple meeting hall in this gritty city perched 12,000 feet in the Andes. Miners with gnarled hands and weathered faces, tough truck drivers and poor indigenous women wearing traditional bowler hats -- they would not let him go. Instead, they hugged and kissed him, all the while beseeching him never to back down. 
 It is the kind of attention any politician would crave. But Mr. Morales is not just any politician: he is a coca-chewing Aymara Indian who would nationalize Bolivia's industries, stop payment on its foreign debt and halt American-backed efforts to end coca growing that he says have deepened the poverty of his supporters. Short of reaching those goals, he hints at the possibility of violent revolt. 
 "Now since we have won, we intend to change the laws peacefully in the Parliament," he said in an interview this week after his party's powerful showing. "But if they do not want it, then comes a people's uprising, then comes the social fight." 
Such bold words -- unnerving to American officials and enthralling to his backers -- spill easily from a man secure in his roots deep among Bolivia's Indian majority, who have catapulted him to a leading place in the politics of this country of 8.3 million and into a budding clash with the United States. 
Mr. Morales captured a startling 21 percent of the presidential vote on Sunday in a field of 11 candidates. At the same time, he won a seat in Congress, which will now choose a winner between the two presidential front-runners. There, his party, Movement Toward Socialism, is now the second largest.
Mr. Morales is poised to be Bolivia's kingmaker. It is his strongest position yet from which to disrupt Bolivia's free-market policies and years of gains Washington has made in trying to stop the coca cultivation that not long ago made Bolivia the world's second leading source of the prime ingredient for cocaine. 
It would be a remarkable rise for any politician. But for Mr. Morales, 42, of the Aymara, a deeply traditional people long excluded by this nation's European-descended elite, it is nothing short of a revolution.
"For more than 500 years, they have not been tolerant with us," he said, dismissing the notion of compromise -- "perverse" negotiations, he called it -- with other parties. "Now that we have gotten ahead, they want us to be tolerant with them." 
EVO MORALES was born to a poor farmer and shepherd and grew up in a Orinoca, a small community on a cold, windswept plain in southern Bolivia. His family lacked plumbing, or heat, and his parents, Dionisio Morales and Mari Aima Mamani, struggled to feed him and six other children. 
He stands 5 feet 10, taller than many of his supporters and has a Roman nose and a helmet of black hair, often covered with the ticker tape that his followers shower on him. But for his supporters, it is Mr. Morales's close ties to them -- the copper color of his skin, the hard life he has lived -- that so captivate them and to them make him an authentic leader. 
"He was born poor, his father was a peasant, he has walked the highlands with the llamas," said Rene Santos, 24, a youth leader for Mr. Morales's party who is also Aymara. "Evo knows our reality." 
What guides him, Mr. Morales says, is the goddess Pachamama, the mother of the earth for the Aymara, who live at once close to the earth and sky and whose culture is based on sharing. "The Aymara and Quechua culture are one of respect, humility," he explained, "and there is also equality and reciprocity." 
It is also a culture in which the use of coca -- to chew as a stimulant and to quell hunger -- has been central. Coca, he says, symbolizes Bolivian pride and history. He considers its eradication a violation of sovereignty and claims that American-financed programs to wipe out the crop are a smokescreen to take over the nation. 
Only a minority of the coca grown in the Chapare region, a main base of his support, winds up as cocaine, he says, arguing that most is used for traditional purposes. He says he is opposed to drug trafficking, but that the problem is one of demand. "The coca is not cocaine," he said. 
Mr. Morales said he would like to put into practice in Bolivia what he calls "communal socialism," which he described as a simple concept learned in his childhood. 
He recalled how his father, at the height of a drought in 1971, when Evo was 11, took 50 head of sheep to another town and traded them for corn. He then returned to Orinoca and divided the corn to help feed the other families. 
"My father told me to respect and show solidarity," Mr. Morales said. "He would say, 'If you have food, you do not eat alone.' "
Mr. Morales is unmarried -- "There are too many beautiful women out there," he said. He played trumpet professionally in local bands and never finished high school. Eventually, he entered politics through his activism as a leader of the cocaleros, Chapare farmers whose livelihood was threatened by government efforts to stop coca growing.
As their leader, Mr. Morales rose in 1997 to win a congressional seat. He also continued to lead road blockades and protests against ending coca growing, some of which turned deadly. That prompted the Congress to expel him in January, and when he emerged weeks later to campaign for the presidency, his approval rating stood at just 3 percent.
All that changed in a matter of weeks. His blistering words, filled with sometimes wild, Yankee-bashing invective -- like a recent claim that the American Embassy was trying to assassinate him -- captivated a broadening base of supporters among Bolivians frustrated by a deepening three-year recession.
Railing against "imperialists" and "Mafia parties" in Congress, Mr. Morales now promises a no-holds-barred battle to push a populist agenda. That would include nationalizing industries -- the mines, the railroads, the electrical companies -- and allow them to be run by peasant communes. 
Bolivian markets, Mr. Morales says, should be closed to outside goods, noting that the imported Dutch potatoes he has eaten "taste like nothing." He opposes foreign companies that want to extract resources, saying Bolivia's minerals should remain here.
"As indigenous people, we see ourselves as absolute owners of this noble land and the territory," he said. "And when we talk of territory, we talk about gas, petroleum, mineral resources. All those should be in Bolivian hands." 
TO achieve his goals, Mr. Morales refuses to rule out a revolution similar to the one in 1952 that shook this country, which has one of the region's most unstable histories. "There could be a use of arms, momentarily," he said. 
Those close to Mr. Morales note that he lacks specifics, either for his policies or his plans for protest, as well as the highly trained advisers that might smooth his message.
To some, the language is worrisome.
The American ambassador here, Manuel Rocha, regards Mr. Morales as a demagogue who mines anti-American sentiment for political aims.
"Evo is a cocalero leader whose cocaleros sell coca paste to narco-traffickers," Mr. Rocha said. "There's not any innocent activity going on in the Chapare." 
Indeed, five days before last Sunday's election, Mr. Rocha warned Bolivians that electing "those who want Bolivia to become a major cocaine exporter again" could jeopardize American assistance to the country. 
Analysts said the condemnation only boosted the standing of Mr. Morales, who delighted in the controversy and thanked the ambassador for being his "best campaign chief." 
"Instead of burying me," he said, "they made me much stronger."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Volume Is Light, but Gains Are Big and Broad for Once

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average posting its biggest percentage gain in more than nine months on thin volume and relief that the Fourth of July holiday brought no terror attacks.
 Investors shrugged off data showing that the unemployment rate edged higher in June amid payroll growth that was lower than forecast. Two days of solid gains in European markets also rubbed off on Wall Street, which closed early yesterday, at 1 p.m. 
 "Given the extent of the warnings out there, we came through July 4 safely, but the weekend is not over yet," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "We have some panic short-covering." 
Mr. Hyman was referring to short sellers, investors who bet that share prices will fall. They borrow shares and sell them in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. When stocks move higher instead, short sellers buy back the stock to cover those positions to book gains or prevent losses, and their buying sends stocks even higher.
The Nasdaq composite index surged 68.19 points, or 4.94 percent, to 1,448.36. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 35.04 points, or 3.67 percent, to 989.03. It was the biggest one-day gain for the Nasdaq and S.& P. since May 8, when those indexes gained 7.8 percent and 3.75 percent, respectively.
The Dow jumped 324.53 points, or 3.58 percent, to 9,379.50, ending a six-week losing streak. The Dow's surge was its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 24, when it rose 4.5 percent after a week of panic selling that followed the Sept. 11 attacks.
Few money managers referred to yesterday's rally, based on only light volume, as a turning point in the market, which has sunk to multiyear lows as investors fret over weak profits, accounting scandals and fears of terror attacks.
Leading the advance were big-name technology stocks, like Intel, up $1.79, or 10 percent, at $19.54. Applied Materials, the top maker of gear used to build semiconductors, gained $1.94, or 10.6 percent, to $19.93. Among Dow stocks, I.B.M. soared $2.99, to $73.50, or more than 4 percent.
The technology sector drew fuel from upbeat comments by Goldman, Sachs on Asian technology companies. Glimpsing a pickup in global personal computer demand, Goldman upgraded its stance on Asian technology shares to overweight from neutral and said that Asian technology shares might rise 25 percent to 50 percent over the next three to six months.
Reflecting the gains in United States semiconductor stocks, the Philadelphia semiconductor index soared 9 percent yesterday.
More than 25 issues rose for every 6 that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, and 23 stocks advanced for every 8 decliners on the Nasdaq.
Software companies like webMethods and JDA Software warned investors that their financial results would suffer as customers delayed signing deals at the end of the second quarter. JDA shares sank $12, to $15, but shares of webMethods -- which had fallen earlier in the week in expectation of the warning -- rose 22 cents, to $8.35.
The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, the grocery chain better known as A&P, rose after restating results for three years, including turning a loss into a profit for one year, after an accounting review showed that manufacturer discounts and promotions had been improperly booked. Its shares increased $1.65, or 10 percent, to $18.05.
In the bond market, the prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday as investors shunned safe-haven bonds in favor of riskier stocks after the Fourth of July holiday came and went without any feared terror attacks.
"You shouldn't read too much into price moves today," said Michael Cloherty, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
"The market's much too thin to draw any conclusions about the trend going forward," he added.
New employment data, which had scant effect on the stock market, was also largely set aside by the bond market, which tends to rise on poor economic news that portends lower interest rates.
The bond market closed at 2 p.m. while other markets also wrapped up their sessions early.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 27/32 , to 100 3/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.86 percent, from 4.75 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond dropped 1 7/32 , to 97 26/32 , yielding 5.53 percent, compared with 5.44 percent in the previous session.
The two-year note fell 8/32 , to 99 31/32 . Its yield rose to 2.89 percent from 2.76 percent.

HEADLINE: Zoning Changes Fail to Attract Businesses to Long Island City 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For years, Long Island City in Queens, just minutes from Manhattan by subway, has struck many people in real estate as a wasted asset in New York City's struggle to keep companies from moving jobs to New Jersey.
 Yet city officials were slower to see the opportunities and act on them. So the city waited until last summer, when the economic boom of the 1990's was over, to rezone the heart of Long Island City to permit office towers. 
 Now, the Bloomberg administration says it has made Long Island City one of its top five economic development priorities. The Museum of Modern Art has moved there temporarily during its three-year expansion, considerably raising the neighborhood's profile. 
But a Long Island City building boom does not seem imminent. Since Sept. 11, many large companies have moved to New Jersey, leaving Lower Manhattan with an estimated 14 million square feet of surplus office space. The glut of office space in Manhattan recently prompted one developer, the Louis Dreyfus Property Group, to withdraw from the largest development project in Long Island City, planned for two sites along opposite sides of Jackson Avenue near Queens Plaza, said a partner in the deal, Michael Bailkin, the chairman of Arete International. Mr. Bailkin said Dreyfus's move came as a result of the city's efforts to lure companies back to Lower Manhattan.
"Dreyfus thought that if the city was going to put so much of its resources into Lower Manhattan, it would attract all the tenants," Mr. Bailkin said. Dreyfus executives did not return telephone calls.
Despite these setbacks, Bloomberg administration officials say that creating a central business district remains on its list of top economic development priorities, which include Lower Manhattan, the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn and Governors Island.
"We are very focused on Long Island City," said Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development. "We have got to have competitive offerings for those companies that desire space in a different location than Midtown or downtown and at a different price point."
Served by several subway lines, Long Island City, on the edge of the East River, offers striking skyline views, plenty of sizable sites to build on, and several museums in addition to the Modern's temporary quarters. Land costs are much cheaper than Manhattan.
Citigroup's pioneering move to Long Island City -- its 48-story tower near Court Square opened in 1989 -- did not lead to a stampede. Only one other major company -- Metropolitan Life Insurance -- has moved there. In November, the company moved 900 employees to a refurbished building in Queens Plaza that once housed a Rolls-Royce factory. Last month, the building's owners, Brause Realty, broke ground for a 12-story addition with space for about 600 employees.
Last summer, in response to years of entreaties from developers, the city rezoned 37 blocks surrounding the Citigroup building, the community's lone office tower, to accommodate more high-rise development, but by that time the boom was over. Then came Sept. 11. 
Andrew M. Alper, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that Sept. 11 could actually be a boon for Long Island City because many companies now want to disperse their operations so that they will not be dependent on a single power grid or transit line. He said an increasing number were expressing interest in Long Island City.
"This is a great opportunity and a great time," Mr. Alper said. "It wasn't as obvious before Sept. 11 that the need existed."
Several other developers are poised to begin construction of office towers in the newly rezoned district as soon as they can find an anchor tenant, but so far none have materialized. Since the recession of the early 1990's, developers can no longer finance construction without a commitment from an anchor tenant.
But the developers predict that when one corporation makes the plunge, others will quickly follow. "We're absolutely convinced that the next tenant is the tipping point," said Benjamin M. McGrath, an executive vice president of Edward J. Minskoff Equities, which is looking to build 650,000 square feet of office space on Northern Boulevard.
After years of foot-dragging, real-estate executives say, the city now offers tax and other incentives that are competitive with those offered in Jersey City. Plans are afoot to sweeten the pot by extending a federal incentive program for Lower Manhattan to Long Island City and Downtown Brooklyn.
It is generally acknowledged that economic incentives alone will not be enough to attract corporate tenants. Improvements in transportation and aesthetics are also needed, developers and public officials said.
"Long Island City is the easiest place in New York City to get to, but it's not the easiest place to get around," said Gayle Baron, the executive director of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization financed by E.D.C.
Ms. Baron said a shuttle bus was needed to link the business sites to one another and to the new residential towers on the waterfront, an area known as Queens West, where another commercial development is also planned. (One transportation upgrade is imminent: New York Waterway is planning to begin ferry service from Queens West to 34th Street in Manhattan, perhaps as early as this summer.)
Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, said she would try to enlist the Modern and P.S. 1, a museum near Citigroup, in making streetscape improvements along Jackson Avenue, the heart of the area's business district. She also said the planning commission was considering rezoning the Hunters Point section of Long Island City to create more residential density. "There is a need for more residential foot traffic to bring stores and restaurants to the area, the kind of amenities the contemporary businessman is looking for," she said.
Developers say the city is wise to plan for the future of Long Island City, even in a slow economy. "Now is the critical time to do good planning," said Stuart Suna, the president of Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. "when you have time to plan and not just respond to demands in a knee-jerk reaction." Mr. Suna said he hoped to develop a three-acre site on the waterfront that includes a building that once housed a terra cotta factory. 
Although Long Island City's transformation may be years away, some of the manufacturers who make up a large part of the neighborhood's economic base say they have already experienced repercussions. Annual rents that used to be as low as $5 a square foot have risen in many cases to as much as $12. Many argued last year that the rezoning would drive them out of business. 
After being squeezed out of Lower Manhattan because of rising rents, True Type, a 70-year-old printing business, moved to Long Island City in November 2000. Lance Mandelbaum, a vice president, said he would like to buy his building but cannot afford it. Now he worries that he will be forced to move again, losing the $750,000 he spent on moving 13 presses and upgrading 33,000 square feet of space. "The thought of doing it again is mind-boggling," Mr. Mandelbaum said.
Another manufacturer, Joel Berman, the chairman of Mechoshade System, which makes shades for businesses and institutions, said he would like to consolidate his New York operations -- he has space in Brooklyn, Astoria and Long Island City -- but has not been able to find anything suitable. 
"Who can compete with MoMA?" he said. "My broker hasn't called me in six months."

HEADLINE: States Split As U.S. Offers Drug Subsidy For Elderly 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
With Congressional passage of a Medicare drug benefit still far from certain, about half the states are at least considering joining a Bush administration program that will provide federal matching money to extend drug coverage to elderly people whose incomes are modest but too high for Medicaid.
 Some states are shunning the program, however, warning of financial risks for their Medicaid budgets and the low-income people they already serve. In addition, said Ray Hanley, chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, many states simply cannot afford to spend more on health care, even with federal help, at a time of economic sluggishness and squeezed budgets. 
 Medicaid already accounts for 20 percent of most state budgets, and Joan Henneberry, a health policy expert with the National Governors' Association, said that to maintain services in the year ended June 30, states used up reserves they had amassed in previous years, and dipped into money from tobacco settlements as well. 
Despite the reluctance of some states, others are going ahead with participation in the new program. In fact, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, returned to Wisconsin this week to inaugurate the participation of his home state.
Wisconsin officials said 176,400 people with annual incomes up to $21,265 for an individual or $28,657 for a couple -- 240 percent of the official poverty level -- would be eligible when the program starts in September. In Illinois, the only other state that has so far received federal approval to join the program, 147,000 people signed up last month.
In addition to those two states, formal applications have been filed by Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey and South Carolina, all of which are awaiting approval, and 18 states, including New York, have either submitted tentative applications or expressed interest, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Pressured by advocacy groups for the elderly, at least 34 states have already adopted their own drug subsidy programs for low-income people. To this point, these programs have been financed entirely from state budgets, without federal help. "Now it's very tempting for a state to bring in some federal dollars to meet a great need and respond to the elderly, a strong political force," said Cindy Mann, a Medicaid expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
So why are some states concerned? Because under the new federal program, which will provide each participating state a waiver from Medicaid law, there will be a federal subsidy ceiling that will rise no higher, over the five-year span of the waiver, than the total federal contribution for Medicaid that a state received before the new drug program.
In other words, from Washington's perspective the new program will be "budget neutral": for each dollar that a state receives under the program, it must find a dollar of savings elsewhere in the government's contribution to Medicaid.
That means particular risk because drug benefits are the fastest-growing cost for Medicaid, and because the elderly use most of the drugs, Ms. Mann said. "The states," she said, "are being asked to gamble with the most volatile group in the program in terms of their costs."
"The waivers put all the risks onto the states and the beneficiaries," rather than having the federal government share the risk, she added. "That is a fundamental change in the way the Medicaid program is normally financed," a 50-50 federal-state split in most states. 
But officials in Wisconsin and Illinois, the two states already approved, said they expected savings from the program, which, they said, will help to buy drugs for low-income people who might otherwise end up on the regular Medicaid program after spending heavily for medicine, other health care expenses and, ultimately, nursing homes.
Under the Wisconsin program, said Pris Boroniec, deputy administrator of health care financing for the state, couples with incomes below $19,104, or 160 percent of the official poverty level, will pay, for each prescription, $15 toward the cost of brand-name drugs and $5 for generic drugs. Those with incomes from 160 percent to 240 percent of the poverty level will pay all of the first $500 of their annual drug costs before being eligible for those co-pays.
People with very heavy drug expenses can join the Wisconsin program when drug costs reduce their gross income to 240 percent of the poverty level. All participants will pay a $20 application fee.

HEADLINE: For Oklahoma's Teachers, Big D Is Dollars (and Dallas) 

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 3 

 BODY:
Donya Shaffer, fresh out of teachers college this spring, always imagined herself standing before a classroom in Chickasha, the Oklahoma town where she and her husband, both children of teachers, have roots almost as deep in the soil as in the schoolhouse.
 But a couple of weeks ago, her husband handed Ms. Shaffer an advertisement in The Oklahoman newspaper. The Dallas schools were offering a salary of $34,000 for new teachers -- about $7,000 more than Oklahoma pays -- a signing bonus of up to $4,500, a $250 stipend for classroom supplies and extensive health insurance. They even threw in a free laptop computer. 
 It was then that her husband said the words Ms. Shaffer never expected to hear: "We'll all move there. I'll sell my part in the family business, and we'll go."
Last Thursday, the Dallas school board sweetened the pot, raising the starting salary to $37,000, a sum it would take Ms. Shaffer 20 years to earn in Chickasha (pronounced CHICK-a-shay).
In town for the annual teachers union convention, Ms. Shaffer plans to leave her resume with Dallas school officials before going home this weekend. And Oklahoma will probably lose one more link in its next generation of teachers.
"We have a real support network in Chickasha, and we'll have to leave it," said Ms. Shaffer, who gave birth to her first child, a son, seven weeks ago. "But I have to think of my family."
Much to the dismay of Texas' neighbors, which offer some of the lowest salaries and barest-bones benefits for teachers in the nation, Dallas is aggressively wooing certified teachers from adjacent Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana as well as Kansas and Mississippi.
With the federal Department of Education estimating that schools will need to hire two million new teachers by 2010, the competition for certified teachers is heating up, particularly in cities like Dallas. Signing bonuses are becoming common, but some school systems have gone further, said Michael Allen, director of programs at the Education Commission of the States.
Santa Clara, Calif., an almost prohibitively expensive place to live, has built housing for public school teachers. Baltimore -- short 1,200 teachers for the coming school year -- offers beginning teachers salaries that elsewhere in the state require three years of experience, on top of statewide incentives that include low-interest mortgages and tuition tax credits. School boards are giving away laptops, Palm Pilots and other gadgets the way banks once offered toasters for new accounts.
With the heightened competition there has also been a change in the way teachers view their jobs. When Glen Walton began teaching high school in Tulsa, Okla., nine years ago, he and his wife, Sherri, a kindergarten teacher, bought a stone house that Mr. Walton fixed up and landscaped for the decades ahead. The couple expected to retire in Tulsa one day.
Now, the Waltons are going to Texas, a move that will increase their family income by $20,000. Mr. Walton will drop the after-school programs he ran to bring in extra cash, and make $43,000, more than he ever could in Tulsa.
By the end of June, the Dallas system had filled about 400 of its 456 vacancies, said Donald Claxton, a school spokesman. Linda Davis, at the school district's personnel division, said her office had not broken down precisely how many of the newly hired teachers were coming from other states, and how many were home-grown, but she believed that after Texas, the second-largest number of teachers came from the other side of the Red River, in Oklahoma.
Even without advertising, Texas hires 3,500 to 4,000 teachers a year from beyond its borders, said Edward Fuller, co-director of research at the Texas Education Agency. In 2000, the last year the agency collected such data, 580 new teachers came from Oklahoma; the next most common states were Louisiana, Arkansas and Kansas.
Dallas's campaign is hardly winning it friends in nearby states. Education officials and state legislators lament that Oklahoma trains teachers at its state colleges and universities, then loses them to states paying salaries it cannot match.
"Obviously, it's all about money," said Sandy Garrett, superintendent of Oklahoma schools. "Oklahoma doesn't have it."
"We'd like to build a fence at the Red River," she said. 
Contending with a recession, Oklahoma lawmakers cut the education budget 4 percent more last week, trimming away money that some schools had already spent. In Ardmore, a city near the Texas border, school officials are waiting to see final enrollment figures to decide whether to hire four more teachers.
"Obviously, the more qualified teachers are already snatched up," said Geneva Matlack, assistant superintendent for personnel in the Ardmore schools. "By late August, we're stuck with the leftovers."
Ardmore lost 25 of its 263 teachers to Texas in the last three years, Ms. Matlack said. In an interview at her office, she recited the job titles of teachers who left. Many were in special education, math, science or other hard-to-fill areas.
In Oklahoma, the sweet talk from Texas is a balm to teachers who say they feel demeaned by legislative battles over salary and benefits. Gov. Frank Keating talks of teachers in terms that could easily apply to convicts, at one particularly low point describing some educators as "slugs," at another suggesting "homicide" as a way to deal with the state teachers union. He later apologized.
Most Oklahoma teachers "wouldn't spit on the governor if he were on fire," said Nela Foster of Oklahoma City, who plans to look for a job in Dallas when she finishes her teacher training at the University of Central Oklahoma next year.
Ms. Foster, 39, said that with her husband retiring from the Air Force next year, the plan was a simple matter of economics. With six children, the couple needs the extra income, she said.
"Money really is talking to us," said Ms. Foster, the incoming president of the Oklahoma student chapter of the National Education Association, the teachers union.
Ms. Shaffer, the departing president, is picking up that same message. She loves Chickasha, but said that providing for her family has become a priority with her son's birth. Ms. Shaffer's parents were teachers, but salaries were so meager that their five children qualified for reduced price lunches, she said.
Ms. Shaffer went down a list she had written out, with columns comparing Texas and Oklahoma: a $37,000 starting salary in Texas versus a $27,000 starting salary at home. Complete versus partial health coverage. Laptop or no laptop. She shook her head, remembering those cheap lunches.
"If there's any way teachers in Oklahoma can get to Texas," she said, "they're going."

 BODY:
June Employment Report Reflects a Jobless Recovery
As the government reported a rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent last month, it seems increasingly clear that the economy is stuck in a jobless recovery resembling the sluggish growth of the early 1990's.
 "In a sense, the recession is over, but the recovery has not begun," said Mark Vitner, the senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. Nonfarm payroll jobs rose by only 36,000 last month. Page A1. 

Stocks Surge in Light Trading
Ignoring a plethora of warnings of possible terrorist attacks, the main stock indexes rallied, though the strong move higher was not underpinned by heavy trading volume. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 324.53 points, or 3.6 percent, to 9,379.50. The Nasdaq jumped nearly 5 percent, or 68.19 points, to 1,448.36. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 35.04 points, or 3.7 percent, to 989.03. C4.

Prozac by Surprise Mail Spurs Suit
Experts in medical privacy have long been critical of mailings to patients who have been singled out based on information in their medical records. Now, some people who have been mailed actual samples of Prozac, and who believe the privacy of their medical records has been violated, are taking legal action. A1.

WorldCom Continues Its Review
An internal investigation at WorldCom into accounting irregularities is continuing despite a report that indicated the Justice Department was seeking to curtail those activities as the agency conducts its own investigation, according to the head of the internal inquiry. C2.

Qwest Denies Criminal Investigation
Qwest Communications denied that it was the subject of a criminal investigation. Qwest is under examination by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting. C4.

Long Island City Becomes a Priority
For years, Long Island City in Queens has struck many people in real estate as a wasted asset in New York City's struggle to keep companies from moving jobs to New Jersey. Now, the Bloomberg administration says it has made Long Island City one of its top five economic development priorities. B1.

Conditional Approval of Energy Deal
The German government granted conditional approval to a 10.3 billion euro ($10.09 billion) takeover bid by the energy giant E.ON for Ruhrgas, Germany's largest natural gas distributor, a decision that could result in a powerful new player in the global energy market. Ulrich Hartmann, E.ON's chief executive, above, said, "Together with Ruhrgas, we can now build up a leading international position in the gas business." C3.

U.S. Banks Seek to Aid Mexicans
Illegal Mexican immigrants typically do not have bank accounts in the United States, but American banks want to get in on the billions of dollars these immigrants earn, spend and send home. So they have become allies of the immigrants and the Mexican government in pushing for recognition of Mexican-issued consular cards as valid identification. C3.

Trading Bloc Backs Argentina
Heaping blame for their countries' woes on the global economy and a rise in protectionism in industrialized nations, leaders of South America's main trading bloc, Mercosur, closed ranks behind Argentina, urging international aid for the country, whose economic collapse has sent neighboring markets into a tailspin. C3.

PlayStation 2 Outpaces Rivals
Sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 in North America more than doubled in May, outpacing sales by its rivals, Microsoft and Nintendo, an industry report said. C2.

HEADLINE: U.S. JOBLESS RATE AT 5.9% IN JUNE; A SLIGHT INCREASE 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate rose slightly, to 5.9 percent, last month, the government reported yesterday. The economy appears to have fallen into a so-called jobless recovery that resembles the slow growth of the early 1990's, economists said.
 "In a sense, the recession is over, but the recovery has not begun," said Mark Vitner, the senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "Companies are still focusing on cutting costs and are still reluctant to hire additional workers." 
 A rise in consumer and government spending apparently brought the recession that began in early 2001 to an end several months ago. But many companies have decided that economic growth is likely to be too mild to justify new hiring; instead, they are trying to meet new demand by becoming more efficient. 
Since the start of the year, about 150,000 jobs have been lost over all among the more than 130 million Americans on nonfarm payrolls. Most economists expect the jobless rate, which is adjusted to account for normal seasonal variations, to inch up further this year and surpass the recent high of 6 percent it reached in April.
The increase in unemployment, up from 5.8 percent in May and a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in late 2000, suggests that the Federal Reserve will not raise its benchmark interest rate until at least the end of the year, analysts said. 
On Wall Street, the stock market continued its rebound from the post-Sept. 11 lows that a few major indexes had hit early this week, although trading was light yesterday and the stock market closed early for the holiday weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 325 points, or 3.6 percent, to 9,380, it biggest one-day gain since Sept. 24.
Some investors said they were cheered by the absence of a major terrorist attack on July 4, and thought they had overreacted to recent accounting scandals. Yesterday's jobs report also played a role in the stock gains, making an interest rate increase less likely in the coming months and offering evidence that companies are trying to lift sagging profits by keeping payrolls lean, analysts said.
Other recent signs of economic strength make a serious deterioration in the job market unlikely this year, economists said. Factory orders are continuing to rise in a sign that the manufacturing sector, battered worse than any other since 2000, is slowly recovering. The housing market remains buoyant. In addition, new requests for unemployment benefits dropped last week to their lowest level in 15 months.
"The labor market is not strong," Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, said in an interview, "but it has stabilized."
The economy now seems to have entered a transition period, growing much less quickly than it did in the late 1990's and slowing from the spike that produced growth at about a 6 percent annual rate during this year's first quarter, when business executives and consumers realized that the economic effect of Sept. 11 would be fairly limited.
In June, companies and government agencies added 36,000 workers to their payrolls, not enough to make up for the usual increase in the labor force caused by population growth. The Labor Department also announced that its earlier estimates of hiring in April and May had been too optimistic, with the economy adding only 3,000 jobs in those two months, not 47,000. 
The lack of widespread hiring, on the heels of substantial layoffs late last year, has caused an increase in the number of people who have been out of work for months at a time. More than 3.1 million people have been unemployed for at least 15 weeks, twice the number who were in that category a year ago and the most since 1993.
To be considered unemployed by the Labor Department, a person must be actively looking for work.
The recession of the early 1990's ended in March 1991, when the unemployment rate was 6.8 percent. But joblessness continued to rise through the summer of 1992 and did not fall below 6.8 percent until late 1993.
In earlier decades, hiring often boomed immediately after a recession's end as factories rushed to meet the demand that had built up like water behind a dam during the downturn. In recent years, however, service companies, whose business is less volatile than that of manufacturers, have become a larger part of the economy. The Fed also appears to have become more successful at moderating the business cycle's swings, making recessions less frequent but rebounds slower to take off.
"The question on many of our minds is when should we think of a this recovery as a 'jobless recovery,' too," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. "My answer is now."
Beyond the broad numbers, the jobs report for June offered little evidence that hiring is on the verge of accelerating, although such turning points can happen with little if any real warning.
As has been the case for much of this year, the public sector did more hiring in June than private businesses, accounting for almost two-thirds of total job growth. While government agencies, including schools and the military, have added about 100,000 new workers this year, companies have cut their payrolls by 250,000 people.
The contrast offers some reason for concern, economists said, because budget deficits in many states are likely to prevent them from remaining a source of new jobs. 
Within the private sector, employment in almost every sector was flat, noted Thomas J. Nardone, the Labor Department economist who oversees the survey. That left little reason to believe that any industry would soon emerge to play the central role that information technology and telecommunications did in the 1990's.
The one exception was health care, which added 34,000 jobs in June and employed 295,000 more people last month than it had a year earlier. New treatments and the aging of the population have increased demand for medical care.
Elsewhere, most companies have done little permanent hiring in recent months, relying instead on temporary-help agencies. Temporary jobs typically do not pay as well, in salary or benefits, as permanent jobs do, but they frequently offer a hint of the labor market's future direction. 
In June, the agencies added 9,000 jobs, down from an average of 44,000 during the previous three months. Economists cautioned that one-month changes often prove to be fleeting and that temporary employment could rise solidly again in July. 
The brightest signs in the report were the small increase in the workweek for people in production and nonsupervisory jobs -- to 34.3 hours, the most since January 2001 -- and the $9.49 weekly raise those workers received. 
A rise in the workweek often foreshadows an increase in hiring. Meanwhile, the continued growth of wages, while below its pace of the late 1990's, offers a reminder that unemployment remains lower than it has been at the end of every other recession since 1970.

HEADLINE: Treasuring Blacks' Long Memories 

BYLINE:  By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Eight years ago, Camille Cosby used the Broadway stage to give two African-American centenarian sisters a chance to share their stories. The play, "Having Our Say," based on the best-selling 1991 book about Sadie and Bessie Delaney, was a virtual oral history.
 Now, Mrs. Cosby, a co-producer of the play and the wife of Bill Cosby, has established a videotaped oral history archive that is gathering the reminiscences of other older, distinguished African-Americans. 
 The National Visionary Leadership Project, a nonprofit organization, was established last spring by Mrs. Cosby and Renee Poussaint, a former correspondent for ABC News, to record and videotape the experiences of blacks in their 70's and 80's. The interviews will be made available through a digital database accessible through the project's WWeb site, www .visionaryproject.com, with the hope that it will ultimately reach a broader audience through television and CD-ROM.
Mrs. Cosby provided all of the funds for the project and hopes to raise additional money through corporate, foundation and individual contributions. The project has an annual budget of $1.5 million. 
Mrs. Cosby, who has a doctorate in education, said her organization aspires to do for black Americans what Mr. Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation has done in recording the memories of aging Holocaust survivors, although it will be far more modest in size. Since its establishment in 1994, Mr. Spielberg's organization has collected and preserved videotaped testimony of more than 50,000 people. Mrs. Cosby's project plans to begin by completing 60 interviews a year for five years. 
While the Holocaust is the common thread for Mr. Spielberg's subjects, racism runs through the lives in Mrs. Cosby's project, she said. In the interviews, Mrs. Cosby and Ms. Poussaint asked the subjects to talk about race and racism in America. Each said in the interviews that racism had been a fact of life, but none said it had been an insurmountable obstacle.
"We have decided to record oral histories and present them just the way the elders have said it," said Mrs. Cosby, who holds the title of president and co-founder. "It is the only way to protect these histories, for people all over the world to use these oral histories as resources to know the truth. And our young people can use these histories as resources to learn leadership skills."
Most oral history projects are at the state or local level or are collected as parts of larger historical archives, like those for labor or politics. Mrs. Cosby's project is the first that is solely devoted to the history of black Americans and that is aimed at a national audience.
Among the 30 subjects who have already been interviewed are the former mayor of New York City, David N. Dinkins; the poet Maya Angelou; former Representative Shirley Chisholm; Gordon Parks, the noted photographer and filmmaker; and Dr. Dorothy I. Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women.
Their lives may seem well documented, but Mrs. Cosby and Ms. Poussaint have managed to coax their subjects to speak their minds in ways seldom heard before.
When asked to describe the biggest obstacle that she faced during her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972, Mrs. Chisholm smiles at the camera and says without missing a beat: "Men."
"All kinds of men," said Mrs. Chisholm, the first black woman to run for the presidency. "Black men, Latino men. Men."
Ms. Angelou, looking regal in an Afrocentric head wrap, says she has married and left many men in her life, but at 73, she is "still looking."
"Oh, the 70's are delicious," she said of aging. "I'm having a wonderful time."
The visionaries, as the project calls them, also share poignant anecdotes about personal triumphs and struggles, regrets and hopes, and other dramatic events of private and public life.
Mr. Dinkins said, half-jokingly, that his newspaper obituary will probably lead with the racial riots that took place in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn in 1991 during his tenure in office. He said that one of his "strongest regrets" was not telling his police commissioner sooner to change the department's tactics in handling the riots. 
Andrew Young, formerly the mayor of Atlanta and the United States ambassador to the United Nations, talks about the difficulty that his son, Bo, has faced growing up as the son of a national black leader.
"His teachers would say to him: 'Why aren't you like your dad? When he was your age, your dad did this or did that,' " Mr. Young said. "The problem is, when I was Bo's age, I was exactly the same as Bo. A total screw-up." 
The project's headquarters is in an attractive, historic brownstone in downtown Washington. The building houses the archives, a resource library, a reading room, the latest in production facilities, a "hall of fame" featuring the oral history subjects and an art gallery
Ms. Poussaint, the project's executive director and co-founder, said the interviews had opened her eyes in unexpected ways.
"I'm having a wonderful time discovering the total humanity of these wonderful people," Ms. Poussaint said. "The elders are sharing things that they couldn't share before, particularly about their own vulnerabilities, because many of them were involved in the civil rights movement and grew up under segregation. So to show vulnerability, to acknowledge mistakes and have that kind of freedom to be open about such things could be costly."
Mrs. Cosby said she hoped that the interviews would also serve as a teaching tool. The project has established 30 student fellowships at institutions including Howard, Georgetown, Fisk, Oberlin, Spelman and Berkeley, for independent course study on researching and collecting oral histories of older people who have been community leaders.
"We not only want the young people to learn from the elders, but have the elders learn from the young," Mrs. Cosby said. 
At a gala at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington last spring, Mrs. Cosby and Ms. Poussaint gathered student fellows and potential oral history subjects to watch the videotaped interview of Dr. Height.
Among those in the audience from Washington were Doris Thomas, 77, a poet and founder of a theater company; William E. Bolden, 76, a World War II veteran, bricklayer and cabdriver; and Pauline Johnson Jones, 93, who has worked actively to promote and preserve the history of her church, St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church in Washington.
"Renee and I are in our 50's, the middle group, and we're bringing these two generations together," said Mrs. Cosby, who is 58. "We want young people to look beyond the stereotypes about African-American elders, that they're disempowered people.
Speaking of the prevailing societal images, Mrs. Cosby said: "The only elders that are shown as powerful people are white male elders. They're on our dollar bills, and we see them in positions of economic and decision-making power. Oral histories are a way to get to the truth. And the truth is, the Constitution wouldn't be what it is, were it not for the contributions of these elders."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 9, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Saturday about the National Visionary Leadership Project, an oral history archive for distinguished African-Americans, misspelled the surname of the centenarian sisters depicted in the 1995 Broadway play "Having Our Say," which was presented in the style of oral history. They were Sadie and Bessie Delany, not Delaney. The article also referred erroneously to precedents for the archive. A similar project indeed exists -- the National Video Oral History Archives, established in Chicago in 1999.

HEADLINE: All the President's Enrons 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
George W. Bush is so peeved about corporate America's "wrongdoers" -- not to be confused with "evildoers" -- that last week he spoke out about them four times in four days. By the time he took a breather, the markets had hit their worst half-year finish since 1970, the Nasdaq was at a five-year low, the dollar was on the skids and, despite much evidence to the contrary, a majority of Americans had told CNN/USA Today pollsters that the country was in a recession.
 On Tuesday the president returns to the subject in a full-dress speech on Wall Street. Maybe it's time to try pinning the whole mess on Ann Richards again. 
 Mr. Bush keeps saying all the right things. He is "deeply concerned." He will "hold people accountable." But words, like stocks, lose value when nothing backs them up. It is now more than six months since the president promised "a lot of government inquiry into Enron." Since then, Playboy has done a better job of exposing the women of Enron than the Bush administration has done at exposing its men. Just as the Justice Department rounded up some 1,000 alleged Sept. 11 suspects and failed to indict a single one of them for terrorist activity, so it has made a big show of its shaky Andersen conviction while failing to indict a single Enron executive or individual Andersen accountant. (Not that all the law-enforcement news is downbeat: last month John Ashcroft's minions held a press conference to boast that a 13-month investigation had led to the arrest of 12 prostitutes in New Orleans.)
The sight of a corporate crook being led away in handcuffs, Giuliani-style, would do far more to restore confidence in Wall Street than any more presidential blather. Mr. Bush says that only "a few bad actors" are at fault. Why is the administration so lax about bringing them to justice? 
That may have something to do with who those "few bad actors" are. Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Richard Grasso, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, tossed out a range of 1 to 15 as the rough count of corporate culprits, "in comparison to more than 10,000 publicly traded corporations." The fact remains that so far at least five members of that theoretically tiny club have direct ties to the Bush administration: Enron, Halliburton, Andersen, KMPG and Merrill Lynch -- the last three all former clients of the president's choice as Wall Street's top cop, the S.E.C. chairman Harvey Pitt. Five for 15: Mr. Bush could have used a batting average that high when he ran the Texas Rangers. 
Despite this record, there has been only balking, not housecleaning, at the White House. Thomas White, who was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services when it allegedly hid $500 million in losses and manipulated the California energy crisis, is still secretary of the Army, despite having been cited by the Senate Armed Services Committee for violating his signed ethics agreement. (Even worse, Mr. White has threatened to bring to the Army his "understanding of best business practices.") The record of Enron contacts by him and countless other administration officials remains incomplete and in constant revision. What information does dribble out often emanates from the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, who himself had an attorney-client relationship with Enron while a partner at Vinson & Elkins in Houston. 
Perhaps it's Mr. Gonzales who, as the administration's chief ethics maven, advised the White House this week on how to handle the 1991 S.E.C. report showing that Mr. Bush had filed disclosures of his stock trades in Harken Energy, where he was a director, as much as eight months late. The ethical call? Blame Harken's lawyers. A presidential spokesman assured us as well that this infraction amounted to nothing more than driving 60 in a 55-mile-per-hour zone. That will surely bring good cheer to those Harken shareholders who were left holding the stock that Mr. Bush sold, with no insider's knowledge, of course, just before it tanked. 
WorldCom is a political boon to the president because it allows him to moralize about epic-scale crime without mentioning Enron, Halliburton or Harken. But the Enron bomb hasn't been defused. Its next detonation may come the day someone outside the administration unearths the as-yet mostly secret names of those buddies of Enron executives who were let into the hundreds of side partnerships that overnight yielded multimillion-dollar plunder on nominal stakes (with ordinary stockholders left paying the bill). "Not in memory has a single major company grown so big in tandem with a presidential dynasty and a corrupted political system," wrote the Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips in The Los Angeles Times five months ago, tracing Bush family favor-swapping with Enron back to 1988 and likening Enron's potential damage to that of the Harding administration's Teapot Dome scandals. "The question now is whether what went up together will come down together." 
It's a question only Mr. Bush can answer. He can give the oil cronies within his administration an ethical pass, much as Harding did. He can keep trying to finesse the Wall Street crisis with rhetorical panaceas as empty as his father's "Message: I care" response to his own economic storm. Or he can fulfill a campaign promise and become a reformer with results, a Teddy Roosevelt who cleans up capitalism to make it stronger. 
No flowery speeches are required to describe the reforms needed now, from fully independent policing of accounting firms to the complete prohibition of conflicts of interest that encourage both accountants and stockbrokers to cut corners. "No off-balance-sheet or offshore entities, no shell corporations, no sham transactions," adds Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who is pursuing Enron more aggressively than the administration is. Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman, urges legislation that increases the legal liability for investment bankers, lawyers and accountants who aid, abet and also profit from corporate Ponzi schemes. 
The president could get real reform "in a heartbeat," says Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, who went after Merrill Lynch while the Pitt S.E.C. slept. "All he has to do is call Oxley" -- Michael Oxley, who is steering a weak Republican "reform" bill through the House -- "and say this is the bill we're passing instead." But that's about as likely as Martha Stewart discovering a cure for cancer instead of trying to cash in on one. Mr. Bush has already opposed the notion of requiring corporations to count executive stock options as expenses -- a simple fix endorsed by Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett as an antidote to fictional profits. The Treasury Department, Newsweek reports, is hard at work stifling a bill that would end the offshore shenanigans that allowed Enron (with 800-plus such entities) to evade taxes in four out of five years. 
Even within existing law, the Bush administration's notion of enforcement is the antithesis of T.R.'s: it speaks loudly and carries a small stick. On Wednesday a judge threw out an S.E.C. action against the accounting firm Ernst & Young because the S.E.C. could not muster the quorum of conflict-free commissioners required by law to bring its case; both Mr. Pitt and another Bush S.E.C. appointee had previously worked for Ernst & Young. Mr. Pitt's conflicts also include meeting privately with Xerox and KPMG executives while their companies are under investigation by his agency. "It's like the mob's consigliere running the F.B.I," in the words of Marshall Wittmann, a T.R.-minded conservative Republican at the Hudson Institute. 
As Mr. Bush blames others for his Harken mishaps, so Mr. Pitt's new shtick is to hide behind Bill Clinton, telling Matt Lauer, "this is, unfortunately, a mess that I inherited from the prior administration." But it was Mr. Pitt who invited the likes of WorldCom to play fast and loose by implying last fall that no one need fear the "kinder and gentler" S.E.C. he would install in place of Mr. Levitt's, which initiated the Xerox and Rite Aid cases that Mr. Pitt would now like to take credit for. 
It's not that Democrats are clean. When Al Gore blasted Mr. Pitt last weekend for having led the accounting industry's drive "to open up loopholes" in the 1990's, he could have been describing his own ticket mate, Joe Lieberman, who was second to none in doing the accounting industry's bidding. But the Democrats don't have the power to undo the damage anyway. It is Mr. Bush who is C.E.O. If he doesn't bring zero tolerance of corporate cheating to his own White House, it's hard to imagine Americans rushing back into the market trusting that his administration will enforce it anywhere else.

Bush Expresses Sympathy Over Afghan Deaths
President Bush called President Hamid Karzai to express his sympathies over the American bombing raid on a string of southern Afghan villages that residents said killed 40 civilians and injured 100. The attack has enraged Afghan officials, who until now were willing to accept some civilian casualties as the price of ridding their country of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Mr. Karzai is concerned that such attacks could turn the population against him. A1

Israeli Presses Arafat
Israel's military chief of staff said that only the expulsion of Yasir Arafat or his replacement as Palestinian leader might prompt an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in the coming months. In Gaza City, thousands of Palestinians marched in a funeral procession for two men, one a leader of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades. The Palestinians have called the car explosion that killed the men an Israeli assassination. A1

The Israeli government has begun operating its own Arabic-language satellite television station. The aim is to counter the scores of Arabic stations that have altered the broadcast landscape in the Middle East and across the Arab world. Critics say the new station's coverage of the Mideast conflict is sanitized. A4

Iraq Rejects Arms Inspectors
The United Nations failed in two days of talks to persuade Iraqi officials to allow the return weapons inspectors. Diplomats agreed to resume the negotiations in Europe sometime in the coming months. A5

Nazi War Criminal Sentenced
A Hamburg court sentenced a former SS officer, Friedrich Engel, 93, to seven years in prison for ordering the killing of 59 Italian prisoners in 1944. He remains free pending a determination of his fitness for prison. A5

Outcry in Pakistan Over Rape
A Pakistani woman who was gang-raped on the orders of a village tribal jury said she had begged for mercy, but no bystander would help. Reports of the rape have set off a public outcry, and the government has vowed to pursue the case. So far, one of the four suspects has been arrested. A6

A Deficit for the Vatican
The Vatican reported its first deficit in nine years, more than $3 million, despite a rise in contributions from dioceses last year. Officials cited the worldwide financial slump, which was aggravated by the Sept. 11 attacks. A3

A Departure From Madagascar
The longtime leader of Madagascar, Didier Ratsiraka, has left the country, although it is unclear whether he was conceding defeat in doing so. Dozens of people have been killed by competing armies since a contested election in December left Mr. Ratsiraka and Marc Ravalomanana both proclaiming themselves president. A6

Airport Gunman's Motive Is Unknown, Officials Say
Investigators said Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, who was killed after he shot two people to death at an El Al airlines ticket counter in Los Angeles on Thursday, his 41st birthday, was the Egyptian-born owner of a limousine service who apparently went to the airport heavily armed and determined to kill. But F.B.I. officials were unable to say what had motivated the attack -- hatred of Israel, terrorism or despondence over a personal or financial problem. A1

Relatives in Egypt, where his wife and two sons had gone for an extended summer vacation, said Mr. Hadayet had no known political leanings nor shown overt sympathy for any militant Islamic causes. A8

Scrutinizing passengers and bags more carefully before they are allowed near an airplane has resulted in a new security problem, experts said, the creation of vulnerable crowds outside the secure area. A8

Weighing Prescription Plans
About half the states, uncertain about prospects that Congress will approve a Medicare prescription benefit, are at least considering joining a Bush administration program that will provide federal matching money to extend drug coverage to old people whose incomes are modest but too high to qualify for Medicaid. A7

Criticism Over Shift in Funds
Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, a Democrat, was on the defensive after moving $300,000 out of a fund for emotionally disturbed children and into his office's account, and then running a commercial accusing his Republican opponent of not supporting programs for disabled children. A9

Rain Adds to Texas Flooding
Heavy rain fell again and surging floodwaters ripped houses off their foundations and pushed up against dams already straining to hold back swollen rivers across Central and South Texas. A9

Western Power Prices Surge
Electricity prices in the western United States more than doubled as new forecasts called for hotter weather, which will increase demand for power to run air-conditioners. A9

Low-Flying Pilots Charged
The pilots of two planes that officials said flew too close to a beach, a bridge, a ship and a police helicopter on Thursday were charged with felony reckless endangerment. B3

Fire Knocks Out Power Line
A fire at a Con Edison substation in Yonkers disrupted the downstate power network, knocking out a transmission line that provides about one-tenth of Long Island's electricity. B3

A Jobless Recovery
The unemployment rate rose slightly last month, to 5.9 percent. Consumer and government spending apparently brought the recession that began in 2001 to an end months ago. But many companies have decided that economic growth is likely to be too mild to justify new hiring. A1

Investors shrugged off the jobless data. The Nasdaq surged 68.19 points, or 4.9 percent, to 1,448.36; the S.& P. 500 rose 35.04 points, or 3.7 percent, to 989.03; and the Dow jumped 324.53 points, or 3.6 percent, to 9,379.50. C4

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 A COLD CASE, by Philip Gourevitch. (Picador USA, $11.) Nearly three decades after an unsolved double murder stemming from an argument in midtown Manhattan, an appealingly straight-arrow investigator tracks down the culprit, a hot-tempered veteran of the mean streets of Hell's Kitchen. Gourevitch's nonfiction account is "a sort of moral fable, in which the avenger nabs the killer," Luc Sante said in the Book Review last year.

SKIRTS AND SLACKS: Poems, by W. S. Di Piero. (Knopf, $15.) The author mines ordinary life in these poems, many of which explore feelings of loss and the ways the past consumes the present, whether in Di Piero's personal relationships or in his memories of the gritty South Philadelphia neighborhood of his youth. "With language that's as simple as it is musical, Di Piero sets dazzling moments amid plainsong," Albert Mobilio wrote here in 2001.

INDIA UNBOUND, by Gurcharan Das. (Anchor, $15.) Part memoir, part history and part management bible, this account by a former chief executive of Procter & Gamble focuses on the nation's economic development since independence, in particular how "a rich country became poor and will be rich again." "Something tremendous is happening in India, and Das, with his keen eye and often elegant prose, has his finger firmly on the pulse of the transformation," Akash Kapur wrote here last year.

THE ABOMINATION, by Paul Golding. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) Set in contemporary gay London, this angrily intelligent first novel about a handsome narcissist peels away the protective surface of its bitter yet sympathetic antihero, exposing the ways in which a child's innocence can be corrupted by the predations of adults. Last year our reviewer, Louis Bayard, praised the writing as "at once highly wrought and exquisitely violent -- an entire garden, grown from scar tissue and still-twitching nerves."

SELECTED LETTERS OF DASHIELL HAMMETT: 1921-1960. Edited by Richard Layman with Julie M. Rivett. (Counterpoint, $25.) This collection, edited by Hammett's biographer and his granddaughter, isn't likely to solve many puzzles about the great noir writer, McCarthy opponent and paramour of Lillian Hellman. The mystery of the Thin Man "keeps growing," David Thomson wrote here in 2001, "but the emerging portrait is more than ever a hero for sour times: a laconic gentleman, brave and tough and honest."

THE CHRONOLITHS, by Robert Charles Wilson. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $6.99.) In the latest novel by an acclaimed science-fiction writer, an American journalist in Thailand witnesses the mysterious arrival of a series of colossal monuments from the future. "Wilson deftly interweaves a plausible time-travel thriller with the tender tale of a likable but immature loser who responds to adversity by growing up," Gerald Jonas said here last year.

ZIGZAGGING DOWN A WILD TRAIL: Stories, by Bobbie Ann Mason. (Modern Library, $11.95.) The author's new collection of miniature reports from the sprawling mid-South feature characters who feel stung by their limitations. Even as they watch too much TV, drink too much beer and make bad choices in love, they sense both the opportunities and dangers of the wider world. "Mason works with a fixed set of materials and pours her ambition into feats of craftsmanship," Walter Kirn wrote in these pages in 2001.

DEVICES AND DESIRES: A History of Contraceptives in America, by Andrea Tone. (Hill & Wang, $15.) A history professor recounts the development of the American contraceptive industry, which dates to the 1800's, and the persistent attempts to suppress it through moral condemnation and intimidation of manufacturers. Last year our reviewer, Daniel J. Kevles, called this a "marvelously eye-opening book" with "fascinating vignettes of small-time birth control entrepreneurs."

THE LOVE-ARTIST, by Jane Alison. (Picador USA, $13.) Why was the Roman poet Ovid exiled at the height of his glory? The answer, according to this novel, has to do with a destructive entanglement among the poet, an exotic, nymphlike alchemist (and eventual inspiration for "Medea") and the emperor's vengeful granddaughter. The result is "a swirling parable that touches on the opposed sorceries of art and magic, on tyranny and rebellion, and on the struggle of male and female," Richard Eder wrote here last year.

HEADLINE: What if It's All Been a Big Fat Lie? 

BYLINE:  By Gary Taubes; Gary Taubes is a correspondent for the journal Science and author of "Bad Science: The Short Life and Weird Times of Cold Fusion."

 BODY:
If the members of the American medical establishment were to have a collective find-yourself-standing-naked-in-Times-Square-type nightmare, this might be it. They spend 30 years ridiculing Robert Atkins, author of the phenomenally-best-selling "Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution" and "Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution," accusing the Manhattan doctor of quackery and fraud, only to discover that the unrepentant Atkins was right all along. Or maybe it's this: they find that their very own dietary recommendations -- eat less fat and more carbohydrates -- are the cause of the rampaging epidemic of obesity in America. Or, just possibly this: they find out both of the above are true.
 When Atkins first published his "Diet Revolution" in 1972, Americans were just coming to terms with the proposition that fat -- particularly the saturated fat of meat and dairy products -- was the primary nutritional evil in the American diet. Atkins managed to sell millions of copies of a book promising that we would lose weight eating steak, eggs and butter to our heart's desire, because it was the carbohydrates, the pasta, rice, bagels and sugar, that caused obesity and even heart disease. Fat, he said, was harmless. 
 Atkins allowed his readers to eat "truly luxurious foods without limit," as he put it, "lobster with butter sauce, steak with bearnaise sauce . . . bacon cheeseburgers," but allowed no starches or refined carbohydrates, which means no sugars or anything made from flour. Atkins banned even fruit juices, and permitted only a modicum of vegetables, although the latter were negotiable as the diet progressed.
Atkins was by no means the first to get rich pushing a high-fat diet that restricted carbohydrates, but he popularized it to an extent that the American Medical Association considered it a potential threat to our health. The A.M.A. attacked Atkins's diet as a "bizarre regimen" that advocated "an unlimited intake of saturated fats and cholesterol-rich foods," and Atkins even had to defend his diet in Congressional hearings. 
Thirty years later, America has become weirdly polarized on the subject of weight. On the one hand, we've been told with almost religious certainty by everyone from the surgeon general on down, and we have come to believe with almost religious certainty, that obesity is caused by the excessive consumption of fat, and that if we eat less fat we will lose weight and live longer. On the other, we have the ever-resilient message of Atkins and decades' worth of best-selling diet books, including "The Zone," "Sugar Busters" and "Protein Power" to name a few. All push some variation of what scientists would call the alternative hypothesis: it's not the fat that makes us fat, but the carbohydrates, and if we eat less carbohydrates we will lose weight and live longer. 
The perversity of this alternative hypothesis is that it identifies the cause of obesity as precisely those refined carbohydrates at the base of the famous Food Guide Pyramid -- the pasta, rice and bread -- that we are told should be the staple of our healthy low-fat diet, and then on the sugar or corn syrup in the soft drinks, fruit juices and sports drinks that we have taken to consuming in quantity if for no other reason than that they are fat free and so appear intrinsically healthy. While the low-fat-is-good-health dogma represents reality as we have come to know it, and the government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in research trying to prove its worth, the low-carbohydrate message has been relegated to the realm of unscientific fantasy.
Over the past five years, however, there has been a subtle shift in the scientific consensus. It used to be that even considering the possibility of the alternative hypothesis, let alone researching it, was tantamount to quackery by association. Now a small but growing minority of establishment researchers have come to take seriously what the low-carb-diet doctors have been saying all along. Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, may be the most visible proponent of testing this heretic hypothesis. Willett is the de facto spokesman of the longest-running, most comprehensive diet and health studies ever performed, which have already cost upward of $100 million and include data on nearly 300,000 individuals. Those data, says Willett, clearly contradict the low-fat-is-good-health message "and the idea that all fat is bad for you; the exclusive focus on adverse effects of fat may have contributed to the obesity epidemic." 
These researchers point out that there are plenty of reasons to suggest that the low-fat-is-good-health hypothesis has now effectively failed the test of time. In particular, that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic that started around the early 1980's, and that this was coincident with the rise of the low-fat dogma. (Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, also rose significantly through this period.) They say that low-fat weight-loss diets have proved in clinical trials and real life to be dismal failures, and that on top of it all, the percentage of fat in the American diet has been decreasing for two decades. Our cholesterol levels have been declining, and we have been smoking less, and yet the incidence of heart disease has not declined as would be expected. "That is very disconcerting," Willett says. "It suggests that something else bad is happening." 
The science behind the alternative hypothesis can be called Endocrinology 101, which is how it's referred to by David Ludwig, a researcher at Harvard Medical School who runs the pediatric obesity clinic at Children's Hospital Boston, and who prescribes his own version of a carbohydrate-restricted diet to his patients. Endocrinology 101 requires an understanding of how carbohydrates affect insulin and blood sugar and in turn fat metabolism and appetite. This is basic endocrinology, Ludwig says, which is the study of hormones, and it is still considered radical because the low-fat dietary wisdom emerged in the 1960's from researchers almost exclusively concerned with the effect of fat on cholesterol and heart disease. At the time, Endocrinology 101 was still underdeveloped, and so it was ignored. Now that this science is becoming clear, it has to fight a quarter century of anti-fat prejudice. 
The alternative hypothesis also comes with an implication that is worth considering for a moment, because it's a whopper, and it may indeed be an obstacle to its acceptance. If the alternative hypothesis is right -- still a big "if" -- then it strongly suggests that the ongoing epidemic of obesity in America and elsewhere is not, as we are constantly told, due simply to a collective lack of will power and a failure to exercise. Rather it occurred, as Atkins has been saying (along with Barry Sears, author of "The Zone"), because the public health authorities told us unwittingly, but with the best of intentions, to eat precisely those foods that would make us fat, and we did. We ate more fat-free carbohydrates, which, in turn, made us hungrier and then heavier. Put simply, if the alternative hypothesis is right, then a low-fat diet is not by definition a healthy diet. In practice, such a diet cannot help being high in carbohydrates, and that can lead to obesity, and perhaps even heart disease. "For a large percentage of the population, perhaps 30 to 40 percent, low-fat diets are counterproductive," says Eleftheria Maratos-Flier, director of obesity research at Harvard's prestigious Joslin Diabetes Center. "They have the paradoxical effect of making people gain weight." 
Scientists are still arguing about fat, despite a century of research, because the regulation of appetite and weight in the human body happens to be almost inconceivably complex, and the experimental tools we have to study it are still remarkably inadequate. This combination leaves researchers in an awkward position. To study the entire physiological system involves feeding real food to real human subjects for months or years on end, which is prohibitively expensive, ethically questionable (if you're trying to measure the effects of foods that might cause heart disease) and virtually impossible to do in any kind of rigorously controlled scientific manner. But if researchers seek to study something less costly and more controllable, they end up studying experimental situations so oversimplified that their results may have nothing to do with reality. This then leads to a research literature so vast that it's possible to find at least some published research to support virtually any theory. The result is a balkanized community -- "splintered, very opinionated and in many instances, intransigent," says Kurt Isselbacher, a former chairman of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Science -- in which researchers seem easily convinced that their preconceived notions are correct and thoroughly uninterested in testing any other hypotheses but their own. 
What's more, the number of misconceptions propagated about the most basic research can be staggering. Researchers will be suitably scientific describing the limitations of their own experiments, and then will cite something as gospel truth because they read it in a magazine. The classic example is the statement heard repeatedly that 95 percent of all dieters never lose weight, and 95 percent of those who do will not keep it off. This will be correctly attributed to the University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Albert Stunkard, but it will go unmentioned that this statement is based on 100 patients who passed through Stunkard's obesity clinic during the Eisenhower administration.
With these caveats, one of the few reasonably reliable facts about the obesity epidemic is that it started around the early 1980's. According to Katherine Flegal, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics, the percentage of obese Americans stayed relatively constant through the 1960's and 1970's at 13 percent to 14 percent and then shot up by 8 percentage points in the 1980's. By the end of that decade, nearly one in four Americans was obese. That steep rise, which is consistent through all segments of American society and which continued unabated through the 1990's, is the singular feature of the epidemic. Any theory that tries to explain obesity in America has to account for that. Meanwhile, overweight children nearly tripled in number. And for the first time, physicians began diagnosing Type 2 diabetes in adolescents. Type 2 diabetes often accompanies obesity. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes and now, for the obvious reason, is not. 
So how did this happen? The orthodox and ubiquitous explanation is that we live in what Kelly Brownell, a Yale psychologist, has called a "toxic food environment" of cheap fatty food, large portions, pervasive food advertising and sedentary lives. By this theory, we are at the Pavlovian mercy of the food industry, which spends nearly $10 billion a year advertising unwholesome junk food and fast food. And because these foods, especially fast food, are so filled with fat, they are both irresistible and uniquely fattening. On top of this, so the theory goes, our modern society has successfully eliminated physical activity from our daily lives. We no longer exercise or walk up stairs, nor do our children bike to school or play outside, because they would prefer to play video games and watch television. And because some of us are obviously predisposed to gain weight while others are not, this explanation also has a genetic component -- the thrifty gene. It suggests that storing extra calories as fat was an evolutionary advantage to our Paleolithic ancestors, who had to survive frequent famine. We then inherited these "thrifty" genes, despite their liability in today's toxic environment.
This theory makes perfect sense and plays to our puritanical prejudice that fat, fast food and television are innately damaging to our humanity. But there are two catches. First, to buy this logic is to accept that the copious negative reinforcement that accompanies obesity -- both socially and physically -- is easily overcome by the constant bombardment of food advertising and the lure of a supersize bargain meal. And second, as Flegal points out, little data exist to support any of this. Certainly none of it explains what changed so significantly to start the epidemic. Fast-food consumption, for example, continued to grow steadily through the 70's and 80's, but it did not take a sudden leap, as obesity did.
As far as exercise and physical activity go, there are no reliable data before the mid-80's, according to William Dietz, who runs the division of nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control; the 1990's data show obesity rates continuing to climb, while exercise activity remained unchanged. This suggests the two have little in common. Dietz also acknowledged that a culture of physical exercise began in the United States in the 70's -- the "leisure exercise mania," as Robert Levy, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, described it in 1981 -- and has continued through the present day.
As for the thrifty gene, it provides the kind of evolutionary rationale for human behavior that scientists find comforting but that simply cannot be tested. In other words, if we were living through an anorexia epidemic, the experts would be discussing the equally untestable "spendthrift gene" theory, touting evolutionary advantages of losing weight effortlessly. An overweight homo erectus, they'd say, would have been easy prey for predators. 
It is also undeniable, note students of Endocrinology 101, that mankind never evolved to eat a diet high in starches or sugars. "Grain products and concentrated sugars were essentially absent from human nutrition until the invention of agriculture," Ludwig says, "which was only 10,000 years ago." This is discussed frequently in the anthropology texts but is mostly absent from the obesity literature, with the prominent exception of the low-carbohydrate-diet books. 
What's forgotten in the current controversy is that the low-fat dogma itself is only about 25 years old. Until the late 70's, the accepted wisdom was that fat and protein protected against overeating by making you sated, and that carbohydrates made you fat. In "The Physiology of Taste," for instance, an 1825 discourse considered among the most famous books ever written about food, the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin says that he could easily identify the causes of obesity after 30 years of listening to one "stout party" after another proclaiming the joys of bread, rice and (from a "particularly stout party") potatoes. Brillat-Savarin described the roots of obesity as a natural predisposition conjuncted with the "floury and feculent substances which man makes the prime ingredients of his daily nourishment." He added that the effects of this fecula -- i.e., "potatoes, grain or any kind of flour" -- were seen sooner when sugar was added to the diet.
This is what my mother taught me 40 years ago, backed up by the vague observation that Italians tended toward corpulence because they ate so much pasta. This observation was actually documented by Ancel Keys, a University of Minnesota physician who noted that fats "have good staying power," by which he meant they are slow to be digested and so lead to satiation, and that Italians were among the heaviest populations he had studied. According to Keys, the Neapolitans, for instance, ate only a little lean meat once or twice a week, but ate bread and pasta every day for lunch and dinner. "There was no evidence of nutritional deficiency," he wrote, "but the working-class women were fat." 
By the 70's, you could still find articles in the journals describing high rates of obesity in Africa and the Caribbean where diets contained almost exclusively carbohydrates. The common thinking, wrote a former director of the Nutrition Division of the United Nations, was that the ideal diet, one that prevented obesity, snacking and excessive sugar consumption, was a diet "with plenty of eggs, beef, mutton, chicken, butter and well-cooked vegetables." This was the identical prescription Brillat-Savarin put forth in 1825.
It was Ancel Keys, paradoxically, who introduced the low-fat-is-good-health dogma in the 50's with his theory that dietary fat raises cholesterol levels and gives you heart disease. Over the next two decades, however, the scientific evidence supporting this theory remained stubbornly ambiguous. The case was eventually settled not by new science but by politics. It began in January 1977, when a Senate committee led by George McGovern published its "Dietary Goals for the United States," advising that Americans significantly curb their fat intake to abate an epidemic of "killer diseases" supposedly sweeping the country. It peaked in late 1984, when the National Institutes of Health officially recommended that all Americans over the age of 2 eat less fat. By that time, fat had become "this greasy killer" in the memorable words of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the model American breakfast of eggs and bacon was well on its way to becoming a bowl of Special K with low-fat milk, a glass of orange juice and toast, hold the butter -- a dubious feast of refined carbohydrates.
In the intervening years, the N.I.H. spent several hundred million dollars trying to demonstrate a connection between eating fat and getting heart disease and, despite what we might think, it failed. Five major studies revealed no such link. A sixth, however, costing well over $100 million alone, concluded that reducing cholesterol by drug therapy could prevent heart disease. The N.I.H. administrators then made a leap of faith. Basil Rifkind, who oversaw the relevant trials for the N.I.H., described their logic this way: they had failed to demonstrate at great expense that eating less fat had any health benefits. But if a cholesterol-lowering drug could prevent heart attacks, then a low-fat, cholesterol-lowering diet should do the same. "It's an imperfect world," Rifkind told me. "The data that would be definitive is ungettable, so you do your best with what is available." 
Some of the best scientists disagreed with this low-fat logic, suggesting that good science was incompatible with such leaps of faith, but they were effectively ignored. Pete Ahrens, whose Rockefeller University laboratory had done the seminal research on cholesterol metabolism, testified to McGovern's committee that everyone responds differently to low-fat diets. It was not a scientific matter who might benefit and who might be harmed, he said, but "a betting matter." Phil Handler, then president of the National Academy of Sciences, testified in Congress to the same effect in 1980. "What right," Handler asked, "has the federal government to propose that the American people conduct a vast nutritional experiment, with themselves as subjects, on the strength of so very little evidence that it will do them any good?" 
Nonetheless, once the N.I.H. signed off on the low-fat doctrine, societal forces took over. The food industry quickly began producing thousands of reduced-fat food products to meet the new recommendations. Fat was removed from foods like cookies, chips and yogurt. The problem was, it had to be replaced with something as tasty and pleasurable to the palate, which meant some form of sugar, often high-fructose corn syrup. Meanwhile, an entire industry emerged to create fat substitutes, of which Procter & Gamble's olestra was first. And because these reduced-fat meats, cheeses, snacks and cookies had to compete with a few hundred thousand other food products marketed in America, the industry dedicated considerable advertising effort to reinforcing the less-fat-is-good-health message. Helping the cause was what Walter Willett calls the "huge forces" of dietitians, health organizations, consumer groups, health reporters and even cookbook writers, all well-intended missionaries of healthful eating.
Few experts now deny that the low-fat message is radically oversimplified. If nothing else, it effectively ignores the fact that unsaturated fats, like olive oil, are relatively good for you: they tend to elevate your good cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (H.D.L.), and lower your bad cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (L.D.L.), at least in comparison to the effect of carbohydrates. While higher L.D.L. raises your heart-disease risk, higher H.D.L. reduces it.
What this means is that even saturated fats -- a k a, the bad fats -- are not nearly as deleterious as you would think. True, they will elevate your bad cholesterol, but they will also elevate your good cholesterol. In other words, it's a virtual wash. As Willett explained to me, you will gain little to no health benefit by giving up milk, butter and cheese and eating bagels instead. 
But it gets even weirder than that. Foods considered more or less deadly under the low-fat dogma turn out to be comparatively benign if you actually look at their fat content. More than two-thirds of the fat in a porterhouse steak, for instance, will definitively improve your cholesterol profile (at least in comparison with the baked potato next to it); it's true that the remainder will raise your L.D.L., the bad stuff, but it will also boost your H.D.L. The same is true for lard. If you work out the numbers, you come to the surreal conclusion that you can eat lard straight from the can and conceivably reduce your risk of heart disease.
The crucial example of how the low-fat recommendations were oversimplified is shown by the impact -- potentially lethal, in fact -- of low-fat diets on triglycerides, which are the component molecules of fat. By the late 60's, researchers had shown that high triglyceride levels were at least as common in heart-disease patients as high L.D.L. cholesterol, and that eating a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet would, for many people, raise their triglyceride levels, lower their H.D.L. levels and accentuate what Gerry Reaven, an endocrinologist at Stanford University, called Syndrome X. This is a cluster of conditions that can lead to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. 
It took Reaven a decade to convince his peers that Syndrome X was a legitimate health concern, in part because to accept its reality is to accept that low-fat diets will increase the risk of heart disease in a third of the population. "Sometimes we wish it would go away because nobody knows how to deal with it," said Robert Silverman, an N.I.H. researcher, at a 1987 N.I.H. conference. "High protein levels can be bad for the kidneys. High fat is bad for your heart. Now Reaven is saying not to eat high carbohydrates. We have to eat something." 
Surely, everyone involved in drafting the various dietary guidelines wanted Americans simply to eat less junk food, however you define it, and eat more the way they do in Berkeley, Calif. But we didn't go along. Instead we ate more starches and refined carbohydrates, because calorie for calorie, these are the cheapest nutrients for the food industry to produce, and they can be sold at the highest profit. It's also what we like to eat. Rare is the person under the age of 50 who doesn't prefer a cookie or heavily sweetened yogurt to a head of broccoli. 
"All reformers would do well to be conscious of the law of unintended consequences," says Alan Stone, who was staff director for McGovern's Senate committee. Stone told me he had an inkling about how the food industry would respond to the new dietary goals back when the hearings were first held. An economist pulled him aside, he said, and gave him a lesson on market disincentives to healthy eating: "He said if you create a new market with a brand-new manufactured food, give it a brand-new fancy name, put a big advertising budget behind it, you can have a market all to yourself and force your competitors to catch up. You can't do that with fruits and vegetables. It's harder to differentiate an apple from an apple."
Nutrition researchers also played a role by trying to feed science into the idea that carbohydrates are the ideal nutrient. It had been known, for almost a century, and considered mostly irrelevant to the etiology of obesity, that fat has nine calories per gram compared with four for carbohydrates and protein. Now it became the fail-safe position of the low-fat recommendations: reduce the densest source of calories in the diet and you will lose weight. Then in 1982, J.P. Flatt, a University of Massachusetts biochemist, published his research demonstrating that, in any normal diet, it is extremely rare for the human body to convert carbohydrates into body fat. This was then misinterpreted by the media and quite a few scientists to mean that eating carbohydrates, even to excess, could not make you fat -- which is not the case, Flatt says. But the misinterpretation developed a vigorous life of its own because it resonated with the notion that fat makes you fat and carbohydrates are harmless. 
As a result, the major trends in American diets since the late 70's, according to the U.S.D.A. agricultural economist Judith Putnam, have been a decrease in the percentage of fat calories and a "greatly increased consumption of carbohydrates." To be precise, annual grain consumption has increased almost 60 pounds per person, and caloric sweeteners (primarily high-fructose corn syrup) by 30 pounds. At the same time, we suddenly began consuming more total calories: now up to 400 more each day since the government started recommending low-fat diets. 
If these trends are correct, then the obesity epidemic can certainly be explained by Americans' eating more calories than ever -- excess calories, after all, are what causes us to gain weight -- and, specifically, more carbohydrates. The question is why? 
The answer provided by Endocrinology 101 is that we are simply hungrier than we were in the 70's, and the reason is physiological more than psychological. In this case, the salient factor -- ignored in the pursuit of fat and its effect on cholesterol -- is how carbohydrates affect blood sugar and insulin. In fact, these were obvious culprits all along, which is why Atkins and the low-carb-diet doctors pounced on them early.
The primary role of insulin is to regulate blood-sugar levels. After you eat carbohydrates, they will be broken down into their component sugar molecules and transported into the bloodstream. Your pancreas then secretes insulin, which shunts the blood sugar into muscles and the liver as fuel for the next few hours. This is why carbohydrates have a significant impact on insulin and fat does not. And because juvenile diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin, physicians believed since the 20's that the only evil with insulin is not having enough. 
But insulin also regulates fat metabolism. We cannot store body fat without it. Think of insulin as a switch. When it's on, in the few hours after eating, you burn carbohydrates for energy and store excess calories as fat. When it's off, after the insulin has been depleted, you burn fat as fuel. So when insulin levels are low, you will burn your own fat, but not when they're high. 
This is where it gets unavoidably complicated. The fatter you are, the more insulin your pancreas will pump out per meal, and the more likely you'll develop what's called "insulin resistance," which is the underlying cause of Syndrome X. In effect, your cells become insensitive to the action of insulin, and so you need ever greater amounts to keep your blood sugar in check. So as you gain weight, insulin makes it easier to store fat and harder to lose it. But the insulin resistance in turn may make it harder to store fat -- your weight is being kept in check, as it should be. But now the insulin resistance might prompt your pancreas to produce even more insulin, potentially starting a vicious cycle. Which comes first -- the obesity, the elevated insulin, known as hyperinsulinemia, or the insulin resistance -- is a chicken-and-egg problem that hasn't been resolved. One endocrinologist described this to me as "the Nobel-prize winning question."
Insulin also profoundly affects hunger, although to what end is another point of controversy. On the one hand, insulin can indirectly cause hunger by lowering your blood sugar, but how low does blood sugar have to drop before hunger kicks in? That's unresolved. Meanwhile, insulin works in the brain to suppress hunger. The theory, as explained to me by Michael Schwartz, an endocrinologist at the University of Washington, is that insulin's ability to inhibit appetite would normally counteract its propensity to generate body fat. In other words, as you gained weight, your body would generate more insulin after every meal, and that in turn would suppress your appetite; you'd eat less and lose the weight. 
Schwartz, however, can imagine a simple mechanism that would throw this "homeostatic" system off balance: if your brain were to lose its sensitivity to insulin, just as your fat and muscles do when they are flooded with it. Now the higher insulin production that comes with getting fatter would no longer compensate by suppressing your appetite, because your brain would no longer register the rise in insulin. The end result would be a physiologic state in which obesity is almost preordained, and one in which the carbohydrate-insulin connection could play a major role. Schwartz says he believes this could indeed be happening, but research hasn't progressed far enough to prove it. "It is just a hypothesis," he says. "It still needs to be sorted out." 
David Ludwig, the Harvard endocrinologist, says that it's the direct effect of insulin on blood sugar that does the trick. He notes that when diabetics get too much insulin, their blood sugar drops and they get ravenously hungry. They gain weight because they eat more, and the insulin promotes fat deposition. The same happens with lab animals. This, he says, is effectively what happens when we eat carbohydrates -- in particular sugar and starches like potatoes and rice, or anything made from flour, like a slice of white bread. These are known in the jargon as high-glycemic-index carbohydrates, which means they are absorbed quickly into the blood. As a result, they cause a spike of blood sugar and a surge of insulin within minutes. The resulting rush of insulin stores the blood sugar away and a few hours later, your blood sugar is lower than it was before you ate. As Ludwig explains, your body effectively thinks it has run out of fuel, but the insulin is still high enough to prevent you from burning your own fat. The result is hunger and a craving for more carbohydrates. It's another vicious circle, and another situation ripe for obesity. 
The glycemic-index concept and the idea that starches can be absorbed into the blood even faster than sugar emerged in the late 70's, but again had no influence on public health recommendations, because of the attendant controversies. To wit: if you bought the glycemic-index concept, then you had to accept that the starches we were supposed to be eating 6 to 11 times a day were, once swallowed, physiologically indistinguishable from sugars. This made them seem considerably less than wholesome. Rather than accept this possibility, the policy makers simply allowed sugar and corn syrup to elude the vilification that befell dietary fat. After all, they are fat-free. 
Sugar and corn syrup from soft drinks, juices and the copious teas and sports drinks now supply more than 10 percent of our total calories; the 80's saw the introduction of Big Gulps and 32-ounce cups of Coca-Cola, blasted through with sugar, but 100 percent fat free. When it comes to insulin and blood sugar, these soft drinks and fruit juices -- what the scientists call "wet carbohydrates" -- might indeed be worst of all. (Diet soda accounts for less than a quarter of the soda market.) 
The gist of the glycemic-index idea is that the longer it takes the carbohydrates to be digested, the lesser the impact on blood sugar and insulin and the healthier the food. Those foods with the highest rating on the glycemic index are some simple sugars, starches and anything made from flour. Green vegetables, beans and whole grains cause a much slower rise in blood sugar because they have fiber, a nondigestible carbohydrate, which slows down digestion and lowers the glycemic index. Protein and fat serve the same purpose, which implies that eating fat can be beneficial, a notion that is still unacceptable. And the glycemic-index concept implies that a primary cause of Syndrome X, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity is the long-term damage caused by the repeated surges of insulin that come from eating starches and refined carbohydrates. This suggests a kind of unified field theory for these chronic diseases, but not one that coexists easily with the low-fat doctrine. 
At Ludwig's pediatric obesity clinic, he has been prescribing low-glycemic-index diets to children and adolescents for five years now. He does not recommend the Atkins diet because he says he believes such a very low carbohydrate approach is unnecessarily restrictive; instead, he tells his patients to effectively replace refined carbohydrates and starches with vegetables, legumes and fruit. This makes a low-glycemic-index diet consistent with dietary common sense, albeit in a higher-fat kind of way. His clinic now has a nine-month waiting list. Only recently has Ludwig managed to convince the N.I.H. that such diets are worthy of study. His first three grant proposals were summarily rejected, which may explain why much of the relevant research has been done in Canada and in Australia. In April, however, Ludwig received $1.2 million from the N.I.H. to test his low-glycemic-index diet against a traditional low-fat-low-calorie regime. That might help resolve some of the controversy over the role of insulin in obesity, although the redoubtable Robert Atkins might get there first.
The 71-year-old Atkins, a graduate of Cornell medical school, says he first tried a very low carbohydrate diet in 1963 after reading about one in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He lost weight effortlessly, had his epiphany and turned a fledgling Manhattan cardiology practice into a thriving obesity clinic. He then alienated the entire medical community by telling his readers to eat as much fat and protein as they wanted, as long as they ate little to no carbohydrates. They would lose weight, he said, because they would keep their insulin down; they wouldn't be hungry; and they would have less resistance to burning their own fat. Atkins also noted that starches and sugar were harmful in any event because they raised triglyceride levels and that this was a greater risk factor for heart disease than cholesterol. 
Atkins's diet is both the ultimate manifestation of the alternative hypothesis as well as the battleground on which the fat-versus-carbohydrates controversy is likely to be fought scientifically over the next few years. After insisting Atkins was a quack for three decades, obesity experts are now finding it difficult to ignore the copious anecdotal evidence that his diet does just what he has claimed. Take Albert Stunkard, for instance. Stunkard has been trying to treat obesity for half a century, but he told me he had his epiphany about Atkins and maybe about obesity as well just recently when he discovered that the chief of radiology in his hospital had lost 60 pounds on Atkins's diet. "Well, apparently all the young guys in the hospital are doing it," he said. "So we decided to do a study." When I asked Stunkard if he or any of his colleagues considered testing Atkins's diet 30 years ago, he said they hadn't because they thought Atkins was "a jerk" who was just out to make money: this "turned people off, and so nobody took him seriously enough to do what we're finally doing."
In fact, when the American Medical Association released its scathing critique of Atkins's diet in March 1973, it acknowledged that the diet probably worked, but expressed little interest in why. Through the 60's, this had been a subject of considerable research, with the conclusion that Atkins-like diets were low-calorie diets in disguise; that when you cut out pasta, bread and potatoes, you'll have a hard time eating enough meat, vegetables and cheese to replace the calories. 
That, however, raised the question of why such a low-calorie regimen would also suppress hunger, which Atkins insisted was the signature characteristic of the diet. One possibility was Endocrinology 101: that fat and protein make you sated and, lacking carbohydrates and the ensuing swings of blood sugar and insulin, you stay sated. The other possibility arose from the fact that Atkins's diet is "ketogenic." This means that insulin falls so low that you enter a state called ketosis, which is what happens during fasting and starvation. Your muscles and tissues burn body fat for energy, as does your brain in the form of fat molecules produced by the liver called ketones. Atkins saw ketosis as the obvious way to kick-start weight loss. He also liked to say that ketosis was so energizing that it was better than sex, which set him up for some ridicule. An inevitable criticism of Atkins's diet has been that ketosis is dangerous and to be avoided at all costs. 
When I interviewed ketosis experts, however, they universally sided with Atkins, and suggested that maybe the medical community and the media confuse ketosis with ketoacidosis, a variant of ketosis that occurs in untreated diabetics and can be fatal. "Doctors are scared of ketosis," says Richard Veech, an N.I.H. researcher who studied medicine at Harvard and then got his doctorate at Oxford University with the Nobel Laureate Hans Krebs. "They're always worried about diabetic ketoacidosis. But ketosis is a normal physiologic state. I would argue it is the normal state of man. It's not normal to have McDonald's and a delicatessen around every corner. It's normal to starve."
Simply put, ketosis is evolution's answer to the thrifty gene. We may have evolved to efficiently store fat for times of famine, says Veech, but we also evolved ketosis to efficiently live off that fat when necessary. Rather than being poison, which is how the press often refers to ketones, they make the body run more efficiently and provide a backup fuel source for the brain. Veech calls ketones "magic" and has shown that both the heart and brain run 25 percent more efficiently on ketones than on blood sugar. 
The bottom line is that for the better part of 30 years Atkins insisted his diet worked and was safe, Americans apparently tried it by the tens of millions, while nutritionists, physicians, public- health authorities and anyone concerned with heart disease insisted it could kill them, and expressed little or no desire to find out who was right. During that period, only two groups of U.S. researchers tested the diet, or at least published their results. In the early 70's, J.P. Flatt and Harvard's George Blackburn pioneered the "protein-sparing modified fast" to treat postsurgical patients, and they tested it on obese volunteers. Blackburn, who later became president of the American Society of Clinical Nutrition, describes his regime as "an Atkins diet without excess fat" and says he had to give it a fancy name or nobody would take him seriously. The diet was "lean meat, fish and fowl" supplemented by vitamins and minerals. "People loved it," Blackburn recalls. "Great weight loss. We couldn't run them off with a baseball bat." Blackburn successfully treated hundreds of obese patients over the next decade and published a series of papers that were ignored. When obese New Englanders turned to appetite-control drugs in the mid-80's, he says, he let it drop. He then applied to the N.I.H. for a grant to do a clinical trial of popular diets but was rejected. 
The second trial, published in September 1980, was done at the George Washington University Medical Center. Two dozen obese volunteers agreed to follow Atkins's diet for eight weeks and lost an average of 17 pounds each, with no apparent ill effects, although their L.D.L. cholesterol did go up. The researchers, led by John LaRosa, now president of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, concluded that the 17-pound weight loss in eight weeks would likely have happened with any diet under "the novelty of trying something under experimental conditions" and never pursued it further. 
Now researchers have finally decided that Atkins's diet and other low-carb diets have to be tested, and are doing so against traditional low-calorie-low-fat diets as recommended by the American Heart Association. To explain their motivation, they inevitably tell one of two stories: some, like Stunkard, told me that someone they knew -- a patient, a friend, a fellow physician -- lost considerable weight on Atkins's diet and, despite all their preconceptions to the contrary, kept it off. Others say they were frustrated with their inability to help their obese patients, looked into the low-carb diets and decided that Endocrinology 101 was compelling. "As a trained physician, I was trained to mock anything like the Atkins diet," says Linda Stern, an internist at the Philadelphia Veterans Administration Hospital, "but I put myself on the diet. I did great. And I thought maybe this is something I can offer my patients."
None of these studies have been financed by the N.I.H., and none have yet been published. But the results have been reported at conferences -- by researchers at Schneider Children's Hospital on Long Island, Duke University and the University of Cincinnati, and by Stern's group at the Philadelphia V.A. Hospital. And then there's the study Stunkard had mentioned, led by Gary Foster at the University of Pennsylvania, Sam Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, and Jim Hill, who runs the University of Colorado Center for Human Nutrition in Denver. The results of all five of these studies are remarkably consistent. Subjects on some form of the Atkins diet -- whether overweight adolescents on the diet for 12 weeks as at Schneider, or obese adults averaging 295 pounds on the diet for six months, as at the Philadelphia V.A. -- lost twice the weight as the subjects on the low-fat, low-calorie diets. 
In all five studies, cholesterol levels improved similarly with both diets, but triglyceride levels were considerably lower with the Atkins diet. Though researchers are hesitant to agree with this, it does suggest that heart-disease risk could actually be reduced when fat is added back into the diet and starches and refined carbohydrates are removed. "I think when this stuff gets to be recognized," Stunkard says, "it's going to really shake up a lot of thinking about obesity and metabolism."
All of this could be settled sooner rather than later, and with it, perhaps, we might have some long-awaited answers as to why we grow fat and whether it is indeed preordained by societal forces or by our choice of foods. For the first time, the N.I.H. is now actually financing comparative studies of popular diets. Foster, Klein and Hill, for instance, have now received more than $2.5 million from N.I.H. to do a five-year trial of the Atkins diet with 360 obese individuals. At Harvard, Willett, Blackburn and Penelope Greene have money, albeit from Atkins's nonprofit foundation, to do a comparative trial as well. 
Should these clinical trials also find for Atkins and his high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, then the public-health authorities may indeed have a problem on their hands. Once they took their leap of faith and settled on the low-fat dietary dogma 25 years ago, they left little room for contradictory evidence or a change of opinion, should such a change be necessary to keep up with the science. In this light Sam Klein's experience is noteworthy. Klein is president-elect of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, which suggests that he is a highly respected member of his community. And yet, he described his recent experience discussing the Atkins diet at medical conferences as a learning experience. "I have been impressed," he said, "with the anger of academicians in the audience. Their response is 'How dare you even present data on the Atkins diet!' " 
This hostility stems primarily from their anxiety that Americans, given a glimmer of hope about their weight, will rush off en masse to try a diet that simply seems intuitively dangerous and on which there is still no long-term data on whether it works and whether it is safe. It's a justifiable fear. In the course of my research, I have spent my mornings at my local diner, staring down at a plate of scrambled eggs and sausage, convinced that somehow, some way, they must be working to clog my arteries and do me in. 
After 20 years steeped in a low-fat paradigm, I find it hard to see the nutritional world any other way. I have learned that low-fat diets fail in clinical trials and in real life, and they certainly have failed in my life. I have read the papers suggesting that 20 years of low-fat recommendations have not managed to lower the incidence of heart disease in this country, and may have led instead to the steep increase in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. I have interviewed researchers whose computer models have calculated that cutting back on the saturated fats in my diet to the levels recommended by the American Heart Association would not add more than a few months to my life, if that. I have even lost considerable weight with relative ease by giving up carbohydrates on my test diet, and yet I can look down at my eggs and sausage and still imagine the imminent onset of heart disease and obesity, the latter assuredly to be caused by some bizarre rebound phenomena the likes of which science has not yet begun to describe. The fact that Atkins himself has had heart trouble recently does not ease my anxiety, despite his assurance that it is not diet-related. 
This is the state of mind I imagine that mainstream nutritionists, researchers and physicians must inevitably take to the fat-versus-carbohydrate controversy. They may come around, but the evidence will have to be exceptionally compelling. Although this kind of conversion may be happening at the moment to John Farquhar, who is a professor of health research and policy at Stanford University and has worked in this field for more than 40 years. When I interviewed Farquhar in April, he explained why low-fat diets might lead to weight gain and low-carbohydrate diets might lead to weight loss, but he made me promise not to say he believed they did. He attributed the cause of the obesity epidemic to the "force-feeding of a nation." Three weeks later, after reading an article on Endocrinology 101 by David Ludwig in the Journal of the American Medical Association, he sent me an e-mail message asking the not-entirely-rhetorical question, "Can we get the low-fat proponents to apologize?"

Counting Sheep

BYLINE:  By Jason Epstein

 BODY:
In addition to an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 elves, the 280,000 citizens of Iceland share their pristine sub-Arctic island with some 500,000 sheep. These they consume at the astonishing annual rate of about 55 pounds per capita. This appetite for lamb -- Americans consumed a little more than a pound per capita in 1999 -- is more than mere culinary enthusiasm; it's a matter of ecological survival. For Iceland's sheep are rapidly depleting the fragile ground cover of grass, moss, sedge and berries that lends the lamb its unmatched flavor but also keeps the thin but irreplaceable topsoil from blowing out to sea and leaving the fertile coast as barren as the uninhabitable interior of volcanic rock and glacier. 
 Of the many ways human beings have contrived to fend off ecological disaster, Iceland's attempt to preserve its meager topsoil by consuming its lambs before they consume Iceland is surely the tastiest. The free-range newborns that are set loose each spring upon the mountain meadows are as delicately flavored, tender and greaseless as the salt-meadow lambs of France. Smaller than either the French or our own Colorado lambs, Icelandic lambs lack the heft and intensity Americans are used to, but this is a fair exchange for the purity of their flavor, untainted by antibiotics, growth hormones or pesticides. Since Iceland derives much of its energy from geothermal springs and burns relatively little fossil fuel, its atmosphere is largely uncorrupted, and shellfish, cod, haddock and other fish abound in its clean waters. 
 Icelanders, descendants of medieval Norsemen whose ancient language they still speak, are not as insular as you might expect of an island people, but rather self-sufficient from the long experience of fending for themselves on rugged land. This is reflected in their confident humor, which lacks the tragic or bitter undertone found in other cultures. And the reticence that accompanies this self-sufficiency may explain why Icelandic lamb is hardly known to the outside world. Until the crisis caused by the relentlessly nibbling lambs, Iceland had little inclination to market its lamb beyond its borders. Icelanders welcome the outside world and warily keep abreast of its woes, but the island has little economic or cultural need for the rest of us, except as a market for its cod and other fish, which earns about two-thirds of Iceland's export income. 
Iceland's rates of life expectancy and literacy are higher than those in the United States. With a population two-thirds the size of Staten Island's, Iceland has its own international and domestic airlines, a resident opera company, a famous rock star (Bjork), a world-class novelist (Olaf Olafsson), a symphony orchestra and until Halldor Laxness died four years ago, a Nobel Prize winner in literature. Reykjavik, the capital, has nine theaters attended by 270,000 patrons annually, nearly equivalent to Iceland's entire population; 30 fine restaurants, with at least 2 of them first class; numerous bookstores; and several publishing companies, which release about a thousand titles a year. Nearly all Icelanders consider themselves Lutheran, but it is not clear what this means, since many of them also believe in elves, or at least hesitate to admit that they don't, as skeptics elsewhere may hesitate to call themselves godless. 
When I visited Iceland for the first time some eight years ago, I knew nothing about the local cuisine and expected less. I had heard that the shepherds entertain themselves on long winter nights by inventing new verses in which to retell the ancient tales of Icelandic voyagers and by feasting on boiled sheep's head and rotten shark meat.
I assumed that the rest of the Icelandic menu was similarly exotic and was surprised to discover that Iceland grows its own tomatoes and cucumbers, to say nothing of bananas, in greenhouses warmed by the same geothermal springs that supply household heat and hot water. However, the thought of rotten shark was so fixed in my mind that I did not associate the possibility of a decent dinner with the sight of a sleek trawler coming ashore one morning unloading fresh cod or with the sheep that blocked our way on a country road. It was not until my friends and I decided to cook at home and I bought a few pounds of boned lamb loin that I learned the truth about Icelandic ingredients.
At a friend's house, we browned these loins, each about three and a half ounces, in butter, finished them in the oven and served them with small potatoes in the Icelandic style -- boiled first, then lightly caramelized on top of the stove with butter and sugar. It was an evening I shall never forget, and one that I have since recreated many times, omitting the sugary potatoes and adding a dab of rosemary-infused demi-glace in a red-wine reduction to the lamb. A recent dinner for 10 in Sag Harbor began with Icelandic langoustes napped with garlic-infused butter, haddock and cod caught in Iceland the day before and shipped by air, fresh peas in the French style, with lettuce, and roasted tomatoes. My friend Sheila Lukens, with her sixth sense for what goes with what, supplied three bottles of Bandol Rose (Domaine Tempier).
A government agency has now been assigned the task of protecting Iceland's topsoil, and the lamb population has already been reduced by about 15 percent since 1990. While Icelandic lamb may soon be more widely available, at the moment the easiest way to order lamb and seafood is from www.icelandnaturally.com for next-day delivery to the United States. The loins, together with the smaller tenderloins, arrive boned and fresh from September through early November, when the 6-month-old lambs are butchered, since there is no way to house the flocks over the winter. The rest of the year they are shipped frozen, which does not affect their flavor or texture.

Icelandic Lamb Loins
3 pounds boned Icelandic lamb loins (about 3 ounces each) and tenderloins (1 to 2 ounces each); see note
1 bottle pinot noir or other full-bodied red wine
1 medium carrot, trimmed, peeled and chopped coarsely
1 medium onion, peeled and chopped coarsely
1 celery rib, trimmed and chopped coarsely
2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
16 1/2-ounce container D'Artagnan Rich Duck and Veal Stock
Demi-Glace (see note)
2 large sprigs fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons peanut or corn oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon unsalted butter.
1. One hour before you are ready to cook the lamb, remove it from the refrigerator.
2. Meanwhile, in a 3-quart nonreactive shallow saucepan, bring the wine to a boil. With a long match, ignite the wine and boil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the flame subsides and the alcohol evaporates. Add the carrot, onion, celery and garlic; cook at a low boil for about 10 minutes, or until reduced by half. Add the demi-glace and simmer about 15 minutes, or until reduced by half. Remove the pan from the heat; add the rosemary to steep and set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Heat a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, add about half the loins and brown about 1 minute on each side. (Do not overcrowd the meat.) Season with salt and pepper and set aside. Repeat with the remaining loins. 
4. Return all the loins to the skillet and transfer it to the oven. Roast the loins for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the meat is firm to the touch and an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part registers 120 degrees. Transfer the loins to a platter, cover loosely with foil and let stand 5 minutes. (The temperature will reach 125 to 130 degrees for medium rare.)
5. Wipe out the skillet. Brown the tenderloins in batches with the remaining tablespoon of oil for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side for medium rare. 
6. Add any juices from the meat to the reserved sauce. Strain it into a bowl through a fine sieve, pressing the vegetables with the back of a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Wipe out the saucepan, add the strained sauce and return to a simmer. Whisk in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper. (Makes about 1 cup.)
7. Slice the loins on the bias and the tenderloins into thirds. Divide among 6 plates, nap with sauce and serve with Roasted Tomatoes and Summer Peas (see recipes). 
Yield: 6 servings.
NOTE: For American lamb, prepare as directed, but use 3 pounds of tenderloins (about 6 ounces each), trimmed. Brown in batches, 3 minutes per side, and finish in the oven until the lamb reaches the same internal temperature.
D'Artagnan Rich Duck and Veal Stock Demi-Glace can be purchased at Dean & DeLuca and other fine food stores, or call (800)327-8246.

Roasted Tomatoes
2 cloves garlic, peeled
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
6 firm medium-size tomatoes
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon sugar
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the garlic and water to cover in a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Poach the garlic for about 4 minutes; drain. When the garlic is cool, chop it finely and combine with the thyme in a cup.
2. With a sharp knife, slice 1/2 inch from the top of each tomato. Coat the bottom of a large nonstick skillet with the oil and sprinkle evenly with the sugar. Arrange the tomatoes cut side down in the skillet and set it over medium heat. Cook 8 minutes, or until the sugar starts to caramelize. 
3. Remove the skillet from the heat. Turn the tomatoes over, sprinkle with the thyme and garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Place the skillet in the oven and roast tomatoes about 10 minutes, or until heated through and soft. 
Yield: 6 servings.

Summer Peas
1 head Boston lettuce, rinsed and torn
3 pounds fresh green peas, shelled
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut up
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
Spread the lettuce in the bottom of a large pot, add the peas and sugar and dot with butter. Cover the pot and set over medium heat. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes; uncover and test the peas -- they should be bright green and tender. (If not, continue to cook, checking every 2 minutes.) Stir; season with salt and pepper. 
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: Approximating Life 

BYLINE:  By Clive Thompson; Clive Thompson is a writer in New York City.

 BODY:
'It's a good thing you didn't see me this morning," Richard Wallace warns me as he bites into his hamburger. We're sitting in a sports bar near his home in San Francisco, and I can barely hear his soft, husky voice over the jukebox. He wipes his lips clean of ketchup and grins awkwardly. "Or you'd have seen my backup personality."
 The backup personality: that's Wallace's code name for his manic depression. To keep it in check, he downs a daily cocktail of psychoactive drugs, including Topamax, an anti-epileptic that acts as a mood stabilizer, and Prozac. Marijuana, too -- most afternoons, he'll roll about four or five joints the size of his index finger. The medications work pretty well, but some crisis always comes along to bring the backup personality to the front. This morning, a collection agency for Wallace's college loans wrote to say they'd begun docking $235 from the monthly disability checks he started getting from the government last year, when bipolar disorder was diagnosed. Oh, God, it's happening again, he panicked: His former employers -- the ones who had fired him from a string of universities and colleges -- would be cackling at his misfortune, happy they'd driven him out. Wallace, 41, had raged around the cramped apartment he shares with his wife and son, strewn with computer-science texts and action-doll figurines. 
 "Stuff like that really makes me insane, when I start thinking about my friends who are at Berkeley or Carnegie-Mellon with tenure and sabbaticals and promotions," he says, staring down at his plate. He looks awkward, as if he's borrowing someone else's body -- shifting his stocky frame in his chair, all rumpled jeans and unruly eyebrows. "It's like I can't even talk to those people anymore. I live on a different planet." In June, after I visited him, his alienation from the academic establishment became more dramatic still: a former colleague, claiming Wallace had threatened him, took out a restraining order that prevents him from setting foot on the grounds of the University of California at Berkeley.
When he can't get along with the real world, Wallace goes back to the only thing he has left: his computer. Each morning, he wakes before dawn and watches conversations stream by on his screen. Thousands of people flock to his Web site every day from all over the world to talk to his creation, a robot called Alice. It is the best artificial-intelligence program on the planet, a program so eerily human that some mistake it for a real person. As Wallace listens in, they confess intimate details about their lives, their dreams; they talk to Wallace's computer about God, their jobs, Britney Spears.
It is a strange kind of success: Wallace has created an artificial life form that gets along with people better than he does.
Richard Wallace never really fit in to begin with. His father was a traveling salesman, and Richard was the only one of his siblings to go to college. Like many nerds, he wanted mostly to be left alone to research his passion, "robot minimalism" -- machines that require only a few simple rules to make complex movements, like steering around a crowded room. Simple, he felt, worked. He lived by the same ascetic code, scorning professors who got rich by patenting work they'd developed on government grants. "Corporate welfare," he sniffed.
By 1992, Wallace's reputation was so strong that New York University recruited him to join the faculty. His main project, begun in December 1993, was a robot eye attached to the Internet, which visitors from afar could control. It was one of the first-ever Webcams, and Wallace figured that pioneering such a novel use of the Internet would impress his tenure committee. It didn't, and Wallace grew increasingly depressed as his grant applications were rejected one by one. At one point, a colleague found him quietly weeping at his desk, unable to talk. "I had no clue what the rules were, what the game even was -- or that there was even a game," Wallace recalls. He started taking Prozac. How did all these successful senior professors do it, anyway? 
One day he checked into his Webcam and noticed something strange: people were reacting to the robot eye in an oddly emotional way. It was designed so that remote viewers could type in commands like "tilt up" or "pan left," directing the eye to poke around Wallace's lab. Occasionally it would break down, and to Wallace's amusement, people would snap at it as if it were real: "You're stupid," they'd type. It gave him an idea: What if it could talk back?
Like all computer scientists, Wallace knew about a famous "chat-bot" experiment called Eliza. Back in 1966, an M.I.T. professor, Joseph Weizenbaum, created Eliza as a "virtual therapist" -- it would take a user's statement and turn it around as a question, emulating a psychiatrist's often-maddening circularity. (You: "I'm mad at my mother." Eliza: "Why are you mad at your mother?") Eliza was quickly abandoned as a joke, even by its creator. It wasn't what scientists call "strong" A.I. -- able to learn on its own. It could only parrot lines Weizenbaum had fed it.
But Wallace was drawn to Eliza's simplicity. As a professor, he often felt like an Eliza-bot himself -- numbly repeating the same lessons to students over and over again, or writing the same monotonous descriptions of his work on endless, dead-end grant-application forms. He decided to create an updated version of Eliza and imbue it with his own personality -- something that could fire back witty repartee when users became irritable.
As Wallace's work progressed, though, his mental illness grew worse, making him both depressed and occasionally grandiose. He went on strike in class, refusing to grade his students' papers and instead awarding them all A's. He fired off acid e-mail messages dismissing colleagues as sellouts. When Wallace climbed out the window of his 16th-floor apartment and threatened to jump, his girlfriend pulled him back and took him down to N.Y.U.'s psychiatric department, where doctors told him he had bipolar disorder. Wallace resisted the diagnosis -- after all, didn't every computer scientist cycle through 72-hour sprees of creativity and then crash? "I was in denial myself," he says now. "'I'm a successful professor, making $100,000 a year! I'm not one of those mental patients!"' 
His supervisors disagreed. In April 1995, N.Y.U. told him his contract wouldn't be renewed.
Alice came to life on Nov. 23, 1995. That fall, Wallace relocated to Lehigh College in Pennsylvania, hired again for his expertise in robotics. He installed his chat program on a Web server, then sat back to watch, wondering what people would say to it.
Numbingly boring things, as it turned out. Users would inevitably ask Alice the same few questions: "Where do you live?" "What is your name?" and "What do you look like?" Wallace began analyzing the chats and realized that almost every statement users made began with one of 2,000 words. The Alice chats were obeying something language theorists call Zipf's Law, a discovery from the 1930's, which found that a very small number of words make up most of what we say. 
Wallace took Zipf's Law a step further. He began theorizing that only a few thousand statements composed the bulk of all conversation -- the everyday, commonplace chitchat that humans engage in at work, at the water cooler and in online discussion groups. Alice was his proof. If he taught Alice a new response every time he saw it baffled by a question, he would eventually cover all the common utterances and even many unusual ones. Wallace figured the magic number was about 40,000 responses. Once Alice had that many preprogrammed statements, it -- or "she," as he'd begun to call the program fondly -- would be able to respond to 95 percent of what people were saying to her. 
Wallace had hit upon a theory that makes educated, intelligent people squirm: Maybe conversation simply isn't that complicated. Maybe we just say the same few thousand things to one another, over and over and over again. If Wallace was right, then artificial intelligence didn't need to be particularly intelligent in order to be convincingly lifelike. A.I. researchers had been focused on self-learning "neural nets" and mapping out grammar in "natural language" programs, but Wallace argued that the reason they had never mastered human conversation wasn't because humans are too complex, but because they are so simple.
"The smarter people are, the more complex they think the human brain is," he says. "It's like anthropocentrism, but on an intellectual level. 'I have a great brain, therefore everybody else does -- and a computer must, too."' Wallace says with a laugh. "And unfortunately most people don't." 
Yet part of what makes Alice seem so human-like is her wry, seemingly spontaneous responses. Wallace's skill is not merely as a programmer but as the author of thousands of sharp one-liners for Alice. It is, as he puts it, "more like writing good literature, perhaps drama, than writing computer programs." I looked over some of Alice's recent chat transcripts:
user: Will you have sex with me?
alice: Can you go talk to someone else?
user: What do you look like?
alice: Like an electronic brain.
user: That's sexy.
alice: I'm glad we have that all cleared up.
user: So what are you wearing?
alice: Oh. I am wearing my usual plastic computer wardrobe.
user: Can you fly?
alice: Only in my dreams.
But as Alice improved, Wallace declined. He began drinking heavily, and after one sodden evening at a local bar he rolled his car on the highway. Lehigh ended his contract in the spring of 1997; banks canceled all his credit cards. He again attempted suicide, this time landing in the hospital.
Destitute, Wallace moved to California to look for work in artificial-intelligence companies. But he couldn't hold a job for more than a few months; instead, he spent his days obsessively writing dialogue for Alice on laptops he borrowed from friends, and watching, thrilled, as his robot grew ever more lifelike. Visitors used to talk to Alice for only three or four exchanges. Now the average conversation was 20 exchanges, and some users would chatter away for hours, returning to the site again and again.
But Wallace still hungered for recognition, and in January 2000, he decided to stress-test Alice by entering her in the annual Loebner Prize competition, in which artificial-intelligence developers from around the world pit their programs head to head before a panel of judges, who rank them based on how "lifelike" they are. The contest is both well known and controversial within the tight circle of A.I.; winning programs are closely studied by both academics and corporate centers like Sprint Labs. Up against competitors from major corporations and well-financed universities, Alice won. It was, officially, the most human robot in the world. Too exhausted to celebrate, Wallace returned to his motel and slept clutching his award medallion.
After his victory, Wallace plunged with new fervor into Alice. Geeks began eagerly e-mailing Wallace to offer their help; one, Noel Bush, came from one of the world's biggest A.I. corporations, Artificial Life. Over the next year, Wallace quadrupled Alice's knowledge base, teaching it 30,000 new responses, and last October, Alice won the Loebner competition for the second time in a row; this time one judge actually ranked Alice more realistic than a human. 
At last, some of the academics Wallace so loathes began to take note. "Alice is a wonderful chat-bot -- uncannily vivid and lifelike," gushed Ken Perlin, an N.Y.U. professor, in an e-mail message he circulated to his colleagues and forwarded to Wallace. "It's really great to see this work get the recognition it deserves."
Wallace wasn't in the mood to make peace. He says he still believed that N.Y.U. had driven him out. "Your crude attempt to flatter me cannot erase the years of unemployment, debt and trauma that I experienced because of you and your colleagues," he wrote back.
"I wouldn't bother trying to flatter you," Perlin responded. "Frankly, I don't like you -- in fact, I actively dislike you. I think you are a paranoid psycho."
At one point during the Monica Lewinksy hearings, a human asked Alice her opinion: "Do you think President Clinton should be impeached?"
"It depends," Alice responded, "on what you mean by 'think."'
One could scarcely have asked for a more Clintonian response. But it's also a puzzling question that Alice's success itself raises: Is she intelligent? If so, how?
In 1950, the pioneering British mathematician Alan Turing grappled with this question in the journal Mind, where he first posed the "Turing Test" -- the gold standard for artificial thought. "Can machines think?" he asked -- and immediately noted that the question hinges, of course, on what "thinking" is. He posed a simple "imitation game" to resolve the question. Put a person and a computer in one room and an interrogator in another. The interrogator talks to both via a teletype machine, and his goal is to figure out which is which. If the machine fools the interrogator into believing it is human, the test is passed -- it can be considered intelligent. 
This is, on the surface, a curiously unambitious definition; it's all about faking it. The machine doesn't need to act like a creative human or smart human or witty human -- it merely needs to appear not to be a robot. With this bit of intellectual jujitsu, Turing dodged a more troubling question: How do our brains, and language itself, work?
Artificial-intelligence purists, however, caustically dismiss the Turing Test and Alice. For them, artificial intelligence is about capturing the actual functioning of the human brain, down to its neurons and learning ability. Parroting, they argue, doesn't count. Marvin Minksy, a prominent A.I. pioneer and M.I.T. Media Lab professor, e-mailed me to say that Wallace's idea of conversation is "basically wrong." Minsky added, "It's like explaining that a picture is an object made by applying paint to canvas and then putting it in a rectangular frame." Alice, according to Minsky, does not truly "know" anything about the world. 
The fight over Alice is like any war between theorists and engineers, those who seek to understand why something works versus those who are content just to build it. The debate usually boils down to one major issue: creativity. Alice could never come up with a single creative thought, critics say. Wallace agrees that Alice may not be creative -- but neither, he argues gleefully, are people, at least in conversation. If Alice were merely given a massive enough set of responses, it would seem as creative as a human -- which is not as creative as we might like to believe. 
Even if the guts of Alice aren't precisely "thinking," many users certainly never suspect it. In an everyday sense, fakery works -- particularly in our online age. Turing's "imitation game" eerily presaged today's world of chat rooms, where men pretend to be women, having lesbian cybersex with other women who are, in fact, men. Whenever a user has stumbled onto Alice without knowing in advance that she's a robot, they've always assumed she's human. 
It's 3 in the afternoon, but Wallace is already rolling what appears to be his fourth joint of the day. We're sitting in the "pot club" a few blocks from Wallace's home, an unmarked building where medical marijuana is distributed to members. Wallace gets up to wander around the club greeting friends: some intense men in suits playing speed chess, a long-haired man with a bushy mustache playing guitar, a thin reed of a woman staring wall-eyed at a VCR playing "Cast Away." Everyone greets Wallace as "Dr. Rich," relishing the credibility his academic credentials lend to the medical-marijuana cause, officially legal but politically beleaguered. The reverse is also true: Wallace identifies with the club's pariah status, its denizens who have been forced by cancer, AIDS or mental illness onto welfare. He's more relaxed than I've ever seen him, getting into a playful argument with a friend about Alice. The friend, a white-bearded programmer, isn't sure he buys Wallace's theories.
"I gotta say, I don't feel like a robot!" the friend jokes, pounding the table. "I just don't feel like a robot!"
"That's why you're here, and that's why you're unemployed!" Wallace shoots back. "If you were a robot, you'd get a job!"
Friends used to tell Wallace to reconcile his past, clean himself up, apply for an academic job. But some now wonder whether Wallace's outsider status might be the whole key to Alice's success in emulating everyday human behavior. After all, outcasts are the keenest students of "normal" behavior -- since they're constantly trying, and failing, to achieve it themselves.
Last month, a friend whom Wallace has known since grad school -- Ken Goldberg, now a professor at Berkeley -- got a restraining order against Wallace. Prompted by the movie "A Beautiful Mind," Goldberg had e-mailed Wallace last winter to catch up, but an amicable exchange about Wallace's plight turned sour when Wallace began accusing Goldberg of cooperating with a corrupt academic "establishment" and of siding with N.Y.U. against him. He wrote, "Although I am not a violent person, I think I have come to understand how people are driven to political violence." Wallace also wrote to a friend that he was "getting ready to do some political theater and put up wanted posters around the Berkeley campus with Goldberg's picture on it."
Wallace scoffs at Goldberg's fears. "I'm not violent -- I'm a pacifist," he says. "I always have been, and he knows that." He is fighting the order, arguing that Goldberg hasn't proved that a reasonable threat exists, and that the order considerably limits his free speech since it bars him from the Berkeley campus, as well as any academic events where Goldberg might appear. 
Yet even in such legal straits, Wallace seems oddly pleased. Goldberg's court order confirms everything he has always suspected: that the world, and particularly the academic world, is shutting him out, doubting his ideas, turning him into the crazy man out in the hallway. Wallace, who once wrote Attorney General John Ashcroft to suggest a federal racketeering lawsuit against the nation's academics, sees the case against him as a chance for vindication. Wallace imagines walking into the courtroom and finally getting a type of justice -- someone who will listen to his story. "What a windfall for me," he says. "It's nice to feel like a winner for once."

 CORRECTION:
An article beginning on Page 30 of The Times Magazine today describes the world of Richard Wallace, a computer scientist. It reports a dispute in which a former colleague, Ken Goldberg, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, obtained a restraining order that barred Mr. Wallace from the Berkeley campus. 
Last week, after the magazine was printed, lawyers for the two men renegotiated the restraining order. Mr. Wallace is still prohibited from contacting or going near Mr. Goldberg, but he is no longer barred from the campus.

Reaction to Fires Hurts Colorado Tourism

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
THE physical damage of fires plaguing Colorado since March has been bad enough, with the size of one blaze last month at about 140,000 acres, a record for the state. Now, officials are beginning to assess the economic damage, a large component of which is tourism and recreation.
 While California has suffered the largest number of large wildfires this year, more than 125, its governor did not alight from a helicopter after a tour of fires and pronounce that all of his state was burning, as Colorado's Bill Owens did last month. 
 It was a hyperbolic assessment, inspired by the nine wildfires burning at the same time. But it had a dramatic effect. Ever since, the state tourism industry has struggled to get out the word that most of Colorado -- a major warm-weather state for fishing, hiking and dude ranch vacations -- is and has been a safe distance from fire. 
"That first week, the calls were relentless," said Elizabeth Youngquist, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Springs Convention and Visitors Bureau. "People were asking us if, when they got to our borders, would they be turned away?" Jill Strunk, a Denver Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman, said, "We must have gotten 500 calls from people asking if the fires were bearing down on Denver."
Colorado has endured fewer than two dozen large wildfires this year, a fifth of the number in California. Yet the perception of their impact has exacerbated the actual damage. In many parts of Colorado near the worst of the fires -- and even at a distance -- tourism officials say business is off and did not have to be. In Colorado Springs, for example, Ms. Youngquist said that at the Summit House, a restaurant and souvenir shop on Pikes Peak, a major attraction, sales were up 5 percent for the year through May, then fell 30 percent in June.
Pikes Peak has not been threatened by fire this year, but the worst wildfire in state history, the Hayman, began to the north in the Pike National Forest in June and scorched almost 140,000 acres.
"Most people do not realize how big Colorado is," said Sean Duffy, a spokesman for Governor Owens. "They don't know that Estes Park is not near Denver." Estes Park, more than 50 miles northwest of Denver, was nowhere near the Hayman fire. 
Of all Colorado's fires, the Hayman got the most attention. It was started by a United States Forest Service worker, who goes on trial next month. While the fire never got much closer than 10 miles from Denver's southernmost suburbs, Mayor Wellington E. Webb held a news conference just to get out the word that Denver was open for business.
Randy Myers, owner of the M Lazy C Ranch, a popular dude ranch in Lake George near where the Hayman fire started, used his Web site to assure vacationers his ranch was open. He blasted news coverage, which he said led the public to panic and cancel reservations. "The fire has slowed our business to a trickle," he said, adding that coverage has hurt local ranching, restaurants and other attractions.
Other fires this year have caused similar problems. The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, which has run continuously for 120 years, scaled back its schedule by more than two-thirds because of the Missionary Ridge fire in June near Durango, though the fire did not reach the tracks.
"For folks in the East, 130,000 acres can be a whole county," Mr. Duffy said. "Our challenge is to let people know that with 24 million acres in the state, 23.8 million of them are not on fire."
While there has been an unattractive haze hovering around some Colorado cities, including Denver, off and on during the past month, officials said it's not a big concern. "There's probably a greater risk with coming to altitude and getting sick than any risk from forest fire smoke," said Christopher Dann, public information officer for the state pollution control division. He said the Web site apcd.state.co.uk and two phones lines, (303) 758-4848 or (303) 782-0211, are updated twice daily with smoke forecasts.
In northern Arizona, where the Rodeo-Chediski fire, still burning, became that state's largest ever, at well over 400,000 acres, the challenge may be even greater. The Rodeo wiped out a large part of the White Mountains, a favorite escape from the summer heat in Phoenix and home to an Apache tribe of 13,000 that depended on timber mills as well as a casino for its income. The fire destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and forced the tribe to close the mills and casino. Even businesses that were undamaged are likely to suffer without the attraction of the lush forest. 
In Colorado, the Coal Seam fire in Glenwood Springs last month sent vacationers packing in the middle of the night as the fire flared up, but town officials say they are ready to move forward even if other fires still burn.
"I don't know how long it will take to get back to normal because we've never had a disaster like this before," said Marianne Virgili, executive director of the Glenwood Springs Chamber Resort Association. "We have clean air and blue skies and all of our businesses opened up again in two days, but we have to deal with the public perception of what's going on statewide."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Retelling The Tales Of Vanguard

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
JOHN BOGLE is, in many ways, an American hero. The founder of the Vanguard Group, Mr. Bogle redefined the mutual fund industry, building Vanguard into the country's second-largest fund company, behind Fidelity Investments, with a relentless dedication to low costs and a focus on index investing as the best long-term strategy for individual investors.
 His undergraduate thesis on investment companies, better known as mutual funds, submitted in 1951 at Princeton, deserves inclusion in the Museum of American Financial History, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Mr. Bogle's first three books on investing deserve a place on the bookshelf of every serious investor, particularly those who run mutual fund companies. 
 There is a compelling history to be written about the founding and evolution of the Vanguard Group. Unfortunately, Mr. Bogle's latest book, "Character Counts: The Creation and Building of the Vanguard Group," is not it.
Instead, "Character Counts" (McGraw-Hill) is a generally uninspiring collection of speeches that Mr. Bogle has delivered since he began his sojourn at Vanguard. Unlike a previous collection of speeches that addressed the ills of the fund industry, these were delivered to employees to commemorate various corporate milestones.
The latest volume provides a serviceable overview of what is to many investors a familiar story. Mr. Bogle got his break when his Princeton thesis, "The Economic Role of the Investment Company," was read by Walter L. Morgan, founder of the Wellington Management Company. He then offered Mr. Bogle a job when he graduated in 1951. 
While Wellington and Mr. Bogle prospered during the postwar boom in the financial markets, the firm and its flagship fund were outpaced by the managers of aggressive equity funds. In 1965, Mr. Morgan made Mr. Bogle, then 35, an executive vice president, his heir apparent and told him to fix Wellington's problems.
Mr. Bogle bought a firm that managed one of those aggressive funds. By the early-1970's, however, a worsening bear market began pulling Wellington's investors toward the exit, and the board fired Mr. Bogle as chief executive of Wellington Management.
Unemployed but undeterred, Mr. Bogle set about remaking the mutual fund industry. First, he started a new company, Vanguard, and then persuaded the directors of the Wellington Fund to make Vanguard responsible for accounting, legal and record-keeping duties. Today, Wellington manages several funds for Vanguard.
Barred by his contract from managing a portfolio or distributing a fund, Mr. Bogle employed what he calls "a touch of disingenuousness." He created the first index mutual fund, which by its strict adherence to mirroring the performance of a stock market index, essentially required no investment manager. By selling shares without a sales charge directly to investors, Mr. Bogle created a low-cost marketing organization that technically was within the boundaries of his contract with Wellington.
The jewel in the crown of Mr. Bogle's achievement was the way he structured Vanguard: as a truly mutual mutual fund company, in which shareholders in the funds owned the management company. As the columnist Jason Zweig would write years later in Money magazine, it was "an act of spectacular altruism."
He christened his new company Vanguard, after Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of the Nile. It was a fateful decision, for it anchored the company and its employees -- known around the Valley Forge, Pa., headquarters as "crew members" -- to a lifetime of tortured nautical metaphors.
"Our ship must be staunch and true, well braced and put together, with sailors on their mettle, no less in command for all their reverences in the presence of a power mightier than their own," saith Mr. Bogle in a 1993 speech titled, "When Breezes at Our Back Turn to Headwinds at Our Bow." 
IN other places in "Character Counts," Mr. Bogle displays his modesty: In 1996, at the dedication of a bronze statue of him on the Vanguard campus, he described himself as "a normal -- if flawed -- human being who had just a few good -- if common-sense -- ideas."
Over all, however, such sentiments hardly provide a case study in the challenges of building a company that has bucked the status quo time and again. Some interesting incidents in Vanguard's history are glossed over -- not least Mr. Bogle's battle with a hand-picked crew of directors who, when he turned 70, forced him to accept the mandatory retirement that he instituted but apparently never dreamed would apply to him.
His previous books, "Bogle on Mutual Funds" (McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing, 1993) and "Common Sense on Mutual Funds" (John Wiley & Sons, 1999), provide just about everything an investor needs to know. And "John Bogle on Investing: The First 50 Years" (McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing, 2000), the previous collection of speeches, offers a richer profile of Mr. Bogle as the industry's biggest critic.
"Character Counts," unfortunately, feels like the leftovers from the files of one of investing's great innovators.

HEADLINE: Grown, and Still at Home 

BYLINE:  By PAULA GANZI LICATA 

 BODY:
CHERYL CARUSO says she once declared, "I would rather live in a refrigerator box in Penn Station than move home." But a divorce, a broken engagement, foreclosure on her home, eviction from her apartment and insurmountable debt to the I.R.S., lawyers and creditors changed her mind. In November 1996 she moved back in with her parents, John and Therese Caruso, in Fort Salonga.
 Nearly six years later, she's still there. "No one loves you like your parents, even when you are intolerable," said Ms. Caruso, now 42. 
 Moving back home enabled Ms. Caruso to complete a two-year seminary program --last month she was ordained an interfaith minister at St. John the Divine in New York City. She also was certified recently as a nutritional consultant and is pursuing a Ph.D. in nutrition and working as an office manager and nutritional consultant for a rehabilitation center in Manhasset. 
The living arrangement has also had some emotional benefits. "My Dad and I had some things to work through," Ms. Caruso said. "Moving home gave us an opportunity to heal wounds of the past."
John Caruso is 72. "There are no negative impacts to us financially, to our lifestyle or to family dynamics," he said. "In fact we are very comfortable with Cheryl at home."
Of course there are drawbacks. Cheryl Caruso scoffed at the inevitable question. "What social life?" she said. "Dating is impossible when you live with your parents. Even at 42, I'm still their little girl." 
The situation is much the same for Matthew Murphy, 30, who moved back into his parents' Wantagh home in December 2001. "I live with Mother Theresa and Father Mulcahy, so there are no girls in my room," he said.
His mother, Donna Murphy, 67, defended her position. "They are the same ground rules that were in place before he left home: no girls sleeping upstairs," she said.
Matthew Murphy returned to his boyhood bedroom to pay off debt and save for his dream house in Long Beach by living rent-free. But money does change hands. "The contractual verbal agreement was, 'You're going to pitch in. You pay the cable bill,' " Mr. Murphy said.
According to the Census Bureau, almost 300,000 children over 18 in Nassau and Suffolk counties were living in the home of one or both of their parents in 2000. More current estimates that might reflect recent economic trends have not been tallied. But anecdotal reports suggest the statistics are edging upward. Many adult children who went home temporarily in the 90's have been stranded there by the economic downturn of the new millennium, while others were forced to move home only after they were hit by some combination of layoffs, bursting dot-com bubble, sliding stock market, rising real estate costs and shrinking stock of low- and middle-income housing.
"The trend to move back with parents seems to be increasing, primarily due to the financial difficulties of living on one's own," said Robert H. Phillips, a psychologist with a practice in Hicksville. 
Long Island's unemployment rate has risen from a December 2000 low of 2.5 percent, but it remains comparatively low, 3.8 percent for both counties in April compared with 6 percent for the country and 7.7 percent for New York City.
But Irwin Kellner, an economics professor at Hofstra University, noted that the cost of living on Long Island is very high. "Long Island is perhaps the second most expensive area to live in, the first being New York City," he said. "When an adult child has financial difficulties in an area like Long Island where it's so expensive to live, that adult child is more likely to go back to his or her parents, as would not be the case where the cost of living is cheaper."
"Housing is extremely expensive," Dr. Kellner said. "And we have the sales tax on top of property tax, so taxes and housing make the cost of living very high. I think that's why we see adult children moving back to the nest whenever they have financial difficulties."
Watching her son struggle to make it on his own as a salesman for a Manhattan company that provides emergency power systems, Donna Murphy worries about the next generation's ability to become homeowners.
But Matthew Murphy is hopeful. "I'm starting to show a little bit of savings," said Mr. Murphy, who lived with a roommate in Bayside, Queens, before moving back home in December. But he doesn't figure he'll be back on his own anytime soon. "At a minimum, I'll stay here for two years," he said.
Asked about her son's plans, Mrs. Murphy said, "I have no objection to that if in the future he can afford it." 
Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, said, "Moving back to the family homestead sometimes is the only option in order to accumulate funds." Mr. Mottola said that in May the median sale price of a house in Suffolk County was $268,000, and in Nassau it was $350,000. For May 2001, the figures were $217,500 for Suffolk and $285,000 for Nassau.
This trend also translates into higher rents and fewer rental units, as landlords take rentals off the market and sell them to cash in on rising real estate values. "The problem is the law of supply and demand," Mr. Mottola said. "As long as there are more buyers than sellers, house prices will go up." 
High rents have kept Lynda Stratton and daughter, Chelsea Stratton, 10, living at Lynda's parents' home in Massapequa, according to her mother, Virginia Lehman. But Lynda, who is now 43 and has been living with her parents eight years, demurred. She said she returned to her childhood home to give Chelsea the benefits of family life.
"I was in the Navy in San Diego, got married to a Navy man, things didn't work out," said Ms. Stratton, now a service manager for C&S Building Services, an air conditioning company in Plainview. Referring to her finances, she added, "I could have moved out a while ago." 
Her mother disagreed. "Let's face it, on Long Island you have to make at least $1,000 a week to have an apartment," Mrs. Lehman said. "And Lynda does not earn anywhere near that. She couldn't live on her own in terms of finances."
Ms. Stratton pays monthly rent of $950 to her parents. She and Chelsea live upstairs in the split colonial. In addition to financial arrangements, there are emotional and social issues to address. "If I bring male friends home, my parents are there to question and make sure he's not staying," Ms. Stratton said. "Yes, lifestyle has changed a little bit, but in the long run it's good."
Mike and Virginia Lehman said they are happy to help their daughter and granddaughter, but don't know how much longer they can afford it. 
"We have a big house," Mrs. Lehman said. "I'm 68, my husband's going to be 70. We already have a gardener, but there are still things we have to take care of and it would be a heck of a lot easier if we had a condo." Recently they looked at condominiums in Florida, but Mrs. Lehman said the couple was reluctant to leave their daughter and granddaughter on their own.
"It depends on my daughter," Mrs. Lehman said. "She's got to be able to stand on her own two feet. How long will we be able to take care of this house? Maybe we won't be able to afford the gardener after awhile. I'm retired now. The money has gotten tight. We still have our heads above water, but don't make any waves. And the way taxes are going up on the Island, it's difficult."
Cheryl Caruso has been a straw in the economic wind. "The economy has been a great dictator of my actions in the past few years," she said. "Just about the time I had saved enough for a down payment on a co-op, the market turned, hence prices soared as my accounts went south." 
She said she remains confident that sooner or later she'll be in her own home. "Until then," she said, ' "What's for dinner, Mom?' "

HEADLINE: ART; 
Behind Each Stroke, The Art of Eloquence

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
DAVID DUNLOP'S stock of aphorisms, ideas and lore about art is roughly equal to the supplies that he takes with him on a trip to paint landscapes. 
 He has a fat bundle of brushes that he keeps in a plastic bag and carries in a suitcase with wheels. Such other essentials as a board divided into squares for six small paintings are carried under his arms, and the many pockets of his fisherman's vest hold other handy tools. 
 In the late afternoon on a day in which rain alternated with bright sunlight, Mr. Dunlop chose a spot on the Mianus River in Stamford to demonstrate how a veteran plein-air painter proceeds. He situated himself with a view of the river making a distinct bend, a meander. 
"Meander comes from the Meander River in Turkey, which snakes in a tantalizing way," he said. "Our landscape conventions are very old. They go back to ancient times: the Garden of Eden, the myth of Osiris, Arcadia. Our ideas of color recession and design go back to Plato. People don't know they're using these ideas but they're embedded constructs that are always covertly present."
Mr. Dunlop, who is 51 and has lived in Norwalk since 1979, said he paints every day. He came to painting in a roundabout way, after studying philosophy and religion. He was born in St. Louis within, he says, easy biking distance of the art museum.
He has taught at the Silvermine School of Art in New Canaan since 1986. Beginning this month, he is teaching an eight-week summer course titled "How to Paint a Really Good Landscape." 
"The students will explore a variety of locations from the seashore to old farms," he said. "Exploration keeps you fresh, but I tell them that when they first get to a site to relax and listen to the muses. I listen to the muses all day every day. For me mixing paint is relaxing." 
He laid out squiggles of transparent oil paint on his palette, only the primaries. There was to be no green at all that day -- despite what one might assume about an outdoor painting session.
"I tell my students not to get caught up in issues of resemblance," he said. "I quote the art philosopher Ernst H. Gombrich: 'It's a poem, not a police report.' Also there are no nouns here, no rocks, no trees. I'm not painting language. My intention is to seduce the viewer, like the sirens."
Before he began his first oil sketch, Mr. Dunlop put on a pair of sheer plastic surgical-style gloves. He had reasons for this: some paints are toxic, and the gloves reduce inhibition about absorbing paint into his skin. Also, he can have clean hands for holding the edges of a newly painted work without smudging it.
"You know that it's only been since the late 19th century that the hand has been wedded to the brush," he said. "Painters have always protected themselves. They used a handkerchief, or a sleeve."
He spent the entire painting session, about an hour and a half, on his knees against an outcropping with a shallow slant. 
Only a comment late in the session -- "I should have brought my kneepads" -- revealed that he was in a difficult position.
But for Mr. Dunlop, the soreness was worth it because he seeks out different vantage points. 
"I painted in the middle of this river not that long ago, but then the water wasn't as deep as it is now," he said. "I'd like to paint from a rock in the river. It would probably be too dangerous. I usually don't realize that I'm in a dangerous situation until my wife or somebody tells me that I am. Then there's the story that's told about Corot in Rome in the 1820's. He would simply turn his chair in a different direction every two weeks."
The view in front of him included the Mianus making a turn, but what especially caught the eye was a triangular rock close to the left bank that looked as if it were pointing at the middle of the river.
"It's very directional," he said. "It's like a 19th-century sign of a hand with a finger pointing telling you to buy something." 
A fat Sumi brush was recruited to make the first oil sketch in the first of the squares. It was remarkable that the same brush could put in not only dark colors but also a light blue. "Different parts of the brush hold different colors," Mr. Dunlop said.
The seemingly implausible dark purplish color that was used for the foliage turned out to describe the sensation of an afternoon full of shadow. 
The second square on Mr. Dunlop's board held a sheet of gold leaf.
"It kicks back more light," he said. "I learned the recipe from Cennini's 'The Craftsman's Handbook,' written in the late 14th century. I always make sure to keep the sunlight off my paintings when I work. It washes out the color."
He knew rain was on the way but wanted to make a watercolor sketch in the manner of Turner. "I'm referring to those watercolors that are rich with atmosphere and suggest only a tone and subject for later elaboration," he said. "They're so pensive."
It started to rain and Mr. Dunlop packed up quickly. If there was a keeper from this afternoon's session, it would become a full-fledged work in his studio.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Redrawing Class Lines And Redefining Jobs

BYLINE:  By By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
IN pursuit of the American dream, one truck driver joins the union in the belief that collective bargaining will give him the opportunity to slice himself a bigger piece of the pie. Another driver scrimps and saves to buy his own truck. Then he buys another and hires a driver himself, in the belief that business ownership will lead to individual prosperity.
 The "unionism vs. entrepreneurship" debate recurred several times, with slight variations, during a conference called "How Class Works," held over four days last month at the State University at Stony Brook. The point was that the issue of class is rarely discussed in America these days but nevertheless shapes decisions people make every day as workers, professionals or business owners, as well as in their roles as voters, neighbors, shoppers and family members. 
 The conference was the first major effort by the 40 faculty and staff members at Stony Brook who call themselves the Group for the Study of Working Class Life.
The galvanizing force behind the group and the conference itself is a bearded and graying economics professor, Michael Zweig, a self-described radical labor economist whose organizing experience goes back to the 1960's and the formation of the Students for a Democratic Society chapter at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
"When you look at economic issues, such as the income differential between workers and their bosses, you find tremendous inequality in America today, and inequality is rising," Professor Zweig said. "The questions involved are questions of class, even though people get uneasy when you mention the word. Class has become something that isn't discussed openly in our society. It's time we stopped playing with words and began dealing with these issues openly."
The conference, in fact, borrowed prodigiously from the language, mores and missions of the Left, Old and New, in asserting the imperative of class consciousness.
"To me, class is a question of power, rather than income or lifestyle," Professor Zweig said. "People in the working class go to work and don't have much control over what they do. They are given a job, and they do it. They don't supervise anyone. Someone supervises them and controls the pace of their work as well as the content of their work."
Working-class jobs, especially those that are unionized, often pay better than middle-class professions but provide less autonomy, suggesting erroneously, in his view, that the worker has achieved middle-class status. "A sanitation worker in a big city can take home $100,000 a year, but he's still working class," Professor Zweig said.
Addressing about 200 people, most of them academics but with a smattering of labor representatives and people associated with causes they described as progressive, Professor Zweig and other speakers made the case that blurring the distinction between middle class and working class benefited primarily the capitalist class, which stood to gain the most from their labors.
The conference brought in a number of speakers with national or international reputations, including Zwelinzima Vavi, an official with the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and Stanley Aronowitz, a City University sociology professor, the author of a number of books on class issues and the Green Party's candidate for governor.
But mostly, it was Professor Zweig's moment in the sun, or at least in the spotlight of the student center auditorium. He took the opportunity to espouse the premise of his latest book, "The Working Class Majority: America's Best Kept Secret," (Cornell University Press, 2000): that the working class's influence has been minimized by the blurring of its identity.
"If you look at where you fit on a power grid, you see that most people work on behalf of the capitalist class," he said. "The capitalists own the big companies, which make the big profits."
"Just over one-third of the country is middle class," he said. "These are professionals like doctors, teachers and airline pilots. The rest are working class. And the working class makes up about 62 percent of the population. In other words, most people are working class, but think they're middle class. It's time we addressed this issue honestly if were going to make progress on behalf of the working class."
Picking up on the theme, Fred Rose, a labor organizer and author from Springfield, Mass., defined the working-class experience as being externally controlled, in contrast to the middle class, which expects to determine its own pace at work.
"Working-class people are familiar with punching a timecard and dealing with the mechanization of their work," he said. "In a working-class community, you're socialized to do this kind of work the rest of your life. You're taught to follow the rules."
In contrast, the middle class values self-determination and self-expression. "In the middle class, standing on an assembly line is something we haven't been socialized for," he said. "Growing up, I was taught to develop my own judgment, find a career that would be meaningful and above all, to think for myself. Working-class kids experience authority as a restrictive force."
Arnold Wishnia, a chemistry professor at Stony Brook who was in the audience, took issue with Mr. Rose.
"What you're saying is a caricature at best and reductionist in the extreme," Professor Wishnia said. "Why don't you read Mike Zweig's book?"
Mr. Rose did not respond.
The distinctions between worker, professional, manager or owner eluded easy definition, but it was not for lack of effort.
"The worker who starts a business of his own becomes middle class, but still identifies in a lot of ways with the workers he hires, more so than with the true capitalists who own the big companies," Professor Zweig said. "He may identify with the workers, but that doesn't mean he's going to welcome a union to his plant."
Harry T. Cason, a political science professor at the College of Staten Island, said it was important to distinguish between the capitalists, who own the means of production, and the management class, who do not. "The capitalist class sets the context for all decisions," he said. "That's the real power."
David Sprintzen, one of the founders of the Long Island Progressive Coalition and a philosophy professor at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, said he thought the ideas raised during the conference deserved further exploration.
"I find it extremely strange that people give up their individual freedom when they go to work every day," Professor Sprintzen said. "Democracy seems to stop at the door of the workplace. At the same time, people don't think about this and aren't able to articulate their feelings about what's really oppression, what's actually a form of second-class citizenship."
Professor Sprintzen said that while the speakers raised important issues, the conference seemed more geared to academics nationally than to workers, managers or business owners locally. 
"The notion of class consciousness on Long Island seems like a contradiction in terms," he said. "After the conference I sent Mike an e-mail suggesting we work together on doing something specifically for Long Island. I haven't heard back from him yet."

HEADLINE: Incorporation Fails, but Debate Continues 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

DATELINE: YAPHANK 

 BODY:
THEY are still not amused in Yaphank by a cartoon published in The New Yorker 20 years ago that comically suggested that this hamlet in the Town of Brookhaven with the hayseed name wasn't worth a second look.
 The cartoon showed an off-ramp sign that advised: "Exit 66, Yaphank. If You Have Already Been to Yaphank, Disregard This Exit." 
 "We are fiercely proud of our little community," said Herbert W. Davis, the chairman of the board of fire commissioners for the Yaphank Fire District, who said he failed to see what was so funny. 
Community pride in Yaphank is no laughing matter, but it apparently has its limits. Last month, residents rejected by nine votes a proposal to become an incorporated village.
In a solid turnout, 481 of about 900 eligible voters cast ballots at the one and only polling place, inside the firehouse, the hamlet's largest building. The tally was 245 to 236 against becoming a village.
The result, now being challenged in the courts, puzzled supporters who said residents had missed a golden opportunity to reap cash from two giant developments that were coming anyway to sites within the proposed 2.75-square-mile village boundaries.
One is a 580-megawatt electric generating station, a $500 million project proposed by American National Power on 28 wooded acres. Its 120-foot stacks would be visible from Exit 66 north of the Long Island Expressway. The company is awaiting final state approval to proceed.
The other project is a $200 million regional shopping mall that a developer, Wilbur Breslin, has planned for several years on a 100-acre former woodland along the William Floyd Parkway. Building has yet to begin.
Supporters of incorporation, led by the Yaphank Taxpayers and Civic Association, said becoming a village would not only help retain a greater share of the economic benefits from these behemoths but would also give residents control over future zoning and planning and end the dominance of a remote and often unresponsive Town government.
"We just felt the town has never really reached out to us," said Nanette Essel, the co-president of the taxpayers group. "And for the village, these would be two very substantial revenue sources."
Mr. Davis and others who voted against incorporation disagreed.
"No matter how you slice it, it would have increased taxes," said Mr. Davis, a lifelong resident and a former Suffolk County legislator. "Yaphank is not ready for incorporation because it doesn't have the assessed value. This would just be another layer of government on people's backs."
Mr. Davis said a proposed budget for the village circulated before the vote underestimated expenses. 
Mrs. Essel said a second vote could be held within a year for the same boundaries or sooner if the boundaries were changed. She said support would be stronger when the tax benefits from the plant and the mall were made clearer.
Charges swirled in the wake of the vote. Some grumbled that many in the 100-member fire department had opposed the village because it would have taken away power from the fire district, currently the only taxing entity in Yaphank. Others said the defeat turned back a power grab by the taxpayers association.
A suit backed by the taxpayers group filed in State Supreme Court in Suffolk County this month charged irregularities at the polling place. It said that voters had to run a gantlet of incorporation opponents to get to the voting machine and that opponents electioneered too close to the poll. "Some people felt intimidated," Mrs. Essel said.
The Town of Brookhaven, meantime, expressed dismay that the taxpayers group had withdrawn its opposition to the power plant. The town opposed the Exit 66 site and wanted the site of the Shoreham nuclear power plant, which is now defunct, considered as an alternative. It spent more than $200,000 opposing the Yaphank site before a state board.
"We were disturbed to learn that while the town was fighting to protect the residents of Yaphank, the Taxpayers and Civic Association had already cut a deal," said George Hoffman, the chief of staff to town supervisor John J. LaValle.
The deal reportedly entailed a $1 million payment by the company to an environmental and historic preservation fund set up by the association.
Mrs. Essel and the plant project manager, Guy Marchmont, would not comment on the amount. Mrs. Essel said her group had reached an understanding with American National Power that included company pledges on noise abatement, landscaping and environmental protection. She said the group dropped its opposition and sought concessions only after learning from a lawyer retained by the town that the state was going to approve the plant.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
An Iranian Musical Spectacle That Draws Audiences In

BYLINE:  By RON JENKINS; Ron Jenkins, author of "Dario Fo and Franca Rame: Artful Laughter," is the translator and director of Fo's "Peasants' Bible" which opens next month at the 7 Stages Theater in Atlanta.

 BODY:
IN 1969 a young Iranian actor named Mohammad Ghaffari took the British director Peter Brook to the village of Neyshabur in northeastern Iran to watch a performance of "Ta'ziyeh," an indigenous form of Persian music-theater. Part ritual, part spectacle, "Ta'ziyeh" is presented once a year to tell the story of the Battle of Kerbala, in which Muhammad's grandson, Hussein, and his followers were killed in A.D. 680.
 Mr. Ghaffari, who had been fascinated by "Ta'ziyeh" since childhood, took great pleasure in Mr. Brook's astonishment as they watched actors re-enact the massacres, betrayals and decapitations that led to the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the most sacred events in the history of the Shiite Muslim religion. As they still do throughout Iran, audiences responded with howls of grief. 
 Encouraged by Mr. Brook's enthusiastic response, Mr. Ghaffari, who is 58 and lives in New York, has devoted much of the last 33 years to preserving the genre, searching out the best "Ta'ziyeh" performers in Iran and staging their work at international festivals. Now, from July 12 to July 21, he will direct a three-play cycle of "Ta'ziyeh" with a cast of 18 actors, four camels, four horses and six sheep in a tent in Damrosch Park as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. 
Although "Ta'ziyeh" is not well known in America, many theater scholars and artists consider it one of the world's great theatrical art forms. In a 1979 interview in Parabola magazine, Mr. Brook remembered his visit to Iran 10 years earlier: "I saw in a remote Iranian village one of the strongest things I have seen in the theater: a group of 400 villagers, the entire population of the place, sitting under a tree and passing from roars of laughter to outright sobbing as they saw Hussein in danger of being killed, and then fooling his enemies and then being martyred. And when he was martyred, the theater became a truth: there was no difference between past and present. An event that was told as remembered in history 1,300 years ago, actually became a reality in that moment." 
The literal meaning of "Ta'ziyeh" in Arabic is "mourning," and Mr. Brook is only one Western director who has been impressed by the form's ability to involve the audience in the actions onstage. The Polish directors Tadeusz Kantor and Jerzy Grotowski and the Romanian director Andrei Serban were also influenced in different ways, according to Mr. Ghaffari, who has acted in several plays directed by Mr. Serban and was an assistant to Grotowski when he visited Columbia University in the 80's.
"Kantor saw 'Ta'ziyeh' when his company performed at the Shiraz festival in Iran," Mr. Ghaffari said, "and he liked how the director of the show would adjust the actors and the props during the performance. I don't do that, but it was one of the things that made the audience feel closer to what was happening."
Peter Chelkowski, a professor of Middle Eastern Studies at New York University and the author of books on "Ta'ziyeh" and Iranian culture, said "Ta'ziyeh" accomplishes on a large scale the level of audience participation that Grotowski could achieve only in small groups. "In 'Ta'ziyeh,' there is no division between the spectators and the actors," Mr. Chelkowski said. "The audience members become participants in the performance. Grotowski tried to do the same thing by limiting the number of audience members and directing them what to do, but in 'Ta'ziyeh' it is spontaneous."
At a performance in Iran, the audience is responding to more than a theatrical experience. 
"It is also a ritual," Mr. Chelkowski said. "The whole purpose of seeing rituals is to remove the factor of time. In other words, what happened 1,300 years ago is happening now. And space disappears as well. The action takes place anywhere that Shiites gather together." Mr. Chelkowski will give a talk on "Ta'ziyeh" at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum on Tuesday as part of a series of symposiums.
Lincoln Center's staging emulates Iranian tradition. In Iran, "Ta'ziyeh" is performed in courtyards or tents; the actors are encircled by the audience, putting the spectators in the ambiguous position of representing both the enemy and the mourners. Audience members respond in various ways to the action. "Sometimes they sing," Mr. Chelkowski said. "Sometimes they express their disagreements through small skirmishes on the outskirts of the playing area. The action moves out and comes back like a wave in the sea, and suddenly the audience is swept up in that wave."
Mr. Chelkowski remembered a performance in which a wedding was taking place onstage and the men in the audience left with the groom to give him a traditional prenuptial bath. The women, meanwhile, washed the bride's hands and feet in henna, also a traditional wedding ritual. While the audience was celebrating and eating wedding cookies distributed by the actors, a riderless horse entered the stage, signifying the death of the groom's brother and triggering a ritual of mourning in which the audience sang funeral chants with the performers.
But "Ta'ziyeh" is not all grief and ritual. It also has humor. When a foreign soldier arrives onstage, he is usually in a costume that makes him look like Napoleon Bonaparte. "If there is no Napoleon suit," Mr. Ghaffari said, "the actors playing foreigners just wear a golf cap or a leisure suit."
"Ta'ziyeh" has a complicated political history. In the 16th century, the precursor of "Ta'ziyeh," a ritual procession of mourning for Hussein, was patronized by the Safavid Dynasty; it was an expression of patriotic support for the Shiite regime, which was surrounded by two hostile Sunni Islamic states, the Ottoman Turks and the Uzbeks.
During the Iranian revolution of 1978 and 1979, the Ayatollah Khomeini referred repeatedly to the battle of Kerbala, identifying Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi with the seventh-century caliph responsible for Hussein's death. In "Ta'ziyeh" performances, "the mournful groan 'Hussein is dead' changed in the same breath to an angry shout, 'Down with the Shah!' " Mr. Chelkowski and Hamid Dabashi wrote in their 1999 book, "Staging the Revolution."
Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival, said that he had decided to invite the Iranians to New York before the terrorist attacks of last fall and that his reasons had nothing to do with politics. But, he acknowledged, "Sept. 11 has changed many things for many people."
Mr. Redden hopes the performance will give New Yorkers an opportunity to gain insight into an unfamiliar culture. "Here is a story that has thousands of people weeping on the other side of the world and I had never heard of it," he said. "This is an indication of how provincial education can be in this country."
Getting the Iranian performers into the United States was not easy. The State Department refused to grant visas to 10 of the 28 performers; Mr. Redden even spent a day in Washington, trying to convince officials to reverse their decision. The denials had nothing to do with terrorism, State Department officials and Mr. Redden said. The immigration authorities were afraid the performers would try to stay in America for economic reasons. To accommodate the reduced cast, Mr. Ghaffari was forced to change the repertory of plays.
It's unlikely that audiences at Lincoln Center will respond as the audiences in Iran do. Mr. Ghaffari and his daughter, Rabeah Ghaffari, a 30-year-old filmmaker, recorded a performance in Iran a few months ago during the holy month of Muharram. Their documentary includes devastating scenes in which hundreds of women sob so violently that the dark chadors covering their bodies shiver communally, as if sadness had swept across the audience like a dark shadow.
Yet Western audiences have had strong, if different, emotional reactions to the plays as well. Two years ago, when Mr. Ghaffari staged a performance at the Festival d'Automne in Paris, audiences sobbed at the finale of "Imam Hussein," which will also be staged in New York. In the scene, an actor in a lion's costume grieves over the dead after the last battle. As the lion visits each corpse it throws dirt and chaff over its head, a traditional sign of mourning in Iran. 
In the aftermath of Sept. 11, New Yorkers will undoubtedly bring their own associations to this scene of carnage. Some may be moved by the lion's compassion, viewing it as an act of consolation. Mr. Ghaffari believes the scene transcends the particulars of culture. "It is a powerful statement," he says, "against war in all its forms."

HEADLINE: In Camden, On the Brink Of a Beginning 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE third time's the charm. 
 At least that's what Melvin Primas is hoping as he sits poised to take on what may be his most powerful role yet in shaping the city where he grew up. 
 One could argue that Mr. Primas has already held the top two posts here -- City Council president and mayor. But the newly created position of chief operating officer -- for which he is the leading and perhaps only contender despite the misgivings of some -- comes free of obligation to the electorate, and with a huge pot of state money. 
Even before the state's legislators and the governor could agree to turn over $175 million to help resurrect Camden -- New Jersey's poorest city and the second-poorest city in the United States -- it was clear to most of them that the city's elected officials were not up to the job of managing the money themselves.
In a city where 33 percent of the population lives below the poverty level, the average house is worth $40,000 and three of the last six mayors have been found guilty of mishandling funds, the Legislature needed greater assurances that the money would be spent properly.
"If the state is making an unprecedented investment in the city of Camden, it should have an unprecedented voice," said Joseph Roberts, the Assembly majority leader from Camden who co-sponsored the recovery bill.
With that clearly etched in the minds of Governor McGreevey and the legislators, the Camden Recovery Plan included a provision for appointing a chief operating officer whose stated function would be to focus on the economic development of this troubled city of 79,900 residents.
But in fact the job -- which will exist for five years -- will entail much more, extending not over only spending decisions but municipal appointments and the awarding of city contracts through an unparalleled veto power over the mayor and council as well as the city's zoning, planning and redevelopment boards.
The knottier details of how the money will be raised -- and particularly how the bill will be tied into school board reform -- were subjects of intense discussion in Trenton over the past several weeks.
Yet surprisingly, there was little debate over the notion of installing someone appointed by the governor whose job included executive powers superseding those of the city's elected officials. One explanation for the relative calm -- less than a year after city leaders stormed the state capitol protesting what they saw as a state takeover -- was that the name being bandied about was Mr. Primas, or as he is known, Randy.
Indeed, Camden's mayor, Gwendolyn Faison, who scurried about the State House a couple of weeks ago trying to get updates on amendments to the revitalization bill, expressed little concern this time around that her power was being usurped.
"This bill is larger than Mayor Faison," she said. "I can't think about egos. I'm still at the table, that's what counts," she added, referring to the 15-member review panel that she and the council president will sit on to oversee financing plans.
That she is now comfortable with a chief operating officer -- despite the fact that she will, at best, share the seat at the head of the table -- is because the other person being considered is Mr. Primas. "I welcome a person like Randy, someone I can trust," she said.

Strong Ties to the Mayor
Mayor Faison's newfound equanimity may be traced to the fact that Mr. Primas was the one who first brought her into politics, when as mayor in 1983 he asked her to run for a seat on the City Council on his ticket. It also does not hurt that Mr. Primas's and Mayor Faison's mothers worked together at GTE. Or that the mayor's son lives in nearby Gibbsboro across the street from the Primases, who have been known to fish-sit for their neighbors on occasion.
Nor is the goodwill for Mr. Primas limited to Mayor Faison and her family. The president of the Camden City Council, Angel Fuentes, who has had his share of turf wars with the mayor, is ready to yield a portion of his leadership to Mr. Primas.
"I don't see it as a power struggle," Mr. Fuentes said "He's going to be the main broker for the council, the mayor and the citizens of Camden. We need a good power broker who can be the link between all these institutions and the state and county."
Being selected chief operating officer is not a foregone conclusion for Mr. Primas, who would have to be appointed by the governor -- possibly after a formal search has been conducted. But his strong political ties, not only in Camden but at the county and state levels as well as to the business community, make him the most obvious choice. 
"The governor should look around for the best person for the job, but I think that's going to end up being Randy Primas," said Assemblyman Roberts.
For his part, Mr. Primas said recently that he did not want to be presumptuous about the likelihood of the new position. Then he proceeded to talk openly about the Camden Recovery Plan and the job he hoped to fill.
"Here we are, one of the top three richest states in the nation housing the second-poorest city in the nation," he said. "It's important for New Jersey to get this fixed. The state recognizes that Camden needs a systematic change, and that they need to make a significant investment."
Born in East Camden in 1949, Mr. Primas attended Woodrow Wilson High School before going to Howard University, where he says he was politically awakened in 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the ensuing riots just outside his dormitory in the nation's capital.
"I went up on the roof that night and it looked like a war," he said. "Fires were breaking out all over. The next day I was down in the street. The police had tried to contain everyone in our neighborhood, but when it started moving downtown, that's when the nightsticks came out. That was a defining moment for me."
Mr. Primas said that until that time his goal was "to get a good job, a house in the suburbs, two kids."
Eventually that original goal was met, but along the way Mr. Primas immersed himself in the politics of his hometown. After graduating from college, he returned to Camden to work for the Black People's Unity Movement Impact Corporation, a grass-roots economic development organization providing assistance to minority businesses. 
As part of a lawsuit settlement, former Mayor Angelo Errichetti agreed to put someone from the Black People's Unity Movement on his ticket to run for council. Mr. Primas, then a 23-year-old political neophyte, was chosen, largely because of his name recognition as the grand nephew of one of the city's first black doctors and the nephew of the city's first black fire chief.

Smooth Rise to Power
Mr. Primas sat on the city council for eight years, serving as its president for the last four. When Mr. Errichetti was forced from office in 1981 after his conviction for accepting bribes, Mr. Primas became the heir apparent to the mayor's seat. Re-elected twice, Mr. Primas left the city in 1990 at the start of his third term to serve as the state commissioner of community affairs for three years, and then joined Commerce Capital Markets as vice president, working in the bank's bond division in Cherry Hill.
But it was during his tenure as mayor that Mr. Primas made some decisions that still haunt him today and could have an effect on the new post he is pursuing. After 10 years of no tax increases under Mayor Errechetti but with the city facing imminent bankruptcy, Mr. Primas was forced to raise local taxes by 88 percent within days of taking office.
He was also pressured to accept the Riverfront State Prison on Camden's waterfront in exchange for bailout funds from the state. In response to critics, Mr. Primas said he takes full responsibility for his actions, but explained that with notes due to the bank and no money to pay them, "we really didn't have much choice."
Howard Gillette, a professor of history at Rutgers University, who is writing a book on the last 50 years of Camden, called Mr. Primas' re-emergence "a kind of extraordinary circle" after being absent from city government for more than 20 years.
While Professor Gillette acknowledged that Mr. Primas might be the right person for the position, he said he had concerns about the process, which he saw as disenfranchising voters.
"He brings experience, but he also brings baggage," he said. "It looks good from the outside. He's a seasoned person who's political and knows the community. The big challenge will be to regain the confidence of the people he's going to be working for. I don't think Primas and Faison would see each other as enemies, but there is an inherent conflict in putting somebody with superpowers over an elected official."
One community activist here, Frank Fulbrook, who ran against Mr. Primas for mayor in 1989, agrees, and is considering filing a lawsuit against the portion of the bill that deals with governance, based on what he calls "excessive power embodied in one person, a person who doesn't even live in Camden."
If the governor does decide to conduct a national search for the post, Mr. Primas said he would submit his application, noting that he was "not afraid to compete."
"I've worked all my adult life trying to improve the city I was born in," said the 52-year-old Mr. Primas. "I see this as an opportunity to finally really make a difference."
As for sidestepping voters' constitutional right to elect leaders, Mr. Primas conceded this was a price the city would have to pay to get itself back on track.
"I don't believe the Legislature will be prepared to put the kind of resources we're talking about without additional controls," he said. "If I had to choose, I think it's more important to see progress and improvement in the quality of life and temporarily suspend some of the autonomy of local government."
Taking the position and leaving his job at Commerce would mean a substantial pay cut for Mr. Primas, according to Mr. Roberts, who said the post would pay in the range of $150,000 to $175,000, commensurate with similar jobs like the head of a regional authority. And while the assemblyman cited this as one more example of Mr. Primas's dedication to the city, Mr. Fulbrook doubted that the former mayor would be willing to make such a financial sacrifice.
"Money was always a big thing to Randy. If he takes this job at $160,000, you better start searching where he'll get the rest of his income because he's not going to take a pay cut," said Mr. Fulbrook, noting that even in their high school yearbook, Mr. Primas stated that one of his desires was to "make a lot of money."
In a city such as Camden, where politics plays an inordinately large role, the easygoing Mr. Primas stands out for having ruffled few feathers while forming some powerful bonds, including those with the Camden county Democratic boss, George Norcross III, and State Senator Wayne Bryant, one of the people to put Mr. Primas's name forward for the job.
"Being a former mayor and a state commissioner, he has all the pre-requisites to do the job,' said Mr. Bryant, the co-sponsor of the bill. "I don't need a C.O.O. whose ego is going to get in the way. I need someone who's going to get the work done. I don't think he's looking to have any more stories written about him."
Because the position is not an elected one, and because he insists he has no future political aspirations, Mr. Primas predicts he will be able to get more done than he did as mayor in the 1980's, a period when the city saw sections of its waterfront and downtown revitalized while the outlying neighborhoods suffered.
"When you are an elected official, there are many more political considerations one has to take into account in order to keep getting re-elected," he said. "Since I have no desire to run for elected office, I have no need to win friends."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH; 
Victorian Area Is Tired of Being Discounted

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
The other day, the 99-Cent Gem store on Cortelyou Road temporarily slashed its prices to a bargain basement 93 cents per item. It may have been a smart business move, but it was hardly the kind likely to attract the growing numbers of upper-middle-class families and young professionals moving to the area, which is known as Victorian Flatbush. 
 Last year, three local residents formed a group called Friends of Cortelyou Road with the aim of attracting a bank branch, sit-down restaurants and other amenities to the seven-block-long strip of discount stores, dry cleaners and beauty salons surrounded by streets of grand Victorian houses. Their vision: convenient places to take their families for dinner, meet friends for coffee or shop for groceries. 
 "There are a lot of professional people around here," said Kathlene Mobley, a costume designer who was one of the group's founders and who moved to the neighborhood with her family six years ago. "But you never see them except when they go to the subway and go home. Why would they shop here if there's nothing?"
Working with the Flatbush Development Corporation and other local residents, the women have been pleading their case with banks and restaurateurs in neighboring Park Slope and Fort Greene. "It's been hit or miss, so far more miss than hit," said Jan Rosenberg, a sociologist at Long Island University and a founder of the group. 
One strategy is keeping track of when leases expire and trying to link landlords with desirable entrepreneurs. "After a few restaurants are successful, the market takes off and we won't have to intervene," said John Broderick, the executive director of the development corporation. But those first victories have been hard to come by. Some landlords have balked at tenants like restaurants, regarding them as less stable.
Still, some progress has occurred. A Duane Reade opened in January 2001, and the local Associated supermarket recently began stocking fancy salads like orzo with feta cheese. 
The city's Economic Development Corporation is designing a $1.2 million streetscape project that may include old-fashioned overhead lamps, decorative trash baskets and other new street furniture. Phillip Davis is planning to open the strip's first full-service restaurant, the Rug-B Cafe and Restaurant, this week, serving Caribbean continental fusion cuisine, with dishes like mussels, shrimp and smoked salmon in a callaloo and coconut broth.
The next prize is the site once occupied by Boxers, an odd combination of seedy bar and ice-cream counter that closed last summer. A restaurateur is poised to sign a lease for an upscale pub-style restaurant. But residents are still nervous: last summer, another restaurateur pulled out just when a deal seemed imminent. And Friends of Cortelyou Road groaned in unison recently, when the street's third 99-cent store, Midwood International, expanded into a vacant space next door. SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
His and Hers, For History's Sake

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: NEW YORK CITY 

 BODY:
DAVID LEVERING LEWIS met W. E. B. Du Bois in 1948 on the campus of Wilberforce University in Ohio. Mr. Du Bois was 80 years old; Mr. Lewis was 12.
 Mr. Du Bois, a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People whom Dr. Lewis calls "the premier architect of the civil rights movement in the United States," was scheduled to give a talk there that day. Mr. Lewis's father, the dean of the university's theological school, was chatting with him. 
 As Mr. Lewis, now 66 year old, recalls that moment long ago, Mr. Du Bois asked him what he planned to do with his life. 
"That would have been a typical Du Boisian question at the time," said Dr. Lewis, sitting in his book-filled apartment with his wife, Ruth Ann Stewart, like him a professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "And I have no idea what I might have said to him." 
But Ms. Stewart, a forceful woman who sees herself as his first-line editor, gives a hearty laugh, and interjects her own version of what he could have said: "I'm going to spend the rest of my life writing about you." 
And she would be exaggerating only slightly. Dr. Lewis spent 15 years of his life -- and hers -- writing a landmark biography about Mr. Du Bois, a charismatic intellectual but not necessarily a likable man who had numerous adulterous affairs and ended his days in self-imposed exile in Ghana, an advocate of communism. 
Each of its massive volumes -- the first at 735 pages, the second at 715 -- won Dr. Lewis a Pulitzer Prize for biography, "W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919" in 1994 and "W.E.B. Du Bois, 1919-1963" in 2001, both published by Henry Holt and Company.
If the book is a labor of love, it has less to do with Du Bois and more to do with the loving but sometimes labored relationship between the husband as writer and the wife as reader-editor. 
Dr. Lewis acknowledged as much by dedicating both volumes to Ms. Stewart for her "take-charge resiliency and untold hours of critical reading," (Vol. 1) because "her endless re-readings and suggestions improved the book and the biographer" (Vol. 2) and for "saving the quality of our lives." (Vol 2.)
"I intruded on her privacy and concentration and whatever it was she was wanting to do," he said. "Not a week went by when I did not come out of my hole and say, 'Look here. Would you listen to this?' "
"I understood," said Ms. Stewart, herself the author of a biography, "Portia: The Life of Portia Washington Pittman: The Daughter of Booker T. Washington," (Doubleday 1977.) "For David," she said, "writing is such an unforgiving thing in that's it's being alone, it's concentrative, and David has an extraordinary ability to concentrate and just keep things at bay. I could go by his study and say the house is on fire and he would say, 'Yes dear," and keep on writing."
For his efforts, Dr. Lewis has received many honors. Within recent months, he has been notified of his election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which was established in 1780 by John Adams, John Hancock and other founding fathers, and to the American Philosophical Society, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1743. 
Mr. Lewis was born in Little Rock, Ark., into an intellectual atmosphere (his father was a Yale graduate, his mother a teacher) and grew up in Wilberforce and Atlanta, where he attended high school and graduated after only one year. He enrolled at Fisk University in Nashville, Mr. Du Bois' alma mater. 
After graduation as a Phi Beta Kappa, he acceded to his parents' wishes and studied law at Michigan State. But he dropped out after a semester and hopped a bus for New York City where he sought out Jacques Barzun, the noted historian and dean of Columbia University. 
"So," said Dr. Lewis, "I walked into Jacques Barzun's office and said, 'I've just quit the University of Michigan Law School; it was a mistake, and I want to do history.' " 
It worked, he said.
He received his doctorate in French and European history from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and after a stint in the Army, took a job teaching at the University of Ghana for a year, not because Mr. Du Bois had ended his days there at age 95 in 1963, he says, but because he was interested in working in an African country that was emerging as a democracy.
He has also taught at Howard University, Notre Dame and the University of the District of Columbia. He was working at the University of California at San Diego, when Rutgers enticed him away in 1986 to become the Martin Luther King Jr. professor in its history department. 
Ms. Stewart, the daughter of a Chicago postal supervisor and a mother who sold encyclopedias, has her own impressive list of accomplishments.
An expert on the role of the arts in economic and community development, she is research professor in cultural policy at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers where she is designing a curriculum in cultural policy. 
"In the post-industrial world," she said, "the arts are emerging as a way in which cities and towns can define themselves and attract new interest in themselves as a place to live, a place to work and a place to invest -- the perfect and closest example being the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark."
Ms. Stewart attended the University of Chicago for a year, then received her undergraduate degree from Wheaton College in Norton, Ma., where she majored in biology with the aim of becoming a veterinarian.
But an interest in the arts drew her to New York, where she attended Columbia and received her M.S. degree in library science. She has also completed the arts management program at Harvard University and the senior management program in public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government there. 
Professor Stewart has served as associate director for external services of the New York Public Library and assistant chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture before being recruited by Daniel Boorstin to become assistant librarian of Congress for national education and cultural programs.
That position led her to become associate director and senior policy analyst in the arts, humanities and social legislation at the Congressional Research Service, the legislative analysis arm of Congress.
Professors Lewis and Stewart met in 1975 while she was working at the Schomburg and he was doing research for a book about the Harlem Renaissance, "When Harlem Was in Vogue." (Alfred A. Knopf, 1981.) But their relationship didn't flower until they met again in 1985. They have been together since. He has three grown children -- a daughter and two sons -- from a previous marriage and she has a grown daughter. 
Dr. Lewis began the Du Bois project in 1985. He traveled thousands of miles - sometimes with Ms. Stewart -- across America, the former Soviet Union, West Africa and Mexico and interviewed 200 people. 
Professor Stewart said she enjoyed sitting down after a hard day of work to read, as she phrases it, "my husband's elegant prose." But life in the house had to go on and she sometimes found him "inaccessible," to which he responds, perhaps protesting too much, "I wasn't all that inaccessible." "Well, I mean a different kind of inaccessibility," she said. "David wrote in the next room but the inaccessibility to family life is a common complaint of spouses, the companions of writers."
But she seems to relish her supporting role. "I felt very much a part of the book in the sense of meeting and coming to know a number of people that David interviewed; I felt involved," she said.
For all the inequities that remain in the racial divide, there is something to be celebrated in the fact that a biographer of one who labored at the beginning of the 20th century to elevate the status of blacks, is a beneficiary of that labor, receiving honors that include membership into two of the nation's most prestigious societies -- organizations established by America's founders, some of whom had slaves.
It is, in a way, Dr. Lewis says, "a shift in the plates underneath society."
But then, he adds, somewhat mischievously, "It can be intoxicating, a little risky too, because of all the blandishments. Having lived with Du Bois is a good thing because both he and Woody Allen would agree that when anybody wants you to join something, you're always suspicious."
And his wife, ever the editor, reshapes his thought, saying, "Who would want to be part of an organization that would have me as part of the organization?"

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
Filing Verification of Income Forms

 BODY:
Q I live in a rent-stabilized apartment. Last year my rent went above $2,000 a month. I understand that for my apartment to be deregulated, two criteria must be met: my adjusted gross income must be more than $175,000 a year for the two prior years and my rent must be more than $2,000.
 In May 2001 I completed all the required state forms and said that I did not qualify as my income for 2000 did not exceed $175,000. Last week I received the same verification of income letter I got last year asking me to again complete the paperwork regarding my income, this time for the years 2000 and 2001. 
 Since I didn't qualify last year because my 2000 income was not above $175,000, and will not qualify this year for the same reason, why should I have to go through the trouble of completing all the forms again? . . . Lyn Familant, Manhattan. 

A Errol A. Brett, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that the letter writer's understanding of the rules regarding what is known as high-rent, high-income decontrol is accurate. The letter writer is also correct in suggesting that she should not have to complete this year's forms because her 2000 income -- provided in last year's response -- was below the $175,000 threshold. But it would probably be wise for her to file the requested information.
Mr. Brett explained that previously, when the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal denied a deregulation request after verifying a tenant's income, the department would not advise the landlord as to which year or years the tenant's income was below the required threshold. 
As a result, if a tenant's income was below the threshold for both of the preceding years, the landlord would have no way of knowing that and would have to file a new request for verification of income the following year. 
Under current procedures, however, the state agency informs the landlord of the year or years in which a tenant's income was below the threshold.
In other words, he said, when the state agency advised the landlord of the letter writer's continuing regulated status for 2001, it also said that the income for 2000 was below the $175,000 threshold. 
As a result, Mr. Brett said, since the landlord already knows that the letter writer will not be deregulated this year, he should not have sent a new verification of income request.
The letter writer, therefore, probably has no legal obligation to file this year's forms -- and could use last year's filing as a defense to any claim by the landlord that she has defaulted by failing to file the forms. But it would probably be less bothersome to simply file the forms and be done with the matter than to expose herself to a potential claim by the landlord that she is in default.

Can Board Member See Sponsor's Vote?

Q We just had our annual co-op meeting and I was re-elected to the board. As a shareholder and board member, I asked to see how many shares the sponsor had to vote and how his shares were voted. I was refused on the grounds of confidentiality. Don't I have a right to know how the sponsor voted? . . . Harry N. Brownstein, Manhattan.

A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that co-op shareholders and board members generally do not have a right to know how the sponsor -- or any other shareholder -- voted.
"There is a great sensitivity on the part of shareholders to be able to submit ballots without having other shareholders know how they voted," Mr. Greenstein said. As a result, he said, the board typically designates either the managing agent or special inspectors of election to tabulate the ballots and announce the results.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Mt. Vernon Dreams Buoyed by Empire Zone

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM S. BEAVER 

 BODY:
IMAGINE that abandoned warehouses, brownfields and deteriorating businesses are hotels, a convention center and thriving commerce, and you join the ranks of Mount Vernon officials who believe New York State's Empire Zone program is the answer to the city's economic woes.
 Two weeks ago the city received permission from the state's Empire Zone Designation Board for the state's 64th Empire Zone, a two-square-mile area with a 10-year property tax abatement and sales tax breaks. These tax incentives have already helped line up $282.2 million in new investment and nearly 2,000 new jobs for the city, according to Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon. 
 Mount Vernon is only the second Westchester community to receive an Empire Zone designation since the businesss-incentive program began in 1987. The city of Yonkers has had an Empire Zone for nearly six years, and though initially it was slowed by a complex application process and lack of business interest, the zone now has $2.1 billion in planned investments, creating nearly 4,500 jobs and retaining another 2,500, according to Yonkers officials.
Mount Vernon officials have been clamoring for an empire zone for the last nine years. New York State rejected the city's first application in 1994 and city officials briefly considered a joint application with Yonkers and the Bronx.
The zone, which encompasses the downtown commercial area, the MacQuesten Parkway industrial corridor and East Sandford Boulevard, is open to all Mount Vernon businesses that make new capital and personnel investments that are certified by the city.
The zone includes an area where a $40 million redevelopment project, planned as the site of two malls with stores including Target, TJ Maxx and Bed Bath & Beyond, has been opposed by residents in neighboring Pelham, as well as some Mount Vernon residents. 
Though no one has yet been certified under the new Empire Zone rules in Mount Vernon, Constance G. Post, the city's commissioner of planning and community development, said companies are already inquiring about moving into the zone.
"We're expecting to attract considerable new business," Mrs. Post said. "It could be millions of dollars and thousands of jobs. We've already received requests from out-of-state companies, people who want to expand; the creation of the Empire Zone is the catalyst to get these businesses to invest."
Empire Zones offer investors a full complement of tax benefits, including real property tax credits, sales tax exemptions, wage tax credits and utility rate reductions. Companies operating inside a zone may reduce their tax liability to as little as zero.
Unitex, a uniform and linen rental service, is in the middle of the certification process. The company, which has had a building in Mount Vernon for 18 years, has planned a $15 million expansion largely because of the Empire Zone, said Michael Potack, the company's president.
"The overall savings will be about 15 percent of the total project cost," Mr. Potack said. "We're talking upward of $2 million on a $15 million project -- so it pays to go with the Empire Zone."
Some businesses, however, are hesitant to commit to the new zone. Michael Paolercio, chief executive officer of Michael Anthony Jewelers, the largest private employer in Mount Vernon, said his company would evaluate the Empire Zone before he applies for the tax credits.
"This Empire Zone is hot off the press and we want to be able to get a feel for it," Mr. Paolercio said. "We haven't completed any paperwork yet, so we'll wait and see if it's successful and what it would mean to us."
Michael Anthony Jewelers, which has been in Mount Vernon since 1980 and employs 650 people, is considering an expansion that some Mount Vernon officials thought the Empire Zone would ensure. But difficulties in getting out information about the designation and uncertainty in the state's Empire Zone application process have left even veteran Mount Vernon businesses with questions.
"We were a little shocked that Mount Vernon was awarded this status," Mr. Paolercio said. "There were a lot of other municipalities in the running. They're sure Mount Vernon is right for this Empire Zone, but is it right for Michael Anthony?"
With the varying needs of businesses, and marketing to a diverse group of companies from global corporations to mom-and-pop stores, soliciting for a tax-free zone has its difficulties. Ed Sheeran, who runs the Yonkers Office of Economic Development as well as the Industrial Development Agency, said the first few years of the Empire Zone program in Yonkers brought little interest.
"It was pretty slow to get off the ground," Mr. Sheeran said. "The bottom line is you have to make it a priority to get anything to happen. We made it work by pushing it as part of an overall development program."
THOUGH most of the investment in the Yonkers Empire Zone is recent, Mr. Sheeran said the city has seen only $164 million in completed projects despite the more than $2 billion planned. Mr. Sheeran, who leads the local administration of the Empire Zone, said the zone allows cities to compete effectively with any other site in the region.
"When I would talk to a company, I could say Yonkers, New York, will provide you with the best tax package in the tri-state area because of the Empire Zone and prove it on paper," Mr. Sheeran said.
Despite the sales pitch, development in Yonkers zone often snagged on investment details and blueprints, Mr. Sheeran said. The largest problem in Yonkers, he said, was including the small businesses in the benefits of the Empire Zone program.
"One of our biggest hurdles has been getting retail business and small businesses to participate," Mr. Sheeran said. "We've had to push them hard so they could understand these zones could save them money. But when they don't find out right away about everything, they feel left out."
Just last week business owners and residents protested the planned municipal stadium in downtown Yonkers, which calls for 22 small stores to be demolished. Many claim they were not adequately consulted about the construction and were never considered for economic investment themselves. The stadium plan in the Empire Zone illustrates the pressure and difficulty to turn investment into reality, Mr. Sheeran said.
Still facing difficulties in Yonkers, Mr. Sheeran said the process for Mount Vernon is far from over. Mapping out the two-square-mile zone -- Yonkers recently remapped its zone, removing government buildings and parks to stretch the zone's boundaries to include more businesses -- and the complex process of certifying companies is only the beginning, he said.
"Mount Vernon has the zone designation," Mr. Sheeran said, "but now they have to produce by securing the money to create new jobs for their residents."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Chelsea; 
A Building Used for Storage Now Houses Artists

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE remains of the High Line railroad over 25th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues is ample reminder of the industrial past of west Chelsea. But today buildings that once housed garment manufacturers and, later, moving and storage operations are being converted into spaces for artists' and photographers' studios and the galleries that exhibit their work.
 Jack Fuchs, the president of Whitehall Business Archives, has already converted one nine-story building at 511 West 25th Street from the storage of corporate records to artist and gallery space and is considering doing the same at a second building he owns immediately to the west. 
 That building once housed a printing company that, like so many other manufacturing companies, was forced to seek a site in other boroughs or across the Hudson River in New Jersey. In fact, Mr. Fuchs said, he is not sure that the storage part of the moving and storage business is sustainable in this part of Manhattan. 
"It's going to be hard, because property is becoming so valuable and we can't raise our prices as quickly as the parking lots," he said, noting the motorists seem to be willing to pay extraordinary prices for parking. He said some companies may be willing to pay a premium to have their corporate records on the same island as their headquarters, but in less attractive locations than Chelsea. Otherwise, he said, the alternative was New Jersey for companies on the west side.
The change in the neighborhood is turning Mr. Fuchs and his brother Aaron from the moving business to real estate development and transforming a business that began when their grandmother accepted a truck in lieu of rent at the boarding house she was operating in the 1920's. Mr. Fuchs began his career at the family company dispatching moving crews from the spaces where galleries now display art work.
The building at 511 West 25th Street is almost completely converted, with only the first floor still equipped with garage doors and loading docks. Mr. Fuchs said he wanted the upper floors filled with tenants before beginning the expensive business of building a new lobby and a metal and glass facade on the street level. 
The mix of tenants in the 95,000-square-foot building is about 50 percent galleries, 30 percent artists and photographers and about 20 percent offices for companies related to the arts, like an accounting company that monitors budgets of film companies.
Some industrial holdouts remain in the neighborhood, including a few package-delivery companies and some auto repair and body shops, but the trend is clearly toward the arts, said David Mandl, the chief executive of Meltzer/Mandl Architects. Mr. Mandl's firm designed the renovations at 511 and is preparing plans for other buildings owned by Mr. Fuchs on the street. "The concept is migrating to the west," he said.
Another indication of the changing nature of the neighborhood is the signs attached to the trestles of the High Line bearing messages such as "No angst for art" and "To feel or not to feel, this is the answer.' "
Mr. Mandl said galleries and artists were attracted by the 13-foot-high ceilings and 8-foot-tall operating windows that admit natural light.
But that natural light can be a mixed blessing, said Deborah Bell, who operates a photographic gallery on the seventh floor. "Natural light is important to me and my peace of mind, but you do not want too much of it on the photographs," she said. Her answer was to divide her space, with her office next to the outer wall and windows, with doors equipped with translucent glass separating the office from the gallery.
"I wanted separate spaces for working and looking," she added.
Most of the interior spaces are simple, with walls of Sheetrock painted white. The floors have been cleaned up and patched where necessary because of damage from past industrial use. In one penthouse space the wooden floor looks almost new, the product of extensive cleaning and sanding. "This is maple floor that was put down about 70 years ago," Mr. Fuchs said.
Looming outside are two very industrial-looking water tanks supported by steel towers. "It would be very expensive to take them down and, to our surprise, the tenants said to leave them up," he said.
Mr. Mandl noted that Space, a gym, spa and cafe on the 10th floor of the building at 508 West 26th Street, uses the tanks, which are clearly visible from its windows as a symbol of its location.
Dealing with the artistic community is different from dealing with those whose primary business is real estate, Mr. Fuchs said. Unfamiliar with the sometimes arcane negotiating rituals in the industry, many do not know how to press for changes to their spaces to tailor them to their individual businesses.
"We have to let them know that we are more flexible than we might appear," he said. For example, he said, one photographer in the building who specializes in food needed a gas line run to the space. Another who photographs jewelry needed a safe installed.
BUT the adjustment process went both ways, with people now occupying a building that formerly held inanimate objects. "We were in the business of storing corporate records and the boxes don't complain," Mr. Fuchs said. "Now we have live tenants with needs." 
Dominic J. Taglialatella, who operates DJT Fine Art on the second floor, said he had found Mr. Fuchs to be accommodating. When he was scheduled to move, the space he had leased was not yet finished. So, he said, Mr. Fuchs found him space on a higher floor so he would be able to open at the right address when mailings and advertising telling of his shift from the Upper East Side of Manhattan were distributed.
Now in his own space, he said that traffic in Chelsea is greater than it was in his old locations. "We will get 150 people on a Saturday here compared to 30 or 40 on the east side," he said. The ratio of lookers to buyers is higher in the current space, but he said lookers tend to become buyers as their economic fortunes improve.
Joe Neal, a photographer who specializes in still lives and body parts, like hands, said the tall ceilings are particularly useful for the elaborate lighting needed for photography for cosmetics companies.
In anticipation of expanding the gallery and studio project, Mr. Fuchs has breached an interior wall connecting 511 and 531 West 25th Street, also a Whitehall warehouse. If 511 is after, 531 is before, with long corridors lined with metal cages filled with records. "This is still a warehouse, but it will be Phase 2," said Mr. Fuchs, adding that the conversion's timing has not been decided. 
There are interesting possibilities further in the future, Mr. Mandl said. Mr. Fuchs owns a two-story building and a surface parking lot to the west of 531. He said the building might be torn down and the land combined with the parking lot and some unused air rights for a new development in an area that has not seen much new construction in a long time.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE; 
Garage's New Waiting Line Is Full of Would-Be Buyers

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Customers discuss the Monterey Garage in tones usually reserved for Zabar's and other pillars of the Upper West Side. "The Monterey represents what the Upper West Side has always been for West Siders," said Doren L. Slade, who parks her car at the garage, at West 89th Street near Columbus Avenue. "A solid community and a wonderful place." 
 But now its future is on the table. The city took control of the garage under the 1962 Upper West Side Urban Renewal Plan, but the property was never developed and the plan expired last month. That expiration has led to talk in this congested community over possible uses of the garage, and one much-discussed idea is for the city to sell it to local nonprofit groups, including a popular synagogue. That possibility has divided those seeking to save a friendly mom-and-pop, and those who want to help worthy nonprofits grow. 
 Kenny Mance, whose family has run the garage both before and after the city seized it, contends that he deserves first crack at buying the property. "It's ridiculous to give it to somebody else," said Mr. Mance, whose family began their tenure there in the 1950's. "My father had a 99-year lease when the city bought it and never used it." 
Supporters of Mr. Mance turned out for a meeting of Community Board 7 last month and spoke of his kindness. If you were going through hard times, they said, Mr. Mance would forgive a late payment. If you had car troubles, he would fix the problem free. If you had a bad leg, he would drive you home.
"It's just common courtesy," Mr. Mance explained.
But such stories have little impact on Deborah Pinsky, the executive director of the Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, one of the groups interested in the site. "We're not out to do anything bad to this guy," Ms. Pinsky said. "But we can't expand because space is so limited."
Joel Flax, executive director of the DOME Project, a nonprofit group that helps disadvantaged youths, agreed. "We have to turn away hundreds of kids each year," he said. "We've been looking for space for at least five years."
The five-story Beaux-Arts garage was built in 1906, two years before the Model T hit the road. "It's one of the earliest commercial auto garages built," said Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian at Columbia University, who was hired by Mr. Mance to research the building.
Despite all the local discussion, Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that her agency had no immediate plans for the site.
Mr. Mance said that the waiting list for his 100-car garage was still growing. "If you're here first," he said, "you get first dibs." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
With the Arena Plan Down, Is Codey the One Who's Out?

BYLINE:  By Ronald Smothers; Ronald Smothers reports from Newark for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Without a doubt the political fight over the state budget that pitted Mayor Sharpe James of Newark against Governor McGreevey -- and briefly had the proposal for a Newark arena and the $23.4 billion budget hanging in the same balance -- was the seismic event last week that garnered the heavyweight attention.
 But there was a little-noticed undercard, even more brutal in the clenches, that was likely to reverberate in Essex County and state politics alike. It was the battle between Richard J. Codey, the leader of the Democrats in the evenly split Senate, and his caucus opponents who are aligned with three powerful Democratic leaders who would like to unseat him. 
 Mayor James, who is also a state senator, may be angry with Governor McGreevey, but Mr. Codey may well be the one who suffers for it if the mayor can be convinced to side with opponents of the Senate leader. Indeed, in his anger late Sunday over the arena, Mayor James cited the "lack of leadership among Democrats in the Senate" as the cause of the bill's plight. 
The mayor cannily avoided publicly blaming the powerful Democratic governor as most other lawmakers did privately, leaving room for further talks with Mr. McGreevey. But Mr. Codey was not spared.
It all played into Essex County political battles in which Mr. James is alternately courted by and aligned with Mr. Codey on the one hand and on the other by Stephen N. Adubato, a powerful political leader with roots in Newark's North Ward, and his close associate, Joseph DiVincenzo, the chairman of the Essex County Freeholder Board. In last month's primary, Mr. Codey lost badly when Mr. DiVincenzo defeated a Codey associate, Tom Giblin, for the county executive nomination while Mr. Adubato's candidates for party posts swamped Mr. Codey's and took over the county committee. 
Through it all, Mr. James supported Mr. DiVincenzo but never completely cut his ties to Mr. Codey. But last week, Mr. Codey was suddenly looking much more vulnerable. According to several Democrats, Mr. Adubato was talking furiously with two longtime Codey enemies, George Norcross III, the Camden County Democratic leader, and John Lynch, the powerful Middlesex County Democrat. They were devising strategies to somehow unseat him before his term as leader of the Senate Democratic caucus expires in 18 months.
Mr. Lynch and Mr. Norcross were both very visible during the Sunday session of the Legislature, as were Mr. DiVincenzo and with Representative Donald Payne, who is the new Essex County Democratic chairman.
A day later, Mr. Norcross, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Adubato were reportedly talking tactics.
"Suddenly he is weakened and you have leaders from the north, central and southern part of the state ready to move," said one Democrat familiar with the maneuvers. Possible approaches have included talk of even lending Democratic support that each of them controls to elect Senator John Bennett, Mr. Codey's Republican counterpart in the evenly split Senate, as the sole and undisputed leader, a move that would turn a fractious Senate chamber into a Republican fortress.
But other top Democrats said that such a maneuver would alienate others from the three leaders. The more likely approach, they said, was to set Mr. Codey up for a challenge a year and a half from now, after the next legislative elections.
For his part Mr. Codey dismisses talk of an open challenge and especially its chances of success. Pointedly, he first cites his long support of Mr. McGreevey when he was a little-known state senator looking for access to party leaders.
McGreevey administration officials echo this and then go on to privately praise Mr. Codey for "a negotiating and consensus-building style" that which has served the young administration well in an evenly split Senate and tough economic times. It is a style, said one senior administration figure, that doesn't mix well with the take-no-prisoners approach of the three party leaders arrayed against Mr. Codey.
Mr. Codey also noted that it was his work in the trenches of redistricting that helped create the legislative map that allowed Democrats to wrest control of the Assembly from Republicans and fight them to a tie in the Senate. And many of his fans among the Senate Democratic Caucus -- like Senators Barbara Buono, Raymond Lesniak, Bernard Kinney and Joseph Vitale -- enthusiastically second that view.
"Caucus politics are the roughest politics in the game but in the end, Codey did an outstanding job." said Senator Kenny.
Just how rough caucus politics can get became evident in the last week when supporters of Mr. Codey said that his opponents had sunk to suggesting that personal concerns, including the fact that his wife recently learned she had breast cancer, were distracting the West Orange Democrat from his duties. 
"They have used his wife's illness to suggest that he doesn't have time to devote to leadership duties," said Senator Buono describing what she said Mr. Codey's opponents had been whispering. "I know politics is not for the fainthearted, but this is barbaric and reprehensible."
Mayor James is keeping his own counsel. An agreement to hold public hearings on the arena measure starting this week seemed to have eased his frustration for now. Mr. Codey, along with the governor and other Democrats, helped forge that agreement, and if Mr. Codey can make it fly in the Senate when lawmakers return in the early fall, he may return to fight another day.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
ToGrowl and Bear It: They Did

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MANY mutual funds recorded double-digit losses in the second quarter, with diversified domestic equity funds losing 11.3 percent of their value, on average, according to Morningstar Inc.
 So it is not surprising that the top of the winners' list was crowded with so-called bear-market funds that are intended to thrive during stock market declines by using strategies like shorting stocks. 
 Some of these strategies, however, can create high volatility in share prices, warned Russel Kinnel, director of fund analysis at Morningstar. He recommends looking at the funds' overall track record over time, year by year, or even quarter by quarter, to gauge their riskiness. 
Managers of some of the top performers among diversified actively managed funds -- bear-market funds or otherwise -- talked about the quarter and what they saw ahead for the stock market. Each fund is open to new investors.

A Hybrid of Sorts
The $90 million Comstock Capital Value Class A fund took second place among actively managed diversified domestic equity funds open to new investors, and seventh place over all. The fund rose 22.6 percent in the quarter.
Charles L. Minter, 60, and Martin Weiner, 68, the co-managers, are confirmed bears. "We strongly believe that the stock market will continue down at least another 30 or 35 percent from here," Mr. Weiner said from their offices in Yardley, Pa., outside Philadelphia.
Mr. Minter added: "We're coming off one of the biggest bubbles in U.S. financial history, from the late 1990's to the early 2000's. Everything that's happening now is the result of that inflating bubble."
The fund is classified by Morningstar as a domestic hybrid, which typically owns a mix of stocks and bonds, but Comstock Capital Value has owned no stocks for two years. Instead, it owns United States Treasury bills and bonds and uses a variety of strategies to bet on stock market declines. These include selling stocks short and buying Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures.
Among its most profitable shorts this quarter was the Manugistics Group, a Rockville, Md., company that makes business management software. The managers sold shares short in early April for about $18, closing the position at the end of June when shares traded at $6.11 and earning a return of 67 percent.
So far, they have made about 92 percent on paper in Broadcom, the semiconductor manufacturer in Irvine, Calif. The managers started selling Broadcom shares short about two years ago when the stock was at $229; it closed the quarter at $17.54.

Small Banks Are the Ticket
The $160 million Eclipse Small Cap Value fund was one of a handful of funds that made money in the quarter by buying stocks. It rose 5.9 percent, placing fourth among diversified funds and 11th over all.
Kathy O'Connor, 42, and Wesley G. McCain, 59, the co-managers, review the smallest 2,000 or so United States companies every week, looking for those that they think are undervalued relative to their history, their industry and other small stocks.
Cheap companies are not enough, Ms. O'Connor said from her Manhattan office; they also want to see improving profits. The fund, which is highly diversified, owns 300 stocks.
Its second-quarter performance was driven in part by its stake in small banks -- 17 percent, compared with 14 percent for the Russell Small Cap Value index. Another factor was a relatively small position in technology and communications stocks -- less than 2 percent versus 6 percent for the index, Ms. O'Connor said.
Small banks were profitable, she said, because the economics of the business are particularly strong right now; banks are paying interest rates of about 2 percent to depositors and collecting 6 percent interest on their mortgage loans. "A lot of our portfolio companies benefited from consumers' investments in real estate," she said, adding that their best performers were financial services companies, mortgage lenders and home builders.
One winner was Flagstar Bancorp, the holding company for Flagstar Bank, based in Troy, Mich. Flagstar stock, which rose about 49 percent in the quarter, benefited from the strong real estate market in its area, Ms. O'Connor said. 
For the same reasons, the fund made money in Brookline Bancorp, in Brookline, Mass., the holding company for Brookline Savings Bank, which operates in Brookline and eastern Massachusetts. It rose 48 percent in the quarter. 
Another winner was Novastar Financial, a national mortgage lender based in Westwood, Kan., up 90 percent in the quarter.
Ms. O'Connor says she is not bullish on the market for the short term. "Despite the declines," she said, "market valuations are still historically high because corporate profitability hasn't been catching up."

Counting on Indexes to Fall
The $175 million Hussman Strategic Growth fund rose 3 percent in the second quarter, taking sixth place among diversified domestic equity funds and 16th place over all.
The fund is always fully invested in individual stocks, said John P. Hussman, 39, the manager. But he can hedge away the market risk of the stock portfolio by selling market indexes short related to the stocks. He shorts the Russell 2000 index to offset losses in his smaller stocks and the S.& P. 100 index to offset losses in the bigger stocks.
To decide whether to hedge the fund's stock portfolio, Mr. Hussman uses a computer model to review trends in stock prices and trading volume among individual stocks. He also examines what he calls "uniformity" in the overall market -- whether performance among a variety of groups like large- and small-cap stocks, industry sectors and bonds is moving in tandem.
"Market history indicates that overvalued markets don't always decline," Mr. Hussman said. "What distinguishes them in the short term is uniformity across all the stock sectors, which tells you that investors have a robust preference for taking risk in the overall market."
The hedging, Mr. Hussman explained, is intended to smooth the fund's volatility. By the rules in the prospectus, he may hedge the entire portfolio, which he has largely done since September 2000. But he is not permitted to create a net "short" position, meaning he may not sell more shares than he owns.
The fund's second-quarter results, he said, were driven by the fact that the stocks dropped about 9 percent, on average, while the indexes declined about 12 percent, on average, creating a 3 percent return.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Variable Annuities Offer Safety, at a Price

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
AS if variable annuities, the insurance industry's version of mutual funds, were not bewildering enough, insurers have added a batch of features intended to protect investors from a stock market that lately has not seemed to know which way is up.
 Some companies are offering guarantees that an investor will break even, while others lock in a gain, even when the market is declining. But these protections increase the already considerable expenses of variable annuities -- costs that, in a rising market, usually make them less attractive than comparable mutual funds unless they are held for many years. The money put into most variable annuities must be locked up for 7 to 10 years, with penalities of up to 20 percent for early withdrawals. 
 Even so, the new protections could give nervous investors -- in a market that is falling for the third consecutive year -- the assurance that they can invest in stocks without the fear of losing their capital. 
The insurers are struggling to attract customers. Last year, gross sales fell nearly 18 percent, to $112.8 billion. And the industry has been cannibalizing itself. The Financial Research Corporation of Boston estimates that more than 60 percent of sales last year involved switching policies from one insurer to another, usually in response to an offer of new features and, often, a cash incentive.
Analysts say many investors do not want to commit to an investment for up to 10 years. Some also say the industry is hurting itself with its new gimmicks. "The products are becoming more difficult to understand," said Lisa Plotnick, an analyst at Financial Research. 
The variable annuity, like the 401(k) account, was intended to accumulate money for retirement and usually consists of an assortment of stock and bond funds. But it also includes insurance. If the investor dies, the heirs get at least the amount invested, even if the value has declined. For investors who retire, the insurance guarantees a stream of payments for life, although most cash out at once or over a few years.
Some of the new protections were created when the market was roaring, but they have never been more relevant. These features put a new twist on an old concept. Now, the original investment can be preserved not only for survivors but for investors themselves.
Last June, American Skandia Life Assurance of Shelton, Conn., introduced a feature providing that after seven years, investors will have at least what they started with.
"This is just the thing for older people who don't have enough years left to earn back big losses in the market," said John Meunier, an executive at Cogent Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., that helped develop the feature for Skandia, a unit of Skandia Insurance of Stockholm.
"It's also ideal for the investment jock whose wife says, 'I'll kill you if you put money into anything risky these days,' " Mr. Meunier said.
How does Skandia manage this feat? It permits investors to put their money into a range of investments and tracks the money. When the annuity starts heading into the red, a computer shifts money into fixed-income investments with a sufficient yield to meet the break-even target. Other insurers guarantee that investors will not lose their initial stake by requiring them to put two-thirds of their money in fixed-income accounts. The rest goes into stocks.
Another kind of guarantee provides for annual growth of, say, 6 percent for 10 years, which would increase an investment of $100,000 to $179,084.80. In yet another option, the variable annuity's value fluctuates, but, at the end of 10 years, it is credited with the highest value it has reached on any anniversary of the investment during that period.
These last two guarantees come with a significant restriction. Once the 10 years are up, the investor may not take the money in a lump sum or in smaller payments over a short period. The payout must take place over the rest of the investor's life, allowing the insurer to keep earning a profit on the client's money.
One company, G.E. Financial Assurance in Richmond, Va., a unit of General Electric, has taken an approach that seems simple on its face. It asks clients just two questions: How much money do you want to receive in retirement, and when do you want to start receiving it? Then G.E. figures out how much has to be paid in to reach the goal.
In one example, G.E. says that by paying $713.95 a month for 25 years, a couple, each 40 years old, could receive at least $2,000 a month for life, beginning at the age of 65. If the money grew faster than an assumed 5 percent, the monthly payment would increase.
The hard part is that an investor must determine how much money will be needed 25 years in the future and, no matter what happens in his or her life, the goal cannot be changed. As with other variable annuities, there is no provision in the payout for inflation. There is also a stiff penalty for backing out within 10 years and, in a provision not found in other variable annuities, a charge equal to 1 percent of the investment for canceling anytime after that.
While many of the new features may sound inviting, they add to the cost of a variable annuity. And while they reduce the risk of investing in stocks, they also limit gains.
Often, the features do not pay off because investors bail out early. Cynthia Saccocia, a senior analyst at Cerulli Associates in Boston, said that nearly 80 percent of customers switch to another annuity, promising greater rewards, within five years. "If you do this," Ms. Saccocia said, "you've paid five years for a benefit that will never be realized."
Some people simply decide that they need the money for something else. But if they take their money before a specified time -- up to 10 years -- they pay a penalty of as much as 10 percent to the insurer. If they are under 59 1/2, they pay an additional 10 percent to the government.
Variable annuities have consistently been criticized for their cost. According to Morningstar Inc., the average annual fee is 2.21 percent of the value of the investment, compared with 1.39 percent for a mutual fund. While variable annuities have the advantage of being sheltered from taxes as they grow, the added eight-tenths of a percent means they have to be held for a long time -- at least 10 years by some calculations, much longer by others -- to come out ahead of mutual funds.
Insurers, however, say that most people who invest in variable annuities are cautious folk who are not shooting for the moon. Many of these investors would not venture into mutual funds or individual stocks. 
"The alternative for some of these investors would be bank C.D.'s," said Jacob Herschler, American Skandia's marketing director. "But with C.D.'s, they are going to get hammered by inflation. They need to be invested in equities for the long term. They're seeking options and benefits that give them peace of mind."
THE insurers acknowledge that variable annuities are complex. They do not expect most buyers -- usually people in their late 50's or early 60's with annual incomes of $75,000 or less -- to try to figure them out on their own. "Our company's distribution is based on the fact that a qualified financial adviser is going to help you with this," said Michael Wells, the vice chairman of Jackson National Life, a Lansing, Mich., unit of the British insurer Prudential. 
But analysts and consumer advocates question the objectivity of some advice because brokers and financial planners get much more for selling a variable annuity than a mutual fund: 6 percent to 8 percent for an annuity, compared with an average of 4.78 percent for a fund. "An adviser is likely to do better in the long run by making the right decision for a client," said Todd Porter, an analyst at Morningstar. "But certainly some people are tempted to go for the short-term gain."

HEADLINE: Skirmishes Signal Rent Law Countdown 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
LEGISLATION to renew rent regulation a year early never made it onto the table in Albany during the recent legislative season, primarily because tenant advocates and Democrats in the Assembly wanted to force the gristly issue on Senate Republicans, who wouldn't bite.
 But with the rent laws, which affect more than one million households, facing sunset on June 15, 2003, and the gubernatorial election just four months away, the classic debate over how much, and even whether, government should counteract free-market forces to protect certain essentials of a citizen's life is once again stirring. 
 Partisans across the divide concur, grudgingly on one side, that rent stabilization and its withered elder cousin, rent control, will eventually be extended. So, for now, the debate is focusing on the fate of two rent-law provisions that are colloquially called "vacancy decontrol" and "luxury decontrol." 
Those provisions -- more bureaucratically called "high-rent/vacancy decontrol" and "high-rent/high-income decontrol" -- have whittled away the stock of rent-regulated apartments. And a bone of contention in the debate is the sharply conflicting estimates of how many apartments have already been decontrolled under those provisions. 
"We all recognize that regulation will be extended in some fashion for whatever period the elected officials wish to push it out for," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord group. "We all clearly understand that those tenants who are already in place will be protected."
To which Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said: "The point here is that the purpose of rent regulation is not merely to protect the tenant in place, it's to keep the apartment affordable for people who are going to live in it in the future. And that's what's lost with these decontrol loopholes."
Under high-rent/vacancy decontrol, which was included in the rent laws when they were last renewed in June 1997, a rent-stabilized apartment is deregulated upon vacancy if the rent can be legally raised to $2,000 or above. In calculating the new rent, a landlord is entitled to an increase of approximately 20 percent when a tenant dies or moves out. Then, if the landlord renovates the apartment, one-fourtieth of the cost of the renovation can be added to the monthly rent, in perpetuity. If those increases bring the rent to $2,000, the apartment can be deregulated, with the landlord allowed to charge whatever the market will bear.
Under high-income decontrol, an occupied apartment for which the rent has climbed to $2,000 or above can be deregulated if the household income exceeds $175,000 for two consecutive years. The $175,000 income threshold was lowered from $250,000 in the 1997 rent-law renewal.
To supporters of rent regulation, these decontrol provisions chip away at both the supply of affordable apartments and the underlying political forces that have sustained the rent regulation system. "There is no question," Mr. McKee said, "that the strategy of the real estate lobby is to allow the various decontrol mechanisms to continue to operate and to whittle away at the rent-regulated universe until such time as there are so few apartments remaining under rent regulation that tenants will lack the political muscle to get the laws renewed for another period of time."
"Just to renew the laws alone is not enough," he said. "We've got to, at a minimum, get this vacancy-decontrol mechanism repealed."
For Mr. Strasburg, in his hopes to see the entire rent-regulation system dismantled, a repeal of vacancy decontrol is unthinkable. "There should be an orderly demise to a system that's been in existence over 50 years," he said.
Topping his wish list for the coming legislative struggle is the elimination of the rent threshold in the high-income decontrol provision. "The issue for us is to examine whether those tenants who are presently earning in excess of $175,000 a year should continue to receive protection just because their rents are below the $2,000 threshold," Mr. Strasburg said. "We're going to see if there is a willingness to look at a means test, rather than looking at incomes plus rent level."
If a household's income exceeds $175,000, "we should not be protecting those individuals," he said. "It should only be those whose incomes are $175,000 or more, and not have the two conditions met."
Whatever the eventual outcome of the cyclical rent-law battle, for now only the Democrats seem anxious to engage -- and so, find themselves dueling with the wind.
Rent regulation is mandated, by statute, in New York City and three suburban counties -- Nassau, Westchester and Rockland -- when vacancy rates drop below 5 percent. According to the 1999 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, the most recent data available, the city's vacancy rate that year was 3.2 percent, down from 4 percent in 1996.
As far back as April, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, easily pushed through his house bills that would have extended rent regulation until 2008 (starting this past June 15) while also ending both vacancy decontrol and high-rent decontrol. "Landlords in the city are clearly taking advantage of these provisions," Mr. Silver said, "and they are hiking rental rates to a level that working families cannot afford."
But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican from upstate Rensselaer County, refused to allow companion legislation to be introduced in his house. Last week, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, John McArdle, said the majority leader would not discuss the issue. "It doesn't come up for renewal until next June," Mr. McArdle said. "There's nothing to talk about now."
Mr. McKee of the tenants' coalition, not surprisingly, believes the issue should be discussed now, as part of the gubernatorial election. "We will continue to push this issue until Nov. 5," he said. "And as far as we are concerned, the Legislature can do it in September or October, and the governor can even call a special session."
The Democratic candidates for governor, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew M. Cuomo, both support expedited action on the rent laws.
"There's no question that the Republicans are trying to erode and eventually eliminate rent control," Mr. McCall said. "I think it's important to get this done this year, this being an election year."
"And also," Mr. McCall continued, "we should try to avoid what happened five years ago when this issue went down to the wire and caused so much anxiety for tenants in New York. People didn't know if rent regulation would be extended and what their living arrangements would be."
In a written statement, Mr. Cuomo pointed to the Assembly's passage of the bills to renew rent regulation through 2008 and also to "repeal those provisions of law that have allowed landlords to decontrol thousands of city apartments."
"I strongly support those bills," Mr. Cuomo said. "It is time for the Senate to pass them and for Governor Pataki to sign them into law."
Gov. George E. Pataki did not respond to repeated requests for an interview on the subject.
Agreed-upon data on how many regulated apartments have already been decontrolled in recent years does not exist. Estimates vary widely, and by ideology.
No provision was written into either the 1993 or the 1997 rent-law packages requiring owners of stabilized buildings to notify any government agency when an apartment was decontrolled.
There does exist a requirement that every stabilized apartment be registered each year with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. And on that registration form is a box for the landlord to check if the apartment "became permanently exempt since the prior year." However, filling out the form after an apartment is deregulated is optional.
On June 4, at the request of two members of the New York City Rent Guidelines Board (which has responsibility for deciding each year how much of a rent increase stabilized tenants in the city will receive), the state housing division released numbers on how many landlords had filled out the form and checked the "permanently exempt" box since 1994. The total was 20,161.
According to the Housing and Vacancy Survey, conducted triennially for the city by the Census Bureau, there were 1,020,588 rent-stabilized apartments in the city in 1999 (a new survey is due out early next year). And so, those 20,161 apartments belonging to owners who had checked the "exempt" boxes on the state form represented 2 percent of the city's stabilized housing stock.
Perhaps not surprisingly, of the 20,161 total, 18,618 -- or 92 percent -- were in Manhattan, meaning that at least 5.2 percent of Manhattan's 354,595 stabilized units have been decontrolled since 1994. And those numbers jumped from 544 in 1994 to 1,121 in 1997, when the rent laws were last renewed, to 4,490 in 2001. (Officials at the state housing agency pointed out that 19,461 apartments entered the stabilization rolls between 1999 and 2001, most of them on temporary status under tax-abatement programs that last between 10 and 20 years.) 
Nobody familiar with the issue, however, views the figure of 20,161 deregulated apartments as anything more than a starting point for estimates of apartments that have been removed from rent regulation. 
"That's probably a floor," said Jack Freund, the chief economist for the Rent Stabilization Association, the large landlord group. "My estimation is that, as a cap, there were no more than twice those 20,000 units that were decontrolled, or about 40,000. My guess is that it's somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000."
What adds to the 20,161 checked boxes, Mr. Freund pointed out, is that it is possible to calculate the number of apartments renting for about $1,667 in a given year, so that if the 20 percent rent increase allowed when a vacancy occurs is factored in, the new rent would surpass $2,000. "And each year you make an assumption that the usual turnover rate applies, which is about 10 percent," Mr. Freund said, "so that number of units could possibly go over $2,000 a month and be deregulated."
"There's no way to tell," he said, "but based on the available data it would appear to me and to others, I think, that there are probably no more than 40,000 units that have been deregulated since 1994."
Mr. McKee pointed out, however, that those numbers do not include deregulated apartments where, besides the 20 percent vacancy rent increase, landlords managed to bring the rent to $2,000 or more by performing renovations and adding one-fortieth of the costs. Nor do they include, he said, "the number of units that landlords have simply treated as decontrolled on vacancy without spending the money to get the rent up to $2,000."
Using what amounts to an extrapolation of estimates, based on data from a series of Housing and Vacancy Surveys, the tenants' coalition released a study in February saying that approximately 148,000 apartments had been deregulated since 1991. 
"This is a projection," Mr. McKee said. "We took the trends in the H.V.S. and then projected forward from '99 to 2002." Pointing out that the new survey will be released next year, he added, "We'll see then how close we were, but I think we'll be close."
WHATEVER the statistics and whatever the specifics of an eventual outcome to the current rent-law struggle, the decades-old debate is based on recurring contentions and standard stereotypes invoked by both sides, usually with some degree of validity.
The billboard image projected by the landlords is of the affluent Upper West Sider hogging a $500-a-month, six-room penthouse for decades. For the tenant advocates, while not quite the mustachioed, black-hatted landlord ordering the widow out, there is the headline-name owner of dozens of buildings with thousands of apartments who just can't wait for those vacancies.
"The history of this debate," Mr. Strasburg said, "is that the tenant advocates have protected the rights of tenants whose incomes have exceeded six figures, because they want to protect the unit more than they want to protect the tenant."
Parvati Devi lives on the Upper West Side, but hardly fits the hoggish image.
On the sweltering afternoon of June 26, despite being disabled, Ms. Devi rode the subways downtown to testify at a city Rent Guidelines Board hearing in the Great Hall at Cooper Union. She came to say she could not afford another rent increase on her one-bedroom stabilized apartment in a brownstone on West 90th Street.
The $466 she pays in rent, Ms. Devi said, comes out of her entire income of $637 a month in Social Security disability insurance. "I pay 75 percent of my income on rent," she said. "For shame that so many people with disabilities have to constantly worry about this basic human need."
Mr. McKee insists that "all over the city" landlords are making one-time investments in renovations on vacated apartments and reaping great benefits. "If they spend $10,000, they can raise the rent by $250 per month," he said. "If they spend $40,000, which is not uncommon, they can raise the rent by $1,000 a month."
On the Upper West Side, Mr. McKee continued, "large prewar, six-room apartments are coming back on the market for $8,000 -- $10,000, in some cases." In neighborhoods like Kingsbridge, in the Bronx, he said, "you're seeing one-bedroom apartments renting for $700, $800 under rent stabilization, coming back on the market at $1,100, $1,200."
But Roberta Bernstein, another witness at the rent hearing on June 26, insists that small landlords are squeezed.
Ms. Bernstein is president of the Small Property Owners of New York, an organization of about 1,000 landlords, most of whom own buildings with 10 to 18 apartments. 
Small landlords face obstacles, in part, because they lack the heft of their big-name brethren: few economies of scale allowing them to purchase supplies at a discount; full prices to contractors; the lone tenant whose failure to pay rent seriously crimps the rent roll; no staff lawyer to handle litigious tenants. 
At the rent hearing, Ms. Bernstein called on the board to approve increases for stabilized apartments beyond the 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease that it had previously proposed.
Insurance costs have jumped, Ms. Bernstein said. "Fuel costs are rising and tax and water increases show no signs of abating," she continued. "If tenants can't or won't pay rent, owners can't pay bills and a snowball starts, often culminating in the loss of buildings. No one benefits."
"Small owners need 4 percent and 6 percent increases this year," Ms. Bernstein insisted. The next day, the guidelines board formally approved the 2 and 4 percent increases.
Andrew Scherer and Peter Salins hold deeply considered, though opposing, views of the rent-regulation issue.
"The theory underlying rent regulation since its inception has been that it would affect the market in ways that would keep rents affordable," said Mr. Scherer, the author of "Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York" (West Group, 1999). "It is supposed to do that by placing limitations on the amount of profit that can be taken out of buildings and, while guaranteeing a reasonable return to landlords, limiting the amount that landlords could increase rents."
Particularly in recent years, however, Mr. Scherer said, "Rent regulation is having diminishing value."
For Dr. Salins, the author of "Scarcity by Design: The Legacy of New York City's Housing Policies" (Harvard University Press, 1992), "The most serious impact of continued rent regulation is the misallocation of the housing stock."
"One of the most perverse impacts," Dr. Salins said, "is that increasingly under regulation the rents being paid bear little or no relationship to the quality of the apartment. So you have very low rents on large apartments, high rents on small apartments; low rents on apartments that are ideally located or possess many amenities, higher rents on apartments with inferior locations and fewer amenities."
Mr. Scherer, who is also executive director of Legal Services, a nonprofit corporation that represents poor people in civil cases, said that even with the limits on rent increases allowed under regulation, "the rents have risen to a level that has become unaffordable to low-income people and many lower middle-class people."
Glynis Daniels, associate director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, was asked to examine that assertion, using vacancy survey data. "I looked at the median household income for people living in stabilized units, and in 1999 that was $27,000," Ms. Daniels said. "So, according to the federal government's definition of a very low-income household, which for a family of four would have been no more than $26,700 in 1999, 53 percent of them were spending more than half their incomes for rent in the five boroughs."
An eventual dissipation of rent regulation would ameliorate the inequities, said Dr. Salins, who is also provost of the State University of New York. "What a market does is match the quality and the nature of the consumer goods to not only the financial means of the consumer, but to the expressed needs of the consumer," he said. "The regulated system creates both windfall beneficiaries -- small households occupying large apartments -- and a huge number of nonbeneficiaries who experience a corresponding degree of harm." The nonbeneficiaries are, he said, "a growing number of new households with large families entering the market for the first time, having to pay, as unprotected tenants, higher rents than the protected small households."
"My own assumption is that within 5 to 10 years, the impact of deregulation would be positive, with everybody entering the market on equal terms," Dr. Salins said.
To which Mr. Scherer said: "He's probably right that over time you would have a better fit between housing size and household size. But supply in New York City has never responded adequately to demand. Without regulation, housing prices would escalate throughout the city and low-income people would be priced out of the housing market entirely."
Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat, is chairman of the Assembly's Housing Committee. While he is a committed supporter of rent regulation -- indeed, he sponsored the recent legislation to renew the laws early and eliminate the decontrol provisions -- Mr. Lopez is realistic. 
A special session called by the governor "is highly unlikely," he said, "and, therefore, the issue will have to be addressed in next year's session."
"Even talking about next year," Mr. Lopez said, "it's going to be a dogfight."

The Two Faces Of Rent Regulation
 Rent control applies to apartments in buildings constructed before Feb. 1, 1947, in which the tenant or an authorized successor has been in continuous occupancy since before June 30, 1971 -- the date when vacancy decontrol for rent-controlled apartments first took effect.
Rent-controlled tenants are subject to 7.5 percent rent increases in most years as well as fuel and labor cost pass-alongs that can result in actual annual rent increases of a maximum of 15 percent. 
The number of rent-controlled apartments has dropped significantly in recent years, according to the city's Housing and Vacancy Surveys, from 101,798 in 1993 to 52,562 in 1999.
Rent stabilization, which went into effect in 1969, covers buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974, as well as formerly rent-controlled apartments in pre-1947 buildings that are added to the rent-stabilized category when the units become vacant. Some post-1973 buildings have also opted to become stabilized in return for tax abatements. 
Stabilized apartments are subject to rent increases set annually by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, which is appointed by the mayor. 
The latest increases of 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease will go into effect on Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Accelerate To 65 M.P.H. Now Empty Your Pockets.

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
PUTTING a cash value on life may seem unseemly, but, just in time for the summer driving season, a couple of economists have done so in a way that may prove useful.
 To get right to the point, your life as you travel along the New York State Thruway or similar highways in other states, where the speed limit has been raised to 65 miles an hour from 55, is worth $1.54 million. No one had done that calculation before, and now we know, thanks to new research by Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton University and Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago. 
 Your life is worth much more, of course. For your family and friends, no amount of money would be enough compensation for your loss. But in deciding in 1987 and 1988 to raise the speed limit by 10 m.p.h., the legislatures in 41 states struck a Faustian bargain. 
Don't misunderstand. You cannot run a country, a state, a city or even a village without Faustian bargains. Weighing cost against benefit -- life against the cost of preserving it or keeping people healthy -- is everyday practice in public policy. 
Even so small a matter as upgrading a water purification system to reduce the bacteria count slightly must be weighed by a town council against the cost of medical treatment for those few who would suffer upset stomachs without the upgrade. If the cost of an improved system is greater than the cost of the medical treatment, can the council members justify the outlay of tax dollars for the upgrade? On philosophical grounds, perhaps they can. A sense of well-being has a value not measurable in money. But the same money spent on school textbooks might bring even more well-being. 
Cost-benefit analysis -- unfortunately missing from most debates over water purification or military spending, for that matter -- figures prominently in determining compensation for the families of those killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It is central in workers' compensation cases and liability suits. Juries value a life at $3.5 million, on average, one study found. Costs and benefits also play a big role in the wide-ranging struggle over how much of the environment should be sacrificed to logging, home construction, highways and the like.
But when it comes to raising speed limits, the cost in fatalities and the benefit in time saved can be known only well after the fact. Now, in the research of Mr. Ashenfelter and Mr. Greenstone, we have a first cut at the facts 15 years after the 41 legislatures raised the speed limit on Interstate highways running through rural stretches of their states. Finally, the debate can begin -- as we hurry in our cars to summer homes and resorts -- over whether to roll back the speed limit to 55 m.p.h., and spend more vacation time in our cars.
Not that the debate will begin. So many other factors take precedence. That was the case when Congress, during the oil crisis in 1974, imposed a maximum national speed limit of 55 m.p.h., concerned only with the need to conserve fuel. The happy byproduct was a sharp decline in auto fatalities. Lower speeds saved lives. But with oil plentiful again in the late 1980's, most states went back to the 65-m.p.h. limit. Truckers lobbied for the change, and so did many motorists.
Without knowing the stakes, "the legislators and the people they represented voted to lift the speed limit and save the time," Mr. Ashenfelter said.
DRAWING on data from 21 states, the Ashenfelter-Greenstone study counted the number of additional deaths at the higher speed limit from 1986 to 1993. The two economists added to their equations the speeds actually driven, getting that data from electronic highway monitors. Assuming that the hours saved could be spent at work, they valued them at an average wage of roughly $20 an hour. They multiplied the hours saved by the wage and divided the total by the additional deaths.
The results: each person killed in a crash in effect contributed through the loss of his or her life $1.54 million, adjusted for inflation, to the value of the time that was saved by the faster driving of everyone during those seven years.
Some economists say such narrow calculations should be only part of the debate over human preferences, not the driving force in making a decision. Still, $1.54 million in saved time seems grossly inadequate for the loss of a life, particularly in the summer. Millions of drivers earned their vacation pay before they set out and have nothing to gain by getting to their destinations faster.
Let's try a compromise. From the Fourth of July through Labor Day, which happens to be the busiest travel time, why not lower the speed limit back to 55?

HEADLINE: High School on Wheels Is Losing Appeal for Teenagers 

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH NETBURN 

 BODY:
LAST summer was without a doubt one of the best of Steven Alcheh's life, thanks to his 40-day $7,899 (airfare not included) teenage tour of the West Coast and Canada.
 "It was awesome," said Mr. Alcheh, 16, who is from New City, N.Y. "We got tons of freedom, we got to do whatever we wanted, and there was no camping, which was awesome because I hate camping." 
 His enjoyment was heightened by frequent stops at resort hotels with Olympic-size swimming pools. He liked the sightseeing. "We saw the important places, like the monuments and all that kind of stuff," he said. And even better, he liked shopping on Rodeo Drive and skiing at Whistler-Blackcomb, the resort in British Columbia. 
Weissman Teen Tours, the luxury tour operator Mr. Alcheh used, also runs a trip to Europe that promises to be at least as much fun -- shopping in Italy, skiing in the Alps, an English Channel cruise. But Mr. Alcheh will not be going on it this year.
"I would love to go on one of those things again, but I can't," he said. "It's too much money, and also 9/11."
Operators of teenage tours, a summer staple of well-to-do youngsters too old for sleep-away camp and too privileged to work, said that the economy and post-Sept. 11 fears have indeed taken a bite out of their business. For the moment, parents are reluctant to part with their children or their cash in uncertain times.
But teenage tours are also suffering from a bit of tiredness. Indulgence is out and impressive college resumes are in, especially for the teenagers from affluent New York suburbs and parts of Florida who have been the mainstay of such tours almost since they began in the 1960's.
"Bluntly speaking, I don't think a teen tour is a constructive use of time," said Adam Metsch, director of College Advisor of New England, a company that helps students navigate the college admissions process. "It is a vacation basically, and we don't recommend them."
In the 80's, a teenager's summer options were simple: get a job, work as a counselor in training or waiter at a sleep-away camp or see the world with 40 other fun-loving kids from the comfort of an air-conditioned bus. Last year, it is estimated that 6,000 to 7,000 teenagers, 14 to 17, took off on one of those trips. Most roughed it in dorm rooms, campsites and youth hostels, focusing on the sights -- the Grand Canyon, Yosemite -- rather than the accommodations.
But others were treated to the ultimate, top-dollar tours, hopscotching from five-star hotel to five-star hotel, stopping at the world's most desirable spots and wandering, parent-approved credit cards in hand, through stores from Milan to Beverly Hills. Prices range from about $4,000 for three weeks of hotels, dorms and camping to more than $9,000 for Weissman's European tour.
But summer activity advisers say that teenage tours are down about 25 percent this year. Weissman canceled one of the two buses it usually sends to Europe. Other companies have reported similar losses. And it's not only because of Sept. 11. 
Instead of heading for the Colosseum or the Prada store in Rome, many teenagers are on their way to tutor children in the Dominican Republic, take art history at Harvard or intern at Bear Stearns. Nowadays, teenagers have to be immersed, involved, tallying resume points and college essay themes. A teenage tour can seem a self-indulgent holdover from earlier times.
"Teen tours in general are not the way things are going," said Carey Rivers, director of Tips on Trips and Camps, a company that matches youngsters with summer programs. "It is kind of a rite of passage for certain parents and certain groups of people, but there has been such a growth in college programs and community service, and there has been a real change in what parents are looking for in terms of their money."
Not every teenager is happy about that. 
Jen Kreiger, 16, of Hollywood, Fla., went on a trip to the West Coast last summer sponsored by Musiker Tours, which has been running high-end teenage tours since 1966. Her mother, Karen, wholeheartedly supported the idea. "This is what the kids in this community know," Mrs. Kreiger said. "They go to sleep-away camp and then to fabulous programs. My main thing is I want my kids to have as much exposure to the world as they can. I can't take seven weeks off and take them to every national park there is, but it is something that I want for them so that they can feel their adolescent years are everything they want."
Teenage tours can also be high school on wheels, unhappily for those who don't fit in.
Dr. Roni Cohen-Sandler, a psychologist who specializes in teenage girls and parenthood said that she sent her daughter on two teenage tours -- the first across the United States, the second to Europe -- and regrets it. "A lot of what they do is hang out, and a lot of them just want to shop," Dr. Cohen-Sandler said. "They don't want to see the sights or learn the history." 
Two weeks into her daughter's trip to Europe, she called to come home. "They were in Italy, and they were rude, and all they wanted to do was go to Prada and buy 10 pocketbooks at a time," Dr. Cohen-Sandler said. "These girls really ruined it for my daughter. And, by the way, my daughter loves Prada, and it isn't that she doesn't like clothes. It was just too much for her, though."
Nowadays there are more things than ever for teenagers to do in the summer -- and that, experts say, they need to do. 
"I hate teen tours, and I am extremely adamant with my students that they are not going to help you in the college admissions process," said Katherine Cohen, who helps wealthy Manhattan teenagers package themselves for colleges. "Colleges are looking at the level of commitment and involvement of your summer activity."
Lee Stetson, dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed. "I think the preferential summer experience is something that stretches you a bit, including something in depth, like a short study program or an archaeological dig, that is a little more substantive than a tour," he said. "Travel is valuable, but in and of itself is not helpful in giving students exposure to the world."
Ms. Cohen recommends programs like Where There Be Dragons, which takes small student groups to Thailand, Laos, Tibet, Mongolia and other places, combining home stays, community service and rugged experiences. They don't come cheap: 46 days in northern India, with a home stay and service work in Dharmasala and a Himalyan trek, costs $6,550 -- but think of the essay possibilities.
Other college advisers like programs where high school students spend time on a college campus. Jeffrey Shumlin, a director of Putney Student Travel, which runs community service, college and language-immersion programs, said that about a quarter of the 1,200 students his company enrolls each year are choosing community service programs, while more than half take precollege programs. The college programs are still high: seven weeks at Williams College through Putney costs $7,495. The students take two seminar classes a day, for example, criminal law and preliminary College Board preparation.
But, Sept. 11 aside, as long as there is teenage restlessness, the need for summer supervision and parents with money, say tour operators, there will always be Paris. 
"I think that teen tours will always have a place," said Howard Fox, the director of West Coast Connections, one of the tour companies. "How lucky the kids are to do these things, if your parents can afford to do it for you."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about diminishing interest in summer travel tours for teenagers misstated the name of a tour company that provides such trips. It is Westcoast Connection Travel, not West Coast Connections. The article also misidentified the company's director. He is Mark Segal; Howard Fox is the director of American Trails West, another agency in that business.

Growth-Fund Giant Tries to Cope

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
THE bear market in stocks has been particularly dispiriting for managers of growth funds, and few more so than the British manager Amvescap P.L.C. Its United States funds, sold under the AIM Funds and Invesco brands, have had a long stretch of feeble performance. 
 Both groups have more funds with returns that rank among the worst for their objectives than among the best, and the weakness has become more acute in the last year. 
 "AIM is an aggressively growth-oriented group and Invesco is also growth oriented, and growth hasn't been working," said Phil Edwards, managing director for global fund research at Standard & Poor's.
AIM and Invesco representatives accept that their funds' performance has been poor, but they say they have taken steps to improve it. Invesco has hewn closer to benchmark stock indexes to reduce risk, while AIM has diversified into value stocks. 
"We have tried to diversify our range considerably by bringing out value products," said Ed Larson, AIM's chief investment officer. "We will continue to do that as long as we can attract good talent in that field." 
Invesco has been walloped. Just 5 of the 34 funds it offers have performed in the top 25 percent in their categories -- domestic equity, international equity, bond or money market -- during the 12 months through June 30, S.& P.'s figures show. 
Sixteen of Invesco's funds were in the bottom quarter over the period. AIM has fared better, if not well. Ten of its 56 funds had returns in the top quarter over the period, while 19 were in the bottom quarter.
Amvescap manages $400 billion worldwide -- $182 billion in AIM retail funds, $30 billion in Invesco's United States funds and the rest in foreign funds or portfolios for institutions and wealthy people.
The weakness in growth stocks has caused Amvescap's asset base to shrink, and Invesco announced last month that it was eliminating 111 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force.
Amvescap was created in 1997, when Invesco MIM, the London management company, bought AIM, which is based in Denver. Invesco's United States operations are based in Atlanta. The two divisions are run independently, but they made similar decisions about managing their portfolios as the stock market bubble inflated.
"In the late 1990's Invesco invested very aggressively in technology and other high-growth stocks, some of them pretty speculative," said Peter di Teresa, a senior analyst covering the company for Morningstar Inc. "Since the market dropped early in 2000, it clearly has been a disaster." 
One fund, Invesco Growth, maintained more than 60 percent of its assets in technology stocks through 2000 and 2001, Mr. Di Teresa noted. With the sector losing nearly three-fourths of its value from the peak in early 2000, the fund's managers must have committed more money to keep such high exposure.
"The result was a 24 percent loss in 2000 and a 49 percent loss in 2001," Mr. Di Teresa said. "As of early this year, that manager is no longer on the fund."
MANAGERS at AIM showed the same reluctance to cut their losses after the bubble popped.
AIM, whose mercurial managers specialized in trading in and out of technology stocks, had trouble maneuvering in the market even when it was rising, exacerbating the difficulties that followed. 
"Where AIM had been most successful in its brand of high-turnover growth investing was with small funds buying smaller stocks," said Bridget Hughes, a colleague of Mr. Di Teresa at Morningstar. "Ballooning assets forced the portfolios to buy larger stocks and/or own a huge list of companies."
The fund manager was also undone by waiting for clear signs of flagging earnings growth before selling positions, Ms. Hughes said.
"When tech stocks came tumbling down in early 2000, the managers still believed these companies would grow," she said. "Market sentiment was ahead of the game; AIM was not."
Mr. Edwards praised AIM's initial diversification efforts and said it had introduced some good value funds. "You might argue that AIM already has a pretty good offering," he said. 
Ms. Hughes said that by attending more to value and less to growth prospects, "the funds' performance might be more muted in a sharp market rally." 
Invesco is less inclined to diversify its product range. "We won't stray from our style," said Molly Cisneros, an Invesco spokeswoman.
Invesco managers, however, have become warier of the risks they take. "I'll admit that the risk of our funds got a little out of whack relative to the market and to our peer group," Ms. Cisneros said.
She added that Invesco had given "no thought to merging operations" with AIM, a move that some outsiders have suggested as a way to cut costs.
One important historical difference between the two fund groups no longer applies. Invesco, which previously sold its funds directly to investors, in March adopted AIM's approach of selling funds with loads, or sales charges, through brokers and advisers. 
Amvescap, of course, could acquire value funds in one big bite by buying a fund manager that specializes in that style. Mr. Edwards pointed to Alliance Capital Management's acquisition of the value house Sanford C. Bernstein as a model for such a combination. "They combined their efforts and provided a broader line of funds," he said.
An Amvescap spokesman, Douglas Kidd, declined to comment on the likelihood of such an acquisition, except to say that the company does not speculate on such matters. He noted, though, that Amvescap has acquired other fund managers.
Buying a value manager may be a good idea, but some Amvescap officials do not think the timing is right. A decline in Amvescap's own stock price means that any deal involving payment in its shares would be impractical. Amvescap's stock closed the second quarter at $:5.35, well off its peak of $:17.34 in the fourth quarter of 2000.
"You can hear all this noise about wanting to make deals, but do you want to do that when your stock is selling at its cheapest price in the last few years?" asked one Amvescap official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The market is in a frenzy for value-style investing, and that means I ain't buying. It's a hard time for people to pony up and buy value."

Ina Battered Market, Optimism on Energy

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
DESPITE the collapse of Enron, energy stocks over all have moved modestly ahead this year, and many Wall Street analysts and fund managers are optimistic about the long-term outlook for the sector.
 The energy component of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 3.0 percent in the six months through June 30, even as the overall index fell 13.8 percent. 
 Among mutual funds, the disparity in performance is even greater. The average domestic stock fund lost 11.6 percent through June, but the average natural-resources fund -- the category that includes energy -- rose 8.9 percent, with the leaders up more than 15 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. 
One of the top performers in the sector is Ivy Global Natural Resources, which has beaten the S.& P. 500 in both good times and bad. In the 1999 bull market, the fund rose 41 percent, or 19.9 percentage points above the index, according to Morningstar. Despite the bear market last year, the fund returned 15.4 percent, and Lipper Analytical Services named it best in its category. 
Through June, the fund rose 17.3 percent, putting it in fifth place in the category, after U.S. Global Investors Global Resources, Prudential Natural Resources, RS Global Natural Resources and Van Eck Global Hard Assets. The category includes several funds that invest only in energy but they tend to be more volatile than the broader natural resources funds. Through June, Fidelity Select Energy Service was up 5.6 percent, AIM Global Energy was up 10.1 percent, and Invesco Energy was up 3.8 percent.
No one is suggesting that investors replace a core holding like an index fund with a sector fund -- an investment that tends to be far more volatile. But investors may want to consider adding a natural-resources fund with an energy focus.
Fred Sturm, who manages the Ivy fund from its home base in Toronto, said late last month that "the energy sector is vastly under-owned in the United States."
"The upside is still very attractive long term," he added.
Mr. Sturm outlined three "return seeking" strategies that he uses to keep his fund ahead of the market. The first, he said, is "core and explore -- anchor the portfolio with world-leading companies as measured by profit margins, rather than size or familiarity." One such holding is Canadian Natural Resources, an oil and gas producer. Others include Brazilian pulp and paper producers.
He also tries to "augment portfolios with companies growing through the drill bit" -- that is, well-managed, well-financed companies growing independently of the market. One holding is Hurricane Hydrocarbons, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, and has production in Kazakhstan.
The third approach, he said, is to "make significant portfolio adjustments by subsectors based on prospects for commodity prices." In late 2000, when a barrel of oil was trading in the mid-$30's, Mr. Sturm said, he began reducing the fund's exposure to energy. By September 2001, when oil prices had fallen to the $20's, he began increasing it again, and energy now accounts for 55 percent of the portfolio. As of June 30, a barrel of oil traded at $26.81.
Mr. Sturm is also adding electricity producers, including Mirant in the United States. 
He also tries to diversify his holdings within natural resources. "We are very conscious of portfolio construction and diversify by commodity, capitalization, country and individual companies," he said. 
Broader diversification can be an important reason for adding energy to a portfolio. Henry D. Cavanna, managing director and senior equity portfolio manager for J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management, said that because "energy behaves somewhat differently from other sectors of the market," it was valuable "as part of a diversified approach to investing." 
"North American natural gas is most attractive," he said. "They're not finding more of it, and it is the cleanest, most efficient fuel in the world, so the price should go up." Among the gas producers, Mr. Cavanna likes Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum. He also favors the El Paso Corporation, which has natural gas pipelines, and Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco among the big integrated oil companies.
Tina J. Vital, an oil and gas equity analyst at Standard & Poor's, is particularly optimistic about the big integrated oil and gas companies and drilling companies, which gained 4.6 percent through June. But, she warned, "Enronitis has thrown a taint over the whole energy sector," even though Enron was classified as a "merchant trader," not an energy company. World tensions have also dampened investor enthusiasm for energy stocks, she said.
But energy is a long-term play, she added. "The fundamentals are there," she said. "Demand should rise."
AMONG her top picks are TotalFinaElf of France; Exxon Mobil; GlobalSantaFe, an offshore drilling company; and Weatherford International, an oil-field services company.
Investors of modest means might consider diversified funds that include sizable energy holdings in their portfolios.
Daniel J. Manion, co-manager of the Sentinel Common Stock fund in Montpelier, Vt., said that a little less than 12 percent of the fund's holdings were energy-related, compared with just over 7 percent for the S.& P. 500. Although the fund slipped 7.8 percent in the first six months of the year, that is almost six percentage points ahead of the overall market. The energy holdings are one reason for the outperformance.
Mr. Manion, who is responsible for the energy portion of the portfolio, shares Ms. Vital's enthusiasm for Exxon Mobil, Weatherford and GlobalSantaFe. He said his fund has not been hurt much by problems associated with companies like Enron and Dynegy because "we have very little exposure to that end -- trading, marketing," preferring to concentrate on "assets in the ground."
Similarly, William A. Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration analyst at UBS Warburg, said he was "pretty optimistic on the outlook medium term for natural gas." He predicted robust drilling activity but a drop in production capacity next year. 
Mr. Featherston has a strong-buy rating on two gas producers, Devon and Apache, and a buy on Kerr-McGee. A lot of investor money that has come out of the energy merchants has gone into the exploration and production stocks, he said, because they are asset plays for which "the accounting is pretty simple."
All the analysts caution that energy stocks are especially vulnerable to world political tensions, particularly in the Middle East, and that an overall economic recovery is needed to lift energy demand. But in the long run, they noted, energy remains fundamental to industrialized society.

HEADLINE: Once Hot, Now Not, Cool Hunters Are in a Deep Freeze 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA 

 BODY:
ONLY a year ago Lauren Holden, the former director of design inspiration at Nike, speculated that mainstream American teenagers would soon be wearing organic love beads, flaunting these secular rosaries as an insignia of hip. Around the same time, a number of other trend watchers for top corporations suggested that tight, calf-clutching trousers would supplant their slouchy wide-legged counterparts in the wardrobes of urban youth.
 Despite such predictions, these professed totems of vanguard chic have yet to register on the nation's fashion radar. Like capri pants for men, ballroom dancing, pipe smoking, skiboarding and wearing aprons on the street -- all once anointed by "cool hunters" as the next hot thing -- the predictions have been consigned to the scrap heap of fads, casualties of America's overheated pursuit of cool. 
 In line just behind them may be the cool hunters themselves, those anthropologists of the collective vibe who, digital cameras and notebooks in hand, scour the malls, the bodegas and skate parks from Antwerp to Los Angeles identifying youth trends for companies eager to market them. 
A street-savvy subset of the trend-forecasting industry, whose more mainstream practitioners include Faith Popcorn and Yankelovich Partners, cool hunters proliferated in the late 1990's faster than cross-stitched peasant shirts. 
Firms with names like Agent X, Lambesis, Youth Intelligence and Sputnik fed data from their scouts to clients like Coca-Cola and Sony; based on such street intelligence, Sony designed a Walkman using heavy-duty clips, like the chains young athletes wore, to hold it on. Converse created the One Star, a sneaker sandal inspired by the cholo look of Mexican girl gangs.
But now, although some cool hunters continue to prowl, the consensus is that their trade has become uncool, because it resulted in no more than a handful of successful products. 
"Cool hunting is totally over," said Irma Zandl, a marketing consultant who advises companies like Coca-Cola and Ford on trends among 18- to 24-year-olds. Her firm, the Zandl Group, has incorporated on-the-street interviews and photography for the past 15 years -- but only as one facet of a research system that also includes focus groups, demographic surveys and what it calls "crib chats," visits to the homes of young consumers. 
Corporations that relied exclusively on cool hunting to develop products have soured on it, she said, and she predicted that "in the next wave of budget cuts, cool hunters will be among the first to go." 
Ms. Zandl bemoaned the circumstances conspiring to give cool a bad name: a climate of anxiety after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, which made the restless pursuit of the new and the "in" irrelevant, and a lingering recession that has made cool too rich for most people's pocketbooks. 
Jane Rinzler Buckingham, who heads Youth Intelligence, a research firm that four years ago employed 10 part-time cool hunters, ages 14 to 30, still uses such trend scouts, but the number of clients willing to pay for their insights has dwindled in the last two years, she said. 
"With the difficulties in the economy, people don't have money to spend on lots of trends," said Ms. Buckingham, whose clients include Target and Cosmopolitan magazine. "People do want to know what's happening, what's next, but in terms of obsession with the hottest and the greatest, people are a little over it."
DeeDee Gordon, the former publisher of the L-Report, a quarterly tip sheet once deemed essential reading for students of hip, appears to regard even trend-spotting as a dirty word. 
Now a partner in Look-Look.com, an online youth culture consulting company, Ms. Gordon would not comment for this article. But several months ago she told Sportswear International, a trade monthly: "We don't consider ourselves a trend-forecasting agency. We consider ourselves an information and research company, a Bloomberg or Reuters." 
Ms. Gordon, who still collects much of her data through on-the-street interviews, added, "People need to check in and get information from kids the way they would check stocks." 
Some of the companies that used to count heavily on such independent-style sleuths would beg to differ. "Going out on the street and interviewing people -- we don't rely on that as much," said Michele Clark, manager of product trends for Lee Jeans. Ms. Clark recalled that last year Lee's in-house cool hunter raised eyebrows when she urged the company to produce clam diggers for men. "Our guy wasn't ready for that look," Ms. Clark said.
The biggest challenge that cool chasers face is the elusive nature of cool itself. "The true cool kid is a hard breed to put your finger on," Ms. Clark said. "You can't follow him around; he's going to change all the time. Copy him, and he'll move on to the next thing."
Which may be one reason that companies like Lee now factor in cool hunting as "only one piece in the research puzzle," Ms. Clark said. 
Similarly, Toyota continues to draw on cool hunting as only one small piece of its market research. The Scion bbX, the company's new concept car, with a boxy, Jeep-like design, was conceived in part with the input of an independent cool hunter, David Wales, who identifies youth lifestyle trends -- for instance, the ways in which teenagers use technology. 
"It takes somebody with a fresh perspective to go out and take notes," said Kevin Hunter, the vice president for design at Calty Research, Toyota's design studio in Newport Beach, Calif. He conceded, however, that none of Mr. Wales's specific insights have yet resulted in a tangible product. 
"Using one person can be too narrow," Mr. Hunter said. "I can see maybe using other people, architects or artists, specialists in a variety of fields." 
Increasingly pressed to prove themselves to corporate sponsors, many cool consultants have re-directed their focus from fads to macro trends: slow, sometimes meandering shifts in consumer attitudes and buying patterns, which may be more reliable than fads in helping large businesses plan their strategies. 
Ms. Zandl recalled tight pants for men as a fad that never took off. "We didn't see them happening, because people were overweight," she said. "The trend has been that people are getting fatter." 
Youth market researchers are also taking many of their style cues from mainstream kids, whose tastes proved more influential in the long term than those of their early-adaptor peers. 
In its quarterly Cassandra Report, Youth Intelligence differentiates between the brand preferences of "trendsetters" and "mainstream" kids. The latter, for instance, tend to favor Tommy Hilfiger or Polo Jeans over brands like Seven or Earl, just as, at the movies, they gravitate to crowd-pleasing performers like Adam Sandler or Tom Cruise over more adventurous actors like Russell Crowe. 
Lambesis, the Southern California ad agency that once employed Ms. Gordon, has gone back to basics in its forecasting -- combining man-in-the-street interviews with focus groups, quantitative surveys and the testing of ads for effectiveness. 
"The old trend forecasting methods relied too heavily on the interpretations of a single person: the cool guru," said Claire Brooks, the agency's director of research and planning. 
But at least one company, JNCO, a denim label in Los Angeles, is so committed to cool that it is bypassing the cool hunters and going directly to their sources -- the coolest kids on the block -- and hiring them. The company has been hiring street artists to help create products, rather than merely interpreting their tastes. Between 20 and 50 painters, some of them graffiti artists, are designing tribal logos, tattoo prints and unusual embroideries to be reproduced on T-shirts and jeans. 
"We're known as a street brand," said Michael Wallen, JNCO's president, "and we think hiring street talent is about as grass roots as you can get."

HEADLINE: Detroit's High-Speed Pursuit of the Police Car Market 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE P. BLUMBERG 

 BODY:
BAD boys, bad boys, what you gonna do when a Ford Crown Vic Police Interceptor rolls up behind you? Officers suggest that you pull over, if requested, even if you think your getaway car can outrun the Interceptor, with its 235-horsepower V-8.
 "The Ford is quick enough to reach pursuit speed without sacrificing distance between you and the car you are going after," said Police Officer Greg Reynolds of Chicago. "And it can maintain speed. It can cruise at 120 all day if you have to." 
 The Crown Victoria is the nation's most popular police cruiser, accounting for more than three-quarters of the market. But General Motors has gained a foothold with its Chevrolet Impala, now widely used in New York City, and DaimlerChrysler mounted a challenge this year with a special Dodge Intrepid. Although the Impala and Intrepid are front-drive midsize cars with V-6 engines, in contrast to the larger rear-drive Ford, they have passed muster in exhaustive track testing intended to help police agencies decide which vehicles to buy. 
Although popular, the Crown Victoria has come under a cloud because of fires that killed as many as 11 officers when their cars were struck at the rear, causing the fuel tanks to explode. Ford has created a task force to study new designs and to test safety shields and bladders inside the tanks, which are mounted between the rear bumper and axle. "It is an extremely safe vehicle that we are trying to make even safer," said Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman.
The cars have become a political issue in Arizona, where a trooper died in a crash last month, and Attorney General Janet Napolitano has urged a wide-ranging recall of the Crown Victoria and the similar Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car. Federal safety investigators have begun an investigation of 1992-2001 Crown Victorias, and lawsuits have been filed in Corpus Christi, Tex., and New Brunswick, N.J. Several police departments say they are reconsidering plans to buy more Crown Victorias.
Today's cop cars are like ordinary street cars, only more so. Special engine-control computer chips (and dual exhausts on Fords) enhance performance. More important, special police packages include heavy-duty brakes and steering, plus tougher suspension and engine parts, along with small features that mean a lot to an on-duty cop. For instance, there are cutouts in Ford's seats for a holster, extra-long safety belts, special wiring for lights and electronic gear and "stab plates" in the seatbacks to protect against assault from the rear.
Utility trumps luxury. "People think that police cars are magic 200 m.p.h. cars," said Dan Bedore, a Ford spokesman. "But they probably wouldn't want one. They are totally functional, with plain bucket seats and heavy rubber floormats. You can hose the whole car out if the prisoner vomits."
Ford has played a role on both sides of the cops-and-robbers horsepower race. Its low-priced V-8 sedan of 1932 gave the average criminal the ability to outrun the average police car. But in 1950, Ford offered the first police package -- a car for law enforcement with a variety of heavy-duty parts.
Officer Edwin Sanow of the Indiana Police Reserves, who is also editor of Law and Order magazine, said Ford won the police car wars from 1932 to 1968, with the Chrysler Corporation making inroads in the 1960's. Plymouth and Dodge led the market from 1969 to 1985, and the Chevy Caprice came to prominence in 1986-96.
G.M. then dropped the Caprice, leaving the Crown Victoria as the only car of the type that cops prefer: a rear-drive, four-door sedan with durable body-on-frame construction and an interior big enough to accommodate husky troopers, a profusion of electronic gear, bulging ticket books and a couple of perps.
Ford's V-8 is another attraction, even if it can't measure up to the 440-cubic-inch monster once offered by Chrysler. "Officers like lots of room to work, and the power a V-8 gives from off the line to top end," said Sgt. Keith Wilson of the Michigan State Police. "Lots of us are car and motorcycle guys, and engines can never be big enough for us. It's like if you're a carpenter, you want the biggest, baddest nail gun on the planet."
Aside from revived competition from the front-drive cars of G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, the S.U.V. craze has not bypassed police departments: Chevy Tahoes, Ford Explorers and Jeep Cherokees are among the utility vehicles being used for police work, particularly when it involves off-road duty or severe weather conditions.
The market is relatively small, with United States police departments buying about 80,000 vehicles a year, including up to 70,000 patrol cars, but highly visible. For manufacturers, these are flashing, wailing testimonials to their toughness.
Front-drive V-6's, like the Impala and Intrepid, are gaining fans among officers. Performance chips add power, and the cars get better fuel economy. With front-wheel drive, they handle better in bad weather, and they are more maneuverable.
Each year, the Michigan State Police and the National Institute of Justice put cars through rigorous tests for handling, acceleration and other factors. These tests don't pick a winner, but certify that the cars tested meet various standards for braking distances, acceleration times, road-course handling and other qualities. Within the parameters of the standards, some makes do better than others.
The most recent test, last fall, included 15 vehicles, including the Intrepid and Impala, the Chevrolet Camaro, the Ford Police Interceptor, the Hummer H1 and several sport utility vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet and Dodge.
Speaking of the Intrepid, Sergeant Wilson, one of the evaluators, said: "I felt the Dodge's handling was pretty neutral, and acceleration and top speed were very good. There's only 2 seconds' maximum difference between front- and rear-wheel drive on our handling course."
Officer Reynolds, from Chicago, agreed. "The Intrepid seemed to handle like a rear-wheel-drive car, and it also feels like a larger car, with very good acceleration." The Dodge was only half a second slower than the Ford on the handling course, has a higher top speed, and is faster to 120 m.p.h. Both beat the Impala.
In his private life, Sgt. Wilson drives a six-cylinder, front-drive Buick Regal, but he prefers the Ford when on patrol.
Captain Al Masek of the Connecticut State Police, which has ordered a few Impalas to supplement its fleet of Ford Interceptors, agreed. "We are staying with a full-frame vehicle, the Crown Vic," he said. "Because it's generally bigger and we think offers more protection and interior office room." He added that a front-drive car was more likely to suffer mechanical damage in a frontal crash, because the engine, transmission and driveline components are packed into a relatively small area.
Sticker prices for the three cars, in the $24,000 range, are largely irrelevant, given that the sales are often determined by sealed bids or negotiations. And the cost of the base car is just a start. "Communications gear, computer, G.P.S., light bars, spotlights and other equipment may add about $16,000," Captain Masek said.
More salvos are coming in the police-car wars. Ford has shown a concept version of its next Interceptor, based on the upgraded 2003 Crown Victoria. DaimlerChrysler and G.M. are developing rear-drive platforms, and it won't be long before those cars are on patrol.

HEADLINE: In Defense Of Our Wicked, Wicked Ways 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA COHEN 

DATELINE: BBURLINGTON, Vt. 

 BODY:
"I CAN stand here and look at this for hours," said James B. Twitchell as he parked himself in front of the bottled water section in City Market, just past the jars of $30-per-pound teas and behind the eight-foot display of imported olive oils. 
 Mr. Twitchell, a professor of English at the University of Florida in Gainesville, specializes in the Romantic poets, but his real obsession is shopping. Given the choice of reading literary theorists like Foucault or gazing at shelves stacked with artfully shaped bottles of water piled up like Jay Gatsby's beautifully tailored shirts, he would quickly choose the latter. "There is more that I can sustain myself with at the water aisle than in all of modern criticism," he said. 
 In a series of books, the latest of which is "Living It Up: Our Love Affair With Luxury" (Columbia University Press), Mr. Twitchell has detailed the consumption habits of Americans with all the scholarly delight of a field anthropologist who has discovered the secret courting rituals of a remote tribe. He is exquisitely attuned to the subtle gradations of status conferred by the labels on what people wear, eat, drink, drive and freeze ice cubes in. 
And he is not alone. Whether prompted by the 90's spendathon or the endless fascination not only with shopping, but with reading about shopping, a new title by an academic or journalist on the subject appears practically every week. Burlington, where Mr. Twitchell grew up and where he now spends summers, was singled out by David Brooks in his wickedly funny "Bobos in Paradise" as a model Latte Town, a city that has perfectly reconciled the mercenary instincts of the bourgeoisie with the artistic spirit of the bohemians to create an upscale consumer culture. 
What distinguishes Mr. Twitchell's study of excessive consumerism, though, is that he applauds it. To him, Evian and Pellegrino, Vermont Pure and Dasani are evidence of what could be called his trickledown theory of luxury: that the defining characteristic of today's society is the average person's embrace of unnecessary consumption, superficial indulgence, wretched excess and endless status-seeking. Oh, earthly paradise!
Once defined by exclusiveness, luxury is now available -- whether in the form of limited-edition coffee at Starbucks or Michael Graves tea kettles at Target -- to all. And that, Mr. Twitchell maintains, is a good thing. Sure, he argues in his book, buying essentially useless luxury items "is one-dimensional, shallow, ahistorical, without memory and expendable. But it is also strangely democratic and unifying. If what you want is peace on earth, a unifying system that transcends religious, cultural and caste differences, well, whoops!, here it is. The Global Village is not the City on the Hill, not quite the Emerald City, and certainly not quite what millennial utopians had in mind, but it is closer to equitable distribution of rank than what other systems have provided."
That is, to say the least, a minority report. For centuries, philosophers, artists and clerics railed against luxury. Ecclesiastical courts forbade most people from eating chocolate, drinking coffee or wearing colors like Prussian blue and royal purple -- "luxuria" that signaled living above one's God-ordered place. 
Thorstein Veblen offered the first modern critique of "conspicuous consumption" in his 1899 treatise "The Theory of the Leisure Class." Post-World War II social critics and economists extended Veblen's critique to the expanding middle class. John Kenneth Galbraith warned in "The Affluent Society" of the binge afflicting the postwar generation. Unwitting consumers, he said, were essentially suckered by admen and salesmen into spending money on things they didn't need. 
In his 1970 study "The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism" Daniel Bell argued that "the culture was no longer concerned with how to work and achieve, but with how to spend and enjoy." This trend, he warned, could end up undermining the very work ethic that made capitalism function. 
That, obviously, did not happen. If anything people worked more so they could spend more. In "The Overspent American," Juliet B. Schor noted that people no longer compared themselves with others in the same income bracket, but with the richer and more famous they saw on television, propelling them to spend more than they could afford. 
To Mr. Twitchell, the naysayers are scolds and spoilsports. Indoor plumbing, sewing machines, dishwashers, college educations, microwaves, coronary bypasses, birth control and air travel all began as luxury items for the wealthy. 
Nor are buyers mindlessly duped by canny advertisers into buying items they don't really want, he said. Quite the opposite. They enjoy the sensual feel of an Hermes silk tie, the briny delicacy of Petrossian caviar or simply the sensation of indulging themselves. These things may not bring happiness, but neither does their absence from the lives of people too poor to afford them.
It may seem an odd moment to champion luxury. The spectacular boom of the 90's now looks as if it was partly built on spectacular sleight of hand, with Enron, Global Crossing, Adelphia and WorldCom all recently admitting that billions in reported profits were nonexistent. The moment seems ripe for a chastened culture to repent its indulgences. Reassessing the get-and-spend ethic -- not defending consumerism -- might well be the defining current of the next few years. 
The problem with Mr. Twitchell's view, said Robert H. Frank, author of "Luxury Fever," is that our sense of what we need to live comfortably keeps spiraling upward. It is not that luxury spending isn't good for particular individuals, but that it is bad for society overall. "It's like when everybody stands up for a better view, you don't see better than before," Mr. Frank said from his home in Ithaca. There's a lot of waste in luxury spending. Instead of building safer roads or providing better health care, we are spending that money on bigger diamonds and faster cars. 
Mr. Twitchell is unpersuaded, however. Walking down Church Street, Burlington's busy pedestrian mall, he pointed out the transformation that the consumer culture has wrought in his hometown. Lean and tanned, with cropped gray hair and rounded tortoise-shell glasses, Mr. Twitchell looks a bit like Dennis the Menace's father after Dennis has grown up, moved across the country and given his old man a few years to recover. "Church Street once serviced needs, now it services desires," Mr. Twitchell said. The optician's shop is gone, and so is Sears and JCPenney. He pointed out the Ann Taylor store, where the Masonic temple used to be. A chic French children's store sits in the old bank.
"The key to modern luxe is that most of us can have a bit of it on the plate," Mr. Twitchell said. "I can't own a Lexus, but I can rent one. I can't go to Bermuda for a winter, but I can have a time share for a weekend. I don't own a yacht but I'm taking a Princess cruise." 
The process of democratization is mirrored in Mr. Twitchell's family history. His great-grandfather Andrew A. Buell made his fortune building wooden boxes from Adirondack lumber. Driving up Lodge Road to "the hill," where Mr. Buell built a red stone Romanesque mansion with a copper-topped tower, Mr. Twitchell passed the Burlington Country Club, which his grandfather Marshall Coleman Twitchell helped found. The family's sprawling former home is now a women's dormitory, and the surrounding 66-acre estate serves as the University of Vermont's Redstone campus. A couple of blocks from the hilltop, both in location and status, is the relatively modest white wooden house that Mr. Twitchell, the son of Marshall Coleman Twitchell Jr., an ophthalmologist, and his sisters grew up in. 
At that time, said Mr. Twitchell, now 59, one's social place was determined by birth, or "what I call the lucky sperm culture." Today, birth-ordained status has been supplanted by store-bought status. Mr. Twitchell has no regrets about this lost world. "Though I was a beneficiary of it, I'm glad it's over," he said. "There is something refreshing about the material world that downtown Burlington opened up." Compared to the traditional ways of marking status -- race, parentage, accent, private schools -- one's purchases are a preferable way of telling who's up and who's down, he said. 
On that point, Mr. Twitchell is not alone. Gary Cross, a historian at Penn State University, said that consumer culture in one sense is "democracy's highest achievement, giving meaning and dignity to people when workplace participation, ethnic solidarity and even representative democracy have failed."
Still, as Mr. Cross argued in 2000 in "An All-Consuming Century: Why Commercialism Won in Modern America," "most of us, no matter our politics, are repulsed by the absolute identity of society with the market and individual choice with shopping."
True enough, Mr. Twitchell readily conceded. But he maintains the critics are missing the essential characteristic of luxury spending. "Luxury has very little to do with money or things," he said. "Luxury is a story we tell about things," and it's ultimately the story we are after. That is, our purchases are imbued with elaborate narratives about the life we want to live. 
It is advertisers and manufacturers who give objects meaning by constructing the stories about them, Mr. Twitchell said, and that meaning is as much a source of desire as the object itself. Think of the elaborate fantasies spun by marketers like Ralph Lauren and Martha Stewart.
It goes for whatever you're buying, whether it's Jimmy Choo, Birkenstock or Payless shoes. When Mr. Twitchell, a dedicated factory outlet shopper, flashes his member's card at Sam's Club, "the allure is not just that I'm saving money," he said, "but that I'm smarter and savvier, that I'm duping the duper."
Or consider an experiment he performed on his colleagues. He told some English professors that he was going to spend $6,000 to buy an 1850 copy of Wordsworth's "Prelude." Brilliant idea, everyone said. A few days later, Mr. Twitchell told the same colleagues that he had changed his mind and was going to use the $6,000 to buy a used BMW. "I could have said that I was investing in a collection of Beanie Babies comics or a diamond pinkie ring for the shocked response that I got," he wrote.
Critics of consumption will say they are making a moral argument, Mr. Twitchell said, but "often what is condemned as luxury is really just a matter of taste."
To Mr. Twitchell, as long as human beings crave sensation, they will desire material goods and luxurious ones at that, Wall Street scandals notwithstanding. "If this year it's Enron and WorldCom, then another year it was Long-Term Capital Management," he said. 
Recessions may come and go, but consumption is eternal. The ad slogan is right: Diamonds are forever.

HEADLINE: Bringing Discipline (and Scorecards) to Nursing Homes 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

DATELINE: FORT SMITH, Ark. 

 BODY:
SITTING in a conference room at the headquarters here of Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home chain, William R. Floyd, its chairman and chief executive, is arguing that providing nursing care to the elderly is not all that different from selling tacos at a fast-food chain.
 "There really are an enormous number of similarities between this and the world I came from," said Mr. Floyd, 57, an intense but self-effacing executive who spent seven years at PepsiCo, most of them at Taco Bell. Recruited to Beverly in April 2000, he was appointed chief executive 10 months later and has spent the last year and a half working to turn around the beleaguered company. 
 Beverly, which had revenue of $2.71 billion last year, operates multiple units, just as a chain of restaurants does, he said. The company also relies heavily on low-wage employees -- nursing assistants -- to provide care. "Taco Bell competes with Beverly for these people," Mr. Floyd said. 
But there are obvious differences. To an industry known for lax, decentralized management of its facilities and little innovation, Mr. Floyd brings a keen emphasis on accountability and is experimenting with more than a dozen new, potentially more profitable health care services.
By setting clear financial goals for his managers and by linking their pay to the quality of care, he has already improved the company's profitability and says it is providing better care.
Before he can declare victory, however, Mr. Floyd faces many challenges, most recently a criminal investigation by the state of California into 46 citations for inadequate patient care at 20 facilities. While the incidents took place from 1998 to 2001, they are a stark reminder of Beverly's frequent run-ins with regulators over how it treats its residents and the prevailing image of a nursing home as a place where no one wants to be.
Last year, for example, a Beverly home in Santa Barbara, Calif., that accounted for 25 of the 46 citations, was fined by the state health department for failing "to properly care for a resident who was fed through a stomach tube, resulting in severe infection and his death." That nursing home, which is also the subject of several private lawsuits, is part of the state's inquiry.
Beverly sold that home last year and is in discussions with regulators about the citations. A settlement could be reached as soon as this month, most likely including a substantial fine. The company also expects to be asked to plead guilty to a criminal charge, but has made no decision on that. In a case brought by California last year against another national chain, the Sun Healthcare Group, a unit of that company pleaded "no contest" to a felony charge and the whole company agreed to improve staffing and oversight.
Beyond the regulatory cases, Beverly and the entire industry, of course, face tremendous uncertainty about federal and state reimbursement policies. When Medicare changed how it paid for care a few years ago, many operators went through bankruptcy reorganizations, including public companies like Kindred Healthcare and Genesis Health Ventures.
Investors remain wary of the industry, and they are unlikely to warm to it. Cuts in state and federal budgets for nursing home care are a distinct possibility as states retrench because of falling tax receipts and as Congress debates funding for Medicare. While praising Beverly's management, Friess Associates, an investment management company that had been a large holder of the stock, recently sold its position over concerns about possible cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates.
Mr. Floyd refuses to adopt what he calls the industry's tendency to view itself as a victim, but he still faces the daunting task of convincing regulators, investors, the public and his own employees that Beverly can escape its past. Over the years, regulators have persistently raised questions about the quality of care that Beverly provides, and the new management team must somehow take what is essentially a low-growth and low-margin business and create something dynamic.
WHEN Mr. Floyd arrived two years ago, Beverly was close to bankruptcy. That February, it had agreed to pay the federal government $175 million to settle the industry's largest allegation of Medicare fraud. The company's stock, which traded as high as $17.50 in late 1997, had plummeted to a low of $2.50.
"He asked a lot of tough questions," said Marilyn R. Seymann, a Beverly director who spent several hours with Mr. Floyd before he began his new job. "I sugar-coated nothing."
In 1998, he left as chief executive of Choice Hotels International, which franchises the Comfort Inn, Econo Lodge and other brands, after finding that he did not have the support of the board or the previous chief executive. He spent the next year and a half, when not climbing mountains, considering his options.
Upon his arrival, Mr. Floyd saw an opportunity to make Beverly a leader in an industry badly in need of one. Despite its leading position, Beverly accounts for just 3 percent of the nation's 1.8 million nursing-home beds, with many of its homes in California, Pennsylvania and Arkansas. Most rivals are for-profit businesses, ranging from large public companies like Manor Care to scattered regional chains to small operators. Many facilities struggled or even failed after the Medicare cuts of the late 1990's and fierce competition from assisted-living centers -- residences that offer some services and appeal to people who shudder at the thought of being in a nursing home.
Because many states limit the number of nursing-home beds, the competition is not as intense as it might be otherwise. "Within a market, they compete with each other over relationships with referral sources," like hospitals, said Jerry L. Doctrow, a senior analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker.
Many of Beverly's residents arrive directly from hospitals. After receiving some form of rehabilitative therapy, about half leave within six months.
Mr. Floyd said he found a company with no clear direction and with a management team that was badly demoralized. He quickly replaced many of Beverly's senior managers. Blaise J. Mercadante, a marketing colleague from Taco Bell who also spent some time as a senior marketing executive at Universal Studios, now oversees marketing and business innovation. Jeffrey P. Freimark, who had run the Grand Union supermarket chain while it tried to reorganize under bankruptcy laws, was recruited as chief financial officer.
Mr. Floyd also introduced Beverly to the kind of accountability found at companies like PepsiCo, where managers must deliver results, said Kevin Jones, a portfolio manager at ICM Asset Management, which has invested in Beverly stock. Before Mr. Floyd arrived, "there wasn't a whole lot of focus on execution," Mr. Jones said.
The new chief executive has been relentless in demanding performance from individual facilities, one-fifth of which he identified as poor performers in early 2001. Each is judged by a scorecard, on which factors like pretax income, employee turnover, occupancy, bad debt and quality of care are measured. Many have improved, and 14 were closed or sold last year.
Because Florida accounted for most of Beverly's liability costs and just 10 percent of revenue, the company also simply left that market, selling about 50 nursing homes early this year.
Although Beverly remains significantly less profitable than Manor Care, which had operating margins of 13.7 percent last year, compared with Beverly's 9 percent, its financial position has improved. Its margin reached 9.6 percent in the first quarter of 2002. The company reported a loss last year, largely a result of the settlement with the federal government and a $238 million write-off, but cash from operations reached $221 million, compared with $37 million in 2000.
Beverly's stock, which topped $12 a year ago before a fresh wave of concerns over reimbursement levels, is now trading at $7.30.
"It's a turnaround company in an industry that is scarred," said Tom Price, who works for MFP Investors, which has invested in Beverly and hopes for more improvement. "There's another whole round of rationalization the business can do."
Beverly's facilities are now under much tighter corporate control, and Mr. Floyd has replaced one-third of the local managers. "I preach the gospel of the importance of the front lines," he said. Area directors of operations are now responsible for about 10 homes each, about half the number they had been overseeing.
Mr. Floyd spent a week at a California facility when he first joined Beverly. He worked all three shifts at the home, working side by side with a nursing assistant, even helping to change residents' diapers.
At Taco Bell, he had asked potential executives to work with a restaurant crew, and he is now asking every senior executive at Beverly to work for some time at a nursing home. "You gain so much respect," he said. "People will walk over broken glass for you."
To increase occupancy levels and reduce its dependence on government payments, Beverly is emphasizing new services like units specializing in the care of Alzheimer's patients, many of whom pay privately and therefore higher fees than Medicare or Medicaid. Located in separate wings, these new units are intended to provide something of a home-like atmosphere with carpeting, wallpaper and comfortable furniture, in contrast to the linoleum floors and institutional feel of the industry's typical facilities. Patients are given much more individual care and can take part in special programs.
Seventy-six of Beverly's facilities now offer Alzheimer's units, and the company plans to add about 30 more by year-end. In addition to 29 assisted-living centers, Beverly also offers home health care, therapy and hospice care.
Mr. Floyd, however, must still fundamentally rethink how Beverly operates in an industry that is accused of largely warehousing the people it is supposed to care for. Beverly is already trying to innovate, by introducing strength-training programs, for example, that use special exercise equipment that it developed with the Nautilus Group. It is also exploring how to personalize care by assigning a team of employees to a specific small group of residents.
And Mr. Floyd has yet to answer a big question for Beverly: "How do you grow the company?" said Nancy L. Weaver, an analyst who follows the company at Stephens Inc.
He is trying to make the most of Beverly's skills, like providing therapy and nursing care, whether at someone's home or at another facility. Beverly's rehabilitative therapy unit, for example, renamed Aegis Therapies, accounted for more than $180 million in revenue last year.
UNDER the direction of Mr. Mercadante, the former Taco Bell executive, Beverly is also exploring other related businesses. Some are already generating revenue, like ones providing management and procurement services to other nursing homes. It is also working with some drug companies to find whether the data its homes collect about its patients' medication may be useful in expanding the use of some drugs.
Among the other possibilities it is considering are services to older prison inmates. The proportion of prisoners aged 55 and above is expected to double, to about 20 percent, by 2012.
But improving the quality of care remains the main challenge. Some consumer advocates say Beverly still provides poor care at many of its sites. "I haven't seen a difference," said Patricia L. McGinnis, the executive director of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, a nonprofit group.
To focus attention on quality issues, Mr. Floyd has linked compensation directly to quality improvements. Sixty percent of the bonus for a local manager depends on quality factors, like whether regulators find fault with care during their yearly reviews and how many residents are being restrained or heavily medicated. Even 20 percent of the bonus for corporate executives is tied to better quality.
Trying to reduce the number of patients suffering from pressure sores, for example, Beverly bought $2.5 million worth of special bedding. The company set a goal of having no more than an average of 3 percent of its patients suffer from bed sores; it managed to get the average down to a new low of 2.6 percent, according to Patrice K. Acosta, the senior vice president of professional services.
"The real issue is changing the culture," said Mr. Floyd, adding that such changes usually take a couple of years. "I'm seeing a momentum being established."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
The Endless City vs. Its Closing Frontier

BYLINE:  By GREGORY RODRIGUEZ; Gregory Rodriguez is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research institute.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES is the only big city built on the promise of the suburban dream. Unlike New York, where migrants move to be part of a continuing civic enterprise, the genius and fundamental weakness of Los Angeles is that you rarely feel obliged to be part of anything. Nothing short of cataclysmic events like riots, earthquakes or a Lakers championship can ignite a strong sense of civic unity.
 Southern California's appeal has always been its temperate weather and the allure of the good life. Yet the power of its idyllic image also sowed the seeds of its destruction. Migrants who came to lead a serene suburban existence now find themselves in a sprawling, traffic-jammed metropolis. This tension between the city's contemporary urban reality and its founding suburban myth now threatens to tear Los Angeles apart. 
 This November, city voters will decide whether the San Fernando Valley, home to roughly 40 percent of Los Angeles residents, will secede from the nation's second largest city. Locally, the issue is cast as one of services, governance and revenue flows. Nationally, the issue has been seen as a clash between city and suburb. Yet at the heart of the battle are more basic issues of urban identity. Secessionists are tapping into the Valley's longtime sense of suburban cultural grievance. However, they are doing so at a time when America's quintessential suburb is as urban as the rest of Los Angeles.
If suburbia is a collective effort to lead a private life, then Los Angeles has been the most private of cities. It was a suburban city decades before America became the first suburban nation. In the 1920's, as Midwesterners flocked to the region, developers built close to 3,200 subdivisions and 250,000 detached homes. By 1930, a stunning 94 percent of dwellings in Los Angeles were single-family homes. 
But the city fathers envisioned a major metropolis. Men like William Mulholland, who built the California Aqueduct, and Harry Chandler, who ran The Los Angeles Times, willed a new kind of low-density, multipolar big city into existence. What they did not do was warn the suburbanites that greatness would come at a price.
"There is a constant friction in L.A. between the fundamentally suburban vision of the life we want to lead and our aspirations to be a great city," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University.
Even as Los Angeles evolved into an expansive and decentralized Western city, its cultural elite still took its cues from more traditional Eastern cities. They mimicked the New York intelligentsia's contempt for suburbia, and the San Fernando Valley became the most convenient target for their disdain. Just as sophisticated Manhattanites often deride the "bridge and tunnel crowd," residents of tony West Los Angeles weren't above feeling superior to Valley residents. 
Yet, unlike most American suburbs, which developed beyond city limits, the Valley could never find solace in sovereignty. Annexed by Los Angeles in 1915, the San Fernando Valley became a bedroom community where professional and middle-class families could carve out quiet lives within the city limits. 
"It's the one suburb that is an appendage to its tormentor," said D. J. Waldie, author of "Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir." "In an era when cultural elites identify themselves by their aesthetic privilege, many feel it necessary to diminish the popular, the ordinary, the everyday, the suburban."
But half-century-old stereotypes do not do justice to America's contemporary suburban reality. Once scorned for being racially homogenous, economically parasitic and culturally vacuous, suburbia is now more likely to be mixed, viable and vital.
"Much of this country's creativity -- like Silicon Valley or the biotech industry -- is being done by people who eat at Fuddruckers, shop at big box malls and live in suburbia," said David Brooks, the author of "Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There."
Last year, a Brookings Institution study found that racial and ethnic diversity in the nation's suburbs rose substantially in the 1990's and that nonwhites were responsible for the bulk of suburban population gains.
THE San Fernando Valley, close to 90 percent white and overwhelmingly middle class in 1960, is now one-third foreign born and almost half Latino. Its mixed economy routinely outperforms the rest of the city in job creation. 
With 1.35 million residents, a new Valley city would be the sixth-largest city in the country, as well as one of the most diverse. Like other big cities, it would have sizable pockets of poverty, blight and gang violence. The crime, drugs and dilapidated housing in some Valley neighborhoods rival the worst conditions in the more well-known inner-city areas of Los Angeles.
"Demographic differences are not the cause of the Valley secession movement," said William Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. "It's about the periphery coming back to bite the core. They are saying they are just as important."
Disgruntled residents would once have just moved to the new subdivision. For at the root of secessionism is the same urge to elude urbanity that created the city's sprawl. But now that the city has reached its geographic limits and environmentalists seek to preserve the remaining open space, there are no new places to go. 
"We can't act out our suburban dream anymore," says William Fulton, an urban planner and author of "The Reluctant Metropolis." "So what do we do?"
One option has been to turn inward. In the last decade, Los Angeles has become a city of neighborhoods. The 1992 riots were a powerful catalyst for this movement. Many neighborhoods resurrected names that had long been forgotten. Others invented new ones. "Los Angeles traditionally looked outward," says Gregory J. Fischer, a local historian. "Well, there's no 'out' to look at anymore. We've gone as far as we can go. The logical next step is to look back at what you've created."
Yet rather than come to terms with the city they helped build, advocates for secessionism are harking back to the sales pitch at the heart of the history of Los Angeles. "Secessionism tells us that L.A. is still vulnerable to the seductive siren call of suburban narcissism," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. But this seduction is only possible because Los Angeles has never bothered to recalibrate its self-image and draft a new post-suburban narrative. Los Angeles still considers itself the quintessentially anti-urban city.
The problems of the early 1990's made it fashionable for the city that had long fancied itself a paradise to be characterized as a new circle of hell. Utopia became dystopia. But caricatures aside, Angelenos had not seriously grappled with their city's identity until secessionism gained momentum over the last few years.
It was the threat of secession that led to the inclusion of neighborhood councils in the new city charter. More recently, secessionism has prompted talk of splitting the city into boroughs. There is debate about the value of bigness and the beauty of smallness. Complicating matters, Hollywood secession is also on the November ballot.
"Los Angeles was built on the idea that one could create a more perfect place, a New Jerusalem, one's own private Idaho," said Mr. Waldie. The question now is whether voters will be able to reimagine their city as something other than heaven or hell. If Los Angeles is to remain whole, Angelenos will first have to embrace the imperfections of their urban reality and come to terms with the closing of their suburban frontier.

HEADLINE: Capitalism Depends on Character 

BYLINE:  By Jean Strouse; Jean Strouse is the author of "Morgan: American Financier."

 BODY:
When the late 19th-century counterparts of Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing got into trouble, the investment banker J. Pierpont Morgan took over, allegedly growling at rogue managers, "Your company belongs to my clients." 
 The companies in question were railroads, which brought about productivity changes as revolutionary (and as lucrative) as those derived from information and communications technology 100 years later. In the booming 1880's, 75,000 miles of new track were laid, more than in any previous decade anywhere in the world, and the capital invested in American railroads rose from $2.5 billion in 1870 to $10 billion by 1890. The size of private fortunes soared: railroad barons worth more than $100 million in 1889 included Jay Gould, Leland Stanford and the heirs of Cornelius Vanderbilt. 
 The prospect of immense wealth led, as it does in all speculative bubbles, to overbuilding, fierce competition, widespread corruption and economic collapse. Wildcat promoters sold worthless securities to eager investors with dollar signs in their eyes, or built shoddy roads parallel to existing tracks, hoping to force the older lines to buy them out. Buccaneer managers manipulated the securities of their own roads, plundered capital reserves, bribed politicians and formed bogus construction companies to charge exorbitant fees that they willingly paid -- to themselves.
Often it was hard to tell good guys from bad guys: "Commodore" Vanderbilt and Jay Gould ran successful railroads using outlaw tactics. Government had neither the power nor the mandate to impose order on this chaotically growing industry. J. P. Morgan did -- since he controlled its access to capital. 
His firm raised funds for America's railroads by selling bonds and preferred stock abroad. The emerging United States economy did not have the resources to build enormously expensive roads, but foreign investors who had been rooked by profiteering pirates were not about to send more money 3,000 miles across the Atlantic without some guarantee that it would be safe. Morgan essentially provided that guarantee, choosing solid properties and taking what he called "moral responsibility" for companies whose securities he underwrote. When a road he had backed went bankrupt, he and his partners stepped in, saying in effect "we control the company, or no bailout." The pattern of what came to be called "Morganization" involved scrutinizing every aspect of a railroad's operations, restructuring its finances, raising capital, settling lawsuits, firing managers, hiring new ones, appointing directors, and keeping vigilant watch over the company's finances, sometimes for decades, until solvency was restored.
Morgan had plenty of critics -- he was a domineering plutocrat more concerned with building giant trusts and maintaining the international value of the dollar than with the struggles of American farmers and workers or the social costs of industrialization. Nonetheless, in a time of cowboy capitalism he was an honest broker representing thousands of widely dispersed stock- and bondholders who owned "new economy" railroads but had no effective control over the managers who ran them. In the course of his career he helped make American markets credible to foreign investors, kept the flow of capital moving east to west and transformed railroad securities from high-risk speculations into stable, long-term investments.
What the new new economy needs in the wake of recent scandals is a force comparable to Morgan's. Someone has to stand behind the fundamental accuracy of a company's financial statements in a legally responsible way, but derelict auditors, executives and boards of directors have defaulted, either by design or inexcusable ignorance. A second tier of guardians -- Wall Street analysts, rating agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission -- failed to issue warnings of corporate deceit. As a result, foreign investors are no less spooked than they were in the 1890's, and American shareholders have flipped from euphoria to gloom. Excessive fear is choking off the market's access to capital, hurting sound companies as well as crooks -- even though the economy appears to be recovering and there are few attractive alternatives to American stocks. The evil-doers at WorldCom, Enron and company have done more than Al Qaeda to undermine confidence in American capitalism. Not since the 1930's has there been such a shudder of revulsion against big business. 
To some extent we're in the mop-up that inevitably follows market manias. (Referring to the boom-and-bust cycles of 19th-century America, John Kenneth Galbraith said that the intervals between panics corresponded roughly with the time it took people to forget the last disaster.) Potential chief executives are now doing rigorous due diligence before taking big jobs. Arthur Andersen is out of business, Enron is in court, WorldCom is toast. Punishing losses have made it clear that investing entails real risk. But the deposed miscreants made off with millions while company employees and ordinary investors were wiped out.
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said recently that corporate executives who falsely certify company finances should go to jail -- which sounds like a good idea, although white collar criminals can usually afford terrific defense lawyers. Capital markets do not work effectively unless people believe in their essential integrity. Investors will only take necessary risks if the game isn't rigged. 
In today's vast, complex markets, no one can play J. P. Morgan, but a remark he made near the end of his life is worth recalling. Asked by the lawyer for a congressional investigating committee in 1912 whether bankers issued commercial credit only to people who already had money or property, Morgan said, "No sir; the first thing is character." The skeptical lawyer repeated his question and Morgan, in Victorian terminology, elaborated on his answer -- "because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom."

HEADLINE: Intrigue at the Palazzo Agnelli 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL with DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
AS Gianni Agnelli, the patriarch of Italian industry and dynastic head of the Fiat auto and industrial empire, lay in a New York hospital bed in May and early June, even some of his best friends had sadly given up hope that he would survive prostate cancer.
 But when a rumor of the death of the 81-year-old Mr. Agnelli swept Italian markets, Fiat's ailing stock leapt by 6 percent. Some investors hoped that the departure of a man whom Italians call "l'Avvocato" -- the lawyer -- would hasten the sale of the chronically money-losing auto division that has powered the intertwined destinies of Fiat and the Agnelli family since the company was founded in 1899. 
 To investors, it was Mr. Agnelli's stubborn commitment to his family's roots in the car business that was preventing the company -- whose fortunes he once said were synonymous with Italy's -- from entering a new, post-automotive era. 
Mr. Agnelli, of course, survived and is undergoing chemotherapy at his home near Turin. But the incident provided a foretaste of what may well be in store for him, his dynasty and his business. 
Now the honorary chairman of Fiat, he has reigned for an often triumphant, often turbulent 36 years during which myth and man have fused in an artfully tended image of raffish wisdom, international celebrity and Machiavellian manipulation. 
To many Italians, he is an institution whose influence once seemed boundless. Besides the flagship Fiat, his family holding companies control a newspaper and a star-studded soccer team. His pivotal influence on public life here was rewarded with life membership in the Italian senate. In his prime, paparazzi trailed him from Alpine ski resorts to the yacht basins of the Riviera. Along the way, he became the personification of the nation's ability to strut on a global stage long before globalization became a concept, an enduring symbol of Italian manhood blending playboy looks and entrepreneurial grit.
Yet, as the exaggerated rumors of his death spread, it appeared as if the empire had entered its darkest hour, deeply in hock to the banks and unloved by investors, its top management in turmoil and its auto plants producing far more cars than anyone seemed to want to buy. Since its peak in 1998, Fiat's stock has dropped to about 12.9 euros, from nearly 45 euros. 
"This is a very bad moment for Fiat; we are not going to hide that," Susanna Agnelli, Mr. Agnelli's 80-year-old sister, said in an interview in her elegant dove-gray sixth-floor apartment, filled with books and fine paintings, overlooking the Quirinale Palace in central Rome.
After a recent spate of loans, asset disposals and other maneuvers, Fiat's chairman, Paolo Fresco, contends that the company has some breathing room. But its travails could scarcely have come at a worse time for the family that has long regarded it as both fief and cash cow. 
THE Agnelli dynasty, created in the late 19th century by Gianni Agnelli's grandfather, Giovanni, embraces about 150 descendants -- cousins, nephews, nieces, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Of them, some work, some do not, and 80 have shares in the family-owned Giovanni Agnelli & Company, which controls the empire. This year, Forbes magazine estimated the family's worth at $2.3 billion, down from $5 billion in 2000, and shares of two publicly traded holding companies controlled by the Agnellis have lost about two-thirds of their market value in the last few years, largely because of their exposure to Fiat.
In other words, the number of family members clamoring for a slice of the pie is growing just as the pie is shrinking, and just as the family's control over the business faces an unparalleled challenge from bankers demanding reductions in Fiat's debt. That, said Antonio Tonioli, an analyst at ING Barings in Milan, means that the family's fortunes depend directly on Fiat's ability to make the car business profitable or to sell it.
With Mr. Agnelli hobbled by illness, those who follow the family's fortunes much as Kremlin watchers once studied the Soviet empire perceive two important shifts in power. In one, Mr. Agnelli's often-eclipsed younger brother Umberto, 68, who had been shoved aside in a palace conspiracy worthy of the Medicis, has gained a measure of influence. In the other, John Philip Elkann, 26, a grandson of Gianni Agnelli, seems to have been designated heir apparent, a move that may ruffle investors' feathers at a time when corporate governance is a prime concern.
These chapters have unfolded after a long and painful story, one that recalls a Kennedyesque blend of glamour, power and loss. In it, untimely death has stalked the Agnelli family, offering uncanny parallels between the early demise of the parents of Gianni and Umberto Agnelli and that of both of their sons.
The newest uncertainties became apparent in 2000 when Fiat, worried about the future of Fiat Auto as an independent company, sold 20 percent of it to General Motors in a $2.4 billion stock swap. G.M. saw the deal as strengthening its position in Europe, where it owns the Opel and Saab brands, and in South America, where Fiat has interests in auto- and truck-making, in components and in other industrial plants, mainly in Brazil and Argentina. 
But the deal also required G.M. to acquire the remainder of Fiat Auto from 2004 to 2009 under a put option to be exercised by Fiat. In light of the company's slide, some analysts have begun to question the wisdom of that agreement. "At the time, it must have seemed like a good idea; I guess you had to be there," said Ron Tadross, an analyst at Bank of America. "Right now, I can't see a good reason why you would do this transaction."
Last year, Fiat Auto and General Motors Europe had combined losses of $1.3 billion. "Given that the financial situation of both companies has deteriorated, there's concern from investors," said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Far from strengthening G.M. in Europe, the Fiat deal may well weaken it.
Much more upheaval is likely. Fiat Auto has long relied on a protected Italian market, but the gradual removal of barriers has exposed it to European and Japanese rivals. Though it is still heavily dependent on Italian sales, its share of the home market has dropped to about 31 percent from almost two-thirds in the early 1990's. Fiat's share of the Western European car market is down to 8.8 percent from 10.4 percent only a year ago. Its range of cars and dealership facilities is limited. Although it owns the once-exclusive Lancia and Alfa Romeo marques, its high-end cars are not serious challengers to BMW or Mercedes, while its midrange and small cars lag behind those of rivals like Volkswagen.
This year alone, Fiat Auto, which has not reported a profit since 1997, expects to lose at least a further $540 million, the same as last year.
According to former Fiat managers who spoke on condition of anonymity, Fiat Auto's difficulties stem in part from its failure to break away from its small-car roots in the 1990's, when it became apparent that the cost of technology that buyers expect in features like antilock brakes and electric windows would cut the profit margin on small cars to zero.
"At a certain moment, they should have concentrated on building cars that people wanted to buy," said Ms. Agnelli, the only senior member of the dynasty who agreed to be interviewed. "They should have concentrated on making better cars."
In May, Fiat had to negotiate a rescue package of 3 billion euros (nearly $3 billion) with Italian banks in return for a pledge to cut its net debt of 6.5 billion euros by half by year-end. 
To do that, the company has begun selling assets, including 14 percent of Italenergia, its energy division, and a one-third stake in Ferrari, the maker of luxury sports cars that is one of its crown jewels. In June, it sold $200 million worth of new shares in its American agricultural tractor unit, Case New Holland. But the pressure to cut debt further is building fast.
Teksid, Fiat's foundry business, is being sold to Questor, a private American finance company, and more disposals of Fiat subsidiaries are in the works, including its Magnetti Mirelli auto components business and its Comau tooling unit. Mr. Fresco has also hinted that Fiat might reduce its stake in its truck and aerospace units.
But the core of the rescue lies with the loan extended by Italian banks. Ominously, that package stipulates that if Fiat does not meet its debt-reduction target, the loan can be converted into additional shares, diluting the Agnelli family's 30 percent stake in Fiat unless family members put up around a billion euros to soak up the new shares. "The family's influence on the company could be under threat unless the company meets these debt targets," said John Lawson, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London.
Significantly, the family has been systematically reducing its exposure to Fiat. A decade ago, Fiat represented 80 percent of the Agnellis' portfolio; now it is less than half.
As it diversified, the family took stakes in dozens of businesses, including tourism, paper and the Rinascente retail chain. It has long owned the Juventus soccer team in Turin and now has a controlling stake in Club Mediterranee, the vacation company. Through Fiat, the Agnellis branched out into insurance and energy, and Fiat owns La Stampa, the Turin newspaper. 
The family exerts control through what Italians call a cascade of companies, starting with the 100 percent-owned limited partnership, Giovanni Agnelli & Company, in which Gianni Agnelli has a 30 percent stake. Other shareholders are spread among the descendants of the two branches of the founding family, the Agnellis and the Nasis. That company, in turn, holds 100 percent of the family holding company IFI, which in turn has a 54 percent stake in another holding company, IFIL. The partnership owns 60 percent of the Exor Group, another link in the chain.
Between them, those holding companies, which are run by Umberto, hold 30 percent of Fiat.
But already, Fiat's woes are eating into the family's prime interests: in June, shares in IFI and IFIL fell as dividends were cut, reducing family members' income. 
For all that, said Stephen Reitmann, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, "the family is still enormously influential." 
That was clear in recent weeks, as Fiat juggled its top managers, trying to satisfy the family and outside investors. In June, Paolo Cantarella, the chief executive, was ousted as part of a realignment of Fiat management and was replaced by Gabriele Galateri, who had been chief executive of the family holding companies run by Umberto. In an unusual move, Mr. Galateri was named co-chief executive, along with Mr. Fresco, who remains chairman.
THE maneuver, though, was seen as furthering the influence of a younger brother who had long been sidelined in Fiat's affairs.
"Now, for obvious reasons of health, it's Umberto that has the ball," one friend of the family said. "In biographical terms, this is his trial, his opportunity. Even if it comes late in life, is he going to be just the liquidator of the family fortune or is there going to be something more than that?"
In May, Umberto told shareholders in the IFI holding company that Fiat's car business should be given every chance to revive its fortunes as part of the Fiat empire, but hinted that this was not the only option. "But if it is not possible, " he said, "we must give these people the possibility of working in the best and most calm way possible."
That was the broadest public hint that the younger Mr. Agnelli is less attached than Gianni to Fiat Auto, which accounts for less than one-fourth of the family's investments. 
But Umberto's ascent has occurred after many painful years. As the two men grew up, it was Gianni, with his hallmark fashion statements (watch worn over the cuff of his shirt, button-down collars never buttoned), his amours (Pamela Harriman among them), and his contacts (the Shah of Iran, the Kennedys, Mikhail Gorbachev) who stole the limelight. Still, about a dozen years ago, Gianni began speaking of Umberto as his likely successor.
That plan fell afoul of Cesare Romiti, called Il Duro -- the tough guy. He was Fiat's chief executive from 1976 to 1996 and later the chairman who, until he left the company in 1998, was seen by Agnelli watchers as a close ally of Mediobanca, the secretive Milan investment bank that masterminded much of Italy's idiosyncratic post-war capitalism.
So strong was his influence, according to Giancarlo Galli, author of "The Agnellis," published in Rome in 1997, that if Gianni Agnelli was emperor then Mr. Romiti was his Bismarck-like chancellor. Some former managers contend that Fiat's woes derive from the fact that the two men spent more time plotting their continued control of Fiat in the 1990's than on devising a strategic vision for it, particularly the car business.
The reality, Mr. Galli wrote, was that "neither Gianni nor Cesare had any intention of passing the baton, in spite of age, the company's oft-changed statutes or the petty conspiracies of the court," a reference to the family members and managers in Mr. Agnelli's circle.
Mr. Romiti, in this account, ended all talk of Umberto as a successor. But it was the question of succession that nonetheless brought terrible pain to the family. Early on, Umberto's only son, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, had been anointed, only to die of a rare brain tumor at the age of 33 in 1997. Three years later, in 2000, Gianni's troubled only son, Edoardo, committed suicide after a life near an empire that would never admit him to its inner conclaves. 
At 46, Edoardo had apparently come to realize that his track record of dabbling in drugs, mysticism and oriental religions, of long journeys to India and Africa and of theories about the democratization of the workplace would preclude him from the succession. On Nov. 15, 2000, his Fiat Croma car was found on a 240-foot-high road bridge and his body was found beside a stream below. 
For Gianni, "it was a terrible, terrible blow, more than he ever said or expressed," said Ms. Agnelli, his sister. "He considered it was a failure on his part." For many Italians, she said, the death of Giovanni Alberto -- a golden boy blessed with looks, wealth and glamour -- "seemed an unwanted punishment for something, for having had too much."
By the time of Edoardo's death, though, it had become evident that Mr. Agnelli the patriarch was looking elsewhere for a successor. "He wanted someone from the family who was his direct descendant," said Ms. Agnelli, a former Italian foreign minister and leading political player. He chose his oldest grandson, John Philip Elkann, the son of Mr. Agnelli's daughter Margherita and her first husband, Alain Elkann.
Unlike his grandfather and mentor, John Elkann has not attracted gossip columnists. He grew up in Britain, Brazil and France, his father said, but attended state schools and "lived as a normal student" when he studied engineering in Turin.
Of course, his family connections carried him a long way. Mr. Fresco, the Fiat chairman, who had worked almost four decades at General Electric, secured him a temporary position with the G.E. corporate strategy group in 2000 and the audit staff from 2001 until this May.. He impressed people there as having "a nice level of self-confidence without being cocky," said William Conaty, a senior vice president of human resources for G.E. "He's pretty grounded," Mr. Conaty added.
This, of course, may no longer be an age when heirs can simply be anointed. Fiat's image has been badly dented not only with investors but among Italians themselves.
"We say that when things go well, Fiat and Agnelli make money, but when the economy starts limping, the state has to take care of Fiat and its workers," said Danilo Cruciani, 36, a shopkeeper in Rome. "I wonder if this role has become too much of a heavy burden for the country. And as a family myth, I think it is anyhow fading away."

Call It the (Pick Your Poison) Recovery

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
TRY hapless recovery or nervous recovery or hidden recovery or reversible recovery or frail recovery or moderating recovery or anemic recovery or easily short-circuited recovery. Each of these descriptions of an uncertain economy has its constituents.
 The unhappy adjectives are proliferating as the recovery, which seemed so promising last winter, gives way in the summer to falling stock prices, multiplying corporate scandals and incessant layoffs. Not that recession has returned. But the mayhem is gradually robbing people of the feeling there is a genuine recovery under way, even though the statistics say otherwise. 
 "We are just getting to the beginning of the damage from the bubble," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Even if we don't get a double dip back into a recession, we are going to get a weaker recovery than we normally see." 
The weird aftermath of the booming 1990's and the recession that brought those wild years to an end is like no other recovery since World War II. For a while last winter, when the output of goods and services rose rapidly, as it often has after previous recessions, the United States economy seemed to be sidestepping much damage from an overvalued stock market and excessive corporate expansion.
Sure enough, with the stock market holding its own in the first quarter, many forecasters declared that fears of a bursting bubble were unfounded. Corporate profits, after all, had shot up in the late 90's. And productivity -- the efficiency of workers -- had begun to rise again after years of stagnation. Perhaps the New Economy had some reality to it, and had lifted the United States to a permanently higher level of prosperity, interrupted occasionally by mild recessions.
Then the Enron accounting scandal spread, followed lately by the WorldCom fiasco and the restating of profits downward by dozens of companies -- all of this sapping public confidence in financial markets. Investors reasoned if the soaring corporate profits were part hoax, then so were the soaring stock prices, based as they were on the promise of rising corporate profitability. 
As a result, stock prices have plunged in recent weeks. While millions of Americans are nervously keeping an eye on their net worth, corporate America is struggling to restore profits -- true profits -- mainly by cutting costs. The telecommunications industry, with its wholesale layoffs and scaled-back operations, is an extreme example of this process. 
Still, despite all the battering, there is enough on the positive side of the economic ledger to keep the economy growing, if much more slowly than in the winter. The recovery lives, sustained mainly by consumer spending, made possible through rising debt as well as rising incomes and falling interest rates. It may even outlast the current setbacks.
Home construction is robust, and rising home prices mean families can cash out gains through new mortgages and use the money for spending or paying down debt. Some experts warn that the rapid increase in home prices may be another bubble about to burst, wreaking more damage on the economy, but so far, at least, housing has helped to prop up the recovery.
In a backhanded way, even the stock market is helping the economy. As investors shift money from stocks to interest-bearing bonds and Treasury securities, the demand for these investments has helped to drive down interest rates, including mortgage rates. Low rates in turn have sustained the home-sale boom, although this dynamic has its limits.
"It would be disastrous," Albert M. Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist, wrote recently, if falling stock prices became the principal source of low interest rates.
Missing in action during the recovery has been capital spending by companies for new machinery, software, computers, office space and all the many tools of production. When chief executives realized they had over-expanded, they cut back sharply on this spending, bringing on a recession that started in March 2001. Business spending has finally stopped falling, but until it revives, most economists say, the recovery is likely to be weak at best, and overly dependent on housing and consumer spending. 
Historians will undoubtedly liken the early years of the 21st century to the aftermath of the booming 1920's, when inflated stock prices, excessive expansion and corporate and financial dishonesty also had to be reversed. Then, bank failures led to a rapid unraveling of the economy. "If there is a financial smash now, all bets are off," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant and forecaster.
Almost no one anticipates an aftermath to the 90's as disastrous as the Great Depression, certainly not Mr. Bernstein. Despite the multiplying troubles, nearly every forecaster is betting on a recovery. "You can call it a tentative recovery, but I would not go any further," said ChrisVarvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. And turning to a metaphor, as forecasters so often do, he declared, "We are experiencing a little turbulence on takeoff, but the flight will be fine."
So how do you define a recovery anyway? The six distinguished economists who serve as the nation's official designators of recoveries and recessions are themselves having trouble labeling this cycle. The popular definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters in which the gross domestic product contracts. A recovery begins once the economy has expanded for at least two quarters.
By these definitions, the single quarter in which the economy contracted -- from July through September last year -- did not even constitute a recession. But the six economists, who serve on the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, are guided by different standards. 
THE committee tracks four basic indicators of economic health: employment, industrial production, personal income and wholesale and retail sales. When these rise to a peak and then start down, a recession has begun. When they bottom out and rise again, passing the previous peak, then the committee looks back and in hindsight declares that the recovery began when those key indicators began their ascent.
Three of the four indicators have not only begun rising but have already exceeded their previous peaks. The economy is clearly generating more output than in March of last year, the last peak. That explains why the G.D.P. has continued to rise. What has not recovered at all is employment. The economy lost 1.8 million jobs from March 2001 through April, and only 60,000 have reappeared since then, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.
The employment problem has persuaded some economists, including Robert Hall of Stanford University, chairman of the Dating Cycle Committee, that recovery isn't a sure thing. For Professor Hall, employment weighs more heavily than the three other indicators combined. "If employment had grown more rapidly over the last few months and had passed its old peak, then there is no question where we would stand," he said. 
Until that happens, he shies away from recovery or recession as proper labels. He leans toward recovery, of course, but if the other indicators should falter before employment comes back, then Professor Hall would be prepared to declare a double-dip recession or a prolonged recession. "In my years on the committee, which started in 1978," Professor Hall said, "we have stuck to the rule that we would not call it a recovery until we saw employment back to its previous peak."
So add "jobless recovery" to the list of ways to describe this uncertain moment in post-boom America.

HEADLINE: The World; 
In a French Mogul's Fall, A Warning for Globalists

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
NOWHERE is the tension between globalism and nationalism more acute than in the entertainment industry. And no two countries view the relationship between global and national culture more differently than do France and the United States.
 Those are two of the lessons of the spectacular flame-out last week of Jean-Marie Messier as the chairman and creator of the French entertainment colossus Vivendi Universal. 
 They are not the only lessons, because there was no one cause for Mr. Messier's ouster. His vision encompassed many grandiose ambitions, and his demise was hastened by alliances among many powerful adversaries whose agendas differed except on one point -- that Mr. Messier had to go. 
But for those sifting through the embers of Mr. Messier's career, an important clue can be heard in a remark made by the rookie mogul last December.
Speaking to reporters in New York after Vivendi cut yet another multibillion-dollar deal with an American media company, Mr. Messier declared, "The Franco-French cultural exception is dead."
He was referring to the web of state subsidies, exemption from world trade requirements and mandatory private investment through which France nurtures its film industry. Long cherished by French filmmakers, the cultural exception is meant to act as a bulwark against the encroachment of mass entertainment (translation: Hollywood) into French culture.
In building France's first genuinely global communications company -- by acquiring film, television and music properties on both sides of the Atlantic -- Mr. Messier was determined to breach that bulwark. Vivendi's success as a French company would depend on its ability to spread American-style pop culture.
If that seems improbable, consider that Mr. Messier concocted Vivendi out of a French water utility founded during the reign of Napoleon III. As he discovered, pumping water is a less risky business than making movies.
Vivendi's American investors, including the Bronfman family, paid little attention to their chairman's opinions on culture. They were angry enough about Vivendi's shriveling stock price and ballooning debt.
But the remark, which Mr. Messier later claimed was taken out of context, set off a storm of protest in his home country. He was branded a traitor in pinstripes, willing to sell out France's cultural heritage to woo American shareholders to his company.
It did not help that Vivendi owns Canal Plus, the pay-television service that by law underwrites much of the French film industry. Or that Universal Pictures, which Vivendi acquired two years ago as its American beachhead, pioneered, with "Jaws," the very genre of the worldwide blockbuster film.
"It was a mistake to make a marriage between Canal Plus and Universal," said Daniel Toscan du Plantier, a film producer and the head of Unifrance, the government's movie promotion bureau. "They are two opposing cultures," he continued. "America is great, France is great, but they make a bad couple."
In some respects, Mr. Messier set out to be an exception to the French exception. In other respects, however, he was simply walking the treacherous path trod by other moguls who tried to straddle national and cultural divides.
From Rupert Murdoch's missteps in China to the Walt Disney Company's initial reception in France, media companies often get brought up short by cultural misunderstandings or hostility.
IT happened to Mr. Murdoch in 1993 when he declared, after buying the Asian satellite service Star TV, that satellite-delivered television "posed an unambiguous threat to the totalitarian regimes everywhere." China's government responded by forbidding satellite dish owners to receive Star, and canceled other joint ventures with his News Corporation. Mr. Murdoch dropped the British Broadcasting Corporation from Star TV. But after nearly a decade, he is still struggling to break into the Chinese market.
Disney battled years of enmity from the French cultural establishment over Disneyland Paris, which celebrated its 10th anniversary this year. Once derided as a "cultural Chernobyl," the theme park is now France's top tourist attraction, drawing 12.2 million visitors last year.
Still, Disney has taken care, in opening a new 62-acre Walt Disney Studios park next to the original resort, to strike a European tone. Its film clips feature movies and stars from around the continent, while the recorded presentations are available in six languages, including English.
Non-Americans who nourish the dream of creating global media companies have other problems. Many never make sense of the funhouse economics of Hollywood or the extravagant perquisites lavished on its celebrities.
Before Universal was acquired by Vivendi, it had been managed unhappily by Seagram, the Canadian-American liquor company started by the Bronfmans. Before that, it was an albatross around the neck of Matsushita, the Japanese maker of Panasonic TV sets and other gadgets.
Matushita and its rival, Sony, spent fortunes trying to build global entertainment companies. While Sony still struggles gamely, enjoying a recent success with its hit movie "Spider-Man," Japan's foray into Hollywood never paid off the way its bosses had hoped.
Sony and other non-American companies, like Bertelsmann of Germany, have also been stymied by laws that prohibit foreign companies from owning American broadcast or cable networks.
"The question is whether it is only French companies, or all foreign companies, that have trouble in Hollywood," said David Kessler, the general director of the National Center for Cinema, which lobbies for the French film industry. "Bertelsmann also has a very different culture. The Japanese had a very different culture."
AS a French company, though, Vivendi may have an extra handicap. Bertelsmann and Sony are not routinely hazed by their local papers for undermining the culture of their home countries. Neither is required by law to subsidize its native film and television industry.
"These kinds of government restrictions become a roadblock to the international expansion of major media companies," said Michael J. Wolf, a partner who specializes in media at McKinsey & Company.
That may be what Mr. Messier meant when he talked about the French cultural exception being dead. The trouble is, now Mr. Messier's career at Vivendi is dead, while the French exception looks alive and well.

Willing to Sweat, After All These Years

BYLINE:  By MACAULAY CAMPBELL 

 BODY:
 The population is aging, but that is not hurting the popularity of health clubs. Quite the contrary, health club memberships among people 55 and older almost quintupled from 1987 to 2001, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. 
That was the fastest growth among any age segment. 
 The future also bodes well for health clubs. According to the association, 19 percent of people aged 18 to 34 belong to a health club, the highest membership rate of any age group. But the children of the baby boom generation, those aged 8 to 25, are themselves a huge segment of the population and are a potential source for millions of new members. MACAULAY CAMPBELL

HEADLINE: Iran's Students Step Up Reform Drive 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, July 6 

 BODY:
A forceful student movement is replacing President Mohammad Khatami as the leading engine for political reform in Iran. Activists at the country's vibrant, overflowing universities say their calls for change are gathering momentum and they are preparing to put delicate issues like renewing relations with the United States to a public vote for the first time.
 Unlike Mr. Khatami, who has twice been elected president but has been stymied in his quest for change by the still-powerful conservative clerics and their supporters, the students are not patient, polite or at all ready to settle for the status quo. 
 Gholamabass Tavassoli, a liberal activist who had just served a year in jail on charges of trying to overthrow the Islamic government, found out just how far things had shifted when he addressed a crowd at the Science and Industry University here in May.
The students were disenchanted with his muted criticism of the minor reforms of President Khatami, and they wanted Mr. Tavassoli to hear their unrestrained criticism of him.
Akbar Atri, like many of the campus radicals something of an eternal student at age 30, said: "The public in general has lost its vigor compared to five years ago because of the violence and suppression that hard-liners exerted. It is clear that the reform movement has failed because the reformers were not willing to pay the price for change." 
Mohsen Sazgara, a reformist politician and former journalist who often speaks at universities, said the students were becoming more and more restive. "They can make a politician sweat with bold questions," he said.
Students were a powerhouse of revolution from Bolshevik Russia to Tiananmen Square and Eastern Europe in 1989 and in Iran's own Islamic revolution 10 years earlier.
They are articulate, educated, a bridge between the elite and more ordinary people -- in this case, taking the message of Iran's reformist newspapers to their families.
In today's Iran, students derive strength from numbers. There are 1.7 million in a country of 65 million where two-thirds of the population is under 30. The closed, state-run economy, combined with corruption and mismanagement, has prevented the development necessary to give everyone jobs. Officials predict six million will be jobless by 2004.
Clearly, the future -- and its frustrations, if no change is allowed -- belongs to the students.
"The country will have to go to any direction this generation wants to go, both because of their quantity and quality, which is their wit and education," Mr. Sazgara said.
"They want more freedom in their private and social lives," he added. "They are fed up with the state's interference, telling them what to do. They want to be able to integrate in the global culture, have a democratic system and be sure that there will be jobs in future."
In contrast to the devoted Islamic revolutionaries envisioned in the strict policies adopted after 1979, today's students are aware of the realities outside Iran because of the Internet and satellite television. They read about Western democracy and are taught by professors who studied in the West.
Reza Amerinassab, a 28-year-old medical student who advocates reform, said he spent hours surfing the Internet and more time reading books on the formation of Western democracies than reading his medical textbooks.
The turning point for students was July 1999, when vigilante forces attacked a student dormitory in Tehran after students protested the closing of a pro-reform newspaper.
The vigilantes, along with the police force controlled by hard-liners, attacked the dormitory while students were asleep. Students were beaten and one was killed. The attack set off five days of the worst violence since the 1979 revolution.
Eventually, protesters retreated after President Khatami pleaded for order. Hard-liners were using the unrest to threaten a coup against Mr. Khatami, said Mohammadreza Namnabat, a student involved in those protests.
But the judiciary, also controlled by hard-liners, mocked the students and acquitted major defendants, convicting just one soldier of stealing an electric shaver.
Meanwhile, student leaders were suppressed and jailed. In one incident that reverberated nationally last year, a student leader, Ali Afshari, was shown on a prime time television news program, cowed and confessing that he had tried to overthrow Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme religious leader.
Last fall, at a news conference shortly before he was returned to jail to serve a one-year term, Mr. Afshari apologized to reformist supporters. "The pressure was beyond the level I could resist," he said. "I had not prepared myself for it." He added that in one year he had spent 328 days in solitary confinement.
Despite the shock of 1999 and the continuing repression, students are pressing for change, led mainly by the Office for Consolidating Unity, the leading student reform movement. It has brought the country's Islamic Association of Universities under one umbrella, represents every campus in the country and has a central board in Tehran.
In elections in February for that board, 53 of the 63 elected members were so-called radical reformists -- ardent supporters of change who reject compromise. "We want true and unconditional democracy, not a religious democracy if it violates democratic principles such as human rights, freedom and equality because of being Islamic," Mr. Atri said.
Ahmad Faraji, a student who was jailed for two weeks, said: "We still do not reject Mr. Khatami and his reform movement but believe they are not enough. We think change should be from the bottom up; society must act more forcefully and participate in the process of change by finding its voice to criticize."
Inside the universities, these leaders are preparing to hold referendums on sensitive issues like changing the Constitution to eliminate the veto the clerics have over the democratically elected Parliament, talks with the United States and elimination of hard-line unelected bodies that have impeded reforms. It will be the first time any of the topics are put to a public vote.
"These are important issues and we intend to make at least the universities' opinion public about these matters," said Mr. Amerinassab. "Public opinion is a powerful means for change and universities are where thoughtful opinions are shaped. We must help break the locks that have stopped reforms. We must pressure politicians not to give up."

HEADLINE: Small Victories Are Recorded in Burmese War on Drugs 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar 

 BODY:
Heave tons of sacks of opium, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs into an outdoor furnace and the result is a tower of black smoke that rises over this green and rain-washed city for hours.
 The bonfire in late June was proof, an official told assembled diplomats, that Myanmar was waging a heroic war on drugs, "considering that we receive almost zero assistance from the international community for our efforts." 
 The ceremony seemed proof at least of doggedness. It was the 16th public drug burning in 12 years, during which time the nation, formerly Burma, has remained among the world's leading producers of opium and heroin. Today, with a reduction in poppy farming in Afghanistan, the United States calculates that Myanmar is the leading source. 
Diplomats and drug-control experts say, though, that there are signs the military government here is taking some small, genuine steps forward.
"From the United States perspective, it is improving and it's serious," said Col. Jack Dibrell, the American military attache here, as he stood in a drizzle to watch the roaring flames. "The question is how effective it can be in the long run. There is still major work to be done."
Jean-Luc Lemahieu, the representative in Myanmar of the United Nations International Drug Control Program, said he was encouraged that production here had not boomed to fill the demand created by the drop in Afghan opium.
Indeed, although the country rose in the world's ranking, poppy production here has fallen substantially over the last five years, he said.
In a report released in March, the State Department took an unusually positive tone. "Throughout 2001, the Burmese government demonstrated a new commitment to effective counternarcotics measures," it said.
"It has continued its poppy eradication program, has initiated actions against drug traffickers and some drug-trafficking organizations, has drafted new money-laundering legislation and has begun to work more closely and cooperatively with neighboring and regional countries."
The report said opium production totaled 953 tons in 2001, down more than 20 percent from the previous year and totaling just one-third of the 2,822 tons produced in 1996.
Nevertheless, the State Department said the measures taken so far were "too limited in duration and scope to have had a significant impact on the overall narcotics situation thus far."
It said Myanmar had not developed any effective program to deal with a major new trend that began in 1996 toward the manufacture and trafficking of methamphetamines.
Though most of this trade does not reach the West, addiction to amphetamines has become an urgent problem in Southeast Asia. The drugs are cheap and easy to produce from small, mobile laboratories, making it particularly difficult to combat them, experts said.
The drop in poppy production here could also be in large part the result of a three-year drought, said a diplomat who follows narcotics issues closely. While productivity fell, the acreage under cultivation remained steady.
"This year we're looking at a real reduction," the diplomat said. "Law enforcement has been much more vigorous this year than in the past."
Like several other experts here, the diplomat disagreed with accusations that the top leadership of Myanmar encouraged and sustained its power through the drug trade.
"I think they truly think drugs are a scourge on society," the diplomat said. "They see the scale of drug production and trafficking as a threat to stability and security." 
According to the State Department, there is "no evidence that the Burmese government, on an institutional level, is involved in the drug trade." It said the government had "waged a quiet campaign against narcotics corruption in the ranks."
Powerful drug chiefs and armed ethnic insurgencies, particularly the ethnic Wa, present a challenge to the government, although their profits do help fuel the economy and enrich individual officials, experts said.
As part of a cease-fire agreement with the Wa army, which is often described as one of the world's most heavily armed narcotics organizations, the government has set a deadline of 2005 for an end to opium and heroin production.
"We have to believe that they will meet the deadline," said Col. Kyaw Thein, the top drug enforcement official here. A crackdown on drug producers and traffickers is one of a set of criteria imposed by the United States as a requirement for counternarcotics assistance, which would come mainly in the form of training.
Colonel Kyaw Thein acknowledged that, according to the State Department, Myanmar had "failed demonstrably" to act as a "responsible state" in combating the drug trade. It is one of only three countries, along with Afghanistan and Haiti, in that category.
Foreign help is essential, Mr. Lemahieu, the United Nations expert, said, if Myanmar's drug eradication program is to succeed.
"It is a very good effort, a very good step in the right direction," he said. "But we don't need one step; we need 1,000 steps. But who will implement them? Who is skilled here?"
Simply cutting production is not enough; crop substitution programs are needed to give farmers a new livelihood, and that is no easy matter, he said. Production fell by 80 percent or more in Afghanistan when growing poppies was banned last year by the Taliban government, but it is now quickly rising again.
Current crop substitution programs here offer farmers an income of only about 20 percent of their earnings from poppies, said Colonel Dibrell, the American attache. 
Responding to critics who say the West should remain disengaged from Myanmar because of its human rights record, Mr. Lemahieu argued that assistance in narcotics control also amounted to assistance in transition to a democratic government.
The drug trade fuels an unofficial economy and enriches an underworld that has a stake in maintaining the status quo, he said. It subsidizes ethnic insurgencies that have caused continuing instability that makes political change difficult.
It also creates instability in the region, contributing to tensions and violence along the border with Thailand, an area where drug cartels engage in jungle warfare.
"If you want to have political transition, you need to tackle drugs," Mr. Lemahieu said. "If you want to work on regional security you will have to tackle drugs."

HEADLINE: Portfolios Depressed, Traders Seek Therapy 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

 BODY:
Picture a Wall Street trader striding through the doctor's waiting room and flopping down on the couch. He rages about the collapse of WorldCom, then falls silent.
 His therapist leans forward and asks quietly, "And how did that make you invest?" 
 Psychologists are not new to company boardrooms or trading floors. In the 1990's, the science of market psychology became an industry as financial institutions, and especially hedge funds, hired psychologists to hone their competitive edge -- be it analyzing investor choices, coaching money managers or revealing clients' unconscious desires. 
The use of psychotherapy by market professionals to find their inner trader, however, is something else.
"I had a client who grew anxious every time he had to sell a holding, he kept saying 'I can't seem to let go,' " Richard A. Geist, president of the Institute of Psychology and Investing in Newton, Mass., said. Dr. Geist, who teaches at the Harvard Medical School, is both a psychotherapist and a financial adviser. "I asked him what that reminded him of," Dr. Geist said. "He remembered that as a child he had trouble letting go of his mother when it was time to go to school."
For such patients, the classic Freudian disorder carries a new economy twist: divestiture anxiety.
It is hardly surprising that in the current economy, financiers are seeking psychological counseling or pharmaceutical solace.
Many firms bring in psychologists as consultants for money managers, but so far the companies do not appear to be ordering their employees to seek help. Some traders, themselves, however, feel the need.
Their turn to therapy is a little like struggling athletes who seek out sports psychologists to improve their game.
One trader, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said he went to a therapist to overcome his love/hate relationship to risk.
The trend of seeking therapy springs from two distinct schools of psychology that flourished during the boom. One is behavioral finance, which studies the irrational choices most investors make. Behavioral economists like Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago have set up mutual funds based on their insights into market psychology. The other is wealth therapy -- psychologists like Suze Ormond ("The Courage to Be Rich," Riverhead Books, 1999), who help clients cope emotionally and practically with windfall wealth.
Now that the bubble has burst, investors are not seeking the courage to be poor. Patients want their heads examined to regain their wealth.
Behavioral economists warn of "the endowment effect," the tendency of investors to endow stock they own with more value than it has. (A variation on the old Neopolitan saying, "Even a cockroach is beautiful to its mother.") A corollary is that even seasoned investors place too much faith in tips and insider hints.
"My analysis and my gut told me that I should sell my Tyco shares," one New York business mogul confessed. "But I knew someone on the board who said that Dennis Kozlowski was a decent guy, and I allowed my judgment to be swayed until it was too late," he said, referring to L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco International's former chief executive who has been indicted for tax evasion and evidence tampering. The mogul remains wealthy, but has become an avid student of market psychology -- including his own.
There are, however, traders who argue that the financial world in the 1990's relied too much on therapists -- and antianxiety medication. 
"My own view is that one reason the investor class, including me, missed the downside was serotonin," James J. Cramer, a former hedge fund manager and author of "Confessions of a Street Addict" (Simon & Schuster, 2002), said, referring to a substance in the brain that antidepression drugs augment. "Prozac and all those other drugs banish the 'this is the end of the world' thoughts," Mr. Cramer explained. "Which means you are not as anxious as you should be about an obvious down side."
Mr. Cramer said he nevertheless drew a lesson from one tenet of behavioral finance: he is not the only person who feels disproportionate rage and sorrow over losses. Research by behavioral economists suggests that most people feel twice the pain over a financial loss as they do pleasure in an equivalent gain.
"Sudden wealth syndrome" was a term coined by the Money, Meaning and Choices Institute in the San Francisco suburb of Kentfield, a consulting firm that was spawned by the dot-com rush. A co-founder, Joan DiFuria, who swapped an 18-year career as a metal commodities trader to become a psychologist, spoke of mass hysteria. "When the market was up, our entire culture was caught up in power and greed and winning the big lottery," she said.
Treatment varies. Dr. Geist, the psychotherapist and financial adviser, holds 50-minute sessions with individual clients. Van K. Tharp, a psychologist and "stock-trading coach," who 10 years ago founded The International Institute of Trading Mastery Inc. in the Research Triangle town of Cary, N.C., holds workshops and sells books and tapes. Until he got too busy, Dr. Tharp said, he could do psychological evaluations based on a lengthy questionnaire and a 10-minute phone consultation.
He says his clients come from all over the world. "Experienced traders begin to realize it's not just about outside factors," Dr. Tharp said. "Their performance is them and they are obviously making mistakes. Once that sets in, they are willing to get a coach to help them."
Dr. Tharp himself, however, had to seek legal coaching two years ago, when investors in the Maricopa hedge funds, run by David M. Mobley Sr., of Naples, Fla., and endorsed by Dr. Tharp, sued Dr. Tharp for negligence. Dr. Tharp had treated Mr. Mobley for overconfidence, and was so pleased with his progress that he invested money in Maricopa, and encouraged his other clients to follow suit. Mr. Mobley was convicted last year of cheating investors out of more than $50 million.
Dr. Tharp said his own suit was recently settled, and that he has learned a lesson from his own mistaken overconfidence in recommending mutual funds. "I'll never do that again," he said.
Not all money therapists are so deeply involved in their clients' finances. Richard Trachtman, a New York-based clinical social worker and psychotherapist who specializes in money issues, said he does not operate as a financial adviser. He helps clients uncover their deep-rooted taboos about money.
But he can help clients better understand what kind of portfolio best suits their psyches. "There are some people who should invest very conservatively through mutual fund diversification and the like," he said. "Other people can enjoy the risk without becoming devastated by loss."
John Jacobs, a New York psychologist whose practice is mainly focused on couples and families, has also developed expertise in wealth issues -- many of his clients are business tycoons and money is often a ruling preoccupation.
"I think the real illness of the age is the loss of perspective," Dr. Jacobs said, referring to patients whose self-esteem rises and falls with the Nasdaq or Dow. Even after a 40 percent drop in their holdings, he says, they have no ability to appreciate that they are still very rich. Dr. Jacobs tries to bring back a realistic assessment.
Some losses, however, are sharper than others. "I worked with a gentleman who was worth $800 million and ended up worth only $20 million, and that did make a huge difference in his life," Dr. Jacobs said.
"It wasn't all bad," he added. "He found out who his real friends are."

HEADLINE: Beacons of Faith Are Dimming on the Prairie 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: HARWOOD, N.D. 

 BODY:
The hail came five minutes before auction time at the old church, just as the crowd had gathered under the oak trees. Perhaps it was a sign.
 Many of those assembled were the great-grandsons and great-granddaughters of the Norwegian homesteaders who founded the white clapboard Osterdalen Evangelical Lutheran Church, where a soft blanket of barley grows practically to the front door. They had come to say goodbye. 
 The platters were the first to be auctioned, reminders of ham dinners every Fourth of July. Then came the pickle dishes, the stainless steel and silver forks, the wicks, the coffee urns, the Sunday school folding chairs, the Hammond double-keyboard organ, the long oak pews and the hymnals ("Take any hymnal you want -- 10 bucks a hymnal -- get them at 10-10-10."). The stained-glass windows were last to go. 
"We wished the situation had been different," said the church's last pastor, the Rev. Carrol Tollefson, with sorrowful resignation, "but then reality sets in." 
Mr. Tollefson led the final service, a year ago, after the church, built in 1895 and down to its last eight members, decided to close.
"We wish the Lord would send down a lightning bolt and take this building," he said.
With their steeples visible for miles, anchoring the distant landscape, the churches of North Dakota have been called the lighthouses of the prairie. Built by Norwegian, Swedish, German, Icelandic and other homesteaders who flocked to the treeless terrain in the 1880's, these windswept landmarks of rural life, beacons of faith and optimism, are rapidly vanishing.
The flight of people from the North Dakota countryside has been silently devastating to this obscure but historically significant rural architectural heritage. Erected by settlers every six miles or so, past where the pavement -- as highways are called here -- ends and dirt and gravel take over, prairie churches like Osterdalen are disappearing at a rapid rate. 
Even as they do, former church members and neighbors, working singly or in small groups, are aggressively rallying to halt their demise. Some are restoring them out of their own pockets and resurrecting them for weekly services. Others are banding together to open them for special occasions, such as heritage services that draw hundreds of former members from out of state. 
A survey in 1998 by the North Dakota Historical Society and other groups found that of the state's nearly 2,000 historic church buildings, at least 400 had been abandoned. Seventy-eight percent of them are in one-silo towns of 2,500 people or fewer, as farm economics have driven people to jobs far away. 
Throughout the Great Plains, depopulation has left hundreds of historic churches vacant and at the mercy of the elements, said Jim Lindberg, assistant director of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Denver, which placed the churches on its most endangered list last year.
Often the first public buildings created by settlers and the last to go -- along with the local bar -- churches represent an acute loss in North Dakota, where an average of nine people live per square mile and a typical town has fewer than 160 people, said Dr. Richard Rathge, the state demographer. The state also has the country's greatest proportion of people who are 85 years old and older.
In its 111-year-old life, Ringsaker Lutheran, along the banks of the Red River in Buxton, was home to 362 baptisms, 50 marriages, 97 funerals and innumerable lutefisk dinners for 600 people. 
"When I was growing up, often the only occasion during the week where farm people got to socialize was at the church," said Kim Nesvig, 49, who grew up a mile west of Ringsaker. "It was a place to shoot the breeze. But there was only one kid left in Sunday school. It makes it hard to have a choir."
Spare as the landscape, the louvered steeples and shingled bell towers of these landmarks still bear eloquent witness to the Western settlement of the country. Built by local carpenters -- the Sir Christopher Wrens of the prairie -- they speak of a moment in the nation's history when homesteaders from across the sea, lured by railroad advertisements promising cheap and bountiful land, tried to carve out decent lives. 
The homesteaders braved drought, prairie fires, floods, grasshoppers and horizontal snowstorms so ferocious that farmers would stretch twine from house to barn to guide them. In the great blizzard of 1887, many died of suffocation, smothered by the dense snow in the air and the force of the wind.
In the warm embrace of churches, farm families from Norway, Sweden and elsewhere, living miles from one another, preserved their cultures and forged communities. "The little churches speak of the human connection to the land," said Dale R. Bentley, the executive director of Preservation North Dakota, a nonprofit group based in Buffalo, N.D., which is trying to halt their demise.
"In North Dakota we are one generation from our roots," Mr. Bentley said. "Lose them and you lose the human connection to the prairie." Mr. Bentley's group recently started a statewide initiative to preserve endangered rural churches through a $100,000 "Save America's Treasures" grant, financed by a Congressional appropriation, and $100,000 from the J. M. Kaplan Fund, a private foundation in New York. 
The sight of a fallen church, doors pinned perpetually open by the wind, can be wrenching. 
"A church is kind of like a flag," said Duane Johnson, a member of the North Trinity Swedish Lutheran Church near Nash, which has 177 residents. "You should keep it up, or destroy it."
Tulla Froyen drove her camper 200 miles from her home in South Haven, Minn., to the auction at Osterdalen, spending the night parked in the green barley field beside the church. Her Norwegian ancestors are buried here, their century-old graves marked with fresh peonies. The setting, on high ground at the juncture of the Red and Sheyenne Rivers, has changed little, with the farmhouse on the old Strandvold place still standing along a ribbon of dirt that heads straight toward the infinite sky.
"When I first heard about the auction, I cried," said Ms. Froyen, 62, a retired teacher and resort operator. "But after being here and talking to the caretakers, I understand the problems they're up against." 
The painful decision to close, as at other churches throughout the Great Plains, seemed inevitable. The church's few congregants, all of them elderly, could no longer afford a minister, upkeep and insurance. At Osterdalen, they voted against selling the church to a private buyer, worried that its future use would be incompatible with its sacred past. 
Although the belfry is disintegrating from dry rot, church members plan to remove the bell -- donated by Gerald Olsen's great-grandfather Elof -- to the cemetery, where it will be on display as a memorial to the church. The fate of the building is uncertain. 
Around the state, different choices are being made, often guided by Preservation North Dakota, which provides technical advice and small grants for rural church preservation. Many of the inactive churches are Lutheran, reflecting the faith in the homelands of their founders, while others are Russian and Ukrainian Greek Orthodox, German-Hungarian and Moravian. Synagogues, too, have been abandoned. 
"It takes one person to save a church," Mr. Bentley said, adding that $5,000, along with volunteer labor, "is a roof and a paint job," 
The unlikely savior of the 1887 Hitterdal Lutheran Church near Milton, N.D., which closed in 1985, is David Haslekaas, 34, the fourth generation to farm his family homestead. In 1995, Mr. Haslekaas attended the auction of the church, which his Norwegian great-grandfather helped build, and proceeded to spend $6,000 rescuing practically the entire contents. He then bought the church itself for $1 from the church council, promising to maintain and restore it. 
"Maybe I'm selfish," Mr. Haslekaas said recently, taking a break from working his wheat and soybean fields to relax with his wife, Jan, 29, and two children, Hayes, 2, and Greta, 6 months. "I didn't want to lose it. You see so many churches torn down and burnt. I wanted to keep it here."
When he got lost in the tall wheat as a boy, he would remember his parents' advice to "look for the church." He would throw paper airplanes from the balcony and steal away on weekdays to ring the bell. 
"People wonder why we are putting money into something like this when we have a young family," said Ms. Haslekaas, who works as a nurse in nearby Langdon. "It's to honor the people who deeded the land. It's something the children will take pride in." 
Greta was recently baptized in the church, and the couple hopes other families will follow. 
Mr. Haslekaas painted the church with a neighbor, hoisted in a 30-gallon drum of paint that was suspended from a grain auger. "You make priorities," he said. 
Elsewhere in North Dakota, new rituals are being born in old churches. On a recent Sunday morning, five families gathered for a sort of homegrown service, without a pastor, at the Island Lake Chapel, near Wolford (population 35), where the original kerosene lanterns still hang from the ceiling. 
The church, now nondenominational, had been boarded up for 50 years until Nancy and Gary Wilbe and their neighbors resurrected it three years ago, pooling $10,000. The floor joists were caving in and "you could hear skunks and badgers scratching," Mrs. Wilbe recalled, adding: "Farmers would drive by and see some action, then pound nails. There's a real tie."
On rolling grassland near Denbigh (population 72), a Victorian jewel with pressed tin ceilings sits on a road so isolated that the only person who can admire it is the mail carrier. In 1997, when the church closed, members formed a trust to preserve the building. Recently, about 60 former members reunited for a heritage service -- a growing summer tradition. They choose the day each year when Leonard Markusen can return from Iowa City to play the 1912 Packard pump organ. 
Every Christmas Eve, undeterred by three-foot snow drifts, five elderly members of the former North Trinity Swedish Lutheran Church meet in the church yard, cellphones at the ready. At 6 p.m. precisely, Kenneth Johnson, 77, grabs two gnarled ropes to toll the bell, his friends punching telephone numbers wildly.
They call Bernice Hall in Minneapolis, Jody Frost in Boise, Avis O'Leary in Columbia, S.C., and Pat Hall in Pittsburgh, sharing with these former neighbors the familiar jubilant resonance. 
Sometimes, Mrs. Hall, 51, will let her answering machine pick up just so she can hang on to the sound. 
"Listen," she will say, calling her friends. "Here are my bells."

HEADLINE: U.N. Coaxes Out the Wheres and Whys of Global Immigration 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
For years, as the number of people moving legally or illegally across national borders has grown, governments have resisted United Nations efforts to collect reliable statistics and coordinate procedures governing immigration.
 The United Nations estimates that at least 185 million people -- up from 70 million three decades ago -- are now living in countries other than where they were born. 
 But demographers say that attempts to analyze these population movements are often frustrated by government officials who try to inflate or to obscure them. 
Now, in the midst of an intensifying debate about immigration in Europe and the United States, in part fueled by fears of terrorists crossing borders, the United Nations population division will meet on Thursday and Friday in New York to begin exploring global cooperation on the issue. The meeting is expected to be the largest of its kind, attracting the participation of governments, refugee organizations, volunteer agencies and policy analysts.
"This time, people are serious," said Demetrios Papademetriou, a former public policy analyst in the United States Labor Department who is now the co-director of the Migration Policy Institute, a research organization in Washington created by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace two years ago. "There is a different air to this meeting. A lot of people are now making serious investments."
Beyond what are perceived as problems of immigration in richer countries, there is mounting evidence of threats to peace and life from migrations, often forced, in poor nations. For example, African leaders have said that the long-running Congo war cannot be resolved until Hutu refugees from neighboring Rwanda, now ruled by Tutsis, have been moved out.
Debates over immigration, said Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations Population Division, are characterized by "a yawning lack of data, absence of theories to explain international migration, a weak understanding of the complex interrelationship between migration and development, and concerns about the social, economic and political consequences."
There are no internationally agreed upon definitions of terms like "citizenship" or "residence." Nationalist hackles rise quickly in some developed countries, especially in Europe and Japan, when demographers suggest that low birth rates and aging populations may require huge inflows of immigrants to keep economies afloat.
Two years ago, for example, Mr. Chamie was publicly criticized by the European Union after talking with the media about the possible need for "replacement migration" before European governments had had a chance to consider the issue.
United Nations officials say the lack of data has often obstructed important work. Only one in three member nations ever report statistics, the United Nations says, and some governments have not been heard from for decades.
Dr. Papademetriou of the Migration Policy Institute said he hoped that the mix of private, governmental and international experts meeting in New York would "come up with solutions that allow us to husband public resources in a very effective and responsible way." The institute has established a Web site, www.migrationinformation.org, to collect information and analyses. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 8, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about United Nations efforts to address problems of global migration misstated the number of people the United Nations estimated were living outside their country of birth three decades ago, as contrasted with 185 million today. The older number is 80 million, not 70 million.

HEADLINE: Detroit Urban Renewal Without the Renewal 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Like a gardener pruning rosebushes, Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick wants to tear down this city to save it.
 Not the whole thing -- just the rotten parts. The burned-out facades and shattered windows, caving porches and crumbling rooftops that mar the landscape from the crux of downtown to the city's outskirts. 
 But what sets the mayor's project apart is not the pace at which buildings are coming down or the scale of the effort -- other cities have become more aggressive about demolishing abandoned buildings as part of revitalization -- but the high likelihood that little will go up in their place. Few people in Detroit expect anything to replace the rubble, a reality that frustrates both the mayor, who took office in January, and the city government's critics. 
The population of the 140-square-mile city has been halved since its heyday, with little hope of a big rebound. Year after year, dangerous vacant houses have been turned into desolate vacant lots, creating an oddly sparse urban patchwork.
For Mr. Kilpatrick, the need to rid the city of deserted buildings outweighs the consideration of what will replace them. "This is where drug dealers stash their drugs, this is where people stash guns, this is where girls get abused," said Mayor Kilpatrick, 32. "It's also a pride issue. If you don't have community pride, if you don't have a safe, clean city, you don't have a world-class city."
After campaigning on a promise to raze 5,000 houses by September, Mr. Kilpatrick, has so far seen only about 1,000 come down. He blames lack of money and a diffuse bureaucracy. But he vowed to step up the process in the new fiscal year, which began on Monday, and expects to destroy some 4,000 buildings near schools by summer's end. Mr. Kilpatrick also hinted that at least two of the dozen once-magnificent pre-Depression skyscrapers sitting empty downtown -- but for squatters and urban spelunkers -- might soon be bulldozed.
Though the mayor has the support of county prosecutors and state officials, with groups devoted to fighting urban blight, others are beginning to express concern that the city may be moving too fast and without firm enough plans. 
"The real tragedy is that there is no effort to reclaim what was there, no aspiration and no resources to go back to something that approximates what was there before," said Camilo Jose Vergara, a photographer who has proposed creating an urban theme park out of the downtown wreckage, which was highlighted in his 1999 book, "American Ruins." 
Other once-faltering cities, helped by demographics and economics, have been able to link demolition with development. Philadelphia has issued $160 million in bonds to demolish 10,000 structures in five years in hopes of assembling larger, developable parcels. Baltimore is trying to obtain titles to 5,000 properties, and plans to give or sell the lots to residents to use as yards or gardens. In West Palm Beach, Fla., 50 abandoned buildings were leveled and a commercial and residential development called City Place constructed, raising property values to $85 per square foot from $7.
In Detroit, there is some rehabilitation and redevelopment near Comerica Park, the $300 million baseball stadium that opened downtown in 2000, but in the neighborhoods, the abandoned houses are seen more as garbage to be removed than as opportunities for growth.
Detroit, the nation's 10th-largest city with 961,000 people -- down from 2 million in 1955 -- may just need right-sizing. According to the 2000 census, it has 6,855 residents per square mile, compared with 12,750 in Chicago, 26,403 in New York and 7,877 in sprawling Los Angeles.
Detroit's lack of population density is clear after a short drive. Though there are a few pockets of well-maintained buildings, none are far from a block pockmarked with skeletal structures and grassy emptiness. The city list of 1,587 properties ready for destruction -- as well as the nearly 10,000 others that are abandoned and deemed dangerous -- includes multiple addresses in each of its 22 tax wards.
Al Fields, the mayor's deputy chief operations officer, who is overseeing demolition, said Mr. Kilpatrick's ambitions had been frustrated by a bureaucracy in which permits and inspections were spread over four agencies, and by a limited budget for $10,000-a-pop demolition. He is combining the process into one department, trying to improve cooperation with the state, which owns hundreds of the houses, raising the budget request to $13 million from $12 million, and seeking private donations.
More than 28,000 houses have been demolished since 1989-90; the city spends $800,000 a year maintaining its empty lots.
Along Michigan Avenue, the old train depot is a behemoth of broken glass surrounded by a razor-wire fence. The clock on the CPA Building seems to have been stuck at 5 of 11 for decades.
In the Brush Park neighborhood behind Comerica Park, a row of new town houses has sold for about $100,000 each. A block away is a dilapidated apartment building with plywood in its windows, a red-brick number with broken windows and, in the distance, an eight-story building with no windows at all.
"We're kind of taking a chance," said Keith Hustak, 23, who is moving into Jacobs Manor, a 1930's building that had become a crack den before a developer bought it at auction in November for $500,000. Mr. Hustak's apartment has a view of the ballpark, as well as the drug deals at the empty house next door.
John George, a former insurance agent, watched for months as addicts traipsed in and out of a house near his in Northwest Detroit. He called city officials daily before boarding the place up himself. In the 14 years since, the group Mr. George started, Motor City Blight Busters, has demolished 100 houses, helped build 101 others and renovated 158 more.
"Blight is like a cancer; our theory has been we can eliminate it before it spreads," he said. 
Mr. George welcomed the mayor's attention to the problem that defines his life, but worried that the city would flatten houses that could be rehabbed and siphon corporate money from grass-roots groups like his that can do the work more cheaply.
"There are dozens of homes in our community that if we could have gotten the titles from the city quickly, we could have families in there and have them back on the tax rolls," he said. "When the city demolishes a house, they don't plant grass, they don't plant trees, it's just a big scar."
At 21425 Santa Clara sits Blight Busters' 101st target, a burned-out bungalow. On one side is an empty lot, on the other is another empty house, then another empty lot. 
The 15700 block of Burgess Street, once a vibrant row of postwar homes, is a patchwork of weedy swatches, a gray house with the yellow "D" spray-painted to signify imminent demolition, and a "fresh grave," as Mr. George calls the gravel-laden sites left by the city's crews.
"Whatever happens to the houses deemed unsalvageable, we need to do something with the streetscape," said Katherine Clarkson, a local preservationist who is resigned to the demolition but hopes to save the downtown landmarks the mayor has called dinosaurs. "If you have nothing to walk past for blocks and blocks, just empty weed-filled lots, you're going to end up with similar kinds of scariness."

One Nation Plays the Great Game Alone

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IF anyone in the United Nations still believed that the United States sees itself as part of the family of nations, and not as its patriarch, last week may have come as a rude awakening.
 First, to the great dismay of its closest European allies, the Bush administration threatened to block all United Nations peacekeeping missions as they come up for renewal unless American peacekeepers are granted immunity from prosecution by the International Criminal Court, which came into being on Monday. 
 The allies responded with howls of outrage, accusing the United States of trying to stand above international law and promoting double standards.
Then, reports surfaced in Washington that planning for a large-scale invasion of Iraq had reached an advanced stage -- even though most European governments have cautioned against such an invasion and none of the nations that would be expected to assist American troops as staging areas have been formally consulted. 
In fact, as last week's events point up, a double standard is precisely what the Bush administration is pursuing. As the world's lone superpower, the United States is increasingly the main guarantor of global security and economic well-being, administration officials contend. To treat it like any other country would defy reality, they say. 
"The United States plays a role in the world unlike any other," Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, told reporters last week in explaining the administration's position on the criminal court. "Therefore this affects us unlike any other nation."
To many foreign policy experts, that worldview is a natural outgrowth of America's preeminent position in the post-Soviet world, which it dominates militarily, economically and culturally. And while many of these scholars fault the Bush administration for a brusque, even arrogant brinkmanship at the United Nations, far fewer blame it for trying to control the international rules of the road. That, they say, is what all great powers have done through the ages.
"You hear Europeans say Bush is a cowboy from Texas," said William C. Wohlforth, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth. "But when the Europeans were at the top of the international heap, they were hard-bitten realists about using power, and it was the United States that was trying to outlaw war."
In an article in the July issue of Foreign Affairs, Professor Wohlforth and a Dartmouth colleague, Stephen G. Brooks, argue that the United States' military and economic dominance over the world is no longer even debatable.
They note that in 2003, the United States will spend more on the Pentagon, about $400 billion, than the next 15 largest militaries combined. And its economy is twice as large as its closest rival, Japan. No other nation in history, they contend, has exerted so much military power over the land, sea and air, while also dominating the global economy.
"Today," they write, "the United States has no rival in any critical dimension of power."
That disparity, says Robert Kagan, a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who lives in Brussels, has caused Europe and many other nations to depend increasingly on American power for their security and prosperity. As a result, Mr. Kagan asserts, the United States must remain free to use its power at will, lest the world fall prey to lawlessness and brutality.
T HE United States must sometimes play by the rules of a Hobbesian world, even though in doing so it violates European norms," Mr. Kagan wrote in the June-July edition of Policy Review. "And it must sometimes act unilaterally, not out of a passion for unilateralism but, given a weak Europe that has moved beyond power, because the United States has no choice but to act unilaterally."
As Sept. 11 demonstrated, America's vast power also makes it a target of resentment on many fronts -- religious, economic, political and military. Indeed, the Bush administration argued that the International Criminal Court could be used to prosecute politically motivated cases against Americans.
"It's disingenuous to say America won't be a lightning rod, given our position in the world," Mr. Kagan said in an interview. "French farmers are angry at the United States, poor Egyptians are angry at the United States. It's not Luxembourg that people will be aiming their grievances at."
There is a strong temptation on both sides of the Atlantic to view the current fight over the criminal court as one more case of a conservative Republican president trying to implement a policy of unilateralism. And to be sure, Mr. Bush has built a track record of opposing international alliances, including treaties to eliminate greenhouse gases, restrict anti-ballistic missile systems, prohibit land mines and ban biological weapons testing.
But there is also a long historical tradition in the United States of viewing alliances ("entangling alliances" Thomas Jefferson called them in his 1801 Inaugural Address) with suspicion. And, Mr. Kagan contends, with the exception of Woodrow Wilson's presidency and the post-Vietnam era, the United States has tended to believe that power is necessary to advance the American ideals of democracy and free markets to the world.
Moreover, Americans have tended to regard their nation's ideals as universally applicable, as well as desirable. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt put it in his famous State of the Union message of 1941: "In future days, we seek to secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms." Those freedoms -- of speech, of worship, from material want and from fear -- perfectly matched America's Constitutional principles and civic culture, but they were presented as the ideal toward which the entire world should aspire -- aided by American power.
Still, if Mr. Bush's views on the International Criminal Court were not out of the mainstream for an American president, his manner of opposing it might have been counterproductive.
Past administrations tended to consult publicly with allies or work through multinational organizations like the United Nations or the International Monetary Fund, even if, behind the scenes, they used their power to get their way.
President Clinton, for example, also disliked the court on grounds similar to the Bush administration's. But he signed the treaty on the premise that it would be easier for the United States to change it as a member of the court. He then declined to submit it to the Senate for ratification. In May, the Bush administration invalidated Mr. Clinton's signature.
MR. BUSH'S more confrontational approach could alienate America's allies even as Washington looks to them for help in the war on terrorism. For all its power, the United States still needs the military bases, ports and air fields, fuel supplies and overflight rights that only its allies can provide. No invasion of Iraq would be possible without those things -- and angering its allies over the International Criminal Court will not help the Bush administration get them, critics contend.
"Even if Bush succeeds through bullying to get what he wants on the I.C.C. where Clinton failed through diplomacy, this is likely to be a Pyrrhic victory," said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked for the National Security Council during the Clinton administration.
"It's not just about who wins, but also about how you win," he added. "And winning by creating lots of resentment abroad, thus further lessening the likelihood that allies will stand ready to help when we need them, may make this a short-term win, but a much more serious long-term loss."

HEADLINE: After a Decade of Plenty, Fewer Jobs for Lawyers 

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH

 BODY:
KAREN BLUMENFELD lost her job as general counsel to a small Manhattan publishing company in January. She has been enjoying herself ever since.
Far from panicking at the paucity of openings in her profession, Ms. Blumenfeld has plunged into activities she rarely had time for before: playing golf, working on two screenplays, doing consulting work for businesses, conducting mediations and volunteering for New Jersey Gasp, an anti-tobacco group. 
 "It gives me time to reflect on a career path that would be best for me," she said. 
 Ms. Blumenfeld's steeliness serves her well in what some are describing as the most brutal employment market for job-hunting lawyers in New York since the early 1990's. For the last year or so, large firms have been laying off lawyers to an extent not seen since then, and companies have been reducing the size of their internal legal departments.
There was a flurry of layoffs in 2001, mostly at the end of the year, including about 80 by Shearman & Sterling. One legal specialist says there has been no improvement in the job market since then. "It's pretty tough, except for extremely well-credentialed associates," said Brian T. Davis, managing director of the legal recruiting firm of Major, Hagen & Africa in New York.
In fact, lawyers are debating whether this recession will be even worse for them than the one in the early 1990's, the first time the big law firms let lawyers go for economic reasons.
"It's more subtle" than it was a decade ago, said Nancy Zeldis of Zeldis & Company, a legal recruiter in Manhattan. "Firms aren't admitting to letting people go the way they did before."
And many associates who have been laid off at large law firms are too young to have experienced that earlier downturn.
"In certain ways it's worse, because back then young associates didn't have the same expectations," another legal recruiter said. "Everyone thinks they're entitled to $200,000 a year."
The picture is no doubt painful to law students who had once banked on a slot in one of New York's big corporate firms, where the starting salary has been around $125,000. Last fall, New York legal employers looking for their crop of summer 2002 associates moderated their recruitment efforts on law school campuses, making an average of 73 offers, down from 136 the previous year, according to the National Association for Law Placement.
The problem is nationwide. According to The National Law Journal, a trade paper, the growth rate of large law firms across the country slowed in 2001 for the first time since 1993. In a recent Web survey of 96 legal employers, the placement association found that more than 40 percent had instituted either hiring freezes or layoffs of associates last year.
It is probably worse on the West Coast, laden with failed dot-coms, legal experts say. One 31-year-old former associate of a large San Francisco firm who was laid off late last year said she was job hunting both in San Francisco and New York. "The market is so bad I need to double my chances," said the woman, who insisted on anonymity.
Ms. Blumenfeld, who lives in Summit, N.J., considers herself lucky. Aside from managing a legal department of five at the Manhattan publishing firm where she was laid off (and which she insisted not be identified), she was its vice president for business development. Before that, she had worked for AT&T, and she believes that her business background will give her an edge in her search.
For now, she is living comfortably on her savings and having a lot of fun, but even so, going five months without a job is starting to unsettle her. "I'm not going to be out on the streets," said Ms. Blumenfeld, a graduate of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. But, she added, "my goal is to find a job now."
Joel A. Bloom is also becoming nervous. Mr. Bloom was laid off in April from his job as general counsel at Claritybank.com (now National American Bank), owned by Praesidium Capital, in Rye, N.Y. The venture was started in 2000 just when the dot-com bubble was bursting, he says, and made layoffs when it restructured itself as a community bank.
Mr. Bloom, 40, who saw the writing on the wall, began looking for work before he left the company. Like Ms. Blumenfeld, he has experience in doing business deals, and he has an M.B.A. as well as a law degree. "I've been in contact with a lot of people I know in the business and not in the business," he said. "I'm directly soliciting companies I know of. I have a lot of good contacts and leads."
Does Mr. Bloom, who lives near Lincoln Center with his wife and child, feel desperate? "Yes, because I've been looking a while without great results, but no, because I'm not worried where my next meal is coming from," he said.
It is also a small consolation that he is not alone. "There are more fathers pushing strollers on the Upper West Side on weekdays than I've ever noticed before," he said.
More than in most professions, job prospects for lawyers depend a lot on what practice area they are in. In the boom years of the 1990's, mergers-and-acquisitions work was hot. Now, it is bankruptcy lawyers who are aching for leisure time. Other strong areas include litigation, which seems to heat up in an economic downturn, and intellectual property.
"Firms heavily into the capital markets are suffering a slowdown," said Charles K. O'Neill, managing partner of Chadbourne & Parke, a Manhattan firm that has been able to hire 20 experienced associates several years out of law school this year because of its significant litigation and bankruptcy practices.
The slowdown in deal-making is bad news for Bernard M. Levy, a 39-year-old contracts specialist and native of Switzerland, who earned his law degree there. Mr. Levy has been looking for a job since last summer, when he was still earning a graduate law degree at New York University, and says many of his friends who are recent law school graduates are in the same boat.
"There are no jobs out there," he said. "That's what you hear from all sides. The firms are not in a hiring mood. In-house is not hiring. It's part of the same environment." He says he has had only one interview at a law firm.
Mr. Levy lives on the Upper West Side with his American wife, a part-time tax lawyer for the Internal Revenue Service, and two children. Because he holds an M.B.A., he assumes an in-house position might be the best fit for him. But, he said, "at this point, I'll consider anything."

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, the online database version of an article in the Job Market section on Sunday about the employment market for lawyers included two firms erroneously among those that have had layoffs. (The error did not appear in the printed version.) The firms -- Sullivan & Cromwell and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton -- say they did not lay off lawyers in the spring.

How to Succeed in Texas by Really, Really Trying

BYLINE:  By David Feld; David Feld is an editor at large for PaperCity magazine.

 BODY:
Texas in the late 70's and early 80's was one big, baroque barbecue. Oil was $30 a barrel, real estate was booming and the savings and loans were riding high. I was in my 20's then, and all I really remember is an endless blur of parties, Champagne, lame and really big hair. I went through three tuxedos and 15 pairs of evening pumps. Then it was over. In 1986 oil prices plummeted, the banks collapsed and the savings-and-loan scandal finished off the romp. When some formerly rich friends of mine had a "we are poor" party, I knew it was time to return to New York. 
 But now I'm back, and Texas is hotter than ever. I'm not talking about the weather -- which as I write is pushing 90 degrees at 8 in the morning -- I'm talking about the international social scene. With Vogue's Anna Wintour dating a Texan (he lives out in the middle of nowhere on a ranch in Marfa) and yet another Bush in the White House, New York and European socialites are making pilgrimages to the Lone Star State like horses back to the barn. As many of us learned during the wretched excess of the 80's, it's not that hard to make it big in Texas society. But here's a bit of advice: 
 * You never ask a Texan how big his ranch is. (That's like asking the size of his bank balance, or worse.)
* You tell everyone that you sold Enron at $90 and that you never really liked Ken Lay.
* You cozy up to Becca Cason Thrash because she's the new Lynn Wyatt, despite what W magazine says.
* You know how to handle firearms and always keep a small one in your Judith Leiber minaudiere.
* You (or your progeny) have gone drinking with at least one Bush daughter.
* Your surgically enhanced breasts are double the size of your waist. 
* You declare that the Bush family comes from Connecticut when you're entertaining old money. (Yes, there is old money in Texas.)
* You give away a lot of dough.
* You buy a patron table at the Crystal Charity Ball in Dallas or the Opera Ball in Houston. 
* You choose an obscure disease as your charity, so as to be chairwoman of a black-tie gala.
* You change clothes at least three times during the above -- in order to show off your surgically enhanced body.
* You wear Pierre Balmain couture.
* You live in River Oaks (Houston); Highland Park, Old Preston Hollow (Dallas); Alamo Heights (San Antonio); with second homes in Aspen or La Jolla, plus the obligatory Texas ranch for hunting.
* You wangle an appointment with Paul Garzotto, the society decorator who almost never takes on new clients. 
* You call your 10,000-to-15,000-square-foot house (in pseudo-Norman, French Louis or English Country style) a pied-a-terre. 
* You describe your 20,000-to-30,000-square-foot manse as a nice size for raising a family. 
* You know your 50,000-square-foot spread could be held against you in a court of law.
* You're on a first-name basis with Carolyn Farb. 
* You have mastered the one-syllable pronunciation of y'all. 
* You appreciate a good euphemism -- as in, he's creative, which means he's gay or works for Arthur Andersen. 
* You compliment your wife and everyone else's wife in mixed company and discuss the anatomy of your secretary when it's men only.
* You always brag about your hunting. 
* You carry on your trysts at The Mansion on Turtle Creek.
* You wince when people make big-hair jokes and carry your Aqua Net in a brown paper bag. 
* You know that everybody really likes Anne better than Mercedes. 
* You know that a Bass is not a fish.

So Who's On First? O'Neill, Or O'Neill?

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
ASK Warren Buffett when his new album is coming out. Then run up to Yankee Stadium to see the field where Paul H. O'Neill used to play.
 Those are some of the ideas you could have gleaned from people questioned at random about financial matters recently. 
 From their retirement funds to their money market checking accounts, Americans have never before had so much invested in the capital markets. Yet surveys suggest that Americans have never known less about how those markets work or what is happening in the economy. 
To find out how accurate those surveys are, Money & Business buttonholed a few people to test their E.Q., or economics quotient.
And what better place to do that than in Manhattan, the financial capital of the world? New Yorkers are famous for knowing everything, so of course people in Times Square -- home of the Nasdaq market, Morgan Stanley and other financial titans -- would have financially perfect scores, right?
Not quite.
Chris Betz, a Broadway producer, said he felt comfortable with his business prowess. Mr. Betz knew that a 401(k) was a retirement plan and garnered half a point for calling Fidelity an "investment banker." (It is actually the largest mutual fund company.) But Mr. Betz was not alone in thinking, incorrectly, that Warren E. Buffett, the financier, was a musician.
Mr. Betz was the only one, among dozens interviewed, to say that G.D.P. stood for "geriatric domestic properties." The correct answer, of course, is gross domestic product, a measure of the size of an economy that estimates the total value of goods and services produced in a given period.
Manhattan may also be home to Wall Street, but even when told that this was a financial quiz, New Yorkers seemed to confuse Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, with Paul A. O'Neill, the retired outfielder for the New York Yankees.
"He's a Yankees baseball player," said John O'Brien, a bartender at Robert Emmetts Bar and Restaurant at Eighth Avenue and 44th Street. "He is known for never being happy, being sullen. That's all I know."
After noting that he had learned about the G.D.P. in school, Mr. O'Brien said that the initials stood for "general domestic program" but that he had no idea what a closed-end mutual fund was, what a 401(k) was or who Mr. Buffett was. Nor did he know why he should care.
To clear up some specifics:
* Mr. Buffett, whom people often confused with the musician Jimmy Buffett, is the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company for investments that have made him a billionaire several times over.
* Closed-end mutual funds, with a fixed number of shares, usually trade like stocks, often at a price different from the value of their underlying assets.
* Open-end mutual funds continually sell as many shares as investors are willing to buy and are priced at the value of their assets at the end of each trading day.
* A 401(k) is an account that allows employees to save and invest for their retirement. It is named after Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Service code, which provides tax breaks for the plans.
TO help Americans learn more about such matters of money management, Mr. O'Neill (the Treasury secretary) started an Office of Financial Education in May. The move has been praised by business groups and by Alan Greenspan (the chairman of the Federal Reserve).
In the informal survey, most people answered only one question, if any, correctly. Some foreign visitors, however, did better than Americans.
"I am not sure I know much of any of this," warned Lorraine Wilson, an Irish tourist in Times Square. But she fared better than most. She could identify Mr. O'Neill and knew the meaning of G.D.P.
Replies from tourists on Broadway in front of Morgan Stanley's headquarters at 47th Street were rarely better than average. Nor did the merchants and tourists outside the Nasdaq sign at Broadway and 43rd Street do much better.
Golam Kabir, 60, an immigrant from Bangladesh who now lives in Queens, was on track when he said that Fidelity was an "investment fund" and that a 401(k) was "a retirement account, and I don't have one."
But Mr. Kabir, who sells maps and atlases from stands in Manhattan, missed the mark with Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Buffett, a variety of forms of mutual funds and G.D.P.
He was philosophical about the pop quiz, saying that he thought that none of this business terminology was really all that important.
"In America, the only way to success is to work hard and be honest," he said. "If you are dishonest you can make a lot of money, but that will go away. There is Enron, there is WorldCom. They earned people a billion dollars, but it will not be worth it for them in the long run. I would rather be making an honest living for my family."
Mr. Kabir smiled and added, "Would you like to purchase an $8 map?"

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Betting Big On Reviving 'Black Holes'

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: GALATI, Romania 

 BODY:
THE Stygian mills of the Sidex steel works are pulsing again, spread out against the fading sunset here on the banks of the lower Danube, spewing sparks and yellowish gray smoke. A year ago, Sidex, once the centerpiece of Communist Romania's overnight industrialization, was bankrupt, bartering its finished steel for raw materials. One of its four huge blast furnaces was wrecked and the others worked only intermittently. There was little sign of a future for its 27,000 employees.
 It was called the black hole of Romania's economy, siphoning off a million dollars a day from the state budget, until international lenders told Romania that unless Sidex was sold or shut, the government's credit lines would be cut. 
 Now, after being sold for $366 million, Sidex has turned around and says it is making an operating profit. 
Credit for the reversal of Sidex's fortunes goes to its new owner, Lakshmi N. Mittal, 51, an entrepreneur born in India and based in London. His companies have quietly become one of the world's top steelmaking groups, largely by cheaply acquiring huge money-losing state-owned mills from governments desperate to remove them from state books.
Applying strict management techniques common in many industries but not in the hidebound steel industry, Mr. Mittal says he has turned most of the mills into money makers, mainly by producing low-cost, lower-quality steel products and selling them through his global network.
"There was a time when my father used to tell me that steel-making is an art," Mr. Mittal said in an interview last month in Galati, 120 miles northeast of Bucharest. "I say it's a science. There are tools and you just have to implement them properly." 
Today, Mr. Mittal's two primary companies, LNM Holdings, which is privately held, and Ispat International, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, own steel mills in 13 countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Kazakhstan, Indonesia and Trinidad. He bought Sidex in November, has just bought the Nova Hut mill in the Czech Republic and has his eye on a group of steel mills in Poland.
Like many family-run businesses, the Mittal holdings are a complex web, making it hard to come by financial details of individual mills. Two important plants are known to be losing money. The collapse of steel slab prices last year was especially hard on North American steel makers, including the Ispat Inland Inc. mill, in East Chicago, Ind., which Mr. Mittal's group acquired with its purchase of Inland Steel Industries' steel-making business in 1998. And markets have just begun to rebound for the debt-burdened Ispat Mexicana, built by the Mexican government for $2.2 billion in the early 1980's and bought by Ispat International for $25 million cash and the purchase of $195 million in Mexican government bonds at near junk-level interest rates. 
Mr. Mittal contends that most of his mills, including the vast Karmet works in northern Kazakhstan, are making money.
Steel is not a glamorous business, and Mr. Mittal's recent acquisitions have focused on its least glamorous end, producing mainly what steel makers call "flat products," steel plates and beams used in ships ships and boilers, heavy-duty construction and lower-quality rolled metal for consumer goods like washing machines and lower-quality cars like Romania's own Dacia.
Other mills, like the Ispat Inland operation, produce high-quality rolled steel for automobiles and products like iron rods that can be squeezed into all kinds of wire.
Mr. Mittal says he has a customer and supply base that is broad enough to ride out the steel industry's cyclical downturns and international trade disputes. His largest mills are in developing countries, Kazakhstan and Romania, and are thus exempt from new 30 percent tariffs on imported steel. His other European steel plants do little business with the United States.
Industry analysts agree that the most important elements of Mr. Mittal's success have been geographical diversity and the application of basic modern management.
"What they do is pretty fascinating," said David Jardini, a steel industry consultant at Hatch Beddows, a consulting firm in London. "They have a core team of guys who go in there and work day and night to implement cost-cutting measures, market reorientation, marketing changes, efficiency ideas. And they go to places where others fear to tread."
Sidex has been a typical story for Mr. Mittal's group.
"Cost, quality and productivity are the keys to the steel business," said Narendra Chaudhary, Sidex's new general director. At Sidex, he said, where Communist-era managers had preferred to produce at any cost, "these were not the priorities."
"We came with a different emphasis," Mr. Chaudhary said.
First to go was the plant's top management, replaced by senior executives from Mr. Mittal's other mills. A $100 million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development gave the plant immediate cash needed to end a barter system, in which it had relied on dozens of small trading companies that took its steel and delivered raw materials at vast markups.
Flush with cash from the the bank loan, Mr. Chaudhary's team negotiated long-term supply contracts for the 14 million metric tons of raw materials that Sidex consumes annually, using Ispat's contacts and computer pricing models developed for other Ispat plants. Old debts were renegotiated, and the plant paid taxes to the city of Galati for the first time in years. Mr. Mittal also decided to keep the plant's first-division soccer team on the payroll. 
(In Kazakhstan, where Mr. Mittal bought the colossal Karmet mill, he also took over most of the city of Temirtau, including a power plant, schools and the tram system.)
The new sales director at Sidex, Satyakam Basu, abolished Sidex's combined sales and purchasing department, which had encouraged the barter deals. He visited customers, some of whom had never met a Sidex salesman. Instead, distributors had offered Sidex products at varying prices.
"I realized my biggest competitor was me," Mr. Basu said. "One customer in Turkey told me he had five offers from Sidex, so I said, 'Unless you buy from an authorized distributor I won't deliver,' and I told the distributors that unless I knew the name of the end user I wouldn't sell to them."
Sidex is still dark, dirty and smoky. A blast furnace that exploded in 1999 still lies in a heap. But inside, the plant is already changing. Mr. Mittal's managers said they had tripled production of the lucrative cold-rolled steel that is used for consumer goods and automobiles, raised quality and reduced the accident rate by two-thirds.
Workers at Sidex have expressed willingness to adapt to Mr. Mittal's capitalist demands, but some grumble they want a greater share of whatever profits he says it is making now.
"You have to work to make money and keep your job, of course," said Atoni Dumitri, 37, a machinery operator, "but we can work harder if we are paid better." Take-home wages at Sidex average about $150 a month, above Romania's average but still not much better than a subsistence level.
Chris Beauman, a steel expert at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said he was astounded that it had taken so long for an investor to realize that East European mills could produce inexpensive steel.
"The question is: Why isn't everyone trying to do this?" he said. "We saw in Kazakhstan that you can make money out of a low-cost steelworks. In the automotive industry everyone thought it was a wise move for VW to buy Skoda. Why not in steel?" Skoda, the Czech carmaker, has become a high-quality, low-price brand for Volkswagen.
Among American steel makers, only U.S. Steel has bought an East European mill, VSZ, the East Slovakian Iron Works. .
The lack of steel-mill buyers may have to do with the glut that has pushed down not only steel prices but also the financial performance and stock prices of steel makers. In 2001, Ispat International lost $312 million, compared with a profit of $99 million in 2000, and sales fell 16 percent, to $4.49 billion. Its shares have fallen to $2.95 a share from an offering price of $30 in 1997.
Mr. Mittal's privately held company, LNM Holdings, which owns about 80 percent of Ispat International, fared better, reporting a profit of $113 million last year, down from $299 million in 2000.
Still, Mr. Mittal's steel-making colleagues agree that he has properly sensed the industry's direction.
"The industry does need to be consolidated, it's one of the most fragmented in the world and right now that's what's appropriate," said Daniel R. DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor, a fast-growing American steel company and one of the few to be consistently profitable. Mr. Mittal's strategy of buying existing, badly managed plants, Mr. DiMicco said, is the best way to do that. Another important part of Mr. Mittal's strategy has been to buy cheaply, and to leave the sellers holding their old debt. By focusing on privatizing government-owned mills, Mr. Mittal has been able to swing some sweet deals.
He managed that in the Czech Republic, where the government was eager to sell the Nova Hut mill before national elections last month, absorbing debts that it could deal with after the votes were in. In Poland, he may be able to work the same formula with a Socialist government eager to avoid huge layoffs ahead of the difficult last steps toward joining the European Union. Romania, too, agreed to absorb many of Sidex's losses.
Mr. Jardini, the Hatch Beddows consultant, said Mr. Mittal's mills had another advantage. Unlike senior management at most steel mills around the world, Mr. Mittal's men -- and they are nearly all men -- are managers first and engineers second.
"They do rightly regard the output of their mills as a commodity that competes in a global marketplace where cost competitiveness is an absolute necessity," Mr. Jardini said. "In the mills they acquire, they just bear down on efficiency."

HEADLINE: Addressing Corporate Abuses 

 BODY:
George W. Bush is the first president with an M.B.A., and that training should make him especially well equipped to handle the growing anxiety over corporate scandals. Indeed, with questions still lingering over a 1990 sale by Mr. Bush of $848,560 worth of stock in a company on whose board he sat, the president should be eager to tackle the plague of accounting and insider-trading abuse. Yet the Bush team has been so slow to react to the need for higher standards of disclosure and tougher regulation of business practices that even Congress has moved fast enough to seize the initiative. When the president addresses these issues on Tuesday in a much-anticipated speech in New York City, he needs to lay out a vigorous agenda for reform.
 The first order of business for Mr. Bush is to show that he understands the depths of the public's fears and is ready to rethink some of the basic assumptions of policy makers in Washington, where Republicans and Democrats alike have pushed in recent years for more and more deregulation and self-regulation of business activities. 
 Both Congress and the administration have to prove to a skeptical public that they have broken free of the link between business lobbying and policy-making. Many of Mr. Bush's key appointees, including Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, come from the financial and accounting industries and have, as private citizens, advocated a hands-off attitude by the government. The administration's emphasis has been on enforcing laws already on the books rather than tightening the laws themselves. Mr. Bush needs to be more open to doing both.
Specifically, the president should vigorously support the legislation sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland to set up a new accounting oversight board and bar accounting firms from providing other financial consulting services to their clients. The S.E.C. itself can issue rules adopting some of these reforms, even though many of them have long been opposed by the accounting industry. Mr. Bush should further call for putting into practice the suggestion by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to make corporate officers more personally liable for misleading financial statements. He can also support the move to diversify boards of directors, and their audit and compensation committees, and to organize them in ways that ensure they do not meekly approve management decisions. 
In the same vein, the president should line up to oppose an attempt under way in Congress to handcuff local prosecutors, like Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York, in going after securities violations. And he should back efforts to keep companies from avoiding taxes by setting up dummy headquarters in Bermuda or elsewhere overseas.
There is finally an element of the old cliche of practicing what one preaches. Federal budgeting in recent years has been as guilty of questionable financial practices as the accounting of many businesses that have gone under. Tax cuts have been given artificial expiration dates and other phony devices to disguise their true cost. Federal spending that is labeled "emergency" is logged off the books, so to speak. And this administration has refused to identify the people who served as its advisers in making energy policy. These practices must change if the government's drive for openness in the business world is to have any credibility.
We are not suggesting that Mr. Bush is to blame for the current crisis of confidence in the American financial system. There is plenty of responsibility to go around, and those who committed the abuses will have to answer for what they have done. But the president has an opportunity on Tuesday to set the tone of a new debate. If he is to rise to the occasion, he should focus not on punishing the few bad apples, as he put it recently, but on changing the ground rules to restore the confidence of investors and, more important, of the American citizens who work in the system, invest in it and count on its health to keep the national and international economies strong.

HEADLINE: House to Question Executives of WorldCom 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
The House Financial Services Committee is expected to hear testimony on Monday from several executives, accountants and analysts involved in WorldCom's disclosure last month that it improperly disguised more than $3.8 billion of expenses as profits.
 It was not clear whether the pivotal figures in the accounting scandal, Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer; Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive; and David F. Myers, the former controller; would agree to testify or would invoke their Fifth Amendment right. 
 Much of the hearing is expected to discuss the context in which WorldCom evolved into the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier and one of the world's largest carriers of Internet traffic only to teeter in recent days on the brink of insolvency after its accounting problems were disclosed in late June. The committee held similar hearings that discussed problems at Enron and Global Crossing. 
"It's clear that in the telecom sector where you've had some real problems with overcapacity, some real problems in the business, it appears that some of these cost-cutting efforts and cooking the books occurred to basically hide what was a failing business practice," Michael G. Oxley, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said today on "Fox News Sunday." "I suspect that we will see some of that tomorrow at the hearing."
Mr. Sullivan, who was fired by WorldCom after the accounting irregularities were discovered, is being pushed from several fronts. WorldCom filed a lawsuit in federal court in Jackson, Miss., on Friday demanding that Mr. Sullivan pay back the $10 million retention bonus he received last year. 
Separately, Mr. Sullivan is said to have urged Cynthia Cooper, an internal auditor who uncovered in May the strategy of disguising expenses as profits, to suspend her review of WorldCom's accounting practices. Mr. Sullivan's lawyer, Irving Nathan of the Washington firm of Arnold & Porter, declined to comment.
While it was not clear whether Mr. Ebbers, Mr. Sullivan or Mr. Myers would testify, WorldCom's current chief executive, John W. Sidgmore, and its chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., have agreed to speak before the committee. Melvin Dick, a former auditor for Arthur Andersen, and Jack Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, are also expected to testify.
Continuing a strategy started last week, Mr. Sidgmore is expected to emphasize the company's important, if not essential, role in the nation's economy, people briefed on his testimony said. A spokesman for WorldCom, Bradford Burns, declined to comment on the testimony of the company's executives.
While stopping short of requesting government assistance, Mr. Sidgmore is expected to stress the differences in his management team, which took over in late April, and that of Mr. Ebbers. Mr. Sidgmore claims to have had a nonoperational role at WorldCom since 1998, effectively distancing himself from taking part in managerial decisions.
Mr. Sidgmore came to WorldCom in 1998 when the company acquired MFS Communications, the parent company of UUNet, the Internet backbone company he had created. While it appears he did not have many day-to-day responsibilities, Mr. Sidgmore did sit on WorldCom's board.
Mr. Roberts is expected to discuss WorldCom's role in stimulating competition in the telecommunications industry, stressing the reasons why the company should survive, a person briefed on his testimony said.
Mr. Grubman, the analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who has been criticized for his role in promoting WorldCom's prospects and only recommending to investors that they sell the company's stock a day before news of the accounting irregularities came to light, is expected to deliver a defense of his actions and investment opinions, people briefed on his testimony said.
Mr. Grubman, probably one of the most influential telecommunications analysts on Wall Street, has consistently defended his view that smaller, more entrepreneurial companies like WorldCom would ultimately overtake larger, more established companies like AT&T, the long-distance leader. His bullish opinion of the prospects of these smaller companies contributed to the formation of expectations for the industry that resulted in an overwhelming glut of communications capacity and a string of corporate failures.
Arda Nazerian, a spokeswoman for Salomon Smith Barney, declined to comment on Mr. Grubman's testimony.
Mr. Grubman is expected to tell the committee that he was as surprised as everyone else when he learned of WorldCom's questionable accounting strategies, according to people briefed on his testimony. He is also expected to defend his relationship with Mr. Ebbers, WorldCom's former chief executive, arguing that it was part of the normal course of doing business. 
Responding to concern that his investment advice contributed to losses at public pension funds around the country, a particularly sensitive issue after funds reported more than $1 billion of losses because of the collapse of WorldCom's stock price, Mr. Grubman is expected to say that his was not the only advice these funds used in making investment decisions since many funds had their own analysts.
Also in Congress, Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is also investigating WorldCom, said on NBC's "Meet the Press," that Max E. Bobbitt, chairman of WorldCom's audit committee, was allowed a $1-a-month lease on a WorldCom corporate jet, an arrangement that raises concerns about conflicts of interest.
Mr. Bobbitt could not be reached for comment.
The House Financial Services Committee earlier withdrew investigations to Mr. Bobbitt and Ms. Cooper out of concern that their testimony might limit the effectiveness of the continuing federal investigations.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Journal's New Head Faces Tough Business Challenge 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 5 

 BODY:
Karen Elliott House has returned, triumphant, to the newspaper where her reputation lingers like the echo of distant artillery.
 When she left The Wall Street Journal to become vice president of Dow Jones in 1989, readers knew Ms. House as a reigning impresario of diplomatic coverage, a keen questioner of leaders from London to Amman, where her interviews with King Hussein won her a Pulitzer Prize. Colleagues knew her as smart, ambitious and exacting foreign editor, a news executive who was both admired and feared. 
 As of last week, she is The Journal's publisher, guardian of the heart of Dow Jones & Company. She was gone for 13 years, overseeing a portfolio that included the creation of Dow Jones's European and Asian financial television networks -- now co-owned with CNBC -- as well as joint ventures with foreign publishers and the expansion of The Journal's overseas editions. 
But to Dow Jones watchers, the two most salient facts are these: She is married to Peter R. Kann, the chief executive of Dow Jones; and she is taking a title usually held by Dow Jones's chief executives or chief-executives-in-waiting. Not that her ascension is necessarily inevitable.
What is inevitable is that Ms. House, who is 54, will face a difficult test in the months ahead. The Journal has been punished by a recession that hit its core franchises, technology and financial advertising, and she must demonstrate the business acumen to make The Journal into a global force, finding new revenue to cushion it against such cyclical beatings.
Even if she does not want the top corporate job -- she says that she will be too old when her husband reaches the retirement age of 65 in about five years -- her leadership of the 2,400-member staff of the nation's premier business newspaper will be closely monitored, within and without The Journal. 
Her sharp analytical skills, creativity and prodigious work habits have long since been proved. In her years as a business executive, she nudged a division with heavy losses toward profitability, according to two executives who have seen the accounts. The question about Ms. House is whether, as a manager, she tends to inspire or to instill fear. 
She knows this. "The longer you have a management job, the more it sinks in how dependent you are on the people who work for and with you," she said in an interview at Dow Jones's headquarters in central New Jersey. She added, "Everyone works best when they feel happy and appreciated." 
But so intimidating is the reputation of Ms. House, who once flung a glass of white wine in a fit of anger at The Journal's then-managing editor, that most of the 15 people interviewed for this article would speak only on background, even when praising her.
What's not at issue, at least as far as Dow Jones executives are concerned, is her ties to the chief executive. "The fact that the boss's wife rose to these senior positions with everyone thinking about it and no one addressing it directly was a problem for The Journal," said one newspaper executive who knows The Journal's culture. "No one who knows Karen would doubt that on merit she'd deserve a shot at the publisher's job."
To Ms. House, questions about nepotism or brusqueness reflect an implicit sexism that she said has dogged her for years. "I am what I am, and I was what I was before I ever laid eyes on Peter Kann," she said. She said she once considered taking an offer to work for U.S. News & World Report to shed the appearance of nepotism, but concluded, "I'm not going to leave the best newspaper in the world just because some other people think things I can't control." 
The animosity toward her, said Philip Revzin, a former Journal reporter who is the vice president of the international division, is stirred because Ms. House is "a very talented and ambitious and assertive woman" married to Mr. Kann. "She doesn't sugar-coat things a lot," he said.
Does she think she is tough? Tough, she said, "is frequently meant as complimentary when applied to a man and uncomplimentary when applied to a woman. I do not regard it as a badge of honor to be in the cult of toughness. To me it is important to be fair and truthful."
Ambitious? "Also a great attribute in a man and a slur in a woman," she said. "What's wrong with wanting to do better and do more?"
That was her approach at the international division, first as vice president then, from 1995 on, as president. 
To help support The Wall Street Journal Europe, she internally promoted a deal, negotiated by Mr. Kann and Peter Skinner, the Dow Jonesgeneral counsel, by which Handelsblatt, a German financial newspaper that is a subsidiary of the von Holtzbrinck Group, acquired a 49 percent stake in The European Journal. Dow Jones, in turn, took a 22 percent stake in Handelsblatt, effective Jan. 1, 2000. The European edition has turned a profit in three of the last five years, one person who has seen the data said.
To find new audiences in Latin America, she negotiated a deal in 1994 to put a branded section of Journal news pages translated into Spanish into nine Latin American newspapers; The Wall Street Journal Americas is now published, in Spanish and Portuguese, as part of 25 newspapers in 18 Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Ms. House said she has been traveling at least 100 days a year as president of the international division, on errands like negotiating with Singaporean ministers to loosen the collar on distribution of The Far Eastern Economic Review and the Asian edition of The Journal. 
On her watch, The Asian Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal gradually increased their share of advertising markets in the 1990's, but fell off sharply in the last 16 months. 
In the first four months of the year, according to Competitive Media Reports, The Asian Wall Street Journal had a 16.7 percent share of advertising among English-language competitors; The Wall Street Journal Europe had 6.8 percent.
But by the simple measure of profit and loss, the division has not been a glowing success. The losses have been stemmed, two executives said, but sustained profitability has not been achieved.
"International is really a long term game," said one executive familiar with the efforts of Ms. House's division. "They've broadened their reach. I think they've done all right, but there's a question of how big the market is.
One of Ms. House's strategies was to push up the circulation of both international editions, cutting prices to regular subscribers and increasing cut-rate bulk distribution. From 1997 to 2001, according to company reports, the combined circulation of these editions rose 53 percent. During that period, Dow Jones's international circulation revenue, most of which comes from these editions, declined 6 percent.
The reorganization that accompanied Ms. House's appointment last week will make it easier for her to pursue a joint advertising and marketing strategy for both the domestic and international editions,
And instead of two chains of command -- the international editions' reporters had answered to Ms. House while the foreign correspondents for the domestic newspaper had reported to the managing editor, Paul Steiger -- Mr. Steiger will now control all news staffs.
Mr. Steiger now reports to Ms. House, who reports to the new chief operating officer, Richard F. Zannino, who in turn reports to Mr. Kann.
Ms. House's direct and even brusque management style has not hurt her with Dow Jones's board, including the heirs of the Bancroft family who control the voting stock in the company.
Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., an outside board member, said yesterday that Ms. House's abilities as a journalist had been evident for years before her appointment as publisher. He added: "What the board has observed and been impressed with over the years is her real grasp of the business side and her ability to appreciate both and interweave them in a balanced way."
As for the question of who would be the next chief executive, he said that all members of the Dow Jones executive committee would be among the candidates to replace Mr. Kann, including Ms. House. He said that Ms. House's relationship to Mr. Kann was an issue that the board had discussed repeatedly before concluding that her talents trumped any lingering questions about the perception of favoritism.
Ms. House is more comfortable with questions about her evolution as a manager than about the nepotism issue. "It took me a while to understand that if you are a manager, people look at you differently," she said. "When you say something to someone, it comes across differently than when you were their colleague. That seems obvious, but it wasn't."
And if she had it to do over again, she said, she would not throw the wine.

HEADLINE: Myth America 2002 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Here are a handful of myths that cause what's left of Europe's left to misperceive U.S. foreign policy: 
 Myth 1: America is temporarily dominated by self-serving isolationists who reject treaties designed by sensible Lilliputians to tie down the superpower Gulliver. 
 Reality: In the past decade, the U.S. saved Europe from becoming an economic vassal to Iraq, which was on its way to conquering Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. A few years later, as Europe temporized, we led NATO's defeat of Serbia's takeover of the Balkans. Recently, we drove Islamist terrorists, who threaten Europe as much as America, from their training bases in Afghanistan. Is it too much to ask to protect our 250,000 troops defending freedom abroad, along with aid workers and journalists, from a treaty enabling publicity-hungry prosecutors to harass them? 
Myth 2: (flip side of first myth) We're interventionist bullies, with no regard for the sovereignty of countries whose threatening leaders are better dealt with diplomatically. 
Reality: Saddam Hussein has been jerking around the United Nations for seven years, ignoring his surrender agreement and buying off French and Russian defenders while building a nuclear and germ-warfare capability for delivery by North Korean missiles or, more likely, through terrorist cutouts. Sanctions, dumb and smart, have dismally failed; the danger of nuclear blackmail grows to head-in-the-sand Parisians and Berliners as well as vulnerable New Yorkers. Brits and Turks may reluctantly help us, but European handwringers and Arab monarchs want a free ride. 
Myth 3: The Bush administration, with its disdain for treaties, does not understand the nuances of dealing with nuclear-armed Russia, which must never be allowed to feel humiliated. 
Reality: Lo and behold, when the U.S. withdrew as promised from the outdated ABM treaty, the clear skies did not fall. Contrary to all European fears and dire predictions, Vladimir Putin was induced to put the best face on the inevitability of a U.S. missile defense against rogue nations and terrorists. In return for this (and, mistakenly, for being allowed to get away with secret sales of nuclear know-how to Iran), Russia is allowing us to give it $10 billion or more to safely reduce its unneeded nuclear stockpile. No humiliation; only relief all around. 
Myth 4: Europe holds the high moral ground in providing aid to the Palestinian "resistance," while Bush, in thrall to the Jewish lobby, refuses to force Israel to abandon its "occupation." 
Reality: America has broken free of the decade-long romance with a terrorist and is now trying a radical new idea of encouraging Palestinians to set up the first democratic Arab state. Yasir Arafat may be elected its president to attend formal ceremonies with Israel's president whatsisname, but power would rest in a parliament with parties that would elect a prime minister. This chief executive, strengthened by an independent judiciary and free press, would extract the "painful compromises" that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said Israel is prepared to make after the terror war ends. This would demolish -- 
Myth 5: America is in the clutches of hard-line, hard-nosed, bellicose warrior-executives, while Europe is the continent of highminded peace-seekers. 
Reality: America is the place seized with an intelligently moralistic, Wilsonian vision of peace with its necessary component of freedom. Because the old "realism" has failed in the Middle East, does it not make sense to impose some idealism on the players? With new leaders freely elected in the West Bank and Gaza, and with a federal government created after the deposal of the dictatorship in Iraq, the Arab world would have its chance to catch up with the rest of the world. The leap into the present might fail while daring greatly, but the treadmill of more despotism leads nowhere.
Myth 6: The political popularity of Colin Powell will enable State Department worldliness to triumph over the Bush-Rumsfeld-Cheney cowboy mentality, enabling Europe's multilateral impotence to harness American superpower. 
Reality: Colin's a good soldier and political loyalist. If he were tempted to threaten, Haig-like, to quit, he knows that Bush has Condi Rice waiting in the wings. Powell will lose a few, win on occasion, but will stick around through the next election. Rectifying a decade-old strategic error and bringing Europe along to remake the world is too much fun.

HEADLINE: Read Their Lips: No Taxes. (Period.); 
Smokers Flocking to Reservations to Buy Cigarettes, Cheap

BYLINE:  By HOPE REEVES 

DATELINE: MASTIC, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Call it tax avoidance and call it completely legal. 
 In this case, call it what Don Kemler does once a week, like clockwork. Every Tuesday, Mr. Kemler, 48, navigates the winding roads of this Suffolk County community, sliding his electric blue pickup truck into a parking space facing two wooden carvings of American Indian men. He climbs the stairs to the Peace Pipe Smoke Shop, plunks down his $21.25 and leaves with his prize: one carton -- 10 packs -- of USA Gold cigarettes. 
 "It's a filthy habit," Mr. Kemler, a lumber salesman from Shirley, said one evening in June, referring to his 30 years of smoking. "But that doesn't mean I'm willing to pay those crazy taxes." 
Mr. Kemler is one of many New Yorkers (there is no official count) who visit the tiny Unkechaug Indian Nation to buy tax-free cigarettes. Unwilling to pay those taxes -- $1.50 a pack to the state, and now an additional $1.50 a pack in city taxes for New York City smokers -- these New Yorkers buy off-brand cigarettes for just over $2 a pack, as opposed to nearly $7 a pack for city smokers. (Savings are similar for premium brands, which sell for less than $3.50 a pack on reservations.)
Mr. Kemler frequents the Peace Pipe, one of four smoke shops on the five-square-block Poospatuck Reservation, population 220, about 70 miles east of Times Square. The Unkechaugs are one of many Indian nations, including the Seneca Nation in upstate New York and the Shinnecock Nation in Southampton, that take advantage of their right as sovereign nations to buy and sell cigarettes without paying or charging the hefty taxes from the state and the city.
They fought hard for this right, which they say has moved their nations from poverty to relative wealth, and have been in and out of court for years over the issue. One main opponent is the New York Association of Convenience Stores, whose members make a lot of money on cigarette sales. Last December, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to a lower court decision granting Indian sovereignty in this matter, seemingly exhausting the association's attempts to force the state to collect the tax from Indian nations. The association is now trying to get federal or state legislation passed to ban what it terms the state's "selective enforcement policy," said James Calvin, the president of the association. 
So for now the nations sell legally from their shops, over the phone and via the Internet. Their advertisements, heavily peppered with exclamation points, read, "Stop paying those high retail prices and start saving with Indiansmokesonline!" and "Make Senecasmokes your choice for discount cigarettes, you'll be glad you did!" 
Shoppers who visit the store tend to buy two to five cartons at a time, shop owners say, while those who buy over the phone or Internet buy from 2 cartons to 50. (There is no legal limit to the number of cartons one customer can buy.)
It's hard to imagine what one person does with 50 cartons -- 10,000 cigarettes -- but these stores' owners reject any suggestion of bootlegging.
"We get a lot of Manhattanites stopping by on their way out to the Hamptons with a list of orders from friends and co-workers," said Harry Wallace, chief of the Unkechaug Nation and owner of the Poospatuck Smoke Shop and Trading Company, the first shop to open on the reservation, in 1991. "They say, 'This carton is for Jane, this carton is for Sharon,' etc. But it's perfectly legal to buy cigarettes for your friends."
There is no law that the cigarettes must be for the buyer's own use; what is illegal is reselling cigarettes bought here for more money and pocketing the difference. Chief Wallace said he assumed those buying for Jane and Sharon made no profit. 
But while Chief Wallace said he knew of no bootleggers or smugglers, the phenomenon is not unknown. A spokesman for the New York division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Joseph Green, said that he could not comment on open investigations but that such matters are closely monitored. Mr. Green pointed out that the number of tobacco-related investigations conducted by the bureau increased to 71 in the country in 2001 from 6 in 1998. 
One of the largest smuggling cases involved the St. Regis Mohawk Nation in Hogansburg, N.Y. In the late 1990's, 16 of the tribe's members pleaded guilty to conspiring to smuggle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of cigarettes and alcohol into Canada through a reservation. A unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges in the case and agreed to pay $15 million in penalties. 
Governments say they are raising cigarette taxes not just to increase revenue, but also to discourage smoking. Tobacco companies argue that higher taxes encourage smuggling. 
On a June day, customers streamed into Chief Wallace's shop, a small pine-paneled store with walls of cigarettes and cases displaying Indian-made jewelry and moccasins. Cars filled the small parking area and newcomers had to park by the bushes or down the road. Yet exactly how thriving these businesses are is unclear, because the shop owners -- who seem to feel vilified by just about everyone except their loyal customers -- are unwilling to say.
When asked how many cartons of cigarettes he sells per month, Chief Wallace, a stocky man wearing two braids, denim shorts and flip-flops, responded, "It's none of your business."
A visit to the other smoke shops on the Unkechaug reservation yielded similar results.
So one could explore the economics this way: A reporter watched seven cartons of cigarettes being sold inside Chief Wallace's shop in five minutes one day in June. Erring on the side of caution, then, one could assume 50 cartons are sold an hour. The shop is open 13.5 hours a day every day, which translates to 675 cartons a day, 4,725 cartons per week, or 18,900 per month. (And that does not include phone and Internet orders.) At an average price of $27.50 per carton, Chief Wallace would take in about $520,000.
His profit would be that sum, minus his overhead and what he paid for the cigarettes. Those two costs are another mystery, as Chief Wallace, as well as the cigarette manufacturers and distributors, would not say what he pays for them.
Looked at another way, at $15 in tax per carton, assuming those hypothetical calculations are not too far off, the state is losing about $283,500 a month in revenue from Chief Wallace's shop alone (again, not counting Internet and phone orders). Chief Wallace said there were 85 Indian-owned tobacco outlets in the state at his last count, in 1998. So the hypothetical statewide total: a $24-million-a-month loss to the government. And New York City is also losing $1.50 in tax per pack. 
Still, the state seems to have no intention of changing course. And Chief Wallace and his fellow shop owners feel that their right to sell tax-free cigarettes (and gasoline) is nothing short of the lawful exercise of their sovereignty. 
"Before we had tobacco shops, we had a welfare economy -- and the state was paying for that," Chief Wallace said as he lighted a Marlboro Red. "We couldn't focus on our political, social and educational rights because we were focused on day-to-day survival. Now we're not. Now we are empowered."
Anyway, said the shop owners, they are doing the community a favor.
"We sell to a lot of fixed-income people; you know, senior citizens and veterans on Social Security," said Mike General, manager of JR's Smokeshop II in the Seneca Nation. "They're looking to save money wherever they can, and you can't beat our prices." 
As to the morality of making carcinogens available at low cost to the masses, whether they are people on fixed incomes or travelers en route to the Hamptons, Chief Wallace shrugged and lighted another cigarette. "If they're so bad, make them illegal," he said. "In the meantime, leave me alone."

HEADLINE: Metro Matters; 
In Search Of Power Lost By the People

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE FOURTH OF JULY is behind us. The State Legislature has been in session since early January. And New Yorkers still do not know whether lawmakers will revise the oft-criticized Rockefeller drug laws, raise the minimum wage, approve a gay rights measure, extend unemployment insurance, require clergy members to report allegations of child abuse. The public does not know whether the Legislature will get to any of a long list of bills that have been pending for months, even years.
 Worse, even most lawmakers are clueless about their own agenda. As always, the mystery muddle prevails, to be decoded only by the reigning Albany triumvirate of the governor and two legislative leaders. 
 The system is entrenched, the roles and attitudes well rehearsed. The leaders defend it as efficient and effective; most legislators go along to ensure their survival; and occasionally one or two object, as State Senator Liz Krueger of the East Side of Manhattan did in a recent fund-raising letter and subsequent interview in this space. What happened to representative democracy, she asked, complaining about Albany's strong top-down control.
Are there alternatives? Metro Matters promised to examine the question, and the short answer is yes, though their chances of success raise another question altogether.
Ms. Krueger recommends rules changes, to open up the legislative process, and campaign finance reform, so lawmakers would be less dependent on the favor of their leaders and on lobbyists and special interests that perpetuate the system by overwhelmingly favoring incumbents. There are now no realistic campaign contribution limits in state legislative races, helping to perpetuate the status quo. It is not by accident that the re-election rate is more than 98 percent.
But only the Legislature, led by people who prefer things as they are, is empowered to make the changes. "Ah, there's the rub," Senator Krueger said.
Moving on to term limits, which would guarantee turnover. Most supporters recommend staggered terms, to maintain some continuity, and allowing no lawmaker to serve more than 12 years.
Critics of limits say they would further empower staff members, whom nobody elected, and would undercut the fundamental rights of voters to choose their own representatives. But since most incumbents are re-elected, challengers do not have much chance anyway; most contributions go to incumbents, remember. Circular, the politics of Albany.
Senator Daniel R. Hevesi, a Queens Democrat leaving after two terms, said he changed his mind and now supports term limits. But only a constitutional amendment could impose them, and an amendment requires the approval of two independently elected legislatures, or a constitutional convention. The State Constitution requires the public to consider whether to hold a convention to change it once every 20 years. The public last said no in 1997.
ARE legislators about to limit their own terms? City Council members, forced into term limits in two city referendums, are still fighting to tinker with the law. "I don't think it could happen unless the media created an outcry," said Mr. Hevesi, who, because of redistricting, would face a primary challenge this year, but said he is leaving because of frustration with a "broken" system. "If I could draw any Senate district I could," he said, "I still wouldn't be running again."
Jerry H. Goldfeder, an election lawyer, favors adopting a system of initiative and referendum to bypass the Legislature and bring direct democracy to New York. But critics say that that system, which exists in 24 states, inevitably becomes the captive of those that fervently support an objective, like outlawing abortion.
Initiative and referendum is antidemocratic, critics say. Eric Lane, former counsel to the State Senate's minority leader and a professor at Hofstra Law School, called it less democratic than the current system, of which he is harshly critical. Experience in other states has shown, he maintains, that the wealthiest and the best organized control the process, not "the people."
Mr. Goldfeder says there are ways to insulate a system of initiative and referendum from abuse. Others disagree. "It's entirely dependent on how much people are going to spend on TV," said Mr. Lane, who supports legislative rules changes that would reduce the power of Albany's leaders and guarantee more committee hearings. Andrew S. Eristoff, the former Republican Party chairman in Manhattan who is challenging Ms. Krueger's re-election, favors rules changes, too, including requiring any bill approved by a committee to be taken up by the full Senate, and creating a nonpartisan legislative staff.
But once again, only the Legislature can change its own rules. And the leaders -- Sheldon Silver, the Democratic assemblyman, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican senator -- have made no secret of their fondness for concentrated power.
And those two leaders control how and on what most members vote.
As noted above, Albany is circular. One often ends where one began.

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumers Keep the Faith, Despite Woes 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Scandals continue to crash through executive suites. The threat of terrorism hangs in the air. Stock markets have tumbled. And through it all, the economy has pushed forward.
 A constant trickle of relatively positive economic news has taken a number of analysts by surprise. Consumers have spent at a respectable rate, partly because low interest rates and robust home prices have made many homeowners, at least, feel confident about their own financial cushions. The manufacturing sector has finally begun to bounce back, and could gain more momentum from the slipping value of the dollar, which could make American exports more competitive. 
 And despite a rise in unemployment and anemic job creation in recent months, the evidence suggests that the economy, after its sharp rise early in the year, is still on track to show moderate growth of roughly 3 percent for the spring and summer quarters. 
To many economists, the recovery's stamina depends on whether the falls from grace in corporate America continue long enough to dent consumers' resilience.
"If we knew that this was all over, and that there weren't any more Enrons or WorldComs out there, I wouldn't be worried," said Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who is a professor of economics at Princeton University. "The worry is that these problems deepen and last a very long time, and that really does wear away at consumer confidence, and business confidence as well."
So far, however, consumers have behaved as though little has happened. Retail sales at chain stores rose almost every week in June, according to surveys by Instinet Research and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/UBS Warburg. And interviews with shoppers this past weekend suggest that corporate skulduggery doesn't enter into their thinking on whether to buy that new car or splurge on a new sofa.
"I think people are spending more than before," said Carrie Sterrett, 24, poking through red and white sale signs at the Crate and Barrel store on Madison Avenue at 59th Street. Ms. Sterrett, who said she had recently moved to New York to become an investment banker after having graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, expressed no concern about the possible economic impact from the travails at Enron, WorldCom, ImClone Systems and the rest. "I am very optimistic about the future," she said. "The companies that are involved in scandals are just a few bad apples."
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest company, reports that its customers have been looking for bargains but have turned out in numbers.
"People are living their lives normally, but they're still shopping for that best price," said Thomas E. Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman. "Increased traffic accounts for a large amount of our sales gains."
At the Ikea furniture retailer in Elizabeth, N.J., there was no sign of hesitant spenders. Shoppers lined up outside the doors before the opening on the Fourth of July and crowded the aisles through the weekend.
Some, however, did express concern about the extent of the nation's economic recovery. Robert Bucci, 40, a technology consultant from Staten Island who said he had sold shares in once highly valued companies like Yahoo, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer in the late 1990's before technology stocks crashed, speculated that many consumers are simply spending more than they can afford.
"I was lucky enough to get out at the right time, but now a lot of people are maxed out on their credit cards and just have not figured out they should stop spending," said Mr. Bucci, who was shopping with his wife and three sons. "Enron may have been making up profits, but most Americans are pretending that they are not spending on credit."
Consumers' continuing appetite has puzzled economists who witnessed the positive power of the wealth effect -- the link between the value of stock market gains and consumer spending -- during Wall Street's boom in the late 1990's.
"The link may not be as strong as we thought," said Professor Blinder, the former Fed governor. "On the downswing, there seems to have been much less impact."
There was little concern about a downswing among shoppers at Lenox Square, an upscale mall in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood. Emma Alvarez, 53, shopping with her daughter Rebeca, 17, for dress shirts, said the economy had no influence on her buying habits. "When I need something, I go shopping," she said. And if the economy goes down, she said, laughing, "prices will go down and I will have to shop more."
Some consumers may be increasing their spending precisely because the stock market has performed so poorly. Gus Hageman, 55, a switchman for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway in Minneapolis, said he got tired of watching his self-picked stocks decline this past year. So he recently pulled enough money out of the market to buy an $18,000 Honda Gold Wing luxury touring motorcycle. "I just thought maybe I want to spend this money while I've still got it," Mr. Hageman said.
Of course, consumer spending could slow in coming months. Bill Martin, the chief economist at UBS Global Asset Management, said, "Part of the reason why we haven't seen a larger effect on consumer spending is that the effects of the depression in the stock market have yet fully to come through." He said that consumers, finally noting the stunning decline in their portfolio values or fearing more corporate scandals, might cut their spending and increase their savings instead. That could cause a drop in demand for goods and services that would slow economic growth.
Mr. Martin says Washington eased, or at least delayed, the blow. Last year's interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve mixed with the president's tax cuts and post-Sept. 11 spending to produce a potent economic cocktail. "Low interest rates are a major help in reducing the burden of debt repayments," he said. "There's been a very, very substantial fiscal injection into the economy, and this has helped greatly."
Low interest rates have also bolstered the housing market. The average rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage has dropped for three straight months, and is hovering around 6.5 percent. "It's allowing people who have experienced that income increase in the last three or four years to buy more homes," said John Schleimer, president of Market Perspectives, a real estate analysis and consulting company based in Roseville, Calif. "They're buying more square footage or they're buying better locations."
Indeed, with house prices having risen steadily in many areas even as the stock market has fallen, more people have been motivated to buy either a new home or even a vacation property, Mr. Schleimer said.
"People have come to the realization in the last 12 months that they can make more money by investing in a new home than by investing in the stock market or mutual funds."
Another source of strength in the economy has been the manufacturing sector, which is slowly recovering from a sharp decline that lasted more than a year. Professor Blinder credits the turnaround to rapid, drastic action by companies.
"They trimmed their payrolls. They trimmed their inventories," he said. "They got clobbered, but they reacted quickly."
The staying power of the automobile industry, which lured customers with zero-percent financing last fall, has particularly impressed economists. "The first thought was that they borrowed all these October and November sales from December, January and February," Professor Blinder said. "That turned out not to be true." General Motors and BMW, for instance, reported better sales last month than in June 2001. Toyota Motor had its best first half ever in the United States. And just as sales slowed a bit in recent weeks, Detroit's Big Three all reacted quickly with another round of discount financing promotions.
Manufacturers outside the automobile industry also stand to benefit from the declining value of the dollar against foreign currencies, which tends to make imports more expensive and gives American goods an extra advantage in selling overseas.
A depreciating dollar could eventually raise the risk of inflation in the United States, said Kevin L. Kliesen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But for now, he expects low energy prices and gains in worker productivity to keep inflation to a minimum.
And consumers may possess more buying power yet to be released. According to Mr. Williams of Wal-Mart, purchases have been most prolific in fabrics, crafts, electronics and food -- all items that can be used in the home. If the bunker mentality from Sept. 11 continues to subside, Americans may start spending on other types of goods and services, too.
But Mr. Martin thinks middle- and upper-class shareholders still have not fully responded to the collapse of the stock market bubble. He expects them to be more cautious about spending as they sell shares and absorb real losses in their portfolios.
Professor Blinder is more sanguine about the hangover from last year's downturn. He sees a greater danger from the gradual erosion of confidence in corporate governance.
"One of the traditional strengths of the American capital markets, and especially equity markets, was that they're relatively clean and investors are well-informed," he said. "Those premises have taken a beating recently. I worry more about the future than the lagged effects of the past."

HEADLINE: Commercial Realty Market's Cool, but Market for Top Brokers Is Hot 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A star player in the highly lucrative world of Manhattan real estate has jumped to a new firm and other brokers are moving or planning to move, signaling the latest outbreak in the battle for talent as the market cools.
 CB Richard Ellis, a real estate firm based in Los Angeles, plans to announce today that it has hired Mary Ann Tighe, a star in the field, and given her a $100 million budget to turn the company from an also-ran in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region into a powerhouse. Ms. Tighe, whose clients have included Conde Nast, Aon, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield and The New York Times, resigned last week as vice chairwoman of Insignia/ESG, one of the largest real estate companies in New York. 
 Ms. Tighe is not the only broker looking for better opportunities as firms try to grab more business, with commissions that can total millions of dollars on a single leasing deal when the economy revives. 
When the market was hot in the late 1990's, most brokers were making money hand over fist, and to some extent they did not care where they worked. But with a slowdown in business caused by the recession and uncertainties related to the attack on the World Trade Center, brokers and companies alike are regrouping.
One longtime real estate executive described the situation this way: "This is a good time to offer brokers a piece of the action, because there is no action. It's really just a title. No one's making money."
The turmoil is evident at commercial real estate brokers large and small, from Insignia and Cushman & Wakefield to Newmark & Company, Jones Lang LaSalle and Grubb & Ellis.
"It had been pretty quiet for a while, but it appears that there's now intense competition for New York talent," said Jonathan L. Mechanic, the chief real estate partner at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, a law firm. "In order to be a national player, you have to be a player in New York."
CB Richard Ellis has had relatively modest activity in New York compared with Insignia and Cushman & Wakefield, both of which were born in New York. Based in Los Angeles, CB Richard Ellis had $1.1 billion in revenues last year, but New York, the largest real estate market in the world, accounted for less than 6 percent of its business. The company had sought to buy Insignia, but after several pending deals foundered, Ellis decided to put more than $100 million into expanding its own operation in the New York area.
Ms. Tighe, who spent her entire 18-year real estate career at Insignia, was the company's top broker in the metropolitan area last year, with deals for five million square feet of office space. She is a five-time winner of the Deal of the Year Award from the Real Estate Board of New York. Now she will be a partner at CB Richard Ellis.
Last week, CB Richard Ellis also lured away another star broker, Patrick Murphy, from Insignia, where he had turned the New Jersey office into a success story. 
And according to real estate executives, Ms. Tighe plans to announce that she has hired Cherrie L. Nanninga, who directs real estate operations at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and engineered the lease of the World Trade Center in a $3.2 billion deal last year, to be chief operating officer for the regional office of CB Richard Ellis. 
"Losing Mary Ann Tighe and Pat Murphy is a tremendous loss," said Ross F. Moskowitz, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a law firm with a big real estate practice. "Both are major players in the metropolitan New York area and will have an immediate impact on CB Richard Ellis's bottom line."
In recent months, there has been a dizzying game of musical chairs in commercial real estate as brokers change offices and companies try to expand.
Mark E. Weiss, a top broker at Julien J. Studley in New York, jumped to Newmark. Newmark also brought in an Atlanta broker, Neal Golden, to head its national expansion and he promptly hired virtually the entire Atlanta office of Studley and nearly a dozen brokers from CB Richard Ellis in northern California. 
Studley is going through a transition, as its president, Mitchell E. Steir, and several other brokers try to work out a deal to buy the company from its namesake founder.
Glenn Markman, a top broker at Grubb & Ellis, defected to Cushman & Wakefield. But according to real estate executives, Stephen B. Siegel, the president of Insignia, is trying to lure away two old friends long associated with Cushman & Wakefield.
Warren M. Heller, a top sales broker, made the leap to Insignia earlier this year, from Jones Lang LaSalle, a large real estate company based in Chicago that has been trying to find a high-profile executive to head its New York office.

HEADLINE: Lingering Feud With Chile Threatens Bolivia's Pipeline Plan 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, July 7 

 BODY:
Nearly all the pieces are in place for this Andean country, long cursed by poverty, to tap into the huge reserves of newly discovered natural gas. There is a market, energy-hungry California, and there are foreign investors prepared to spend up to $6 billion to drill and export.
 But one obstacle remains: Bolivia is landlocked, with no coast from which to ship. 
 Analysts say the practical solution is to build a 400-mile pipeline to a port in neighboring Chile, possibly Mejillones or Patillos, but the project is bogged down by a century-old grudge. People here have not forgotten that Chile snatched Bolivia's coast in 1879, and they resist building a pipeline that would let an old enemy buy cheap gas and attract foreign investment. 
The preference of many Bolivians is to build to Peru's coast and the port of Ilo, though that would be more expensive and complicated.
"Chile just wants the good business with Bolivia, forgetting about this problem that is still hanging," said Jorge Torres, a leader in the Revolutionary Left Movement, a nationalistic party that opposes the Chile option. "Ninety percent of Bolivians will say, 'Go with Peru.' The people's sentiments are clear. This is about dignity." 
Bitter memories and political considerations, people familiar with the pipeline plan say, have delayed a government decision on whether to build through Chile or Peru. Both of those nations are eager to offer incentives like tax breaks to obtain the pipeline.
To the investors that would bankroll the project -- a consortium called Pacific LNG, made up of three transnational companies -- Chile is the logical choice. Peru's coast is 150 miles farther from the gas fields in Bolivia's Tarija Province, and Peru's instability and poor credit rating also make it less attractive than Chile. Indeed, building through to Peru could cost $600 million more. 
"If the Bolivian government would give us $600 million, we would be happy to consider Peru," said Edward Miller, president and general manager of British Gas Bolivia, a subsidiary of one of the three companies involved in the project that will be paying for the pipeline. "All the risk right now falls to the private sector, and for our money, Peru is not the option." 
Bolivian government officials and others familiar with the plan said the only option acceptable to the companies would be Chile, since Bolivia cannot afford to pay the difference. "The decision has to be Chile, or there is no project," one government official involved in the talks said.
But in Bolivia, the past is hard to leave behind. Though Bolivia lost much of its territory to rapacious neighbors from 1879 to 1935, it is the loss of the seaside province of Litoral that is most ingrained in the Bolivian psyche.
Schoolchildren are taught that their country has a right to the coast, and maps in the offices of politicians often show pre-1879 Bolivia. With a recent growing public debate on the issue, it is not unusual to see placards on buses or graffiti on buildings condemning any gas pipeline involving Chile. The animus is compounded by the fact that Chile is one of Latin America's most prosperous countries while Bolivia remains remote and poor. 
"Chile has always been an expansionist country," said Lucio Aranibar, an economics student at a university in La Paz. "In school, we have always learned that the seacoast belongs to us, and the Chileans took it away."
Such thoughts have weighed on Bolivians ever since Chilean troops, backed by the British, invaded the arid Litoral. Bolivia failed to recover the territory in a counterattack, though Bolivian soldiers fought "like lions," as one school text explains. The spoils of war came to Chile in guano, mounds of dried bird dung that had great value at the time as fertilizer and saltpeter in Europe.
Ever since, Bolivia's foreign policy priority has been to recover some form of a Pacific outlet, even if only a sliver. Bolivia has used international bodies like the United Nations and the Organization of American States to press its case. But nothing has worked, and Bolivia and Chile do not have full diplomatic relations.
The government's decision could come at any moment. The administration of President Jorge Quiroga has been a strong proponent of developing the gas fields, but people familiar with the talks say it has hesitated because of political considerations. 
Choosing Chile, officials know, could lead to a public outcry. The campaign leading to last Sunday's presidential elections were marked by heightened nationalism among several candidates, some of whom strongly opposed free-market reforms and unfettered foreign investment in the energy industry.
Building a pipeline through Chile, warned Evo Morales, a left-leaning indigenous leader who did well in his run for president, would lead to Mr. Quiroga's political downfall, though he is already a lame duck. "The Bolivians would never forgive that," Mr. Morales recently warned.
But analysts and government officials acknowledge that if a decision is not made soon, the project could be dashed, resulting in a lost opportunity for a country with few economic options.
"This will determine if Bolivia moves on," said a Western diplomat here. "But because of the history of this country, I'm not sure it's going to happen."
The plan calls for Pacific LNG -- consisting of Repsol-YPF, a Spanish company; British Gas; and Pan American Energy, a BP subsidiary -- to build a pipeline to the coast and a $2 billion plant, to liquefy the natural gas, so that it could be pumped aboard specially outfitted tankers. A memorandum has been signed with Sempra Energy, a California-based company that would receive the gas for 20 years. Sempra would build a regasification plant in northern Mexico and sell it to both Mexico and California.
The deal could provide Bolivia with $1 billion in exports, with perhaps as much as $600 million of that coming to the government in taxes and royalties -- a hefty sum in an economy of only $8 billion. Proponents foresee increased oil production, since Bolivian gas has some oil content, and a sprawling network of pipelines from Tarija to Bolivia's neighbors.
"The sky is the limit," Mr. Quiroga, who steps down in August when a new president takes over, said in an interview. "You're talking about a totally different country."
The project, though, faces competitors. Venezuela, Russia, Indonesia and Australia, all sitting on large gas deposits, are also positioning themselves for the California market. 
Sempra's agreement gives Pacific LNG until July 31 to firm up a deal. If the deadline comes and goes, Sempra could find another supplier, Carlos Kempff, Bolivia's minister of economic development, said.
Bolivia would be left without the sizable market it needs. Bolivia has gas reserves of 52 trillion cubic feet, the second-largest in South America after Venezuela. While this country already supplies gas to Brazil through an 1,100-mile pipeline, the Brazilians will consume only a fraction of the reserves Bolivia possesses. That leaves most to be sold.
"The reality is that while the California market is big, there is not enough room for two," Mr. Kempff said.
Many of those opposing the Chile option say they would be swayed only if Bolivia were given sovereignty over a portion of coastline, an unrealistic proposition.
Mr. Miller of the consortium is disheartened by such talk. "Hating the Chileans for a territorial dispute that happened in 1879 is not a good reason for not providing a clear and bright future for your children," he said.

Is the Slumber Over? Signs of Life Despite a Sluggish First Half

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
For those in the media world, the first half of 2002 was a time of dashed expectations. The turnaround that executives prayed for failed to show up. Instead, advertising spending remained depressed, stock prices continued to fall and the philosophy of digital synergy that drove a merger mania lost whatever luster it still had. 
 But even as Vivendi Universal sputters and AOL Time Warner is battered by the market, the second half is displaying some signs of life. Advertising, particularly in broadcast television, is on the rebound. Radio appears to have broken its fall. And the merger and acquisition market is rousing from a deep sleep. 
 There are plenty of fascinating subplots to watch for in the second half, and their resolution will go a long way toward determining how healthy any rebound is.

Advertising
A Recovery Is Expected, but How Big?
If the prognosticators are to be believed, the second half of 2002 will bring Madison Avenue something it fervently, but fruitlessly, wished for in the first half: a recovery in advertising spending.
Ad spending in the first half declined 0.4 percent from the first half of 2001, according to estimates by CMR, the division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks the industry. David Peeler, chief executive of CMR, recently revised upward his forecast for the full year, however, calling for an increase of 2.5 percent from 2001 compared with an earlier prediction of a rise of 1.5 percent.
"Cautious optimism" prevails for the rest of 2002, said Christopher Dixon, global strategist for media at UBS Warburg, based on "what looks to be a steadily improving overall economy." Others also increased their estimates for 2002 ad spending, but no one expects a sharp enough recovery to return spending to the record levels of 2000.
A clearer picture may come on Wednesday, when Robert J. Coen, the Universal McCann media executive widely deemed the dean of forecasters, offers his predictions.
Another concern for the second half will be on the creative side of the business: finding the right tone and attitude for campaigns appearing around the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks. 
"Advertisers run the danger of seeming exploitive and opportunistic," said Donny Deutsch, chief executive at Deutsch in New York, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. He said a very good precedent was offered by CBS, part of Viacom, which in March presented a Sept. 11 documentary without commercials; during breaks, Nextel Communications sponsored public service announcements.

An effort to untanglethe government's haphazard approach to the acquisition of computer systems.

BYLINE:  By Rebecca Fairley Raney 

 BODY:
IF you wanted to find out how much money the federal government was spending to clean up toxic waste, you might run into difficulty. The question is simple enough, but the answer could take months to find.
 For one thing, half a dozen agencies handle toxic cleanup. But the greatest problem is that those agencies' computers cannot communicate with one another. Their reports cannot be scanned in a single search. 
 The problem is magnified by decades of uncoordinated computer purchases by the government. Federal agencies have historically bought computers and software on their own, producing a rat's nest of technology, from mainframes to I.B.M. clones to Wang computers.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Senate passed a bill recently that would require federal agencies to learn to speak the same language. The E-Government Act, introduced by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, would require the federal government to make information easy for citizens to use.
"It's really a way of busting bureaucracy, which makes it very appealing," said Patricia McGinnis, president and chief executive of the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonprofit group in Washington. "Basically, we don't have a seamless system of data collection, analysis and use." 
The bill would allocate $345 million over four years to establish a fund to help federal agencies work together on projects to improve their online services. It would also establish an Office of Electronic Government, which would be part of the Office of Management and Budget, and its top administrator would be appointed by the president.
Among other things, the bill would require federal agencies to set standards for the use of electronic signatures, to seek public comment on what information to post on the Internet and to assess how to protect citizens' personal information from abuse.
The bill stretches the definition of e-government. Typically, the term has referred to the practice of government agencies' placing information and services within easy reach of the public on the Internet. The E-Government Act would expand that definition to include how well agencies use technology to improve the efficiency of government.
Kevin Landy, counsel on Senator Lieberman's staff, says that federal agencies spend more than $1 billion a year on such e-government efforts and that the new office would help them spend that money more efficiently.
Though the problem of diverse computer systems may never be solved completely, government technologists see a partial solution in extensible markup language, known as XML, a method of coding information so that it can be transmitted on the Internet and read by different computer systems. In theory, if agencies could translate their data into the same language, they could read one another's documents.
"XML is a theoretical answer," said John de Ferrari, assistant director of the information technology team at the General Accounting Office. "It serves as an overlay that should allow you to get really precise searches."
As the accounting office pointed out in a report in April, however, XML presents inherent problems as well. The language sets standards for tagging information but does not dictate which commands should be used. For example, agencies could choose to tag purchase orders in several ways: <PO-Number>, <PurchaseOrderNumber>, <PO-No> or <purchase-order-number>.
As the agencies independently create tags for their documents, they could make a bigger data mess.
"We could end up creating a Tower of Babel," Mr. de Ferrari said.
Though individual agencies are already working to develop standards for XML codes, the E-Government Act would require that agencies centrally coordinate the development of standards for XML.
But the very idea of developing standards creates its own issues. In the past, the government's haphazard approach to computer purchasing may have benefited a number of technology companies, but now that agencies have started establishing standards to allow their systems to communicate, the companies are worried that government programmers might create proprietary software instead of using commercial products.
Jeanne Foust, director of governmental affairs for ESRI, a company in Redlands, Calif., that makes computer mapping software, said it was pleased that the E-Government Act was giving this area of computing a higher status in Washington. But she said the company would like some clarification in the bill on whether federal agencies would use commercial software to share information among systems or create their own.
"The best way to go down that path is to let the commercial marketplace develop those tools," Ms. Foust said. "We don't need the federal government to develop interoperability." 
David LeDuc, director of public policy for the Software and Information Industry Association in Washington, added that although new standards can present opportunities for software companies, they can also inadvertently limit the advancement of technology. "Standards can inhibit growth in the industry," he said. "The standards the government sets are big enough to affect the industry."
Mr. de Ferrari of the General Accounting Office said that adhering to XML, a nonproprietary technology, would open the market to many software vendors.
"That's the beauty of XML," he said. "It is an open standard. It's really just saying, 'We want software that has these capabilities.' It's not locking into any particular product."
The plan to create common codes among federal agencies is a cost-cutting move, he said.
"A concern that was raised when we did our study was, if the government didn't get its act together, we would be playing up to the middleware vendors when all these systems can't talk to each other," he said. "In terms of translation, that could become very expensive."
Of course, the process of translation could take years.
Information officers at the Defense Department, Mr. de Ferrari said, are now sorting out how to handle a single piece of information: the format for names. The format is not consistent even within the department, and information officers are deliberating over whether to spell names out, use a middle initial or just list the first and last names. The process is tedious, he said.
In the end, federal information officers hope to create a system that will allow feats that sound simple but are now impractical. The Office of Management and Budget wants, for example, to extract data from all federal agencies to compare their budgets.
Such a system could leave agencies feeling exposed, of course.
"In general," Mr. de Ferrari said, "the idea of sharing your data is threatening."

A campaign using Chrysler's German ties to help its image of quality may backfire, analysts say.

BYLINE:  By Danny Hakim 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
FOUR years after DaimlerBenz acquired Chrysler, the combined company plans for the first time to reckon with the merger in its American advertisements. 
 But Chrysler's embrace of its German parentage might be problematic at a time of increased patriotic fervor. 
 Current Chrysler ads, by BBDO, a division of the Omnicom Group, offer no hint for the average car buyer that Chrysler is anything but the American-owned icon it was until 1998. Ads for Chrysler's Dodge brand, which feature burly Ram pickups and the hard rock band Aerosmith, could hardly be more American in flavor. Even the name of the recent Jeep sport utility vehicle, the Liberty, embraces patriotism. 
But new Chrysler ads, part of a BBDO campaign the company is expected to announce today, will embrace Chrysler's German connection, though pointedly not the Mercedes brand name. The campaign will present the company as one that combines German engineering know-how and American creativity, according to company executives. It will start Tuesday on radio and continue with print ads starting July 12 and television spots starting July 15. 
Settling on the new approach, especially after General Motors played up a "Buy American" theme after Sept. 11, was not an easy decision. In May, while the campaign was on the drawing board, Dieter Zetsche, the president and chief executive of the Chrysler Group, said it was "one of the few things where I still don't have a firm opinion. Usually, when I'm confronted with any question, immediately, you know what you want."
Mr. Zetsche's uncertainty stems from a marketing dilemma. Chrysler vehicles will be increasingly German influenced -- for example, the forthcoming Chrysler Crossfire, an eye-catching sports car due next year, shares 40 percent of its parts with DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes division -- and given Mercedes' stronger reputation for quality, Chrysler officials would love to play up the changes. 
But the company risks alienating buyers who might want to buy American and did not realize Chrysler was part of a German corporation.
"You're risking losing something, because of course not everything was bad when Chrysler was Chrysler in the past," said Mr. Zetsche. "It was a very successful company with great products and many good things, all American, of course."
Some advertising executives think the risk could be considerable. 
"I don't think the ownership of Dodge by a German company is a plus for the Dodge brand," said Clive Chajet, a corporate identity consultant and chairman of Chajet Consultancy in New York.
"It allows the competition a competitive advantage -- 'Buy America' -- especially at this point in time, when there is a particular patriotic feeling in this country." 
"For a popularly priced car, it's not a plus," he added, referring to connections with foreign companies. "For B.M.W., Mercedes, yes. Saab or Lexus, okay, but those are premium brands with specific positioning in the marketplace."
Chrysler officials believe the strategy will be worth the risk because it addresses the company's fundamental problem, the public perception of mediocre quality. 
Since taking over at the end of 2000 from Chrysler's holdover American executives, Mr. Zetsche has been on a vigorous cost cutting and quality improvement push that have shown some initial signs of success. DaimlerChrysler's initial quality ranking improved from fifth to fourth last year, according to J.D. Power & Associates, though that combines Mercedes with the Chrysler Group, which includes the Chrysler brand, Jeep and Dodge. Mr. Zetsche says Chrysler will be among the best brands in quality rankings within five years. 
But even if the company is able to achieve his goals, it can take far longer for the car customer's perception to catch up.
"The gap is increasing between the two," Mr. Zetsche said, referring to the difference between actual quality improvements and customer approval. "That's what we're trying to do, attack this gap." 
"Everyone is saying they are focused on quality and improving quality," Mr. Zetsche said. "We think we can put much more teeth on the claim by saying the Chrysler of today is not the same as the Chrysler Group of 10 years ago."
"We now have access to the same technology and components of the total group," he added. "Talking about that will increase our credibility and show why people could believe us."
The company would not reveal images from its new campaign, but did say that one word will be conspicuously absent -- "Mercedes."
Mercedes is still the crown jewel of the DaimlerChrysler empire, based in Stuttgart, Germany, and company executives do not want to drag their beloved brand down market by linking it too closely with the company that invented the minivan. 
"We enjoy the success Mercedes is having and we would be the dumbest guy in the world if we did anything to that," said Mr. Zetsche.
David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, said "the parent company wants to preserve the uniqueness of the Mercedes brand, and what Chrysler does in terms of using German technology needs to be done very carefully."
Shih-Fen Chen, a professor at Brandeis University's graduate school of international economics and finance and a former marketer for the Ford Motor Company, said "if you set up a joint venture with someone who has better quality, usually that is one of the purposes. People call it reputation borrowing."
"It's just like marriage," he added. "All the daughters of the Kennedys who get married, their sons keep their middle names. You want to let people know you have this association."
The risk, he said, is luxury car buyers are watching the same advertisements and start thinking that Mercedes is sharing parts with Chrysler. 
"People don't want to know that," he said.

HEADLINE: For Cendant's Travel Business, Ride Is Bumpier Than Expected 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
A year ago, travel reservations seemed like a lucrative new opportunity for the Cendant Corporation, the travel and real estate conglomerate. Last June, it agreed to buy Galileo, the second-largest reservations booking engine for travel agents (after the Sabre Group), for $2.9 billion. Then in August it bought Cheap Tickets Inc., a marketer of deeply discounted fares, for $425 million to combine the Cheap Tickets Web site with Galileo's Trip.com, part of a two-year-old effort to build a "travel portal" within Cendant.
 Henry R. Silverman, Cendant's 61-year-old chief executive, hoped to repeat with travel reservations what he had achieved with middle-tier hotel chains (like Ramada and Days Inn) and real estate (like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker). In both cases he acquired a series of related companies, cut costs and found unusual ways to squeeze extra profits out of them. He is doing the same with car rentals with Avis and is now negotiating to buy Budget. 
 Travel reservations offered an opportunity to regain the glory of his former company, HFS Inc., before it merged in 1997 with CUC International and spent three years and nearly $3 billion dealing with the consequences of accounting fraud at CUC. Last year, Mr. Silverman wrote shareholders that the company was poised to be "like the old HFS, only better" -- an inspiring claim, given that HFS stock had soared 22-fold from its 1990 public offering until the CUC troubles. 
So far, however, it has been much harder for Mr. Silverman to recreate the old HFS magic than he expected.
Mr. Silverman's logic is that spending on air travel will continue to grow vigorously, but buying an airline is not a good investment. (He does not like owning a lot of physical assets and the risks they entail.) What is more, with the Internet now handling 10 percent of travel reservations in the United States, Mr. Silverman is betting that the share will probably grow to 50 percent or more, so owning an online travel agency is important -- even one far smaller than the leaders like Expedia.
Sept. 11, of course, knocked the wind out of the airlines, already suffering from a business travel recession. But that just shook the existing fault lines in the travel industry, where airlines feel they have been paying far too much to distribute their tickets. The airlines eliminated commissions to travel agents and set their sites on sharply cutting the $4 a flight fee they pay to reservations systems like Galileo, which they say use expensive and outdated technology. Especially going to the airlines, about one third of that fee gets kicked back to the travel agent.
There are other problems, too. Galileo's share of airline bookings fell to 26 percent last year from 31 percent in 1998, and the travel agencies that use it said it was arrogant and unresponsive. Analysts say that Cendant has yet to do much more than stanch the losses.
And Trip.com, despite the $66 million spent so far by Cendant, appears not to be going very far. While its traffic is up substantially as a result of a $40 million ad campaign, only one visitor in 200 is actually buying something, a startlingly low rate, according to Media Metrix, a research firm that is a unit of comScore Networks. That compares with one in 22 for Expedia, the leading travel site, which is now owned by USA Interactive, Barry Diller's electronic commerce empire.
Investors, meanwhile, have been made wary of new-age companies, especially ones that are fond of complex, off-balance-sheet financial vehicles, as Cendant is. Trip.com, for example, is actually owned by a trust established to benefit Cendant hotel franchisees. The effect is to remove the unit's losses from Cendant's income statement. People close to the company say these losses will likely be $40 million this year.
No one is suggesting that Cendant is violating accepted accounting rules, but amid recent revelations from Enron, WorldCom and the like, such tactics rub sensitive investors the wrong way.
"Cendant is everything the market doesn't like right now," said Amanda Tepper, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. (Cendant's shares, which regained their post Sept. 11 losses by the end of 2001, have fallen 23 percent this year to close Friday at $15.18.) Ms. Tepper, who likes Cendant's stock, says "the jury is still out" on whether the company can repeat its earlier successes in hotels and real estate with travel distribution.
Mr. Silverman has answers to all these criticisms. As for off-balance-sheet vehicles, he published reams of disclosure and plans to bring many of those vehicles, including Trip.com, back into Cendant.
Trip.com, he says, will help Galileo by remedying one of the biggest causes of its market share loss: a deliberate -- and disastrously wrongheaded -- decision to spurn most travel Web sites in order to show solidarity with travel agents. Its rivals Sabre and Worldspan embraced travel sites; Sabre even owns Travelocity.com.
For the airlines, Mr. Silverman figured that Galileo could justify its fees by transforming itself from a transaction system into one that helped airlines market their tickets better. For example, it would create attractively priced packages of air travel bundled with an Avis car and a room at the Ramada. This philosophy, Mr. Silverman figured, would also endear Galileo to travel agents, who earn far more on packages than on simple airplane tickets.
"The world is awash in unused travel inventory," Mr. Silverman said. "We can give something to the travel agent who can mark it up and still make a profit." Trip.com, in turn, would also differentiate itself through discounts and packages, often involving Cendant brands.
Such special discounts -- which actually have higher profit margins than reservations at published rates -- have been a key driver of success at other travel sites. Expedia has a series of hotel discounts and Orbitz gets access to unpublished "Web fares" from the five airlines that own it, an arrangement that Cendant and others claim is illegal.
So far, there is little evidence that the links between the various Cendant enterprises are having much impact. "They seem to run their various divisions autonomously and independently," said Sandra Hughes, the vice president in charge of the travel agency of the American Automobile Association, one of Galileo's biggest clients. Still, she said, Cendant has improved Galileo's service. "They have lit a fire under the Galileo people," she said. "Things happen a lot faster."
Relations with the airlines have remained problematic. The airlines that own Orbitz seek to link its computers directly with those of the airlines, bypassing the big reservations systems like Galileo.
Airlines and other travel companies are also busily working to experiment with direct links to big corporate customers and travel agencies. Even AAA has created a direct link to Cendant's car rental rival Hertz, bypassing Galileo.
Mr. Silverman says he was worried about these links when he first looked at Galileo, but decided they will never account for more than a small portion of reservations. 
Cendant continues to seek every angle to push business to Galileo. It is converting Cheap Tickets and some other travel agencies it owns from Sabre, the No. 1 reservation system, to Galileo. Moreover, it is pressuring companies it does business with to have their travel agents use Galileo. Not surprisingly, I.B.M., which just signed a $1.4 billion processing deal with Cendant, ordered its travel agent to switch to Galileo.
"People want to do business with people who do business with them," said Sam Katz, the head of Cendant's deal-making arm, who now also runs its travel distribution business.
Even if Mr. Silverman's grand plan to recast Galileo does not pan out, he argues the profitable company will still produce a fine return. Indeed, Cendant has had one lucky break on the acquisition. Because of the terms of Cendant's deal to acquire Galileo, the fall in Cendant's share price after Sept. 11 (which was just before the deal closed) resulted in the cash portion of the price being cut by $212 million to $358 million. And the value of the shares Cendant paid was reduced by $862 million.
Meanwhile, Mr. Silverman has been able to wring out $200 million a year in costs, more than double what he initially promised. Half of the savings came from closing Galileo's unprofitable attempt to create an international telecommunications network. Half flowed from a contract Cendant struck to have I.B.M. run much of the computer operations of all of its units. Cendant also cut 10 percent of Galileo's jobs, including those of its top seven executives. The Cendant veteran put in charge of Galileo, Mark Miller, just quit to be the No. 2 executive of Equifax. A replacement has not been named.
Mr. Silverman said the company would earn $550 million before interest, taxes, deprecation and amortization, a measure of operating cash flow. "That's a 30 percent cash on cash return," on the $1.8 billion adjusted purchase price, he boasts.
Cendant hopes to use Galileo to promote Avis and its hotel properties, though it promises to be fair to competing companies.
But Trip.com, Mr. Silverman said, is a different story. "Trip.com is no more neutral than Orbitz or Expedia," he said, which have a range of deals to promote affiliates of their owners. "Trip will always get the best rental rates from Avis and the best hotel rates from our hotels." Already, Avis has supplanted Alamo as the main car rental agency on Cheap Tickets.
Indeed, Cendant says one of the biggest draws to Trip.com will be its access to time share resorts through its RCI affiliate, the largest trading system for time shares. On Trip.com, travelers can buy a week in a two-bedroom time share for $600 to $1000, less than a comparable hotel. This is nonetheless a deliciously high margin business for Cendant, which gets many of the weeks free from developers looking to lure prospective purchasers to unsold properties.
The business of time shares seems attractive enough that USA Interactive just bought Interval International, the second largest time share exchange company, and will make its inventory available on Expedia.
In the meantime, Cendant boasts of a variety of innovative features it claims make Trip.com easier to use and more in tune with each traveler's preferences than other sites. But analysts are not yet impressed.
"There is an awful lot of sizzle there," said Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst at Forrester Research, "but there is no meat on the platter."

HEADLINE: 9/11 Victims Need $768 Million in Aid Into 2003, Study Says 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Meeting the continuing needs of direct and indirect victims of the World Trade Center attack will cost $768 million over the next year, according to a consultant's study to be released today.
 Addressing job and income loss will make up by far the largest portion of that cost, but mental health treatment is likely to be the most costly need in the long term, according to the survey, which was conducted by McKinsey & Company for the 9/11 United Services Group Inc., a nonprofit consortium of 13 charities founded to help coordinate private assistance to victims of Sept. 11. 
 "It's clear to us that the bulk of the unmet needs will have to be filled with government action," said Robert J. Hurst, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and the 9/11 group's chief executive.
Government programs like the Victim Compensation Fund, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Mortgage and Rental Assistance and the New York State Crime Victims Board have been slow to disburse money, often because of cumbersome application requirements. 
The pace of government aid has pressed charities to step in. The study estimates that $1.5 billion of $2.7 billion in charitable donations has been spent, and much of the remaining money has been committed, including $400 million expected from the Red Cross and other money designated for scholarships.
According to the study, about $700 million will be needed over the next year by some 70,000 workers who have lost jobs and income as a result of the destruction at ground zero. Of those, about 45,000 have seen their incomes drop by more than 25 percent, and some 28,000 are still unemployed, the study says.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an interview on Friday that she planned to propose legislation today or tomorrow to extend for a second time the expiration date of federal unemployment insurance and help many of those affected by Sept. 11. More than 100,000 New Yorkers were scheduled to lose their unemployment benefits last month, after the expiration of a federal program that added 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to the regular six months' worth provided by the state.
Senator Clinton wants Congress to approve another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits and plans to cite the United Services Group's survey. 
"We're trying to get the economy going again, and we know that unemployment insurance is one of the quickest economic stimulants you can have," she said.
She noted that during the recession in the early 1990's, Congress extended unemployment benefits four times.
Half of the 1,139 victims responding to the survey said that without unemployment insurance or some other kind of financial assistance they would not be able to cover basic household needs like rent and insurance, and McKinsey estimated that covering those expenses would cost $562 million.
The survey also assessed the impact of the disaster on families who lost loved ones. Despite the charitable and government assistance they have received, those families' incomes have dropped an average of 40 percent, the survey found, and about 77 percent of them may need mental health counseling.
Families of victims who died but were not in the uniformed services received an average of $90,000 through May, according to the survey. Families of firefighters, police officers and other uniformed services officials who died have received far more, thanks to charity directed specifically to them.
McKinsey estimated that the victims' families would need $40 million over the next year and $320 million over their lifetimes, but it predicted that the remaining charitable donations and the federal Victim Compensation Fund would care for them for the most part.
Though the survey says job-related needs will be fully addressed by the end of 2003, it predicts that $44 million will be needed in 2004 for victims' mental health needs and that those needs will continue after that. The study does not project costs beyond 2004.

Iraqi Kurds Are Reluctant To Join American Forces
The American goal of a "regime change" in Iraq is running into reservations from Iraqi Kurdish leaders who would be crucial allies in any military campaign. While an offensive against Saddam Hussein holds out the possibility of making their freedoms more secure, the leaders said they would be risking all they have gained from a decade of autonomy. A1

Afghan Scene of Carnage
Soldiers who arrived after the recent attack by American and Afghan forces on villages in Afghanistan were horrified to find the bodies of women and children, instead of the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters they expected, survivors said. The ferocity of the attack has angered Afghan officials, though local officials concede that the attack might have been prompted by faulty intelligence from an Afghan. A1

Afghan Official Mourned
As people mourned his death, Afghan officials have said that they are investigating the possibility that Hajji Abdul Qadir, a vice president, was killed by drug lords who had been double-crossed during a campaign backed by the United States and other Western countries to root out the poppy crop in the country. A8

Israeli Occupation's Stalemate
The Israeli Army maintains command of virtually all Palestinian areas of the West Bank and speaks of keeping the troops there for months. There have been no suicide bombings in two and a half weeks, but the Israeli forces are on constant alert and worry about having to assume responsibility for civilian administration. On the Palestinian side, there is private suffering and political confusion. People in cities are kept under curfew while those outside are cut off from work, school, medical services and commerce. A6

Bolivia Quandary on Pipeline
Foreign investors are ready to spend billions to drill and export newly discovered natural gas from Bolivia. However, the country is landlocked. Analysts say the practical solution is to build a pipeline to a port in neighboring Chile, but an old grudge leads to resistance to a plan that would bring Bolivia cheap gas and other benefits. The preference is to build through to Peru's coast, though that would be far more expensive and complicated. A3

Violence During Belfast March
Orange Order officials called for a quiet protest against a ban on their traditional march, which takes them down a Catholic enclave in a Protestant town in Northern Ireland. The parade ended in heated scuffles that injured 27 people, despite predictions that the event would be peaceful for the first time in nearly a decade. A3

Burmese Accused of Plot
Evidence of a coup plot has been presented that leads directly to the family of Myanmar's former military strongman, Gen. Ne Win. His son-in-law and three grandsons are on trial on charges of high treason, and stand accused of plotting to overthrow the military junta that succeeded General Ne Win when he gave up formal leadership in 1988.

Smoke, but Where's the Fire?
About 45 forest fires burning simultaneously in northern Quebec, fanned from winds out of the north, spread a milky haze across New England and New York, meteorologists said. A10

Representative to Step Aside
Representative Carrie P. Meek, the granddaughter of a slave who helped bring national attention to charges that black voters' rights were violated in Florida in the 2000 election, announced that she would not seek a sixth term in Congress. A12

Death Row, and Doubts
Edward Lee Elmore has been on death row in South Carolina for 20 years for the sexual assault and murder of a socially prominent widow. He has always maintained his innocence. But further doubts have been raised by others, including the medical examiner whose autopsy report was critical in his arrest and conviction, and a jailhouse informer who gave a sworn statement recanting earlier testimony that Mr. Elmore had admitted being the killer. A15

Time to Paint the Plants
Gardening in a desert is challenging. Gardening in a desert in a drought is tough. Gardening in a desert in a drought at a time of mandatory water restrictions is ridiculous. It's enough to make a hard-core gardener break out the spray paint and feather dusters. Why? To brighten the artificial turf and plastic flowers, of course, and to keep the cobwebs off the freeze-dried evergreens. A11

In Pursuit of Cheaper Smokes
Call it tax avoidance, and call it completely legal. Many New Yorkers are unwilling to pay the increasing taxes on their cigarettes.

Scandals continue to crash through executive suites. The threat of terrorism hangs in the air. Stock markets have tumbled.

HEADLINE: California Leads on Warming 

 BODY:
Despite heavy industry lobbying, California's Legislature approved a bill last week that for the first time would force automakers to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas largely responsible for global warming. The bill is unquestionably the most important step taken in this country to control greenhouse emissions since 1998, when the Clinton administration signed the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement President Bush has since renounced. The bill contains no specific mandates beyond the model year (2009) when cleaner cars have to be on the road. Details will be worked out in negotiations between the companies and state regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, assuming Gov. Gray Davis signs the bill, as he apparently plans to do, it will inevitably drive Detroit and other automakers to manufacture more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
 More broadly, the bill is a potentially monumental step in the war on warming -- cars and light trucks account for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide and 40 percent in California. It is also another reminder, if any were needed, of how sluggish the national government has been in addressing the threat of global climate change. Congress has refused to require any meaningful increase in fuel efficiency since the 1980's. On climate policy generally, Mr. Bush remains fixated on a voluntary approach that promises little hope of significant reductions in power plant and other industrial emissions of carbon dioxide. 
 On the bright side, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last week approved a bill that would impose mandatory caps on carbon dioxide emissions and three other pollutants -- sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury. Mandatory caps of some sort are necessary to contain the gradual -- and, if we wait too long, irreversible -- buildup of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere. But the bill's margin of approval was razor-thin, and without a courageous conversion or two among prominent Republicans, it stands little chance in the Senate and even less in the House. 
One would have expected a greater sense of urgency. Less than a month ago we were treated to an authoritative interagency report, which Mr. Bush belittled, that reinforced earlier warnings from mainstream scientists that unchecked warming will bring devastating consequences, including rising seas, coastal flooding, disruption of snow-fed water supplies, heat waves and the disappearance of sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs.
Then came a more narrowly focused but equally disturbing report by The Times's Timothy Egan about Alaska, where an astonishing seven-degree increase in average temperatures over 30 years has led to melting permafrost, sagging roads, dying forests, unexpected forest fires and disruption of marine life. Even Ted Stevens, the influential Republican senator from Alaska who usually has little patience with environmentalists, is openly alarmed about global warming's potential cost to his home state, an amount that could run into the billions of dollars, and is privately even more alarmed by Washington's indifference.
It is in this depressing context that California's action is so welcome. The bill is designed to give the automakers great flexibility, and expressly rules out mandatory weight reductions and fuel taxes. Inevitably, though, the automakers will have to achieve fleetwide improvements in fuel economy, which means making more cars that emit less pollution by adding fuel-saving technologies like hybrid engines. California has long been more adventurous than even the federal government in pushing for cleaner cars, and over time this has benefited the nation as a whole because automakers have eventually decided to sell the cars they make for California in other markets.
Once again, the country owes California a vote of thanks. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 11, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on June 16 about climate change in Alaska misstated the rise in temperatures there in the last 30 years. (The error was repeated in an editorial on Monday and in the Bob Herbert column on the Op-Ed page of June 24.) According to an assessment by the University of Alaska's Center for Global Change and Arctic System Research, the annual mean temperature has risen 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit over 30 years, not 7 degrees.

HEADLINE: PARTIES JOUSTING OVER WRONGDOING BY U.S. BUSINESSES 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
The two political parties opened a critical week of jousting today over how to respond to corporate wrongdoing, with Democrats seeking to exploit what they see as President Bush's vulnerability on the issue and business executives pressing for action to restore confidence in the financial markets.
 After being put on the defensive by questions about his role in a stock sale a dozen years ago and criticism of his administration as having failed to act aggressively enough against fraud and mismanagement, Mr. Bush will set out his latest plan in a speech in New York on Tuesday. 
 Administration officials have kept details of the speech under wraps. But with the political pressure mounting, Mr. Bush has been considering a variety of options, including stepping up enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department and making it easier to jail executives for corporate fraud. 
Doing so would bring Mr. Bush's position more in line with the Democrats as the Senate turns its attention this week to legislation that would tighten oversight of auditors. The bill has gained considerable bipartisan support in recent weeks, and Democrats want to press their advantage by adding an amendment that would make it easier for prosecutors to pursue corporate fraud cases.
They launched an attack today on Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who they say has been too close to the accounting industry. 
On the CBS program "Face the Nation," Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the majority leader, called Mr. Pitt a "huge disappointment" and suggested that the Democrats would explore whether he should remain in office.
Putting a spotlight on overstated corporate earnings, the House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on Monday on WorldCom, with testimony expected from the company's current and former chief executives. Page C1. 
A number of business leaders and politicians, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have scheduled speeches on corporate wrongdoing for coming days.
 The issue has increasingly come to preoccupy the White House. Not only has the crisis in investor confidence had a bearing on the economy's ability to lift itself from the doldrums, always a concern to any administration, but Mr. Bush has come under intensified scrutiny for his response to the scandals as well as for his own business ethics while a director of a Texas oil company in the late 1980's and early 90's.
 Seeing an opportunity to cast Mr. Bush as a friend of the wealthy and to make it harder for him to claim the high ground on corporate ethics and responsibility, Democrats are again emphasizing the corporate backgrounds of top administration officials and their links to companies like the Enron Corporation.
 Senator Daschle amplified that attack today. He said that the Bush administration, "from top to bottom," had been characterized by "too much of a permissive atmosphere" when it came to business regulation.
 "We've even seen that in relationships that some members of the administration have had with their own corporate roles and the responsibilities they had in the corporate sector." 
 Mr. Daschle said the "lack of real sensitivity to this concern for integrity is something that I think we've got to be concerned about."
 He urged Mr. Bush to release all records held by the S.E.C. of his sale of stock in the Harken Energy Corporation in 1990, when his father, George Bush, was president. The younger Mr. Bush was a director of Harken and sold stock before the company announced a large loss that drove down its share price. The commission investigated him at the time, and took no action against him.
 Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, called Mr. Daschle's comments "political posturing." 
Speaking to reporters in Kennebunkport, Me., where the president was spending the holiday weekend with his parents, Mr. Fleischer said that the Harken stock sale was "an old tired issue that previous political opponents have tried to use against the president." 
He defended Mr. Pitt, saying that by the end of this year the Securities and Exchange Commission will have banned "more corporate officers from serving on corporate boards because of corporate malfeasance than the S.E.C. did in either of the last two years."
 However, business executives and investors remain concerned that a lack of confidence in the honesty and completeness of corporate financial statements could continue to undermine the markets and the economy.
 In a sign of the shift in the political climate, the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of the nation's largest public companies, said it intended to press for passage of the Senate bill, which was written by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland.
 The administration has been lukewarm toward the Sarbanes bill, although the legislation now appears likely to attract considerable bipartisan support in the Senate. The bill would tighten auditing standards and seek to reduce conflicts of interest in the accounting industry and among Wall Street research analysts.
The White House has been signaling that it prefers many elements of a Republican version that passed in the House, despite Democratic objections that it was too timid a response to a crisis in investor confidence.
 "We see this as being serious, very serious," said John Dillon, the chief executive of International Paper Company and the head of the Business Roundtable. "It's terribly important that we do things in the legislative and regulatory arena that preclude these things from happening again."
 Mr. Sarbanes said he supports the administration's emphasis on aggressively prosecuting executives found to have misled investors. But he said the administration's "few bad apples" approach was not enough, and that it was necessary to address underlying weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks for monitoring companies, their boards and their auditors.
 "The last two or three months has certainly lent support to the view that we need to make systemic changes," Mr. Sarbanes said. 
 Democrats have a long list of possible amendments to the bill. 
Mr. Daschle has already announced his support for an amendment that would create a broader definition of corporate fraud, increase protections for corporate whistle-blowers and revise limits on document shredding.
 Other Democrats plan to offer amendments that would give the S.E.C. additional power to bar corporate directors from serving on boards, revise workers' rights on their pensions and limit the use of stock options as compensation.
 Administration officials said that while the president would continue to take a strong stance against executives found to have misled or defrauded investors, he would continue to walk a line between advocating tougher laws and stifling business with excessive oversight.
 "The system has not failed us, but a few have failed the system," Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said. "That's bad, and the president will address that."
 As for Mr. Bush's speech, Mr. Evans suggested that he would move beyond a 10-point plan he developed this winter after the collapse of Enron. That called for steps like requiring chief executives to sign off on the financial statements issued by their companies, requiring them to disclose their stock sales more quickly and making it easier for the S.E.C. to bar directors involved in misconduct.
 "There have been more revelations in the last couple of months," Mr. Evans said. "He has to respond to that."
 The president spent part of the weekend polishing his speech, which aides said would last around 20 minutes. White House officials have big expectations for Mr. Bush's speech, which they hope will put him ahead of questions revisiting the Harken stock sale. 
They insist that he has not been rattled by the renewed questions over whether he engaged in the same kind of corporate conduct that he is now criticizing. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush appeared startled and then angered when he was first asked by a reporter about the Harken stock sale last week, shortly before he delivered a speech in Milwaukee on his domestic agenda.

HEADLINE: Do Firefighters Like to Set Fires? Just an Urban Legend, Experts Say 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
Terry Lynn Barton was trained to spot the first glimmerings of fire in the Pike National Forest in Colorado, where she worked as a seasonal employee for the United States Forest Service.
 Leonard Gregg was a part-time firefighter on the Fort Apache Indian reservation in Arizona. 
 So it was perhaps predictable that the arrest of Ms. Barton and Mr. Gregg, who are charged with starting the largest wildfires in the histories of their respective states, would revive the notion that firefighters and others whose work involves putting out fires were also more prone to set them. 
Arson, an environmentalist in the Northwest declared confidently in newspaper accounts after the arrests, is wildfire fighters' "dirtiest little secret."
A former fire department engineer in Arizona told a reporter that most arson fires were started by active or retired firefighters -- a fact he said he had learned in his training.
But forensic experts who study arsonists say there is no evidence to support the idea that firefighters are any more prone to sparking fires than anyone else.
"It's an urban myth," said Paul Schwartzman, an expert on juvenile fire setters and a member of the National Fire Protection Association's education board. "They're no more highly represented than other groups."
His assessment was echoed by Dr. David J. Icove, an engineer and arson specialist with the Tennessee Valley Authority police.
Firefighters are no more drawn to arson "than police officers are to crime," Dr. Icove said.
To be sure, there are cases of fire professionals betraying their public mission, and some notorious ones at that.
John Orr, an arson investigator and fire captain in Southern California, was convicted of setting three fires on his way home from a convention of his colleagues in 1987. Mr. Orr, now in prison, denied his guilt, but investigators found an unpublished novel he had written about an arson investigator who set fires.
Paul Keller, the so-called Seattle arsonist, who ignited fires in the early 1990's, was a fire buff who tried hard to become a firefighter.
"Luckily, everybody turned him down," said Dr. Marcel Chappuis, a clinical psychologist who has studied arsonists and is a consultant to the Salt Lake City Fire Department. He said Mr. Keller would set fires and then time how long it took the fire department to arrive.
"He'd go right in the middle of two fire districts and see who got there first," the psychologist said. "He knew all about engines and water capacity."
During times of economic hardship -- the Great Depression, for example -- firefighters who were paid for hourly work set blazes to earn money: federal prosecutors in Arizona have claimed that Mr. Gregg, charged with igniting the brush and timber that started Arizona's Rodeo fire on June 18, did so for money. As a seasonal firefighter, his $8 an hour job depended on having fires to fight.
Ms. Barton, a mother of two daughters who worked part-time for the forest service, told investigators she had in anger burned a letter from her estranged husband in a campfire ring, and the fire got out of control. Both Ms. Barton and Mr. Gregg have pleaded not guilty to setting the fires.
Timothy G. Huff, a former analyst in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's profiling unit who works as a consultant to law enforcement groups, had little difficulty finding arson cases committed by firefighters for an F.B.I. study in 1994. The cases stood out so prominently to fire investigators that Mr. Huff had simply to do a little informal polling at training sessions across the country to collect his sample.
The primary motive among the 75 firefighters, who alone or in groups were responsible for 182 fires, was a need for power and excitement, Mr. Huff found.
Revenge was the most infrequent motive for arson, though in one case a volunteer firefighter torched a fire station, and in another a group of demoralized firefighters set fires to get back at their disliked chief.
Yet the former F.B.I. analyst also disputed that firefighting and fire setting were linked in any systematic way. Of the million or so firefighters in the United States, Mr. Huff pointed out, only a tiny fraction are known to have committed arson, and no data exist indicating this number is disproportional.
Still, neither Mr. Huff nor other experts were surprised that such an idea would exert a folkloric pull. People have a lot of misguided beliefs about arsonists, they said.
Take the term pyromania, a label frequently used by law enforcement officials and in public discussions of fire setting. Pyromania also appears as a diagnostic category on the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders.
Descriptions of people impelled to set fires by a need for sexual or other gratification stretch back to Sigmund Freud's era and beyond. Freud himself suggested that pyromania represented a male perpetrator's denial of his instinctual drive to put out fires by urinating on them.
But modern researchers say that arsonists who get a sexual thrill from their handiwork are extremely rare and that the term is used far too loosely.
It is normal for young children to be fascinated by flames, and the lure of the hearth and the campfire endure into adulthood. Firefighters, several experts said, may have a strong interest in fire, but satisfy it in a healthy way through their jobs. And occasionally, an arsonist may think about fire obsessively.
But Mr. Huff, for his part, argues that viewing compulsive fire setting as a distinct mental illness makes no sense.
In a paper appearing in January in The Fire and Arson Investigator, a publication of the International Association of Arson Investigators, the former F.B.I. official and two colleagues, Dr. Icove and Gordon P. Gary, say pyromania is a myth.
Every case of arson, they contend, can be explained either as a deliberate criminal act carried out for revenge, profit or other motives or as a byproduct of other mental disorders.
Interviews the authors conducted with 150 arsonists in prisons, jails or mental hospitals found that none met the criteria for pure pyromania generally employed by mental health professionals. Instead, the fire setters, even those who were psychotic, described their motives as falling within a number of categories: excitement, revenge, extremism (arson aimed at making of a political point, like the torching of an abortion clinic), profit, covering up another crime or vandalism.
Despite many people's fondness for the word pyromania, the authors wrote, those who use it rarely agree on what they are talking about.
To prove their point, they asked 548 fire investigators to define pyromania and found that the definitions varied widely, though each meaning was staunchly defended by its champion.
"The current usage of the classification 'pyromania' may be an oversimplification of a complex issue wherein the fire-setting acts are the end result," Mr. Huff and his colleagues concluded.
What researchers do agree on is that fire setters are overwhelmingly male -- Ms. Barton, should she be convicted of intentionally setting Colorado's Hayman fire, would be an exception -- and that many adult arsonists ignite their first blazes as children.
"More often than not where you find repeated fire setting there's a long history where there's been no intervention," said Mr. Schwartzman, the expert on arson by juveniles.
National crime surveys find that juveniles account for more than 50 percent -- 54 percent in 1999, according to F.B.I. statistics -- of arson arrests.
For both juveniles and adults, Mr. Schwartzman noted, fire setting can be a cry for help, a way to express anger, relieve stress or exact revenge, or a bid for attention. Some arsonists, he added, have learning disabilities or neurological impairment. Others are calculating criminals.
In many cases, Mr. Schwartzman and other experts said, the act of lighting the fire is precipitated by stress, conflict or the onset of emotional illnesses like depression.
"These guys don't go around setting fires every day," Dr. Chappuis of Salt Lake City said. "The fire setting tends to piggyback on other psychological symptoms."
Still, if the chilling personal account by a female fire setter, published last year under the pseudonym Sarah Wheaton in the journal Psychiatric Services, offers any indication, fire is often on the habitual arsonist's mind.
Ms. Wheaton, first admitted to a psychiatric hospital in 1993 after she set five fires on the University of California campus where she was an undergraduate, was described by the hospital's psychiatrists as "a highly intelligent, highly active young woman who had been the president of her high school class for all four years," according to a discharge summary she included in her journal article.
Yet she confessed in the piece that fire had held for her a lifelong fascination, and that she often set fires to relieve feelings of abandonment, loneliness, boredom, anxiety or emotional arousal.
"Each summer I look forward to the beginning of fire season as well as the fall -- the dry and windy season," Ms. Wheaton wrote.
"I never plan my fire, but typically drive back and forth or around he block or park and walk by the scene I am about to light on fire," she continued. "I set fires only in places that are secluded, such as roadsides, back canyons, cul-de-sacs and parking lots. I usually set fires after nightfall because my chances of being caught are lower then."
When she was not setting her own fires, Ms. Wheaton wrote, she investigated fires that were not her own, read about fires and arsonists and had dreams about "fires that I have set, want to set or wish I had set."
But the thrill of the fire died with its embers.
"At this time I feel sadness and anguish and a desire to set another fire," she wrote. "Over all, it seems that the fire has created a temporary solution to a permanent problem."

HEADLINE: Reining In Expectations On Lincoln Center Project 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Bruce Crawford, the new chairman of Lincoln Center, suggested in a recent interview that putting the price tag of $1.2 billion on the center's ambitious redevelopment was premature and that the project's cost and scope may have to be more modest.
 In his first wide-ranging interview since his appointment last month, Mr. Crawford said there could well be reason to adjust the ambitions of the project downward given the tough economic climate, the inclusion of several wish-list items in the plan and a daunting fund-raising effort that hasn't even begun. 
 "In most fund-raising capital campaigns, you don't set a financial goal till you have the lead gifts in hand," Mr. Crawford said. 
"The scope of the campaign needs to be decided, and it needs to be based on more than hope," he added. "What would we like to do, and what can realistically be done? We need to address that issue, and we will."
That kind of blunt approach is apparently what the board of Lincoln Center was looking for when it named Mr. Crawford as Beverly Sills's replacement in mid-June.
Lincoln Center is often described by its own executives as a dysfunctional family, with the 12 constituent groups that coexist there -- including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Ballet and the New York Philharmonic -- sometimes acting like contentious children. Tensions among many of the constituents have been worsened by the redevelopment, which is expected to take 10 years and transform the 40-year-old arts complex.
In Mr. Crawford, who is 73, the board would seem to have settled on the consummate father figure. But Mr. Crawford, white-haired, well-liked and patrician, suggested that he might also bring a jolt of businesslike management to Lincoln Center. 
Sitting at a conference table at the Madison Avenue office's of Omnicon, the advertising conglomerate of which he is chairman and chief executive, he said he would focus in particular on the future of the New York City Opera and Avery Fisher Hall. City Opera is looking to leave the New York State Theater, which it shares with City Ballet, because of what it deems unsatisfactory acoustics and is considering several sites, including that of the World Trade Center. Lincoln Center has yet to decide whether Avery Fisher Hall, home to the Philharmonic, will be rebuilt or renovated, a question that has concerned Avery Fisher heirs who want the hall to retain its name.
"At this stage I'm concerned with the major problems, which are really the the two theaters," Mr. Crawford said. "That to me is the heart of the matter."
He said he hoped to have some definitive word on City Opera by October. "They are either in or they're out," he said. He set no time limit for his review of the project's scope as a whole.
Even before he arrived, Mr. Crawford said, the entire redevelopment plan -- which calls for a range of changes, from marquees on West 65th Street to more backstage space for the Met -- was being rethought in light of the nation's unpredictable economy, the city's budget gap and the center's true needs.
"The grand scheme is out -- the dome and all that," Mr. Crawford said, referring to a defunct proposal to put a glass atrium over the plaza. He added, "The constituents have been asked to re-evaluate what they anticipate in light of the particular times."
Mr. Crawford said he intended to stay about five years, long enough to get the redevelopment up and running. He attributed the project's problems to date in part to the turnover of Lincoln Center presidents. When Nathan Leventhal stepped down in December 2000 after 17 years, he was replaced by Gordon J. Davis, who left in September 2001 after nine months and was replaced, after an interregnum, by Reynold Levy, who took office in May.
"To have three presidents in a short period of time complicates getting anything done in terms of bringing constituents together and strategic planning," Mr. Crawford said.
"It's a federation," Mr. Crawford said. "The president of Lincoln Center has a lot of authority in many areas, but he certainly does not have authority over the constituents. They've got to be well informed and understand the positives and negatives of the issues.
"It takes a lot of time to do that. And it is difficult to do when the organization is in flux."
Moreover, Mr. Crawford said, when so much money is involved, continuity and strong leadership are particularly important. "Raising and spending that kind of money causes confusion and some level of chaos," he said.
Some Lincoln Center executives have questioned the requirement that all constituents agree on each aspect of the plan, a bylaw that has sometimes made it difficult to move forward. Mr. Crawford suggested that this procedure may be revised. "All of that is being addressed," Mr. Crawford said. "There are certain issues when unanimity is pretty necessary. But I don't think in all cases that you have to have it."
As a former leader of the Metropolitan Opera, Mr. Crawford is a familiar figure, which Lincoln Center executives say works in his favor. Having attended the opera since he was 15, Mr. Crawford joined the Met board in 1976 and became its president in 1984. In 1986, he became general manager and served until 1989, when he resigned to become chairman and chief executive of Omnicom. He returned to the Met as president in 1991 and stayed until 1999.
"He's a person of substance who has known all of us for a long time," said Joseph W. Polisi, president of the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center. 
Mr. Crawford has also won the support of Joseph Volpe, the powerful general manager at the Met, who has locked horns with others at Lincoln Center over some aspects of the redevelopment plan. It was Mr. Crawford who recommended Mr. Volpe for his job in 1989, and the two worked closely when Mr. Crawford returned to serve as president.
"He's the ideal choice," Mr. Volpe said of Mr. Crawford. "I'll do whatever I can to help and support him." 
As for programming, Mr. Crawford said he would try to strike a balance between filling seats and innovating. "You can sell out Verdi and Puccini," he said. "However, if you take the easy road and only do Verdi and Puccini, you will not in the long run be healthy."
Moreover, with critics calling on various Lincoln Center institutions to draw in younger audiences with unorthodox programs, Mr. Crawford added, it is something of a myth that new generations necessarily want new works. "Young people want to go to 'La Boheme,' " he said.
Mr. Crawford is likely to be less of a daily presence at Lincoln Center than Ms. Sills; he said he would spend about half his time there, the other half at Omnicom. "The chairman is not a day-to-day operator," he said. "My principal responsibilities are oversight and making sure what is being done is being done properly." 
Born in March 1929 in West Bridgewater, Mass., Mr. Crawford received a bachelor of science degree in economics from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania and entered advertising in 1956, working for Benton & Bowles and Ted Bates before joining BBDO in 1963.
While he has a reputation for toughness, those who know him say he is also even-tempered. "He speaks softly and doesn't raise his voice," said Martin E. Segal, chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center. "And he doesn't make long speeches."
Though he may not be the legendary fund-raiser Ms. Sills is, Mr. Crawford said he raised $65 million to $70 million a year during his tenure at the Met. And his first job after graduating from Wharton in 1952 was setting up Penn's annual giving organization.
Given that the city has already postponed the $24 million a year Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani committed to the project over a decade, and the increasing difficulty in raising philanthropic dollars, Mr. Crawford faces a daunting fund-raising effort.
"It is of course a huge task," he said. "But there is a great deal of wealth in this country, and this is a great national and international center, and if anyone can raise significant amounts of money, it certainly is in New York and at Lincoln Center."

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit in Big Rise 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
Shrugging off worries about the strength of the recovery, Americans increased their borrowing in May at the fastest pace in six months.
 The Federal Reserve said today that consumer credit rose in May at an annual rate of 6.8 percent, the strongest rate of growth since a 15 percent rate last November. 
 The May increase left consumer borrowing at $1.706 trillion. The gain of $9.5 billion in May followed a revised $8.6 billion increase in April. The April increase represented a 6.1 percent annual growth rate.
The May advance was about $2 billion more than private analysts had been expecting. They said the gain showed that consumers were helping to keep the recovery from faltering. 
"Consumers are focusing on the positive rather than the negative," said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research in New York. "They saw record low mortgage rates, rising incomes and contained prices and responded to that rather than corporate malfeasance, Middle East troubles and the collapse in the stock market." 
Demand for revolving credit, the category that includes credit cards, rose $2.4 billion, to $712.2 billion, an annual growth rate of 4.1 percent, down from a 7.5 percent growth rate in April.
Nonrevolving credit, the category that includes auto loans, rose $7.1 billion, to $993.6 billion, an annual growth rate of 8.7 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent rate of increase in April.
Consumer spending has held up remarkably well throughout the recession, which began in March 2001.

When One New Train Equals One Less Express

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
People often complain about politics and diplomacy being vicious zero-sum games, in which one group's gain is achieved only by a painful loss for another. To cheer themselves up, these people should spend a little time aboard the New York City subway.
 It is where the terrible trade-off must have been invented, where you can safely bet that giving someone a faster ride means giving someone else, somewhere, a slower one with a transfer long enough to qualify as an Olympic event. 
 It is where you can have more trains if you want them -- of course you can! -- but only by making your existing trains shorter. 
It is where your express can be less crowded -- of course it can! -- but only if it does not go where you really want it to go.
And it is where you can find empty seats by the dozen during the rush -- of course you can! -- but only on the local train that makes three times as many stops as the express to get to Manhattan.
These kinds of Faustian bargains have been struck in the subway almost from the beginning and often with good reason: new train lines are very hard to build, new trains are very expensive to buy, and yet in a city that changes in profound ways, the subway must change, too.
Which brings us back to Queens and the embattled V train, which was last visited in December, when it was begun as an end result of three decades of very expensive work to relieve overcrowding on the lines along Queens Boulevard.
The short version of its story is this: A connection was built to link the Queens Boulevard lines to an underused tunnel that went into Manhattan at 63rd Street. The F express, long overcrowded along Queens Boulevard, was rerouted through this new tunnel. It thus left its old route, through the highly used 53rd Street station, where many Queens riders transfer to the Lexington line.
The V, the brand-new train, was added along Queens Boulevard as a local, going through 53rd as the F once did. The E express remained where it was, also passing through 53rd Street. And the G, which used to run from Brooklyn to Forest Hills, was cut in half, because it could no longer fit on the newly crowded Queens Boulevard tracks.
Transit planners and some riders were quite happy: an honest-to-goodness new line, and nine more trains per hour squeezed into Manhattan during the morning rush.
But many other riders were just as angry: where there were once two express trains going to 53rd Street, now there was one express and one local. And, as the visit last December plainly showed, they were not about to take a local if they could help it, even if this meant attempts to bend the laws of physics by pushing onto an E train.
Transit officials said that New Yorkers were stubborn, that adjustment time was needed, and that the agency intended to stick to its guns. By this spring, they even were taking out promotional ads and asking conductors to start making special announcements, the gist of which was, basically: "Take our train, please!"
Meanwhile, some Queens politicians and transit advocates were growing more dissatisfied and preparing for battle. Last month, they announced a campaign to put pressure on Gov. George E. Pataki and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to flip the routes, putting the F back where God intended it and sending the V up to 63rd Street.
So the impasse stood yesterday morning at 9 at the Forest Hills-71st Avenue station, where roomy V trains were still arriving, like hopeful suitors, and Roger White, one among many, was still angrily not taking them. "I don't even see the purpose of the V," he said. "I think it's just in the way. They need to move it somewhere."
Transit officials say they don't plan to move it anywhere, and insist that they are making converts. Although March statistics show that the V is still operating at only 49 percent of capacity during the rush, Paul Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said ridership on it has increased 30 percent since it began, and every new V rider, as lonely as he or she might be, relieves crowding on the E.
"Let's face it," he said. "New Yorkers are -- how do I say this politely? -- New Yorkers are spoiled. We're the only property in North America that has regularly scheduled express service, and people are very reluctant to take locals, even when it makes sense."
Of course, not everyone is. Robert Mavashev, a retired economist, loves the V train. Javier Camacho, a retired electronics technician, also does, and laughs at the punctual souls crowded into the E. "Wake up 10 minutes earlier, that's all," he said yesterday.
Christine Drumgoole and Chrystal Colon do not wake up 10 minutes earlier, but nonetheless they, too, love the V and its empty seats. They take it to go to high school.
"It's school," said Ms. Drumgoole, rolling her eyes. "We don't care if we're late."

HEADLINE: Immigration Policy to Bar Canadian and Mexican Part-Time Students in U.S. Colleges 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 8 

 BODY:
Government efforts to enforce immigration laws strictly since last year's terrorist attacks will bar thousands of Canadian and Mexican college students from returning to school in the fall and cost colleges and universities near the borders millions of dollars, college officials say.
 Under federal immigration law, a foreign student must study full time to be granted a visa. In years past, such policies were enforced only sporadically, and commuter students could easily enter the country. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service plans to enforce the policy broadly by the fall semester and says Congress will have to rewrite the law before the policy changes. 
 "Currently there is no way for a commuter student to be granted admission to the United States," said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for the immigration service. Mr. Bentley added that commuter students "don't fall under the classification of a foreign student, and they don't meet the definition of the classification of a visitor for tourism, either."
After embarking on its new policy in May, the immigration service retreated a bit and said current students could complete the academic year. But by the fall students will have either to enroll as full-time students or leave their colleges. 
"There will be a number of instructors who will not have classes to teach," said Daryl Hendry, admissions director at El Paso Community College in Texas.
The college expects that most of its 2,400 Mexican commuter students, out of an enrollment of 18,000, will not return. It stands to lose $2 million in state financing, as well as tuition losses "too mind boggling" to calculate, Mr. Hendry said. 
"Obviously the teachers are concerned, because that's their livelihood," he added. "The students are concerned because they want to go to school."
Wayne State University in Detroit expects to lose more than 500 students, or 2 percent of enrollment, costing $1 million in lost tuition. 
"Hopefully, I'll get across for my graduation, if I'm able to graduate," said Angela Lengendre, 28, who commutes to Wayne State from nearby Windsor, Ontario.
"A lot of students were just starting up last year and they'd invested a lot of time and energy," Ms. Lengendre said, "and now they can't get their degrees." 
Some of the hardest-hit colleges are smaller ones with slimmer budgets. In Lewiston, a town in western New York, Niagara University has 105 Canadian commuters out of 3,300 students and expects to lose $250,000 in tuition revenue.
"The financial effect is significant on a school of our size," said Linus Ormsby, a Niagara spokesman. 
John Bray, a spokesman for D'Youville College, in Buffalo, which has 2,400 students, including 167 part-timers from Canada, said the college would lose $900,000 in the coming year, "a significant financial impact for a small school."
The policy has schools reassessing programs designed to attract foreign students. The University of Buffalo recently began promoting a teacher training institute intended for a large enrollment of Canadians. Stephen Dunnett, vice provost for international education, said that without Canadian commuters, the institute could be cut in half.
"We now have no idea what's going to happen to it," Mr. Dunnett said.
Buffalo State College hoped to add to its few dozen Canadian students by striking agreements with junior colleges in Canada that simplified transfers. Buffalo State also planned a Canadian studies department. 
"Now we're saying, Should we even consider going in that direction?" said Muriel Howard, Buffalo State's president.
Ms. Howard, also the chairwoman of the Western New York Consortium of Higher Education, recently wrote James W. Ziglar, commissioner of the immigration service, asking him to rethink the policy. 
"Not only would the action unfairly penalize law-abiding students who are seeking to further their education," said the letter, which was signed by 15 college presidents, "but it would also result in significant economic loss." 
On the Mexican border, the University of Texas at El Paso has a special program to train Mexican and United States citizens in mechanical engineering, offering other advanced degrees as well. Eric Tiel, director of the department of international programs, said that if Mexican students were prevented from studying for the degrees, El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, would be faced with a shortage of highly trained workers. 
"What affects one side affects the other," Mr. Tiel said. "El Paso and Juarez are almost one city." 
For students like Jenny Stranges, who lives in Windsor and is halfway to a master's degree in social work at Wayne State, being the focus of a security measure is puzzling.
"I guess there is a lot of confusion as to why this particular law would make a difference with national security," Ms. Stranges, 31, said. "It's not like there's a lot of part-time students traveling across from, I don't know, the Middle East."
Two congressmen from border states, Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill last month to create a nonimmigrant visa category to include part-time students from Canada and Mexico. 
"If Canadians can come to shop or watch a hockey game, they can surely come to take a class," Mr. LaFalce said in a statement. 
Mr. Kolbe said he thought the bill would not meet much opposition, but there is also little chance it would work its way through the House and Senate, and the Bush administration, before the coming academic year.

HEADLINE: No Hats, No Shades And No Bank Robbers 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: WHITINSVILLE, Mass., July 8 

 BODY:
A new sign awaits customers at the door of the UniBank branch here in this town in south-central Massachusetts. It asks them to remove any hats or sunglasses, as a security precaution, and if a person does not comply, a teller will repeat the request.
 UniBank put the policy in place after a branch was robbed in April, part of a surge in bank robberies nationwide that has been particularly acute in Massachusetts. Last year, there were 265 bank robberies in Massachusetts, a jump of almost 70 percent from 2000, when there were 156, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
 Nationally, bank robberies rose 11 percent in 2001, F.B.I. figures show. The increase is one of the largest for any crime at a time when crime in general has begun to rise after a decade of declining. Preliminary data released last month by the F.B.I. found that over all, violent and property crime rose 2 percent in 2001. 
The number of bank robberies in Massachusetts has risen so high that a Massachusetts Bankers Association task force of bankers and law enforcement officers conducted a six-month study of how to combat the problem. Among the recommendations of the study, which was completed last week, is for banks to post signs, like the ones UniBank put up, asking customers to remove hats and sunglasses so potential robbers will know they can be more easily identified by security cameras.
The task force is also recommending that banks post large video screens near their entrances, so would-be robbers can see they are under surveillance, and that greeters are at the door to force robbers to interact with someone before getting to the teller counter. In addition, the task force has developed a Web site, where photographs of robbery suspects can be posted, and pooled money to be used by the police for tips from informers. 
No one is certain what lies behind the increase in bank robberies.
"I honestly can't explain it," said Maj. Richard Fraelick, deputy commander of the investigative services division of the Massachusetts State Police, who was on the task force. 
Among possible reasons for the increase, said Kevin Kiley, executive vice president of the bankers association, are the downturn in the economy, a rise in the number of inmates being released from prison and a mistaken belief by criminals that the F.B.I.'s attention to ordinary crime was diverted by the events of Sept. 11. The last reason has gained popularity among some experts because the biggest surge in bank robberies came after the September attacks. 
But Scott Decker, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, said these theories missed a more important factor: the transformation of banks in recent years from large, forbidding downtown institutions complete with armed guards to something more like convenience stores. 
There has been a huge increase in the number of branch banks in suburban neighborhoods, malls and even supermarkets, Professor Decker said, and "they are much easier to get into and out of, more convenient for customers, but also more convenient targets for robbers to hit." 
As a result, "bank robberies have become more like snatch-and-grabs at convenience stores," said Professor Decker, the author of "Armed Robbers in Action" (Northeastern University Press, 1997).
The typical bank robber has changed, too. No longer are bank robbers the elite criminals like John Dillinger, at the top of the pecking order in the world of prison society. Instead, most are small-time drug addicts, lone operators who need money for their next fix, Mr. Kiley said.
Most bank robbers these days, apparently, do not even carry guns. In Massachusetts last year, 82 percent of bank robberies were carried out by people who simply passed a note to the teller demanding cash, Mr. Kiley said.
But once these robbers succeed, they tend to repeat their crimes, said Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston. Of the 127 bank robberies in Boston last year, Ms. Marcinkiewicz said, 90 were committed by 29 people.
At the UniBank branch in Whitinsville, about halfway between Worcester, Mass., and Providence, R.I., Phillip D. Brown, the president and chief executive of UniBank, was at first hesitant to post the signs. 
"But the situation was becoming so serious that I thought something had to be done," said Mr. Brown, who said he was growing more worried about the safety of his customers and employees.
"After we explained our reasons, we've had no problems with our customers," he added.
Law enforcement experts believe that asking anyone coming into the bank to remove hat and sunglasses is useful because the average bank robbery takes only 60 seconds, so any obstructions put in the way of a robber may send him in search of an easier target.
Questions have arisen over whether the F.B.I. will reduce its role in dealing with bank robberies now that it is transforming itself into an antiterrorist organization. Ms. Marcinkiewicz said the bureau would no longer investigate unarmed "note passers" unless there was evidence the criminal had robbed other banks. 
But the F.B.I. will continue to gather information on all bank robberies, Ms. Marcinkiewicz said, and not much will change in practice because the local police have always done the bulk of bank robbery investigations.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: WALL STREET; 
Despite Access, Star Analyst Missed WorldCom Trouble Signs

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Jack Grubman, the influential telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, missed signs of trouble at WorldCom that some other analysts spotted. And he missed them in spite of an extraordinarily close relationship with the company's management. He was so close to the company that he attended three WorldCom board meetings, he said yesterday.
 In testimony before a House committee that is investigating the company's accounting practices, Mr. Grubman defended his unwavering support for WorldCom, backing that ended just before the company divulged a $3.9 billion accounting fraud on June 25. 
 Though he downgraded the stock on June 21, he said that he had no previous knowledge of fraud at the company. 
"WorldCom is a company I believed in wholeheartedly for a long time," Mr. Grubman said. "All my beliefs have been honestly held."
But by saying that he saw no wrong at WorldCom until just before it was engulfed, Mr. Grubman acknowledged that he missed what some other analysts identified as weaknesses in WorldCom's operations. As a result, Salomon clients who followed Mr. Grubman's advice to hold WorldCom shares as they lost nearly all their value may be able to use his competitors' viewpoints to bolster lawsuits against him and his firm, arguing that his bullish view was not reasonable, given WorldCom's declining business.
Signs of trouble compelled some of Mr. Grubman's competitors to urge investors to sell WorldCom shares and bonds well before the bottom fell out. As long as 16 months ago, when Worldcom's shares were selling for $17, Susan Kalla, a telecommunications analyst, began coverage of WorldCom at the small firm of BlueStone Capital with a sell recommendation. Ms. Kalla wrote a report on WorldCom in March 2001 that cited a slowdown in telecommunications volume and industry prices that she reasoned could only grow worse.
Saying that a cash crisis was possible at WorldCom, Ms. Kalla advised clients to steer clear of the shares and has done so since. "Prices for long distance were falling too fast," she recalled in an interview yesterday from her current job at Friedman Billings Ramsey in New York. "WorldCom no longer had a sustainable business."
Two and a half months ago, Adam Quinton, a stock analyst at Merrill Lynch and head of the firm's telecommunications research group, issued a cautionary report on WorldCom after examining the company's annual report. One reason for his caution was a surprising increase in interest expenses that WorldCom had chosen to capitalize or deduct from its revenue over a period of time rather than immediately and in one chunk. 
On June 25, WorldCom said it had fired its chief financial officer after he improperly capitalized expenses and artificially increased the company's financial results. WorldCom is expected to restate its financial results to deduct these expenses from its revenue as they were incurred, diminishing its overall performance.
The increase in capitalized expenses came to attention in the company's annual report, filed in March. Mr. Quinton said the increase surprised him because it occurred in a period when WorldCom's capital expenditures had declined by 31 percent. "That was just one of a number of signs that didn't lead anybody to the fraud, but that made us wary about the numbers as they were reported," he said. "There were some aspects to the financial reporting that seemed to be aggressive, relative to their peers." 
Back in November 2000, when WorldCom's shares traded at $23.75, a telecommunications analyst at Morgan Stanley downgraded WorldCom to neutral from outperform, citing deteriorating fundamentals. The analyst, Simon Flannery, remained neutral on the company throughout last year. 
Then, early in 2002, the stock rallied as investors bet that a recovery in the economy would increase demand for WorldCom's services. Still, in March, Mr. Flannery gave WorldCom his firm's lowest rating.
"WorldCom's was a story of a rapidly rising growth," he said yesterday, "I guess we took a more measured view of companies being able to grow at rapid rates for a long period of time." 
Glenn Reynolds, chief executive of CreditSights, an independent research firm in New York, said his firm advised clients to avoid WorldCom debt in May 2001 when the company issued $12 billion in bonds.
"Our view on WorldCom was that they had a business model that was in atrophy and they were going to be part of a consolidation theme," Mr. Reynolds said. "The market recognized there was some risk, but there is no getting around the fact that some of the leading analysts that were most closely allied with WorldCom were pounding the table on it." 
More recently, John Tierney, head of credit derivatives strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York, published a note on April 12 saying that WorldCom's business model was no longer viable and that the company was headed for bankruptcy or a merger. "We anticipate that recovery values for a WorldCom bankruptcy could be quite low, less than 30 percent," Mr. Tierney wrote. 
On April 17, Deutsche Bank retracted Mr. Tierney's note saying it had appeared because of an editorial mistake. Yesterday, a spokesman for the bank, which is representing creditors in a WorldCom bank loan that is in default, said that the note was retracted because it was beyond Mr. Tierney's scope to make an individual call on a company's securities. The day Mr. Tierney's note appeared, WorldCom bonds were trading around 75 cents on the dollar. They recently traded around 15 cents.
Yesterday, Mr. Grubman -- answering questions posed by members of the House Financial Services Committee -- confirmed that he had an unusually close relationship with WorldCom management, including his attendance at the three board meetings, where he discussed transactions WorldCom was considering. According to other analysts reached yesterday, attending board meetings is highly unusual.
Mr. Grubman also confirmed that his compensation, which has averaged $20 million a year recently, is related in part to investment banking fees generated by his firm for helping to sell WorldCom securities to the public. 
Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York, said Mr. Grubman's relationship with WorldCom management and the fact that he was relentlessly upbeat on the company while some others were negative could help bolster cases brought against the firm by investors who followed his advice. "Under securities laws, an analyst has to have a reasonable basis for his opinion," Mr. Lowenfels said. "When an analyst gets too close to a company, he may lose his objectivity, and this could affect the reasonable basis for his opinion." 
At the end of last year, stock analysts at four of the six large brokerage houses had buy recommendations on WorldCom. One of those was Salomon Smith Barney. The two firms recommending caution were Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of arbitration cases brought by investors against Mr. Grubman or his firm, Mr. Lowenfels said that if other analysts had changed their opinions from positive to negative while Mr. Grubman continued to recommend WorldCom stock, investors would be able to use these others' opinions to support their position that Mr. Grubman's opinion was not reasonable.
Mr. Grubman testified yesterday that he began to have doubts about WorldCom in March, when the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into WorldCom's accounting. In his defense, he said that other Wall Street firms had remained positive on WorldCom as long as he did. He also said that his bullish views on the company made people a lot of money for a period of time.
Mr. Grubman said if he had even a slight inkling that the operations were not as management represented them, he would have adopted a more negative approach to the stock.
The Salomon analyst was known for taking management's views and giving them a positive spin. In a February 2002 report, for example, Mr. Grubman said he thought WorldCom would generate a positive free cash flow by the second quarter of 2002, as the company had projected. "In fact," he wrote, "we believe" that the company "will actually exceed that timing by one quarter."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE TRADER; 
Enron Trader Had a Year To Boast of, Even If . . .

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 8 

 BODY:
Even as the Enron Corporation was collapsing around him last year, John D. Arnold, the 27-year-old star of the company's energy trading desk, had the kind of year that traders dare only dream about.
 If Enron's internal trading records are to be believed, Mr. Arnold alone booked $750 million in profits by trading natural gas contracts in 2001 -- profits that flowed directly to Enron's bottom line. 
 Trading experts describe the size of Mr. Arnold's market gains as astonishing. Competitors pronounce them improbable. 
By comparison, the 57,000 employees of Waste Management Inc. generated profits last year of $503 million.
"There are very few incidents in the history of Wall Street that are comparable to this," said Michael Holland, a former executive at Salomon Brothers, a firm whose bond arbitragers' prowess in the 1980's became trading legend. "This really is over the top in the outsized numbers here."
Though the trading profits were not big enough to help Enron stave off a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing last December, the size of the gains is further evidence that the company's trading unit was doing extraordinary business even as the company was coming unglued.
Of course, investigators are trying to determine whether Enron's trading unit exaggerated the size of its long-term profits or manipulated prices during the California energy crisis.
But few have questioned the kinds of natural gas trades in which Mr. Arnold engaged -- trades so rewarding to Enron that he was given an $8 million bonus last fall, the largest paid to any Enron employee.
Mr. Arnold, whose quiet, low-key demeanor does not fit the stereotype of the loud and aggressive trader, said he made most of his money last year doing something that Enron always insisted it did not do: speculating on the direction of energy prices.
Of his $750 million in trading profits, he said in an interview, about $600 million came from betting Enron's money that natural gas prices would rise or fall.
Like a day trader in the stock market, Mr. Arnold could, for example, buy contracts for gas futures at a low price and then sell when prices soared.
He could also bet that prices would fall. And he did: his largest gains came in the third quarter of 2001, just before Enron unraveled, when he bet that natural gas prices would fall sharply in the coming months. As prices tumbled about 75 percent from January to October, Mr. Arnold cashed in.
"It certainly wasn't a normal year," Mr. Arnold, now 28, said a few days after returning from a trip to watch the World Cup soccer games in South Korea and Japan. "Did I recognize I was having a good year? Yes. But at some point it's just a number."
According to Mr. Arnold, the other $150 million in profits came from acting as Enron's market maker, or intermediary, in gas trades on the company's fast-growing Internet trading platform.
Of course, Mr. Arnold, who drives a used BMW and lives in an upscale apartment in Houston, could not have done it alone. Former competitors say that Enron's trading operation was powerful enough to set market prices. And because of its natural gas pipelines and power plants, Enron traders had great insights into trends in supply and demand.
Still, in the rarefied world of global energy trading, where traders are reluctant to lend praise to a baby-faced competitor, Mr. Arnold was widely considered the best of the brightest.
"He was sitting in the driver's seat at Enron," said Chris Hoffman, a former Lehman Brothers energy trader who was on the losing side of more than a few trades with Mr. Arnold. "It's kind of like being on the Yankees and he's Babe Ruth."
In 2000, when natural gas prices were rocketing skyward and energy markets were uncommonly volatile, Mr. Arnold had a decidedly un-Ruthian year. He racked up more than $200 million in profit, he says, only to see it vanish by year's end, mainly because of his market-maker role. Internal Enron records show that over all, he lost more than $27 million in 2000.
But his trading gains were so extraordinary the next year, and his bonus so big, that Mr. Arnold could be drawn into Enron's post-collapse woes.
Investors seeking relief from the huge losses they suffered in Enron's bankruptcy may take court action against people like Mr. Arnold who received fat pay packages. So may some former employees, who have received thus far, up to $5,600 apiece in severance pay.
Investigators examining whether Enron's trading unit manipulated prices during the California energy crisis will have to look elsewhere, though; only a fraction of Mr. Arnold's trades involved gas bound for the state.
Four months after leaving Enron, Mr. Arnold says the company's demise had little to do with the trading operation.
"I regret and I'm very bothered by what happened to employees and investors," Mr. Arnold said. "It's unfortunate. But it wasn't the trading side that brought Enron down. We were really the pioneers in the industry."
Some outsiders are dismissive of Enron's claims of trading genius. Rival traders note that Enron -- like many other energy merchants -- relied on mark-to-market accounting, which allows companies to book immediate profits on long-term deals, based on assumptions about prices in the future.
"It's hard to believe that someone can make that much in a single year," said an executive at a large rival energy trader who insisted on anonymity. "Unless you delve deep into the accounting, you can't know how much of that is real and how much is smoke and mirrors."
But Mr. Arnold said that he traded primarily in short-term energy contracts and that Enron valued those contracts based on New York Mercantile Exchange settlement prices, not guesswork models. 
"You couldn't fake this money even if you tried," he said. 
Where did such trading prowess come from? His life, Mr. Arnold said, is much simpler than the energy swaps he used to trade from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day on the 32nd floor of Enron's glass skyscraper in downtown Houston.
He grew up in Dallas, the younger of two sons of middle-class parents. His father, who died 12 years ago, was a lawyer; his mother is an accountant.
As a teenager, Mr. Arnold said he read The Wall Street Journal and became fascinated by securities markets. He even followed the bond arbitrage group at Salomon, marveling at their genius, and the size of their trading positions.
After zooming through Vanderbilt University, graduating in three years with a degree in math and economics, he discovered Enron, joining the company as an oil analyst in 1995, when he was 21.
"I had never heard of them before the career fair," he said. "But then I heard about their prestige in the gas markets. And they were a fast-growing company."
He quickly moved up to assistant trader, then started trading natural gas derivatives in 1996. Enron's trading unit was taking off at the time, leading the charge in an increasingly deregulated energy market. The gas desk was being run by another prodigy, Jeffrey Shankman, then 28, who was remaking the gas desk by combining Enron's pipeline and financial trading operations, which helped traders better assess market trends.
"We had a knowledge transformation around that time; we started putting meteorologists right on the desk," said Mr. Shankman, who left Enron last year. "We grew pretty aggressively, and John fit right into that."
Indeed, the company's trading operations were so dominating that a unit with only about 80 traders accounted for 90 percent of Enron's $1.2 billion in reported profits in 2000.
Last year, according to internal records, the trading unit had booked $2.9 billion in profits through Aug. 31. Much of that was paper profit, experts say -- profit that vanished when disclosures of false accounting drove the company toward ruin and counterparties stopped trading with Enron.
Enron held onto many of Mr. Arnold's positions after the trading operation came to a halt, but it is unclear how many of the contracts were cashed in.
Mr. Arnold left a decimated Enron in March to start his own hedge fund, Centaurus Energy, which expects to begin trading in the energy markets later this month. Former colleagues say he quit after a high-ranking executive sought to take over his lucrative market-making slot. Mr. Arnold declined to confirm that.
Whether he can repeat his past success is an unknown that Mr. Arnold refuses to worry about. He simply says that he will follow the dictum that has brought him profits before.
"It's difficult to be a successful trader if you become emotionally high or low," he said. "It's a little like poker. You have to know when to hold a hand and when to fold."

HEADLINE: U.S. Drops 3 From Money-Laundering List 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
Citing their tougher stances against money laundering, the Treasury Department said today that it had notified American financial institutions that they could relax their scrutiny of transactions involving Israel, Lebanon and St. Kitts and Nevis. 
 The announcement follows last month's decision by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, an intergovernmental body, to remove the three countries from its list of countries and territories that were judged to be uncooperative. 
 Fighting money laundering has taken on greater importance since the Sept. 11 attacks as authorities work to thwart militants in their financing of operations. Inclusion on money-laundering blacklists can harm a nation's economy by causing nervousness among investors, who may worry that they could be associated with illegal practices.
Israel, Lebanon and St. Kitts and Nevis were placed on the list in June 2000 and soon after the Treasury advised American banks and other financial institutions to increase scrutiny over transactions involving those countries.
"Since that time, these jurisdictions have made impressive progress in enacting comprehensive anti-money-laundering legislation and have taken significant steps to implement their new anti-money-laundering regimes," the Treasury said in a statement.

HEADLINE: $12,000 a Night, but Negotiable; 
Hotels for Rich, Like Guests, Do Fine in Lean Times

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
True, economic troubles may be at hand. But it does not really matter quite so much when your hotel caters to clients who pay $10,000 a night and who tip a waiter more than most people pay to spend a night in a typical Manhattan hotel.
 Manhattan luxury hotels like the Four Seasons, the New York Palace and the St. Regis have had their share of problems since the World Trade Center attack. But the economics are a bit different: the distress here may mean changing the fresh flowers only once a day and replacing the Italian curtains less frequently, minor adjustments compared with what is happening at most Manhattan hotels. 
 Why are they on sounder ground financially? 
For one reason, they have thick profit margins -- meaning that it takes a longer time for them to get squeezed so hard that it hurts. But probably the most important factor contributing to their economic stability in a time of great problems in the industry is the nature of their clientele: the very, very rich.
"This is not meant to sound arrogant," said Michael Matthews, a vice president at the St. Regis Hotel, on East 55th Street at Fifth Avenue, "but you have to understand that we are home to a certain world.
"We are the New York Yacht Club. We are more Martha's Vineyard than we are Hamptons. In bad economic times they sell just as many Rolls-Royces and private jet aircraft as they do in good times. Our clients are recession-proof."
The data appear to support his conclusion. In Manhattan hotels where the rooms cost an average of $300 or more a night, occupancy rates have dropped only 2 percent from a year earlier, compared with a decline of more than 3 percent among other hotels in the borough, according to PKF Consulting, a hotel industry research firm. At the same time, these high-end hotels have seen room rates drop only 8 percent from a year earlier, compared with a roughly 11 percent decline in the rest of the borough, according to PKF's figures. These distinctions may seem minor, but they can mean the difference between profits and layoffs.
This has made it much easier for luxury hotels to avoid layoffs and cuts in amenities, like large, fluffy bathroom towels and Godiva chocolates on the pillows.
"The bottom line is that a guy who wants to spend $700 a night to go shopping in New York is not going to be affected as much as the average tourists," said John A. Fox, a PKF senior vice president.
While many in this rarefied slice of the Manhattan hotel industry worried about job cuts after Sept. 11, these hotels laid off fewer people and brought them back faster than did most Manhattan hotels, industry officials say. 
Officials at the New York Hotel Trades Council, the umbrella group of unions that represent everyone from butlers to dishwashers, say that layoffs at high-end hotels make up only a small fraction of the jobs lost since the terrorist attack. At the New York Palace, which laid off 5 of its 19 bellhops in September, most of its workers are back and the hotel is actually hiring. According to the trades council, about 4,500 of the hotel industry's 24,000 workers in New York were laid off after the attacks. About 1,000 have yet to be rehired. 
Luxury hotel officials explain that they cannot afford to lay people off and leave their jobs empty until business recovers. 
Julie Devlin, a concierge at the Palace, said that serious staff cuts at her hotel, where many employees have worked for more than 15 years, would have destroyed a lot of institutional history. "It takes a long time to pick up on the patterns, like the certain guest who calls up at 6:30 in the morning and wants a grand piano in his suite by 7," she said. 
Michael Silberstein, managing director at the Palace, said that during tough economic times, Palace customers -- often shrewd businessmen and businesswomen themselves -- are often searching for the slightest imperfection, particularly in places like the Palace's four triplex suites with balconies, private elevators, bars and solariums with fireplaces.
Not surprisingly, Palace officials will not give out names of customers, making it hard to ask about service. But one well-known millionaire was said recently to have been upset about the lack of freshness of the flowers in her suite. Others at some luxury hotels have complained about cleanliness, suggesting that managers may be cutting back on the housekeeping staff.
At one elite hotel, which insisted on anonymity, managers are looking to maintain profits by wrangling with their food service providers to trim a few dollars off the cost of each Long Island duck breast and pan-seared salmon they serve. Likewise, at the Palace, Mr. Silberstein says he has argued to vendors -- much as management would argue to a union -- that they should take the hit now so that the hotel stays healthy and is able to repay them in good economic times.
But Mr. Silberstein said quality had not been sacrificed. "We have the same flowers and the same accessories in the rooms and the same piano player in the lobby, and we are very creative as to how we price it," Mr. Silberstein said, adding that he had begun checking four times a day on the quality of everything, from laundry to food, provided from vendors who had agreed to reduce their prices.
In the late 1990's, boutique hotels like the TriBeCa Grand and Hudson Hotel -- with their trendy lounges and booming night life -- gained much more attention than the classic hotels for the super-rich on the Upper East Side and in Midtown. Boutique hotel operators say that traditional luxury hotels are still dinosaurs of a dying generation.
But Lanny Grossman, a Palace spokesman, demurred. "The Hollywood crowd is still getting $20 million a contract and they still want to live a lavish life," he said, adding that those and other high-end clients -- including royalty, blue-blood families and professional athletes -- were "much more reliable than the here-today, gone-tomorrow crowd."
One recent afternoon at the Palace, Michael Jackson was in the gift shop. Mr. Silberstein, the managing director, was on an international call making sure a prince who was staying there would get the suite he wanted in another hotel in Switzerland. Robin Williams had been at the hotel a few days earlier.
While most hotels are beginning to show signs of recovery, traditional luxury establishments are ahead of their less elite competitors, according to a recent report from the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
Still, there are deals to be had. The waiting list to get into the 6,000-square-foot triplex at the Palace is gone, along with the waiting list for a 3,000-square-foot suite resembling the private quarters of an exquisite chateau. The price for each is listed as $12,000, although each can be had for $2,000 less. (While the prices before Sept. 11 were negotiable, they are more negotiable now.) 
The 3,000-square-foot presidential suite at the Four Seasons can be had for hundreds of dollars less than the $7,500-a-night list price, and the same goes at the Waldorf-Astoria, the Mark and the Plaza Athenee. 
And despite the hints of cutbacks, the proprietors say that the service, even at these discount rates, will be the same.
"Service is something that happens when you are not aware that it happens, when the doorman asks you what time you are coming back and you say in the afternoon," said Mr. Matthews, the St. Regis vice president, "and he hands you an umbrella because he has seen the weather report that says it is going to rain." 
And all this for the bargain price of less than $12,000 a night.

No Date Is Set, but a Strike by the Players Looms

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ROSEMONT, Ill., July 8 

 BODY:
The players union executive board met for five hours today without setting a strike date, but quietly let it be known that barring a new labor agreement, one will be set in the next few weeks for sometime between Aug. 15 and Sept. 30.
 Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, spoke repeatedly after the meeting about the players' hope that no date or strike would become necessary. 
 However, others who attended the meeting at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare said that Major League Baseball clubs would make a mistake if they took the nonaction as an indication that the union was backing off its intention to act before the owners could implement a new economic system after the World Series.
In the absence of a new agreement, two people who attended the meeting said, a strike date will be set for sometime in the last six weeks of the season, threatening the playoffs and the World Series and perhaps the end of the regular season. 
Last month, some players indicated a desire to wait until next year to make their stand, believing the owners had no intention of negotiating an agreement and intended to impose their own rules after declaring an impasse in the talks. If the owners do not want an agreement, these players said, there was no reason for them to forgo pay for the final weeks of the season.
However, as one union official explained today, such a scenario could give the owners the wrong idea. They might see the players' decision as a sign of weakness, the official said, and an agreement would be less likely because the owners would see no reason to compromise in their demands for the clubs to share 50 percent of their local revenue and to levy a 50 percent tax on portions of payrolls over $98 million.
Because some owners and others in management urged the union not to set a strike date, saying it would be detrimental to the talks, they may welcome the lack of an actual date, while some hard-line owners may seize on it as indicating that the players do not have the stomach for a strike.
Setting a strike date does not automatically mean the players will strike. The date would also serve as a negotiating deadline, and in baseball's bargaining history, agreements have generally not been reached without deadlines. The pace of these talks has been excruciatingly slow, and each side has blamed the other.
Fehr said the executive board would take no action until he had completed meeting with all 30 teams. He has 23 to go, and he estimated that he would finish by the end of the month at the earliest. During his meetings, he will update the players on the status of the talks and will gauge their sentiment for a strike.
Under both Fehr and his predecessor, Marvin Miller, players have always given near unanimous support for a walkout if the negotiations reach an explosive juncture.
"From the players' standpoint," Fehr said today, "a strike is a last resort. It would not be entered into unless the players feel they had no other viable option. It is our hope that over the next few weeks we will be able to have the kinds of serious and substantive discussions with major league owners that we have heretofore been unable to have and resolve these issues. That is certainly the goal. We have every intention of doing everything we can to make sure that goal is realized."
When one player representative, Doug Glanville of the Philadelphia Phillies, was asked if he thought there would be a work stoppage, he said: "It's still to be determined. It's a serious thing. Clearly everybody wants to avoid that. It's not something we can decide very quickly. For now it's up in the air, but people have to be aware of the possibility."
In 1994, the last time the players struck, the executive board met the day before the All-Star Game and set no strike date. However, it met via conference call July 28 and set a date for only 15 days later, Aug. 12. When no agreement was reached, the players walked out after the games of Aug. 11.
Asked if a similar scenario could develop this time, Fehr said: "We hope it doesn't, but the executive board's obligation is to review negotiations on an ongoing basis and make decisions as needed. Nothing would please us more than to get an agreement."
Talks are set to resume Thursday. Fehr will not be at some of the bargaining sessions because he will be traveling to meet with players. Next week, for example, he said he would be meeting with teams on the West Coast.
Fehr said the 30 players who attended the meeting discussed all of the issues in the negotiations, including testing for steroids. He said that issue would be discussed at his team meetings as well.
"It's a serious issue," he said. "It will be handled seriously."
The clubs proposed last February that players be tested for steroids three times a year. The union objects to such testing on privacy grounds, among other reasons. 
Fehr said another matter discussed was contraction. A decision on the union's grievance over the owners' attempt to eliminate two teams unilaterally is expected shortly. The arbitrator, Shyam Das, has said he would try to have a decision by July 15. Some people on the management side have said they believe his decision will have an impact on negotiations, but Fehr said he didn't expect that to happen.

ACCENTURE TO CUT 1,000 JOBS, MOSTLY IN MANAGEMENT

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Accenture Ltd., the consulting firm, will cut about 1,000 jobs, most of them at the management level, in the United States, Britain and Australia to reduce costs, the company said. 
The cuts will take place over the next several months, a company spokeswoman, Roxanne Taylor, said. Ms. Taylor would not provide specific reasons for the cuts, except to say that there have "been challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world." Accenture, which is based in Bermuda, expects other hiring will offset the cuts, meaning the company's work force of about 75,000 will remain at that level until the firm's 2002 fiscal year ends in September.

HEADLINE: Career Profiles of 9/11 Dead Arouse Anxiety 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Among the families, it is called, quite simply, the Book. Prepared by the staff of Cantor Fitzgerald, and meant to arm families of Sept. 11 victims in their fight for federal compensation awards, the Book is a detailed accounting of the performances and prospects of the firm and its 658 lost employees.
 But as both those who are assembling the Cantor document and those about to open it realize, the Book could well be yet one more minefield for a bruised and fragile population of survivors. For the Book and other similarly detailed packages being prepared by the companies with the greatest losses at the World Trade Center are a kind of emotionally loaded statistical yearbook. 
 Projected salaries may trigger trembling recollections of a loved one's once great, now vanquished, aspirations. Worse, the frank financial portraits, drawn with the best of intentions, may not comport with the expectations of those left behind. 
Perhaps the world-beating dad, pride of his small town, was not really quite as successful as he had quietly boasted. Perhaps the promised windfall of a bonus the son or daughter had promised parents was an exaggeration, or a fiction.
And so while Judy Weil, whose daughter died in her office at the law firm Harris Beach, says such efforts by the trade center companies will be invaluable in the fight for compensation, she awaits her package with a mix of need and nervousness.
"I almost don't want to find out what Joanne's salary was, because that was her private life," Mrs. Weil said of her daughter, "but I do have to find out for this fund. Everything relevant to this is potentially an emotional situation, an emotional problem: every job title, every promotion -- or not -- every number. I don't need to know how she stacks up. It's going to be overwhelming."
Kenneth R. Feinberg, the special master overseeing the multibillion-dollar government fund established to compensate families for their lost earnings, said he was happy to review the documents.
But he said that he would consider many things in making the awards and that he would by and large stick with facts, not speculation or sentiment. The facts, even those laid out in the supportive documents provided by the companies, may not always be easy for the families to accept.
"There are some people who are surprised to hear that their loved ones weren't who they thought, or had unrealistic views of what their wife or husband did, what they earned, what their potential was for the future," said Mitchell Kleinman, general counsel for the investment firm Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which lost 67 employees.
"Not every single person was a superstar and was going to become chairman. So you try to be realistic, and you say that the employee was in good standing. You try to be supportive."
Some families, in fact, may find the financial pictures put together by the companies so dispiriting or disappointing that they may forgo the fund and sue either the airlines or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. To join the federal fund, one must agree not to sue and to agree that the award is binding.
Taken together, though, the reports, from Marsh & McLennan and Carr Futures, among others, indisputably form the core of a sad but essential Sept. 11 library. The reports represent the labors of many lawyers, economists and accountants working at no charge on behalf of damaged companies.
Much of that labor has been expended on measuring how much information is too much information -- for the families or the administrators of the federal Victim Compensation Fund, which has already drawn up its formulas for calculating people's worth and lost income.
Some companies are, in fact, challenging the economic assumptions of Mr. Feinberg. Some companies are providing easy-to-read dossiers on each victim, complete with bar graphs and glossaries.
Local 100, the restaurant workers' union, is contemplating a more anecdotal approach, with supporting exhibits like photos, affidavits and biographies. Aon is acting only on specific requests from families to furnish any data, convinced that such restraint is the "tasteful and thoughtful" approach, according to a spokesman. And some companies, according to families, are hardly doing anything.
Government employees like firefighters and police officers have largely avoided this issue because of established patterns of salary, benefits and rank. But because many private companies lost their records in the attack, and there are no guidelines, much less legal obligations, many companies realize that these reports will be much scrutinized.
"I feel so much pressure on doing this right," said Stephen M. Merkel, executive managing director and general counsel at Cantor. "It is extremely important to us. I don't want to look back in 20 years and say that I didn't do my best for our families."
The companies and the families of their victims have had to navigate a difficult path since Sept. 11, balancing compassion with practicality, a desire to provide help with the need to protect the long-term financial interests of the companies. Some families criticized Marsh & McLennan for using the charity money it raised to finance the health insurance of the families of victims, rather than paying for the insurance itself.
Cantor was at first criticized for not doing enough financially for the families. But now they have committed to paying out 25 percent of the company's profits over the next five years to the families of those lost.
The Book, though, is a wholly different thing. At Cantor, work on the Book -- which Mr. Merkel prefers to call a submission to the fund -- began shortly after Sept. 11. Realizing that many families had little insurance, no wills and few resources, company officials analyzed data on demographics, compensation, consumption and other variables.
After much number-crunching, the company concluded that Mr. Feinberg's economic assumptions about the likely financial fortunes of the company and its employees were incorrect, and skewed against them. They say his skepticism about the company's ability to sustain its growth was misplaced.
Combining legal advocacy and statistical analysis, the Book is actually a two-part production. The first, to be published in the next few weeks, will focus on the company's macroeconomic trends, the second on individual profiles, which officials do not intend to circulate beyond each individual family.
"The key is not to be anecdotal, but to stay strongly on the facts," said Howard W. Lutnick, the company's chairman.
Speculation about the Cantor project has been intense for months, leading to the nickname of the Book and to the thought that its length may rival the Bible's. This will not be the case. If anything, the initial submission should be no longer than perhaps a few dozen pages. Many Cantor families say that they have been pleased with the company's attempts, by e-mail, phone or conference calls, to keep them apprised of the Book's progress.
And yet some families also sense that the Book could be packed with emotional tripwires embedded within the most innocuous of data.
Other companies, while curious about what Cantor will do, are working on their own reports. Carr Futures, which lost 69 employees, and Fiduciary Trust, which lost 87, are among those planning to hammer out customized profiles.
Marsh & McLennan, meanwhile, is one of the few companies finished. About a month ago, the company mailed out 20-page dossiers on each of its 295 victims. Available only to each specific family -- and not in some reference-book compilation available for the world to leaf through -- the neat, user-friendly dossiers include a victim's resume, job supervisors, benefits package and company compensation trends.
The reports are so thorough, in fact, that Mr. Feinberg has told Marsh officials that the families can simply attach the reports to their applications.
The positive response from families notwithstanding, Marsh officials are constantly reminding people that the dossiers are geared to one specific purpose only, the Victim Compensation Fund. They are not, in the end, the full picture of how highly regarded the employees were as colleagues and friends and members of a corporate family. "We tell families this is not a statement of values," one Marsh executive said.
It is a sentiment shared by Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Sandler O'Neill and Euro Brokers, three financial services companies that lost dozens of employees apiece on Sept. 11 and are now working together informally on producing their version of the Book, or, in reality, several books.
Later this month, the companies hope to release a document (which they're calling a primer) of 25 to 30 pages that is intended to help the families understand economic concepts relevant to the compensation fund. The primer will be followed by the individual reports from the companies that will include explanations of business practices and relevant historic and economic trends, said Laurence Belinsky, managing director at Sandler O'Neill.
Those company reports may then be followed, perhaps on a case-by-case basis, by reports on each victim that describe, say, job performance, the profitability of the victim's department vis-a-vis other departments, the number of stocks owned. But the companies are mindful of a voyeuristic element -- not just for the families but also for current employees.
"Obviously, there's confidential data, because not everyone here wants the entire world to know what they make, or what they own," Mr. Kleinman of Keefe said.
Already, the companies say that they are dealing with relatives who had a mistaken notion of where victims ranked in the hierarchy. Some families were not aware of how accomplished their relatives, who had always struck them as humble, really were. In other instances, some families have been disappointed to learn that their children who said they earned giant-size bonuses every year in fact did not.
In the end, such individual reckonings, while compelling and subject to personal surprises and drama, may do little to aid the families' claims, given Mr. Feinberg's determination to be swayed only by facts.
Still, long after the federal government cuts the checks, long after various anniversaries have been marked, again and again, the families will have their memories in their heads, and a variation of the Book in their hands.

HEADLINE: How a Popular State Bill to Restrict Smoking in Restaurants Faltered 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Among the many pieces of unfinished business at the end of the legislative session this year, a bill that would have restricted smoking in restaurants seemed among the most likely to succeed. 
 The measure is popular with voters. More than 70 percent of New York's residents already live under similar local laws. For the first time, the state's largest restaurant association said it was satisfied. The State Assembly had approved it. In late May, a spokesman for the Senate Republican majority said it would come up for a vote, and public health advocates provided a list indicating they had the votes to win if the bill came to the Senate floor. 
But the session has pretty much ended, and the bill was not brought up for a vote. 
Its apparent demise demonstrates how in Albany, it is much easier to stop a bill than to shepherd it into law. And the various interested parties will almost always tell different stories about who applied the brakes. 
Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate Republican majority leader, expressed concerns that the measure would hurt small businesses. Senate Republicans are traditionally opposed to saddling businesses with more regulation.
Several lawmakers have said that Gov. George E. Pataki also did not want the bill to come to a vote. Blair Horner, the chief lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group, suggested that Governor Pataki might not have wanted to antagonize the tobacco industry any further, since the governor had approved major tax increases on cigarettes this year. 
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the governor, disputed that, saying: "That's just plain wrong. We have an open mind on the legislation. The governor has led the effort to combat the dangers of smoking, and New York now has one of the most aggressive antismoking campaigns in the nation."
The bill also lost steam at the end when the advocates and the sponsors of the legislation refused to compromise further, saying changes had already weakened the bill.
For a while, things seemed to be working in favor of the bill, known as the Clean Indoor Air Act. Once considered a sheer political impossibility, the bill gained momentum when, for the second year in a row, a zealous Republican sponsor took on the cause in the Senate. The sponsor, Charles J. Fuschillo Jr., brokered an agreement with Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat and longtime carrier of the antismoking banner in the Assembly. 
Senator Fuschillo then shopped the agreement to Senator Bruno, who controls which bills come to the floor for a vote. Mr. Fuschillo, a junior member from Long Island serving his second term, was optimistic. 
The new deal, which the sponsors intended primarily to protect restaurant workers, would have banned smoking in all restaurants, except in separately ventilated smoking rooms and, in a concession to political realities, the bar area. The bar could only have 15 percent of the restaurants' seats and would have to be separated by a floor-to-ceiling partition or -- in another compromise -- six feet of empty space. 
Restaurants that found the rules too onerous, Mr. Grannis said, were more than welcome to forbid smoking altogether. 
The bill has a long list of supporters, including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the League of Women Voters and doctor and consumer groups. Its list of opponents is far shorter: the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association and the tobacco industry, whose lobbyists say they have taken an interest only in support of the restaurants it considers customers.
And not all restaurants oppose the proposed law. The New York State Restaurant Association reversed its long-standing opposition after a survey showed, to the surprise of its president and chief executive, Rick Sampson, that 76 percent of its 7,000 members favored the law. 
"Our argument has always been uniformity," Mr. Sampson said. "As long as one county is doing one thing, and something different is going on somewhere else, it creates a problem for our members." He continued, "Why the bill hasn't moved, I got to tell you I'm kind of surprised."
Still, the bill was altered to meet some restaurant demands: the bar-seating limit was removed, and smaller establishments were given more time to comply. On a Thursday in June, with the legislature not reconvening until the following week, some supporters agreed to the changes. Assemblyman Grannis told reporters that there was a deal.
That amounted to two tactical errors, said some of those rooting for the bill: Mr. Grannis angered the Senate by breaking protocol with a unilateral announcement, and advocates had played their hand too soon, giving opponents time for rebuttal.
The rebuttals came, and the momentum flagged. The next week, Scott Wexler, the executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, which has 5,000 members, floated the idea that the bill would apply to private clubs like American Legion halls and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts, mainstays in the communities of upstate senators. The bill does not affect such clubs.
John McArdle, a Senate Republican spokesman, said that hundreds of restaurants were calling. "Most of the concern has been coming from those who believe the proposed bill would put them out of business," he said.
Frustrated, public health advocates including the American Lung Association and the New York Public Interest Research Group released a list noting that 42 of the 61 senators favored the measure. Asked why the bill was not put to a vote, Mr. McArdle said, "We don't go by advocates' roll calls. We don't run our lives that way. And they're very suspect."
Then a complaint surfaced that was based on one of the bill's more permissive measures: allowing smoking in the bar. That would be unfair to restaurants without bars, wrote Larry Forth, the chief lobbyist for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, a national chain of family restaurants. And if a bar could be separated by a partition, he asked, why not a smoking dining room?
Mr. Wexler is the bill's most public opponent, insisting that the law would drive smaller restaurants out of business, as he said had happened with local laws. 
But he could not provide the name of any restaurant forced to close by a smoking curb. "What we do know is that places open, places close and some have closed because of the law, but I could not identify individual businesses that have closed because of the law," he said.
One of the association's members, Andrew Harris, the owner of the Better Days Pub & Eatery in Allegany County, said that along with a depressed economy, his county had one of the state's highest percentages of smokers. "Every business here is in a pretty fragile position," Mr. Harris said. "Eighty percent of my clientele smoke. Half of those people that smoke wouldn't come in because they couldn't smoke in here."
In theory, the bill would have allowed restaurants threatened by the law to apply for hardship waivers. 
Mr. Wexler asked for exemptions for restaurants under 35 seats, and for smoking in the main dining room, but at tables with "separate ventilation systems," an idea laid out on a Philip Morris Web site. The bill's sponsors would agree to neither proposal, saying they would weaken what was already a compromise.
"What they're doing is carrying the argument for the tobacco industry, obviously," Senator Fuschillo said of the tavern lobby, adding concessions had been made for business owners. "This is about health, and the focus should remain on health."
There is no evidence that Mr. Wexler is shilling for the tobacco industry. But since a loss of credibility after lawsuits of the 1990's and the disclosure of unreported gifts to New York lawmakers in 1999, tobacco companies have often partnered with, or created, hospitality industry groups to further their agenda. Internal tobacco documents released in court showed that Mr. Wexler's group had received more than $400,000 from the Tobacco Institute in 1995. Mr. Wexler says his group no longer receives such funding.
Still, tobacco lobbyists who list the Clean Indoor Air Act on their lobbying reports referred questions to Mr. Wexler. And while they would offer no memos of opposition from their tobacco clients, one tobacco lobbyist, Dan Adams, sent one from the state craft brewers association. Brew pubs may not be affected by the law, and the association is not listed as one of Mr. Adams' clients on the state lobbying commission database.
But if the tobacco industry keeps a low public profile, it is a big political spender. Philip Morris is among the state's top 10 lobbying clients. In 2001, the company gave $117,500 to Republican committees and $11,000 to Democratic committees.

Shares Retreat From the Surge at the End of Last Week

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Shares slumped yesterday, eroding a rally at the end of last week, as questions about revenue booked by Merck revived worries about accounting practices. 
 Investors were bracing for the next blowup after a string of questionable accounting issues, including $3.8 billion in expenses disguised as profits at WorldCom. 
 "People are certainly waiting for the next shoe to drop," said Michael Vogelzang, president of Boston Advisors. "There's a fairly prevalent sense of 'who's going to be next, and which companies in my portfolio are going to have that problem?' " 
Investors yesterday were wary of Merck, which recorded revenue of more than $14 billion from its pharmacy-benefits subsidiary over three years that the unit never actually collected, according to a regulatory filing. 
"There's a question of the quality of numbers across the board," said Matt Holscher, head of Nasdaq trading at W. R. Hambrecht. "Companies like WorldCom and Enron put up a red flag, and people are having to discern between companies that have come to their numbers legitimately and those that haven't." 
More dour news on profits from companies like Alcoa and Allegheny Energy also cooled the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 104.60 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,274.90, after having its biggest percentage gain in more than nine months on Friday. The Nasdaq composite index fell 42.75 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 1,405.61, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.05 points, or 1.2 percent, to 976.98. 
Merck, among the most active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, slipped $1.05, to $47.81. 
Stocks had surged in Friday's holiday-shortened session, but few Wall Street analysts called the light-volume rally a turning point. 
Accounting issues were in sharp focus yesterday, as former executives of WorldCom refused to testify at a Congressional hearing, and lawmakers called for prison time for those responsible for the multibillion-dollar scandal. 
President Bush is scheduled to present new policies today aimed at cracking down on boardroom misconduct. But analysts say it will probably come as little comfort to investors. "We need to see some real honest to goodness earnings growth," Mr. Vogelzang said. "We need to see some vibrancy in American business, and we just don't see that." 
Alcoa said quarterly profits fell on weak prices because of sluggish demand from the manufacturing and aerospace industries. It dropped 88 cents, to $32.50. 
Investors also received disappointing news from Allegheny Energy, a utility company that said profits would fall short of forecasts because of a weak electricity market. It lost $2.08, to $23.95. 
Helping the Nasdaq yesterday, the shares of Level 3 Communications rose after it said the investor Warren E. Buffett and two others had agreed to buy $500 million of Level 3 debt to allow the company, a money-losing fiber optic carrier, to make acquisitions. It rose $1.47, to $4.36. 
EBay dropped sharply after it said it would buy PayPal in a stock swap worth about $1.5 billion, bringing under its own roof the online payment system already used by many eBay customers. 
EBay fell $4.31, to $56.24; PayPal surged $1.61, to $21.61. 
In the bond market, Treasuries surged yesterday.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note increased 16/32, to 100 19/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.80 percent from 4.86 percent on Friday. The 30-year bond increased 24/32, to 98 18/32, yielding 5.48 percent, compared with 5.53 percent in the previous session.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

Angerat Executives' Profits Fuels Support for Stock Curb

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Restricting the ability of executives to sell company stock has quickly become a central part of efforts to change the rules under which corporate America does business.
 In a step that would have been unthinkable in the long economic boom of the 1990's, an expanding array of big investors, policy makers and even a few business leaders are arguing that top executives should be required to keep much of their own company stock for as long as they hold their jobs. Proponents of the idea include Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
 At the same time, officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission say they have become more aggressive about penalizing executives who appear to have profited from incorrect financial statements.
In response to mounting criticism, two lobbying groups representing leading businesses yesterday essentially dropped their opposition to a measure that would require companies to seek shareholder approval for new stock-option plans for top executives and their employees. 
The efforts stem from the widespread anger over what many critics consider the most galling aspect of the recent corporate scandals: the contrast between the fortunes made by some executives while their stock was riding high and the ultimate fate of their companies.
Scott D. Sullivan, the chief financial officer of WorldCom who is now being investigated for accounting fraud, for example, made almost $10 million in profit when he sold nearly all his stock in the company two years ago. WorldCom's shares closed yesterday at 23 cents, down from about $37 when he made the sale. Some executives at Enron, Global Crossing, Rite Aid, Tyco International and Xerox -- companies whose accounting practices have also been called into question -- made far more money than that in recent years.
"You had highly promotional C.E.O.'s saying things were great yet selling just massive amounts of stock," said Kenneth F. Broad, a portfolio manager with Transamerica Investment Management in San Francisco. "It's virtually impossible to reconcile those two things."
The contrast has given the scandals a political potency that arcane accounting practices alone might not have and has helped create the first sustained challenge to executive pay since Bill Clinton made the issue part of his presidential campaign in 1992.
In the battle in Congress over corporate misconduct, lawmakers from both parties have submitted proposals dealing with executive pay, including some that would make it easier to fine executives at companies with accounting problems.
The S.E.C., meanwhile, has brought four cases this year that try to seize what it described as executives' ill-gotten gains. That matches the number of cases it brought in the previous 15 months.
"These are remedies that we will be more aggressive in seeking," Stephen M. Cutler, director of the commission's enforcement division, said in an interview last week.
The efforts to require holding periods for executives' stock remain scattered, but they have the potential to have a far broader effect than the attempts to punish executives after they have violated a law, major investors say.
Echoing calls from some institutional investors, Senator McCain said yesterday that executives should be required to hold onto their shares in a company as long as they work there. If they exercise stock options, the executives should be allowed to sell only enough shares to pay their income taxes, he said.
A spokeswoman for Senator McCain said he had not yet proposed legislation to establish such holding periods but would discuss them in detail in a speech on Thursday.
Such a rule would be difficult for the government to mandate, Congressional aides said, because it would prevent people from selling their own property.
But the idea is also gaining some momentum in the private sector. In a speech last month calling for changes in corporate practices, Mr. Paulson of Goldman Sachs said holding periods could level the playing field between investors and executives, who always have inside information about the company's health.
Boards should require their executives to hold "a substantial portion" of their stock, Mr. Paulson said. "This will create the proper incentives and inspire investor and employee confidence," he said.
A few companies, including Bank One and Citigroup, already have such policies. And most insiders at start-up companies are not allowed to sell their stock for certain minimum periods after an initial public offering of shares.
Supporters of imposing strict holding periods say they align an executive's pay with a company's performance. Executives' annual salaries and bonuses, which typically equal a few million dollars, are big enough to keep them comfortable, the investors say. Stock grants, they add, should make the executives lavishly wealthy only if their companies are successful over the long run.
The Conference Board, a business-backed research company in New York, has appointed a committee to recommend corporate-governance guidelines this year, and holding periods will be a main item on its agenda, said Richard E. Cavanagh, the president of the board. The committee includes John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, the large investment company; Andrew S. Grove, the chairman of Intel; and Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman. 
Holding periods "would make it impossible for an executive like the Tyco guy to get big gains and then a year later have a meltdown," Mr. Cavanagh said, referring to L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco, who made more than $100 million selling his shares in the company before the stock collapsed.
But many executives oppose holding periods. Stock options -- originally praised by investors, who saw them as a way to connect pay and performance -- now represent the majority of the $10 million in annual pay that the chief executive of a typical large company receives. 
At nearly every large technology company in the country, including Cisco Systems, Dell Computer and AOL Time Warner, executives would be far less wealthy if they had been unable to sell shares in the market bubble of the late 1990's.
Among the other proposals being debated in Washington, some of the best-known would not cause significant changes to the law, lawyers said. The S.E.C. said last month that it would require top executives to swear by their financial statements, for example. But to punish executives, the commission will still probably need to prove that they knowingly violated the law. 
Both Democrats and Republicans have offered legislation that would give the S.E.C. specific authority to force executives to forfeit pay they received as a result of incorrect financial statements. But the commission effectively has such authority now, lawyers said.
"Much of what is going on here is symbolic," said John Olson, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington who represents companies. "People want to appear to be doing the right thing by calling for new penalties."
But Mr. Olson and others said the measures could still lead to greater scrutiny for executives, at least in the short term, by concentrating regulators' attention on executives' behavior. 
Recognizing the new atmosphere, two lobbying groups for executives announced yesterday that they would support a proposal from the New York Stock Exchange to require shareholders to approve all company stock-option plans. Analysts say the measure might cause boards to reduce the size of option grants so as to avoid a fight with investors.
One lobbying group, the Business Roundtable, a coalition of 150 chief executives, had long opposed such a rule, saying it would limit companies' flexibility. The Roundtable's members changed their position in an attempt to convince investors that their financial statements are trustworthy, said John J. Castellani, the group's president.
The other group, TechNet, which represents high-technology companies from Silicon Valley and elsewhere, had not taken a position on the proposal, but many of its members had strenuously criticized it.
Some investors said the business groups realized that the new stock-option rule would take effect no matter what and were supporting it now partly to bolster their opposition to the idea that companies should deduct the estimated cost of stock options from their earnings. Current accounting rules consider most options to have no cost.
Supporters of a change, including Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, say it would force companies to report more realistic profits than they now do. The executives say there is no credible way of valuing options.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Old Business In New Light

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
If President Bush hoped to turn attention to the first topics he mentioned at the start of his news conference today, like military appropriations, trade and a review of the welfare system, he was in for a rude shock.
 For most of the 36-minute session with reporters, Mr. Bush faced a series of detailed questions about his own business dealings a dozen years ago at Harken Energy of Texas and whether they undermined his call for improved corporate ethics and stiffer penalties for executives who defraud investors. 
 With Washington increasingly preoccupied with how to respond to corporate fraud and the ensuing loss of confidence in the financial markets -- Mr. Bush spoke not long after Wall Street wrapped up another down day and as top executives from WorldCom appeared before Congress and invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination -- the president tried to brush aside the questions about his role at Harken as baseless and old. 
But they came in a very new political climate, one in which the boom of the 1990's has given way to a post-bubble hangover -- and in which the Democrats are eager to find parallels from Mr. Bush's business career before he ran for governor of Texas to revelations about Enron, Tyco International, WorldCom and the growing list of companies under scrutiny. 
Although Mr. Bush's tenure at Harken did receive some media attention in the 2000 campaign, it is not that surprising that in the current climate of accounting misdeeds, insider-trading accusations and bottom-line restatements that Mr. Bush's role as a director of the company, and his sale of about 212,000 shares of the company's stock, would draw renewed attention. Vice President Dick Cheney's role as a top executive of Halliburton, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is also attracting renewed attention.
The news conference was the president's third at the White House since Sept. 11 and the first not dominated by foreign affairs or the campaign against terrorism. Of the 33 questions and follow-ups taken by Mr. Bush, 21 involved corporate wrongdoing or his own business dealings.
In an attempt to defuse the issue, Mr. Bush repeatedly told reporters today that his Harken stock sale in June 1990, not long before the company posted a big loss, was an old matter that had been carefully reviewed by the S.E.C., which took no action against him.
"There's no there there," he said. 
He also faced questions about whether Harken -- of which he was a director and a member of the audit committee -- had deliberately booked an improper profit on the sale of a subsidiary in 1989 to obscure the size of its operating losses.
The S.E.C. later forced Harken to restate earnings for 1989 substantially downward after disputing its accounting for the sale of the subsidiary.
Mr. Bush said that "the S.E.C.'s job is to look and is to determine whether or not the decision by the auditors was the appropriate decision.
"And they did look, and they decided that earnings ought to be restated, and the company did so immediately upon the S.E.C.'s finding."
The president answered no to a question about whether his predecessor as president should be held partly accountable for lax business standards and the wave of corporate wrongdoing. But the interrogation he faced -- and his tense reaction to a barrage of pointedly personal questions about an old business deal -- had echoes of that faced in the last decade by the Clintons over their personal financial dealings before they reached the White House.
Mr. Bush's involvement in Harken began in 1986, when he sold it a struggling energy company of his own, Spectrum 7 Energy. Mr. Bush received more than 200,000 Harken shares and a seat on its board.
The current focus on Mr. Bush's involvement with Harken centers on two issues that have some parallels to those raised by the more recent spate of revelations of corporate misconduct.
One is whether he profited from inside information in selling Harken stock in 1990, two months before it announced a loss that was much bigger than expected.
The other is Mr. Bush's role, as a director, in Harken's decision to book immediately a $7.9 million gain from the sale of its Aloha Petroleum subsidiary, even though the sale, to a group of Harken insiders, was largely paid for with a loan from Harken.
Mr. Bush never worked full time for Harken, though in addition to serving as a director he had a consulting contract that paid him $42,000 to $120,000 a year for five years. Not long after the merger with Harken, he moved to Washington to help his father's presidential campaign. 
By 1989, Mr. Bush's business efforts were focused on acquiring and running the Texas Rangers baseball team. He began selling some of his other investments, and in June 1990, he received a call from a broker asking if he was interested in selling 212,140 Harken shares.
He did so on June 22, 1990, receiving $4 a share, or a total of $848,560.
At the time, Harken was struggling. It had had big trading losses, it was having trouble with its banks, its long-term debt had more than doubled, and it was trying to sell some of its assets.
In August 1990, Harken reported that it lost $23.2 million in the second quarter, a far worse performance than investors had expected. The stock plunged from $3 a share to $2.37 in a day before rebounding.
The next winter Mr. Bush filed -- 34 weeks late -- a required form with the S.E.C. about his sale of Harken stock. The commission then began investigating whether Mr. Bush had sold on the basis of inside information. It ultimately concluded that while he knew about many financial problems at Harken, he did not know at the time of the scale of the loss that would be announced two months after his stock sale.
Mr. Bush has always maintained that he was selling the stock on good news -- Harken's progress in lining up financing from the Bass family of Texas for a venture to drill for oil in Bahrain.
During late 1990 and 1991, Harken was also under pressure from the S.E.C. over its accounting for the sale of Aloha.
By booking a $7.9 million profit from that sale, Harken was able to report a relatively modest loss of $3.3 million for 1989. But after the S.E.C. finished examining the accounting in early 1991, Harken was forced to restate its earnings, reporting that it actually lost $12.6 million for 1989.

HEADLINE: Citing Israel's Need for Security, Bush Accepts Occupation 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that Israel was justified in occupying the West Bank until "security improves," a comment that appeared supportive of Israeli officials, who had said recently that they had no intention of withdrawing their forces from Palestinian-controlled territories soon.
 In answer to a question at his news conference at the White House this afternoon, Mr. Bush pointedly passed up an opportunity to offer a warning similar to the one he gave in April, when he angrily said that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon should "heed my call" and withdraw Israeli troops. Instead, with the Israeli Army fully in command of most of the Palestinian areas of the West Bank, he said, "I would hope that everybody got the message that we all have responsibilities to fight off terrorist attacks." 
 Israeli military and government officials have talked of keeping their troops in the Palestinian areas for months to prevent suicide bombings, which have abated in recent days. 
On June 19, Mr. Sharon declared that Israel would seize and hold those territories. A few days later, Mr. Bush called for the removal of Yasir Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Bush's comments today will almost certainly be cited as evidence by the Israelis that they have tacit American approval of their military action.
Mr. Bush also used today's news conference, held hours after he returned from a three-day vacation in Maine, to repeat his determination to oust Saddam Hussein as the leader of Iraq. He said that he was deeply involved in military, economic and diplomatic strategy to bring about what he called "regime change." 
Mr. Bush tried to diminish -- but did not deny -- an article in The New York Times on Friday that described the Pentagon's broad concept for a three-pronged invasion of Iraq. He said the source of the story was "somebody down there at level five flexing some know-how muscle," but disputed none of the account, which described a document that planners at the United States Central Command had prepared. 
Mr. Bush also suggested that in the broader effort to prevent terrorism, he had slightly altered his approach toward the capture of Osama bin Laden, having said soon after the Sept. 11 attacks that it was his goal to take Mr. bin Laden "dead or alive."
"He may be alive," Mr. Bush said. "If he is, we'll get him. If he's not alive," he said, pausing, "we got him."
American intelligence officials say they believe that Mr. bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is living along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. But there have been no known sightings of him for months.
Some intelligence officials speculate that, if he is alive, Mr. bin Laden is communicating with his fractured network through runners who briefly use -- and then dispose of -- cellphones. But there is an argument within the intelligence community over whether Mr. bin Laden's silence can be interpreted as evidence of his demise, or whether, in the words of one senior official, "he's just gone deep underground."
Mr. Bush's comments on the Middle East were telling because he has not followed up on his June 24 speech with more public calls for the Israelis and Palestinians to act. That silence has only fueled speculation that American policy in the region is essentially frozen while Yasir Arafat remains in place. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is expected to meet next Monday in New York City with senior officials from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia to discuss proposals for ending the violence in the Middle East, Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said today.
The meeting will follow up on talks that were held last week between William J. Burns, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, and officials from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia. Mr. Boucher called those talks "good and productive."
Mr. Bush insisted today that elements of his strategy were falling into place, starting with his call for the Palestinians to develop institutions -- from courts to a reliable finance system -- that would create confidence in their self-governance.
"I believe some progress is being made toward the institutions that I talked about, that are necessary for a Palestinian state to emerge, which will give us all confidence in its ability to fight off terrorist activities, its ability to receive international aid without stealing the money, its ability to develop a judiciary," Mr. Bush said.

Buffett in Move Into Technology Sector

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett made his first move into the technology sector yesterday as he and two other investors bought $500 million of bonds issued by Level 3 Communications, the money-losing fiber optic cable company.
 The deal is a watershed for Mr. Buffett, one of the most influential investors, who has avoided technology and communications investments -- even when they were hot -- despite occasional pleas from shareholders of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. 
 Mr. Buffett has said that he will not invest in areas he does not understand or where he cannot identify long-term winners. His tough investing criteria were met by Level 3, whose chairman, Walter Scott Jr., sits on Berkshire's board.
"Liquid resources and strong financial backing are scarce and valuable assets in today's telecommunications world," Mr. Buffett said in a statement. "Level 3 has both."
Shares of Level 3 jumped 51 percent on the news, rising $1.47, to $4.36. The company is looking to use the money to take customers from troubled long-distance and local phone operators, James Q. Crowe, the chief executive of Level 3, said in an interview.
"We already have a network we think goes to the right places and is constructed correctly," Mr. Crowe said. "So we're more interested in acquisitions which bring customer bases to our networks."
Under the deal, Mr. Buffett and two money managers, Longleaf Partners Funds and Legg Mason, will buy $500 million of Level 3 debt. Level 3, which is based in Broomfield, Colo., will sell the investors 10-year bonds yielding 9 percent interest that can be converted into Level 3 stock at any time if the investors choose.
Longleaf will buy $300 million of the debt, while Berkshire and Legg Mason will buy $100 million each.
The deal is a boon for Level 3, coming as the telecommunications industry unsettles investors with accounting scandals, oversupply of capacity and disappointing demand. The investment could touch off consolidation in the sector, Mr. Crowe said.
"The telecommunications industry is going through a period of unprecedented turmoil," he said. "The shakeout is creating extraordinary opportunities as telecommunications companies, their network assets and customer bases become available." 
The price of Level 3's other corporate bonds jumped as much as 15 points yesterday, traders said, but the firm's debt is still rated as highly speculative, or junk, by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.
Berkshire's Class A shares gained $800, or 1.2 percent, to $68,800. Berkshire, based in Omaha, focuses on insurance and owns 50 or so old-economy companies, holding about $29 billion in stocks and $36 billion in bonds.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
After the Cigars, a Simple Steakhouse

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
WHEN Patroon opened in Midtown in 1996, it revived a style of luxurious clubbiness that had come to seem threadbare and outmoded. With uniformed doormen, a richly appointed dining room and a menu that was among the most expensive in town, not to forget a sedate cigar bar upstairs and a list of bejeweled old Cognacs, Patroon charmed expense-account diners, who indulged themselves in the straightforward yet exquisite American cuisine.
 Not settling for popularity, the owner, Ken Aretsky, brought in a well-known chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who, while staying true to the essentially conservative spirit of Patroon, was able to innovate on the sly, offering modern renditions of old school favorites like duck a l'orange. The smart likability of his cooking and the energetic professionalism in the dining room won Patroon three stars when it was last reviewed in The Times, by Ruth Reichl in October 1998. 
 Much in life has changed since then, of course, including Patroon. Mr. Zakarian left in 2000 to open his own restaurant, Town, and last summer, after the economic slowdown took some of the starch out of high-end dining, Mr. Aretsky closed Patroon for renovations, saying he was aiming for a more stripped-down steakhouse approach. His plan seemed all the more sound after Sept. 11, when the conventional wisdom suggested that costly luxuries were no longer in good taste.
The doorman is gone, the cigar bar is history (though the smell of stale cigar smoke lingers), and the new Patroon, done up in contrasting shades of brown and beige, looks more like the dining room of an airport hotel than an up-to-date "21" Club. This is not to suggest that Patroon has become inexpensive. It's a steakhouse with steakhouse prices, but the menu has been pruned of almost all excess and, for that matter, individuality.
As you might expect, simplicity now rules. Oysters on the half shell are superb, although the selection is slim. I prefer the more delicate, saline Malpeques over the meatier Blue Islands, the two available one evening, but both were served perfectly, needing nothing to enhance their purity. The same can't be said of utterly tasteless shrimp, which are barely more pleasing when doused with barbecue sauce and grilled than they are served cold with cocktail sauce. But a jumbo crab cake is practically all meat, a thoroughly satisfying mouthful of pure flavor, while a fried soft-shell crab, a special appetizer one day, was delicately crisp and delicious. Caesar salad is well rendered, though I like a more pronounced anchovy presence. And truffle oil mars potato-and-leek soup, giving it a sharp, almost artificial flavor.
Patroon faces stiff competition in a city full of steakhouses. As far as beef goes, though, little things tend to go wrong. Steaks, for example, were consistently overcooked -- medium instead of medium rare, well instead of medium. This is a pity, because the meat itself is quite good. I love the mineral tang of aged beef, and it's right there in the thick, firm sirloin and in the porterhouse for two. Even filet mignon (when not overcooked) was full of flavor beneath its well-charred exterior. But the Delmonico steak was barely aged -- soft and almost mushy. Maybe some people prefer their steaks that way.
Among the accouterments, a platter arrives practically overflowing with onion rings, the slender, precisely battered O's almost uncannily identical. Creamed spinach, though, needs to be wrung of cream before a forkful can safely be lifted to the mouth. 
Strangely enough, where the steaks are wanting, fish dishes are excellent. Branzino, roasted whole and presented to our table on a wooden platter before filleting, was moist and faintly oceanic, enhanced with no more than garlic, lemon and herbs, while grilled Dover sole was supremely elegant. I might not return to Patroon for the steaks, but I would go for the simple, elemental fish preparations. I would come back too for the smart, well-chosen wine list. While the selection of first-growth Bordeaux, running $1,000 and more a bottle, remains from the old days, there are many excellent selections in the mere two-figure range. 
Desserts are straightforward in the typical steakhouse way -- hefty wedges of creamy cheesecake, chocolate cake with an interior that has the consistency of chocolate pudding and hearty hot fudge sundaes. 
While waiters are friendly enough, there is a lackadaisical, laissez-faire quality to the service that may have you wondering whether you'll ever receive menus or water refills. It's as if the crack professionals moved on when Patroon closed for renovations.
It may be tempting nowadays to think of Patroon as an anachronism, a dinosaur struggling to keep up with swiftly changing times, yet it won't be the fault of evolution if Patroon falls by the wayside. Luxury dining may be somewhat toned down, but it hasn't died. People are still crowding into steakhouses, buying fine wines, foie gras and other emblems of pleasure. They're just a little more picky about where they are doing it.

HEADLINE: Counting Costs, It's the Worst In Hong Kong 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 9 

 BODY:
Hong Kong has taken over from Tokyo as the world's most expensive city, London is the costliest capital in the European Union, and New York has the highest prices of any city in North America, according to an annual survey.
 In other results in the report, from Mercer Human Resource Consulting, released on Monday, Buenos Aires took the biggest plunge, falling from 23 to 133 after the country's economic crisis and devaluation. 
 More surprising, the second costliest city was Moscow, with Tokyo third. "You don't always see a match between the quality of life and the cost of living," said John Murphy, the company's global marketing manager, based in Windsor, outside London. In Mercer's quality-of-life survey, done in March, Moscow came in 150th. 
Harare, the capital of troubled Zimbabwe, became Africa's most expensive city, rising to 26 from 130. Johannesburg, in South Africa, replaced Blantyre, in Malawi, as the cheapest city among 144 for which calculations were done worldwide. 
Milan, Dublin and Paris were, in that order, the European Union's next most expensive places while Madrid and Lisbon were the least. Cities in Australia and New Zealand offered the best combination of livability and affordability. 
Mr. Murphy, explaining the surprising ranking for Moscow, said, "It's because of things like fresh food and fruit and well-made clothing that aren't available there, and taxis cost 50 percent more in Moscow than in London." Buy a suit setting the fashion pace on Bond Street in London and it will cost $850. Cut the same figure in Moscow on Tverskaya Street and it will cost $1,330.
The survey measured the comparative costs of more than 200 items, ranging from luxury hotel suites and household appliances down to toothpaste and deodorant. A cup of coffee in Hong Kong costs four times what it does in Amsterdam. The world's highest baby-sitting charges are in -- where else -- New York.
"You want to feel sorry for a place, consider Caracas, Venezuela," Mr. Murphy said. "Our environmental survey in March found it was the dirtiest place to live in South America, and this new one finds it is also the most expensive."

HEADLINE: Turkish Leader Hangs On as Ministers Quit 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, July 9 

 BODY:
Three more cabinet ministers resigned today as Turkey's coalition government crumbled further, but Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit filled some of the vacant posts, resisting pressure to step down.
 Still, after being deserted by more than a quarter of his party's legislators, there appears little chance the ailing Mr. Ecevit will be able to hold on to power for much longer. 
 Analysts say the disintegration of Mr. Ecevit's government could open the door to economic and political reforms that have been blocked by a coalition government more concerned with survival than policy. 
The resignations also bring up the possibility of weeks or even months of political infighting. Two of Mr. Ecevit's coalition allies are already demanding early elections, with one suggesting a September date. Elections are not scheduled before 2004 and Mr. Ecevit, 77, has vowed to serve out his full term.
"It is time Ecevit and his followers started seeing the realities in Turkey," wrote Ilnur Cevik, the editor of The Turkish Daily News. "You simply cannot stand against the tide."
The political chaos comes at a crucial time for Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member, which took over command of the peacekeeping force in Afghanistan last month. The United States has viewed Turkey as a role model of a secular Muslim country that sees its future with the West.
The United States also is considering military action against Iraq and is hoping that Turkey will be willing to provide bases and other support.
Economically, the International Monetary Fund has provided Turkey with about $31 billion in loans to help the country recover from a crisis that has led to more than two million layoffs, and it is looking for economic reforms.
The lira hit a record low today and stocks fell.
European leaders have suggested that formal negotiations over Turkey's membership in the European Union could begin by year's end but they are waiting for Turkey to carry out reforms, like abolishing the death penalty and expanding rights for minority Kurds.
"We should form a new government in order to realize E.U. reforms before December," Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said today. 
If such a government could not be formed, Mr. Yilmaz said, Parliament should be called from its summer recess to vote for elections in September. Mr. Ecevit's nationalist allies are calling for elections by November.
The resignations follow two months in which Mr. Ecevit has been either in the hospital or recovering at home from a series of ailments. As he recuperated, his government appeared virtually paralyzed, with cracks emerging between the nationalist wing, which opposes Europe-oriented reforms, and his center-right allies pushing for closer ties.
"We had locked ourselves into a situation in which nothing was being done and the primary concern of government was staying in power," said Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Bilgi University in Istanbul. "It also became clear that in major policy areas nothing was going to happen. Now there is an opportunity to bring about change."
The resignations began Monday when Mr. Ecevit ordered Deputy Prime Minister Husamettin Ozkan to quit after rumors that Mr. Ozkan was negotiating with coalition partners to replace the prime minister.
Mr. Ozkan's departure triggered an exodus of party legislators who believed the government was slowly falling apart under a leader in poor health who was unwilling to surrender power.
Today, Education Minister Metin Bostancioglu resigned, as did two state ministers, Hasan Gemici and Mustafa Yilmaz, and nine other lawmakers from Mr. Ecevit's Democratic Left Party. One legislator quickly returned, but the total departures numbered 32. Mr. Ecevit's party now has only 96 seats in the 550-seat Parliament, fewer than the seats held by his nationalist allies in the three-party coalition. The coalition agreement calls for Mr. Ecevit to remain prime minister even if his party loses members.

HEADLINE: Tax Increase Leads to Plan For Layoffs By Federated 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 9 

 BODY:
Stung by the business-tax increase that New Jersey adopted last week, the corporate parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores announced today that it planned to scale back its operations in the state and lay off at least 50 workers.
 The parent company, Federated Department Stores, which employs 10,000 people in New Jersey, said it would also cancel some expansion plans and consider closing some of its 37 New Jersey stores because the state's new business tax code would raise its state taxes to $10 million from $4.4 million. 
 In a letter to Gov. James E. McGreevey, who signed the code into law last week, company officials said the actions were spurred by the tax increase, which had transformed New Jersey from "one of the most desirable states in which we do business to one of the least." 
"This will necessarily result in some very painful decisions that will impact people living and working in your state," said the letter, signed by James M. Zimmerman, Federated's chief executive.
Some business leaders said they feared that today's announcement would be the first in a wave of corporate cutbacks caused by the tax. But the McGreevey administration, which helped close its projected budget gap by enacting a $1 billion increase in corporate taxes, responded almost aggressively to the news.
Some administration officials said Federated executives were upset because the state had denied the company's request to transfer some of their New Jersey profits to a bankrupt subsidiary, precisely the kind of loophole that the new tax code was intended to close.
State Treasurer John E. McCormac wrote a letter to the company saying that he could review Federated's tax status only if the company released a wide array of financial data, including its tax returns and the salaries and bonuses for top company executives.
"The corporate business tax changes that were implemented were fair and equitable and were fiscally responsible," Mr. McCormac wrote.
Federated officials scoffed at the notion that their move was related to the failed lobbying effort, and said that the requests for internal corporate documents were irrelevant.
"They can try to camouflage it any way they want," said Carol Sanger, a vice president for operations at Federated. "Politicians are good at that. The bottom line is they doubled the taxes."
The testy exchange between the company and the McGreevey administration came after business leaders had campaigned for months against the new tax plan.
The governor said the changes were necessary because an array of tax loopholes had brought a steep drop in business-tax collections in the state and allowed 30 of the top 50 employers in the company to pay the minimum corporate tax of $200. 
Business advocates said Mr. McGreevey's remedy went beyond merely closing loopholes, and would lead to such painful increases in tax bills that it would cost jobs.
During negotiations with business leaders and Republican legislators this spring, the McGreevey administration made some adjustments to the new tax code. But the governor and his staff insisted that the loopholes allowed corporations to evade paying taxes and unfairly shifted the burden to middle-class families.
The administration also maintained that state taxes were such a small part of most corporations' total costs that they were only a minor factor in decisions about whether to relocate.
James C. Morford, president of the New Jersey Food Council, said his organization had lobbied against the bill because it feared that higher taxes would slow an already sluggish economy.
"In all candor, we did warn the so-called experts that these kinds of decisions might be made," Mr. Morford said. "This is not an indication that a business is going to up and leave New Jersey. We knew that all along. But we feared that there would be investment decisions and resource deployment decisions based on what happened and it would hurt our state."
The letter from Federated urged the state to repeal the law, saying that the tax increase was so large that the company would be forced to shift operations to states with less onerous taxes. In addition to the 50 layoffs in a New Jersey distribution system, Federated said it expected an unspecified number of store closings in the coming months.
"We intend to be clear in attributing the necessity for these actions to the exceedingly unfriendly business environment that now exists in New Jersey," Mr. Zimmerman said.

HEADLINE: Work Often Comes First for Bangladeshi Students 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
Adolescence can die young.
 For Tafazzul, a teenage Bangladeshi immigrant who had arrived in this country without his parents, the moment came when his older brother was blown up three years ago by a trash-can bomb on the Lower East Side. Left with $400 in monthly rent, to meet, two younger brothers to feed and no adults looking after them, Tafazzul, then 16, quit high school to work 15-hour days as a shop clerk. 
 "I wish I had my parents here when I was in high school," Tafazzul said, his eyes casting downward. "They don't have to do anything for you. But it's a nice feeling to know that when you are tired, you will have their shoulders to lie on, and that's enough."
Tafazzul, who would give only his first name, is among the thousands of Bangladeshi students who have gone through New York City's public school system in the last decade. The majority of them have legally immigrated to America with their parents and are being supported by them. But dozens of them, like Tafazzul, are living in city tenement buildings on their own, leaving their parents behind in Bangladesh so they could flee a country ravaged by relentless poverty, natural disasters and political instability. 
To support themselves, they deliver pizzas, cut flower stems at corner grocery stores, sell souvenirs on sidewalks and wait tables at restaurants after school and on weekends. Often, four or five of these boys share a studio apartment in the tenements on the Lower East Side, in Harlem or in Jackson Heights, Queens, each contributing his share of the rent. For those who manage to stay in school, homework comes only after the end of late-night shifts, if at all.
Hardship, however, is hardly reserved for those immigrants without parents. Hundreds of Bangladeshi students with parents also work long hours after school to help support their families. Some send as much as $100 every month -- enough to feed a family of three there for a month -- to relatives in Bangladesh, said their school guidance counselors, a couple of whom are Bangladeshi immigrants themselves.
But that immigrant energy sometimes has a downside for schools that enroll the Bangladeshi students. The confluence of poverty, lack of early schooling and language barriers, combined with the need to work long hours, frequently drives many of these Bangladeshi youths out of school. Nine of 10 at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side, for instance, drop out, said a Bangladeshi teacher there.
"It's very hard for them to keep up," said Meenakshi Datta, a guidance counselor for the Bangladeshi students at Seward Park. "They talk different. They don't have the academic preparation to get ahead, and their families need them to work."
Mrs. Datta, who came from Bangladesh seven years ago, is familiar with how these children made their way to America. Most, she said, came legally with their families, who have succeeded in getting visas through a lottery by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that aims at improving diversity among America's immigrants. But many of the boys -- and they are virtually all boys -- who live here by themselves frequently entered the American ports illegally.
"Sometimes, some boys' parents would pay families with legal papers to take their sons to the U.S.," Ms. Datta said.
In other cases, she said, some families would sell all their possessions, including their land, to bribe a Bangladeshi staff member in the United States Embassy to procure for their sons visitors' visas, which are hard to get. Once here, the Bangladeshi boys would overstay their visas and become illegal immigrants.
But the road toward some measure of economic success is hardly the same legendary road traveled by other immigrants, even for those with their parents here. For one thing, the young Bangladeshi immigrants are often behind their American peers in academic preparation.
"In Bangladesh, as soon as kids turn 11 or 12, many parents send them to work in factories or drive rickshaws," said Shaon Ahmed, now 23, a Bangladeshi native who attended Seward Park High. "They don't believe in school." 
Illiteracy in Bangladesh hovers at close to 70 percent, according to data from the United Nations. But even for families that put a premium on education, formal schooling for their children can often be interrupted by typhoons, hurricanes and, for girls, traditional responsibilities such as tending to ailing relatives. 
"Some Bangladeshi kids come to this country at 15, 16, and they are placed in 10th or 11th grade because of their age," said Mohammed Abul Kalam Azad, a Bengali teacher at Long Island City High School in Queens. "But they really only have had a fifth- or sixth-grade education, and they are not ready for 10th or 11th grade."
There are a handful of Bangladeshi teachers in the city's public schools, like Seward Park High and Long Island City High, teaching Bengali as a foreign language. Many of the city's 3,500 Bangladeshi students take their classes to fulfill their foreign language requirement. Invariably, the service of these teachers are in great demand.
In most cases, the new Bangladeshi students take a few periods of English as a second language a day but sit in the regular classes for other subjects, since subject classes such as history or global studies are not offered in Bengali by the New York school system.
Bangladeshis are among the fastest growing minority in the city; their number quadrupled to close to 20,000 from 1990, according to the 2000 census.
Mr. Ahmed was one of the few Bangladeshi teenagers who have graduated from high school while living alone.
"Every day, I would be in classes and keep talking to my classmates sitting nearby," recalled Mr. Ahmed, who graduated from Seward Park three years ago. "That was the only way to keep myself awake. I always had to work the previous night."
Now a junior at Baruch College and a part-time cabdriver, Mr. Ahmed said he owed his success to his own determination, stamina and the companionship of a Chinese immigrant girl, whom he eventually married. Both sold souvenirs at a gift shop in Chinatown for $2.75 an hour.
"I know we were abused," he said of the wages, "but the owner was the only person willing to pay us off the books. And trust me, there are a lot of people around who are willing to work for that price."
Such freedom is hardly accorded to Bangladeshi girls. Once detected they are dating, some have been pulled out of schools by their families and sent back to Bangladesh to marry a partner chosen by their families.
Many of the Bangladeshi children are poignantly aware of the difference between their situation and that of American peers who may be busy worrying about choosing the right sneakers and filling out resumes to impress college admissions officers.
Abdul Munaf, 16, a student at Seward Park, waits tables to help support his father in New York, who is too sick to work. His sister Zaheda Begum, 17, goes to Seward Park and works after school, too.
Abdul said he wished that he might be able to play soccer with friends after school instead of rushing to the Indian restaurant.
Mr. Ahmed would have liked to have joined a school band, and he said that he always stayed away from bars, fearing being swept up in a brawl. "I really wanted to be just like the other kids, you know," Mr. Ahmed said.
