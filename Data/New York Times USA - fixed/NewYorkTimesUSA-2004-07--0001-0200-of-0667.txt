HEADLINE: How Borrowers Are Affected

 BODY:
What will higher Fed rates mean for borrowers? The greatest effects will be on mortgage rates and home equity loans, but these will vary substantially.

MORTGAGES -- Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages have already crept up by more than a percentage point over the last few months and now average about 6.3 percent. Because these rates have already risen, they may remain steady until the Fed signals a tougher stance. Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages would therefore see no change. Those with adjustable-rate mortgages may eventually face higher payments, but most adjustable-rate mortgages are locked in for the first few years.

HOME EQUITY LOANS -- Most of these loans are fully adjustable, moving up or down in response to changes in short-term interest rates and as banks adjust their prime lending rates. Either way, monthly payments are likely to edge up in line with the Fed's rate action.

CREDIT CARDS -- Though some credit cards have variable interest rates, they generally are set at fixed, relatively high levels, meaning that modest changes in short-term lending rates do not have a significant effect on these borrowing costs.

HEADLINE: Poppies Flood Afghanistan; Opium Tide May Yet Turn

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 30 

 BODY:
So many farmers grew opium poppies in Afghanistan this spring that the opium market here is now flooded, causing prices for the illegal drug to drop by an average of 65 percent across the country, according to Afghan officials, Western diplomats and opium farmers. 
 While an overabundance of opium is a setback for the country in the short term, Afghan and Western officials say this year's drop in prices may actually prove to be a boon in the effort to slow the explosive spread of opium here. 
 Afghanistan produces two-thirds of the world's opium, but comparatively little of it is consumed domestically. Almost all of it winds up in Europe, where it is shipped after being processed into heroin in remote border areas and in neighboring Pakistan. 
 Because most of the heroin in the United States comes from Latin America and Southeast Asia, the glut of opium in Afghanistan is not expected to affect the price of heroin on American streets, said Bill Grant, a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
 Experts say the high profit Afghan farmers make on opium is by far the largest incentive they have to grow the illegal crop. If prices tumble far enough and the government mounts a credible crackdown, farmers may decide that growing opium is no longer worth the risk, they say.
 ''There is a tremendous opportunity developing now,'' said a Western diplomat.
 Afghan and Western officials consider the drug to be one of gravest threats to Afghanistan's stability. Proceeds from the trade function as a powerful force pulling the country apart by corrupting local officials, strengthening regional warlords who defy the central government and financing an increasingly violent Taliban insurgency. 
 These officials say they must speed up efforts to introduce alternative crops in areas where farmers who grew opium this year fared poorly. They say a brief window exists to persuade impoverished Afghans that opium will no longer enrich them.
 Even with the drop in prices, the scope of the country's opium trade remains staggering. It appears that a record number of Afghan farmers, including vast numbers in areas where opium had not been grown before, chose to sow it this year.
 Last year, an estimated 1.7 million Afghans, 7 percent of the country's population, grew opium in 28 of the country's 31 provinces. Opium generated an estimated $1 billion in 2003, roughly one-quarter of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Limited efforts by the Afghan government, the United States and Britain to use eradication and alternative crops to slow opium production have failed. 
 American and Afghan officials say the production boom was fueled by a surge in prices, creating an almost insurmountable temptation for farmers in one of the world's poorest countries. For decades, opium prices remained comparatively low in the country, at roughly $30 a kilogram (2.2 pounds), according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. But after the Taliban enacted a brief ban on production in 2001, the prices soared to $750 a kilogram. 
 Eager to get in on this bonanza, farmers planted more and more opium in 2002 and 2003, according to the United Nations. Higher production brought prices down to roughly $350 a kilogram in 2002 and $283 in 2003. 
 This spring's oversupply has driven the price down to an average of roughly $100 a kilogram, according to Western diplomats. In the southern province of Helmand, long a center of opium cultivation, tomatoes are selling for more, according to farmers and shopkeepers. 
 One Western diplomat said strong crops in the north flooded the opium market there. A handful of government raids on processing labs also appears to have made dealers nervous about buying large amounts of opium, he said. That, too, has driven down demand and prices.
 In the south, the same thing appears to be happening. A trip last weekend to Helmand and Kandahar Province, another bastion of opium cultivation, confirmed a sharp drop in prices. In Kandahar, agricultural officials said the prices farmers got for their opium fell 50 percent from last year. 
 In Helmand, agricultural officials said two different obstacles for opium farmers. In northern Helmand, where a multiyear drought continues, a plant disease and a lack of water resulted in some fields' producing very small amounts of opium, with some farmers losing money on the year's crop. In southern Helmand, the opium crop was very strong, but so many farmers grew it that the market was flooded, officials said.
 The vast majority of profit from opium is believed to go to middlemen, processors and smugglers. Many impoverished Afghans grow it as sharecroppers -- borrowing land, seeds or cash. Lower prices this year may increase their indebtedness.
 Falling prices are also affecting other parts of Helmand's economy. Merchants selling vanity items like satellite phones, televisions and refrigerators have seen sales fall this spring. 
 Ubaidullah, a satellite phone salesman in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, said his phone and international call sales plummeted from roughly $4,000 last spring to $1,000 this spring. 
 ''All the people are depending on opium,'' he said. ''If there was no opium, I don't think I'd have one person coming to make a call.''
 The unlikely winners in Helmand are farmers who looked like fools this winter. Sardar Muhammad, 22, could barely contain his glee last weekend as he explained why he chose to plant cucumbers, tomatoes, potatoes and okra instead of poppies. ''I was thinking no other people grow these things,'' he said. ''So I thought I could make a lot of money.''
 He was right. So many farmers grew opium in the province this year that there is now a shortage of vegetables, according to farmers and shopkeepers. The price of tomatoes, okra and cucumbers have soared, while the price of opium has plummeted.

HEADLINE: Gasoline prices are easing -- but not in California. Should the state step in?

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices have finally started to fall, with the United States average declining by over 13 percent in the last month.
 But California has not been as fortunate as the rest of the country. Prices there are down only 8 cents, and remain the highest in the continental United States.
 Why did gas prices go up so sharply in the spring? Why did they subsequently decline? And why do California gasoline prices stay so stubbornly high? 
 May's surge has been widely attributed to a fear of oil supply disruptions in the Middle East. Skeptics have argued that the possibility of future disruptions should not affect current prices. After all, they argue, the oil used to manufacture the gasoline now being sold at the pump has already been bought and paid for.
 But this economic analysis is flawed. Gasoline is easy to store, so if the price is expected to increase, refiners and shippers will keep more in storage, in anticipation of those higher prices. The resulting reduction in current supply will push prices up now, before any actual shortages materialize.
 That's the way the market should work. If you believed that gasoline would become scarcer in a few weeks, wouldn't you want to economize on use now to ensure a larger supply in the future?
 Luckily, the feared disruptions have not occurred (yet), and prices began to fall at the end of May. In addition to the reduction in worries about oil supply disruptions and the increased oil production from OPEC, increased gasoline imports, particularly from Venezuela, helped drive down prices. According to the Automobile Club of Southern California, ''International refiners are like the cavalry, riding to the rescue of overcharged motorists.''
 Maybe so, but Californians are still getting trampled. Prices in California are 30 cents higher than the national average and much more volatile.
 The economics of the California gasoline market are described in a recent study by Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell and Matthew Lewis of the University of California Energy Institute (www.ucei.org/PDF/csemwp132.pdf).
 The basic problem comes down to supply and demand. California uses a special low-polluting blend of gasoline known as CaRFG (California reformulated gasoline), which is produced by only 13 in-state refineries. In 2003 these refineries produced about 15 billion gallons, a figure almost identical to the 14.8 billion gallons consumed in the state.
 California's production capacity is so closely matched to its demand that even sharp increases in price result in little additional production of gasoline.
 On the other side of the market, the demand for gasoline is also quite insensitive to price: a 10 percent increase in price typically reduces short-term demand by only 2 to 3 percent.
 The result is that even small fluctuations in the demand or supply of CaRFG can lead to large price swings.
 The market forces of supply and demand offer a reasonably convincing explanation as to why the California gasoline market is so volatile. But this may not be the entire story.
 The market is controlled by seven large suppliers, ranging from ChevronTexaco, with a 27 percent share, down to Exxon Mobil, which supplies 8 percent of the market. With only seven suppliers, price manipulation may also be at work.
 When demand is insensitive to price and capacity is more or less fixed, sellers have mixed incentives. When prices rise, a refiner can make an immediate profit by selling more gasoline; if all suppliers sell more, the price is pushed back down. But if a few large companies withhold gasoline supplies, they can keep the price propped up for an extended period.
 The authors of the report are quick to point out that they have no evidence that this has occurred. Indeed, they argue that the basic economics of the industry make it difficult to find such evidence in price and quantity movements alone.
 However, they also point out that the temptation to manipulate price is certainly present, and a prudent response from Sacramento would be to enact policies that will reduce that temptation as much as possible.
 It is important to recognize that it is not illegal under American antitrust laws for a supplier to withhold gasoline or any other commodity. Individual energy companies are free to produce or not produce, store or not store, as they see fit. That is the nature of a free market.
 It is illegal for companies to collude to create an artificial scarcity, but collusion is extremely hard to prove.
 The California economists examine various policy responses that might help reduce price volatility and mitigate the incentives to exercise market power: maintaining a strategic fuel reserve, regulating seasonal changes in gasoline mix, regulating refinery closures and using state gasoline purchases more strategically.
 All these proposals have serious problems. Heavy-handed regulation can easily make supply problems worse rather than better. The goal of policy should be not to displace markets, but to make them work better.
 There is one market-based measure that shows considerable promise. This is to allow the importation of non-CaRFG gasoline into the state when CaRFG is in short supply, as long as the importer pays a tax equal to the difference in cost between CaRFG and non-CaRFG (about 15 cents a gallon).
 When prices in California rise, sellers would then want to import gasoline from out of state, dampening the price increase. Air pollution might go up slightly for a few weeks, but the revenue from the gas tax could be used to finance other environmental measures, like buying back old, polluting cars.
 Not only would this measure help dampen price fluctuations, it would also greatly reduce the temptation to manipulate prices -- since any attempt to push up the price would be met with a flood of imported gasoline. Regardless of whether you believe price spikes result from market forces or market manipulation, increasing gasoline supply when prices rise has got to be a good thing for Californians.

HEADLINE: Fed Fails to Stir Market; Shares End Half Nearly Flat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The stock market was little changed yesterday, despite the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in more than four years. And the market was little changed for the quarter, despite strong corporate earnings and a surge in new jobs that confirmed that the economic recovery was self-sustaining.
 These positives have been offset by the turmoil in Iraq and the threat of higher interest rates, which was confirmed when the Fed raised its target for short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent. 
 A decline in trading volume and a fall in market volatility pointed to an unusual listlessness among both big and small investors, some analysts said. 
 A sudden jump in crucial inflation indicators may also have dampened investor enthusiasm, especially in the bond market. The uncertainty of the presidential election is also holding the stock market back, many analysts said. 
 Fed officials telegraphed yesterday's decision for so long that a stock sell-off was unlikely. And policy makers' reassurances that future interest rate increases will probably be measured was enough to give stocks only a tiny boost in the afternoon.
 Bond investors, however, seemed a bit more positive, in part because Fed officials said that the current increase in inflation appeared to be partly a result of ''transitory factors.'' The Treasury market rally that followed may indicate that the recent rise in Treasury interest rates has gone a little too far. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eked out a 1.3 percent gain for the quarter, while the Dow Jones industrial average inched 0.8 percent higher. The Nasdaq, reflecting the rebound of technology stocks during the quarter, rose 2.7 percent, after slipping slightly in the first quarter.
 For the day, the S.&P. 500 index, which was down about half a point before the announcement from the Fed, rose 4.64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,140.84.
 The Dow, which was off about 17 points before the Fed acted, rose 22.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,435.48.
 The Nasdaq, which was up about 3 points before the Fed announcement, just after 2:15 p.m., finished up 12.86 points, or 0.6 percent higher, at 2,047.79.
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Dow Jones industrial average reached their most recent highs on Feb. 11, and the Nasdaq on Jan. 26. The 140-day pause for the Dow is the eighth longest since 1983, and it will move into seventh place if it holds through Monday.
 In keeping with the signs of economic strength, industrial companies, including Boeing and Goodrich, did the best from April through June, as this sector of the S.&P. 500 index climbed 8 percent.
 The energy sector, helped by higher oil prices, rose 7 percent.
 The threat of higher interest rates was hard on bank and other financial stocks, which dropped 2.9 percent, and on the utilities, which fell 2.3 percent.
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 4.58 percent, from 4.69 percent on Tuesday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 26/32, to 101 10/32.
 Where the stock market goes from here depends in part on how fast and how far the Fed pushes interest rates. That decision is likely to depend on the progress of inflation, which rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate from March through May.
 Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan., said that he thought that the pace of economic growth was beginning to slow somewhat, meaning that ''there will be less concern about the level of inflation.''
 But because of the situation in Iraq and the Middle East and because of uncertainty over the presidential election, he said, the stock market does not have much upside now. ''There will be a move up in the third quarter, but it will not be very strong,'' he said. 
 Another factor is corporate earnings. Although they are now strong, their pace of growth is expected to slow markedly in the quarters ahead.
 The earnings growth forecast of Wall Street analysts for the S.&P. 500 in the second quarter is now 20.5 percent, according to Thomson First Call. 
 But the growth rate is expected to fall to 13.7 percent in the third quarter, 15.3 percent in the fourth quarter and to 7.5 percent in the first quarter of next year.
 The listlessness in the market was reflected in a decline in overall trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange to a daily average for June of 1.3 billion shares, the lowest monthly average since December.
 In addition, the volatility of the stock market recently dropped to its lowest level since 1996, reflecting the scant movement of stocks in one direction or the other from one day to the next. 
 In addition, for the last month, about 50 percent of the trading on the New York Stock Exchange has been in big blocks. That has led William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, to conclude that many individual investors are paying less attention to stocks.
 ''I think institutional trading has been the driving force of what has been going on in the market,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed's Statement Regarding Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to raise its benchmark interest rates for the first time in four years: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 1/4 percent. 
 The committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the inter-meeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved. Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors. 
 The committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. 
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Thomas M. Hoenig; Donald L. Kohn; Cathy E. Minehan; Mark W. Olson; Sandra Pianalto; and William Poole. 
 In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 2 1/4 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Losing Backer Of New Music

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
In January 2003, just 18 months into her tenure as the general director of the San Francisco Opera, Pamela Rosenberg had to grapple with a budget deficit of over $7 million and the worst economic contraction in the Bay Area in 40 years.
 She had been recruited from the Stuttgart Opera in Germany, where she had built an international reputation for championing neglected contemporary fare, like Luigi Nono's cutting-edge ''Intolleranza,'' and commissioning new works. 
 Her board in San Francisco supported her vision of ''Animating Opera,'' as Ms. Rosenberg called a five-year plan to integrate modern classics and new works with older repertory under thematic headings like ''Women Outside of Society: Laws Unto Themselves.'' But given the economic conditions, cutbacks in programming were inevitable. Right? 
 Not so fast, Ms. Rosenberg said. ''We are not going to get through this economic downturn and come out the other end by replacing quality with mediocrity,'' she told me in an interview at the time. ''If we are going to be worthy of people's support, we have to make a difference in people's lives,'' she said, adding that ''challenging art can give people real sustenance'' and make them ''come together and think.''
 Yet one month later, Ms. Rosenberg announced another in a series of budgetary and programming cuts that would eventually result in slashing the company's activities by almost 25 percent. The nonunion staff has been cut 20 percent, and everyone, Ms. Rosenberg included, took a pay reduction. Even the musicians gave ground in contract negotiations. From typically presenting some 11 or 12 productions a year, the company will offer only 9 until further notice.
 This week the American-born Ms. Rosenberg announced that she had decided not to renew her contract and would step down in July 2006. She wants to return to Germany, where her grown twin sons and two grandchildren live and where she might find a position at a state-subsidized house allowing her to focus on developing new work rather than raising money.
 Her only fear is that the cutbacks and her premature departure will be taken as evidence that challenging artistic programming is bad for business. Actually, she said, operagoers in San Francisco have mostly taken to her vision, and box office receipts support her. 
 ''There has been no downside to our programming,'' she said in a recent interview. She had thought several seasons would be required to win acceptance of the contemporary works the company routinely offers. For example, the summer segment of its season, which ends on Sunday, has offered Puccini's ''Boheme,'' Janacek's fable ''The Cunning Little Vixen'' and Ferruccio Busoni's visionary ''Doktor Faust,'' completed in 1924. Only one staple. 
 ''The audience has come along beautifully,'' she said. ''It's been very surprising.'' The unfamiliar and new works have sold no worse than the standards and often better. For example, in the fall of 2002 the company presented the North American stage premiere of Messiaen's ecstatic and formidably complex five-hour opera ''Saint Francois d'Assise'' in a riveting modern production conducted with compelling authority by Donald Runnicles, the company's music director. 
 The performance I attended remains one of the great nights I have ever had in an opera house. The run of six performances sold better than Puccini's ''Turandot,'' which was playing at the same time, with Jane Eaglen in the title role. The last three performances of the Messiaen sold out, with lines out the door hoping for tickets. And Karl O. Mills, the president of the company and a staunch Rosenberg supporter, who found the Messiaen transcendent, attended four complete performances and half of a fifth.
 Ms. Rosenberg's programming has hardly been radical. Next season offers diverse works, from Verdi's popular ''La Traviata'' to Britten's powerful ''Billy Budd,'' and rarities like Bizet's ''Pearl Fishers.'' But the big event, and for me the most intriguing offering of all American opera companies next season, will be the United States premiere of Gyorgy Ligeti's musically audacious, apocalyptic ''Grand Macabre'' in a production from the Royal Danish Opera. 
 How can the Metropolitan Opera, supposedly America's leading company, have left it to San Francisco to introduce these major works by Messiaen and Ligeti in the United States? Since its 1978 premiere in Stockholm, the Ligeti opera has had 13 productions in Europe.
 Ms. Rosenberg has also commissioned the composer John Adams to write ''Doctor Atomic,'' based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a work that will reunite Mr. Adams with the librettist Alice Goodman and the director Peter Sellars, his collaborators from ''Nixon in China.'' The opera will have its premiere in the fall of 2005.
 Is there something about San Francisco audiences that makes them more open to experiment? Michael Tilson Thomas has turned the San Francisco Symphony into the most adventurous American orchestra and attracted new and eager audiences. By contrast, the Met and the New York Philharmonic seem as inextricably tied to their august and weighty heritages. Ms. Rosenberg, in a sense, has been freer to take more chances.
 She would have taken more had the economic problems not been so debilitating. The cutbacks that have really hurt, she said, have come out of programming. A production of Weber's fairy-tale opera ''Der Freischutz,'' which would have been a San Francisco first, had to be canceled. The most significant cut has affected what Ms. Rosenberg dubbed ''The Faust Project.'' This three-part offering, which began with Berlioz's ''Damnation of Faust'' and continues with the current production of Busoni's ''Doktor Faust,'' was to have culminated in a future season with four one-act operas, all to be commissioned, that would be performed on two evenings. So far only one of those, ''Earthrise'' by Lewis Spratlan, has been commissioned, composed and tried out in a workshop at the opera house. No other commissions have been made, and a production of Mr. Spratlan's work is not scheduled. 
 You can't blame Ms. Rosenberg, who is 59, for wanting to return to Europe. She went from Stuttgart, where 85 percent of the house's budget was state-subsidized, to San Francisco, where support from the state and the city accounts for 2 percent of the budget. She would like to spend her 60's ''in a situation,'' as she put it, where she can develop new work.
 Might that situation be the Metropolitan Opera? Joseph Volpe, the general manager, will step down in 2006, the same year as Ms. Rosenberg. ''That's not what I want,'' she said. And the Met would probably not want her. She's too risky.
 But at the Met as elsewhere, administrators had better start taking some risks. The status quo is not working. And despite the financial setbacks in San Francisco, Ms. Rosenberg has offered a model of how to do this.

HEADLINE: TXU SPENDS $797 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The TXU Corporation, the biggest power producer in Texas, bought back 20 million shares at Tuesday's closing price of $39.86 each in a step toward reducing its debt by $4 billion this year. The $797.2 million repurchase will make up for most of the dilution to earnings per share from TXU's plan to issue 21.2 million shares for retirement of debt convertible to common stock, the company said. TXU, which is based in Dallas, wants to retire $1.02 billion in equity-linked debt that has interest rates as high as 8.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Business Index Shows Slower Growth in Midwest

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 30 

 BODY:
Business in the Midwest expanded at a slower pace in June, hit by a slowdown in auto sales, a report showed Wednesday. The unexpectedly severe drop in the Chicago purchasing managers' index to an eight-month low echoed monthly declines in durable goods orders in April and May. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer slid to 56.4 in June, from a 16-year high of 68 in May, and was at its lowest since October. Economists had forecast the index at 65. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. 
 The Chicago survey is often seen as a litmus test for factory production, although both manufacturing and service industries are surveyed. 
 The Midwest region builds about 40 percent of the nation's motor vehicles and is a major producer of steel and farm equipment. 
 ''Motor vehicle sales are slowing and I think that this probably contributed to the sharp drop in production that we saw in June,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. 
 The General Motors Corporation said this week that light vehicle sales would total a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.3 million in June, down from 16.5 million a year ago. 
 Outside of the auto sector, major retail chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Target have warned recently of weaker-than-expected June sales. 
 In the Chicago report, the production and new-orders components fell heavily, although the employment measure showed a third consecutive month of growth. The prices-paid component jumped to its highest since August 1988, a sign of inflationary pressures that are starting to plague the economy. 
 ''What bothers me most is the drop-off in production and new orders,'' said David A. Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. ''Durable orders have been dropping. The purchasing managers may be finally figuring out what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Philippine Leader Promises to Create More Jobs 

BYLINE: By CARLOS H. CONDE

DATELINE: MANILA, June 30 

 BODY:
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, sworn in as the 14th president of the Philippines on Wednesday, promised to create up to 10 million jobs in the next six years, balance the budget, improve tax collection, provide cheap medicine for the poor and unite a nation that has not quite settled down since it ousted the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos almost two decades ago.
 ''Our nation must embrace a vision of economic opportunity, social cohesion and always an ever democratic faith,'' Mrs. Arroyo said in her inaugural speech here on Wednesday morning. 
 Mrs. Arroyo and her vice president, Noli de Castro, then flew to Cebu City, in the central Philippines, for the oath-taking ceremony. 
 A street party, with about a thousand barbecue stands to be put up on a major highway, was scheduled in Cebu for Wednesday evening, a departure from the more formal celebrations of previous inaugurations.
 Mrs. Arroyo, 57, a former vice president who rose to the presidency in 2001 when President Joseph Estrada was ousted, said her administration would create jobs. ''When I step down six years from now I shall have created more than 6 million jobs, perhaps even 10 million jobs,'' she said.
 She also promised to provide loans to three million entrepreneurs; create a million agriculture-based businesses; provide power and potable water to every village; put every child in school; decongest Manila; develop Subic and Clark, the former United States military bases, into important Asian economic hubs; computerize the election process; forge a peace agreement with insurgents; and provide cheap medicine and affordable housing.
 She said she would balance the budget by collecting taxes more efficiently and by going after tax evaders and corrupt officials.
 Fitch Ratings on Wednesday warned the Philippines of a possible ratings downgrade if Mrs. Arroyo failed to raise taxes and solve financial problems at National Power Corporation, the state-owned and debt-ridden utility. 
 But analysts say another concern is how to calm a divisive political climate. Since the fall of Mr. Marcos in 1986, successive administrations have been too distracted by politics and adventurism within the military that they failed to put the Philippines, once the region's strongest economy, back on track.

HEADLINE: Commissioner Of Labor, And, Yes, A Workhorse

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Whether the mayor's name is Beame or Bloomberg, commissioners in New York City's government typically last in office three or four years, and rarely more than six years. 
 But James F. Hanley has become the city's marathon man, serving as labor commissioner -- easily one of the city's most contentious, most stressful posts -- for 15 years, except for a brief spell as deputy commissioner. And he has managed to survive as commissioner under three very different mayors, during trying budget conditions.
 Mr. Hanley has endured by repeatedly performing the labor negotiator's equivalent of pulling rabbits out of a hat. He has reached deal after complicated deal with unions representing 300,000 municipal workers, all without angering hard-to-please mayors and labor leaders. 
 And recently he scored a coup, and saved New Yorkers many millions of dollars, by negotiating a deal with the largest municipal union, District Council 37, that calls for a raise of 5 percent over three years, including sizable givebacks, most notably reduced starting salaries for new workers.
 But fresh off that, he now faces what could be his trickiest balancing act of all: negotiating a contract with the city's teachers, police and firefighters, powerful and outspoken unions that feel badly shortchanged. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is demanding that they accept terms like those negotiated with D.C. 37, but the unions insist they deserve considerably more. They want raises of more than 10 percent over three years without granting any concessions, saying the city owes them for their good work, especially with the city's economy and budget picture improving.
 Making Mr. Hanley's job even tougher, Mr. Bloomberg has told him to agree to raises only if the unions agree to money-saving concessions to help pay for those raises, an idea these unions view as insulting. As evidenced by a series of strikes and protests in June over the lack of progress in contract talks, this could be a very hot summer for Mr. Hanley.
 ''He has one of the most important jobs in the city because labor costs are more than half of what the city spends every year,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch, who made him his first deputy labor commissioner in 1988, the year before Mr. Hanley was first promoted to commissioner by Mayor David N. Dinkins. ''He's the guy,'' Mr. Koch added. ''He ultimately brings things to the dotted line, because he either puts the city into greater debt or makes it possible for the city to survive.''
 Mr. Hanley, now 55, insisted that he was unperturbed by the recent labor unrest, including a June 8 demonstration at City Hall by tens of thousands of teachers, police officers and firefighters. As always, he said he would not let the outside commotion influence him, although he is shrewd enough not to let on if it did.
 ''Demonstrations are for the most part a feel-good thing for the union membership,'' he said. ''I've seen a lot of demonstrations over the years, but I've never seen one of them have any effect on the collective bargaining process.''
 If there is a secret to Mr. Hanley's longevity as commissioner, it is that he knows how to serve his boss while managing not to totally anger and alienate the union leaders he battles day after day. Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg hired him as commissioner partly on the recommendation of several union leaders. 
 ''I've done countless agreements with him,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''I find him to be tough. But he's someone I like working with -- and against. He's honest and he knows his craft.''
 Having a sense of humor amid all the discord has certainly helped. Mr. Hanley, at 6 feet 5 inches, with a megaphone voice and down-to-earth manner, tells of an incident in 1993 when several dozen firefighters were protesting outside his Staten Island home, chanting: ''Hanley must go. We want our money.''
 When Mr. Hanley went outside to talk with them, he recommended that they adopt a more poetic chant. The protesters quickly changed to his proposal, chanting: ''Hanley must go. We want our dough.''
 He also recalls one not-so-humorous story, when firefighters, seething about not having a contract, went to his house and cursed him out in front of his children.
 Randy Levine, a longtime labor negotiator who was first deputy mayor under Rudolph W. Giuliani and is now president of the Yankees, said a sense of humor was one of many attributes that make Mr. Hanley effective.
 ''He's very steady,'' Mr. Levine said. ''He has earned everyone's respect. He's got a great sense of humor. He has great institutional knowledge. He knows how to lose his temper for effect. Using baseball parlance, he's a good pitcher -- he has a good fastball, good curve and good changeup.''
 Mr. Hanley, a Staten Island native and the son of a municipal truck driver, sometimes talks as if he was born for this job. His parents died when he was a teenager, so during his years at St. Peter's College in Jersey City he took a job as a union electrician. He worked on the World Trade Center, and in his office is a photo of a long-haired, far thinner version of himself, working on the towers' upper floors. 
 He left construction to teach in Harlem and pursue a master's degree in labor economics at the New School. Fascinated by labor, he went to work at the Office of Labor Relations in 1972 as a junior researcher. He said the city's recent budget crisis was nothing like 1975, when the city nearly went bankrupt, saved in large part by union concessions.
 ''Through the bargaining process, we were able to get through this and provide some stability,'' he said.
 Mr. Hanley acknowledges that some friends think he is a masochist to do a job that is a never-ending tug of war with union leaders who always want more and mayors who always want him to give less.
 ''Ben Ward used to say when he was police commissioner, 'I really don't understand why you like doing what you do,''' Mr. Hanley said. '''If you're trying to squeeze a mayor or commissioner to be more generous, they have to hate you. If you try to squeeze a union, they have to hate you.'''
 At the moment, Mr. Hanley is following Mayor Bloomberg's orders to try to squeeze the city's unions. Mr. Hanley criticized the teachers, police and firefighters who are demanding more than the 5 percent received by District Council 37. 
 ''They already get paid more than D.C. 37's members,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''If they want to get raises higher than D.C. 37, we're perfectly open and willing to discuss how to do that through increased productivity.''
 Teachers union officials say Mr. Hanley played a huge role in negotiating their last contract, in which teachers received a more generous wage package than most city unions after the union agreed to 100 more minutes of work each week. 
 While Mr. Bloomberg pressed Albany to provide money for raises, Ms. Weingarten and Mr. Hanley haggled over how to use the extra 100 minutes and the city's demands for faster procedures to fire incompetent teachers.
 According to Ms. Weingarten, Mayor Bloomberg wanted to control how the 100 extra minutes would be used, while the union demanded that the time be used for teacher training and small group instruction.
 One weekend, Ms. Weingarten and Mr. Hanley negotiated past midnight on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Mr. Hanley, union officials say, helped convince the mayor that the teachers would never agree to a deal if the city continued to insist on having total control over how the 100 minutes were used. Ultimately the two sides compromised; schools could devote the 100 minutes to classroom instruction, small group instruction or teacher training.
 Most labor leaders heap praise on Mr. Hanley because they like him, respect him and feel they can trust his word. In interviews, only a handful criticized him, but none on the record, for fear of souring future deals.
 One official in the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association angrily accused Mr. Hanley of deliberately delaying negotiations. This official said Mr. Hanley had stalled to ensure that D.C. 37 -- which is not able to make as strong a case for raises as the teachers and police -- would sign the first major contract in the hope of setting a low wage pattern for other unions.
 Mr. Hanley insisted that union leaders were the ones who usually did the stalling. He did not hide his impatience with union leaders, most notably for the police, who seek to settle contracts through outside arbitrators rather than at the bargaining table.
 ''Typically people sit back and do very little and when one union settles; no matter what they settle for, all the others criticize it,'' Mr. Hanley said. ''It's easier to ask for some third-party intervention than to roll up your sleeves and try, under trying circumstances, to get the best deal you can at the bargaining table.''
 When Mr. Bloomberg was elected, several veteran labor negotiators said, he was unsure whether to reappoint Mr. Hanley. But the mayor stuck with him. 
 ''I reached out to a number of union leaders, and they had nothing but good things to say about him,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It wasn't because they thought they could ride roughshod over him. Quite the contrary. They really think they're better off with someone who is smart and honest and represents me, so that when he's at the table he's not off on his own. He knows in general terms where he should be going, what's right for the city and what's right for the municipal work force.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Backs Pataki on Converting 9/11 Aid

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will support Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to use billions of dollars in unspent Sept. 11 aid on building a rail link to connect the former World Trade Center site to the Long Island Rail Road and Kennedy International Airport, the mayor's aides said yesterday.
 Mr. Pataki has personally lobbied President Bush, a fellow Republican, to provide hard cash in place of a $5 billion tax-break package that Washington established to help spur construction in Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks. 
 In a news conference at City Hall yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg, also a Republican, told reporters he welcomed the governor's efforts. He also noted that other New York officials -- including Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff and Senator Charles E. Schumer -- had already been urging Congress to convert about $2 billion in unused tax breaks into cash.
 ''I'm glad to see that he's on board,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, referring to Mr. Pataki. ''This is a coordinated effort from everybody and my hope is that down the road, Congress will do it.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides noted that the mayor himself had raised the issue of converting the tax breaks into cash with Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday night when the two men attended a political dinner in Manhattan.
 The project envisioned by the governor would be completed in 2013. It involves digging a tunnel under the East River as part of a rail link from downtown to Kennedy Airport and points east along the Long Island Rail Road.
 In a letter to Mr. Bush on Monday, Mr. Pataki argued that the project would help revitalize Lower Manhattan by enabling businesses there to attract workers from Long Island who now have to take both a train and a subway to get downtown. He also said it would provide direct access to the airport from Manhattan.
 Mr. Pataki's decision to make a personal appeal to Mr. Bush drew praise even from New York Democrats, who have often accused the governor of refusing to publicly fight on behalf of New York when the state's interests came in conflict with the goals of his Republican allies in Washington.
 In a statement, Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, suggested that Mr. Pataki's direct appeal to the president could bolster the efforts that he and city officials have undertaken to secure dollars in place of the tax breaks. ''We're glad that the governor has written the White House, and we are hoping the president will now support increasing that amount,'' he said.
 Mr. Schumer noted that the Senate had already passed a measure that would convert about $200 million in tax breaks for Lower Manhattan into cash. That measure was contained in a national economic stimulus package, the senator's aides said.
 The House passed a similar package, but it did not include any provision to convert tax breaks into cash for Lower Manhattan, according to Mr. Schumer's office. The two chambers are seeking to reconcile the bills, and the fate of the New York provision is unclear.
 The tax breaks, known as the Liberty Zone package, have been controversial from the start, with some New York politicians, economists and real estate interests questioning their value and arguing that Lower Manhattan has needed a large infusion of cash from Washington.

HEADLINE: A Move by the Fed

 BODY:
Well, it's a start. Yesterday the Federal Reserve Board raised its important short-term interest rate by a mere quarter point, to 1.25 percent from its half-century low, 1 percent. The belated move still leaves Alan Greenspan and his colleagues with much work to do, as they are still in real danger of falling behind the inflationary curve. To be responsible, the Fed will have to disregard the calendar and keep raising rates in a presidential election season. 
 The remarkably cheap credit of the last few years has been a boon to American homeowners and consumers, one that helped stave off a more severe recession. But these rates are essentially an emergency stimulus, which is incompatible with the current healthy state of the economy. Economists say that a neutral rate, one at which the Fed is neither trying to stimulate the economy nor applying the brakes, would be in the range of 3 to 4 percent. Before yesterday, the Fed had cut the rate 13 times since the dot-com bubble burst, pulling it down to 1 percent from 6.5 percent.
 Inflation, though mild, is making a comeback, and should be countered by a more powerful antidote than the Fed's free money -- its interest rate is still negative, in real terms. It's hard to cheer a central bank's move to make it cost more to borrow money, but central banks must act like stern parents who weather their children's criticism because they know there's good reason to impose discipline. Among the worst things that can happen is for the markets to conclude that the Fed isn't firmly in charge and intent on keeping inflation at bay.
 In a strengthening global economy, prices for raw materials are soaring, and businesses are feeling as if they can modestly raise prices. The falling value of the dollar -- attribute that in part to the Bush administration's disastrous fiscal policies -- is also exerting inflationary pressure by driving up the price of imports.
 The lagging recovery in the labor market helps explain Mr. Greenspan's restraint. Employers started hiring again in earnest only recently, and wages are just starting to increase significantly. The impressive gains in productivity have mostly fueled corporate profits -- up 41 percent since the recession ended more than two years ago, compared with a 6.3 percent bump for wages. 
 Wages tend to trail profits in the initial stages of an expansion, so the hope is that paychecks will improve further as unemployment declines. The bullish consumer sentiment in recent surveys suggests that people are counting on that. What they have to stop counting on is the Fed's free money.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE RAISES KEY RATE A QUARTER POINT

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time in four years, officially signaling that a remarkable period of historically low rates is drawing to a close.
 But even as it increased the cost of borrowing for financial institutions on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, it sought to soothe investors by saying that inflationary pressures remained low and that further rate increases should come at a ''measured'' pace.
 The Fed's statement was a relief for many on Wall Street, as well as for home buyers, who will be able to get mortgages at comparatively low rates for at least a few more months.
 It also appears to be good news for President Bush. Even though the Fed is expected to keep increasing interest rates as the November elections approach, the economic impact of those increases is likely to be mild until at least sometime next year. 
 But some of the Fed's growing chorus of critics on Wall Street warned that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, might have waited too long to start raising rates. That could force the central bank to play catch-up in tightening monetary policy in the months ahead to prevent inflation from re-emerging as a serious economic threat. [Page C1.] 
 For now, though, any rate increases are likely to be mild. Mortgage rates, which had already climbed noticeably in anticipation of the Fed's decision, may not rise appreciably in the days ahead. Because Mr. Greenspan and other top officials had telegraphed their intentions months in advance, yields on long-term Treasury securities, which directly affect mortgage rates, actually declined slightly after the Fed's announcement.
 The stock market also took the move in stride, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 10,435.48, up just more than 22 points.
 ''This was exactly what they had advertised, and I think the markets were reassured,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.
 Both President Bush and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, reacted cautiously to the Fed's announcement.
 Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the rate increase merely reflected the economy's strength. ''As the economy grows and jobs are being created,'' he said, ''I think it's always expected that a rate increase would be part of that strengthening in the economy.''
 Mr. Kerry's campaign refrained from commenting on the central bank's decision, but accused Mr. Bush of setting the stage for higher interest rates in the future by allowing the federal budget deficit to swell. 
 ''Over the long term,'' said Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to Mr. Kerry, ''economists estimate that Bush's fiscal policies would raise long-term interest rates by about 1 percentage point higher, meaning that a typical family would have to pay $1,200 more for a home mortgage each year and $120 more for a student loan each year.''
 ''The higher debt passed on to our children and the higher long-term interest costs working families and American businesses will bear amount to a Bush debt tax that will require a new economic strategy,'' Mr. Sperling added.
 Mr. Greenspan, a Republican, has himself warned that rising federal deficits will ultimately contribute to higher interest rates and could pose a threat to the nation's long-term economic health.
 But Mr. Greenspan's immediate preoccupation is to be on guard for signs of rising inflation. Echoing those recent statements, the central bank left itself ample room to apply tougher economic medicine if those signs multiply.
 ''They are buying themselves flexibility,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now president of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm in St. Louis. ''They are saying, 'We will go at a measured pace unless we don't.'''
 In devising what it hopes is a gradual retreat from the easy-money policies of the last several years, the Fed is striving for what policy makers used to call a ''soft landing.'' The goal is to head off a resurgence of inflationary pressures without provoking financial disruptions or an economic downturn.
 The remarkably low interest rates of recent years, which fell to a level not seen since the late 1950's, reflected Mr. Greenspan's determination to ward off the shocks to the economy caused by recession, terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq. But economic growth started to surge last summer, and job creation finally began to accelerate this spring.
 Investors had assumed for months that the Fed would announce a quarter-point rate increase on Wednesday, at the end of its two-day policy meeting. Fed officials have made it clear that this will be the start of a series of regular rate increases that could easily last through the end of 2005. 
 The big question now is how fast that process will proceed and how far it will go. The primary factors are likely to be the pace of consumer price increases in the months ahead and the speed at which unemployment declines.
 Mr. Greenspan's goal, though he has never officially stated it, has been to keep the underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile areas like food and energy, under about 2 percent a year but not so low that it threatens to turn to actual deflation, or falling prices.
 Fed officials were clearly startled when the core inflation rate climbed at an annual rate of more than 3 percent in March and April, but many officials contended that the fundamental trend was more sedate.
 The central bank reiterated that view in its statement on Wednesday. ''Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors,'' the Fed said.
 Fed officials still want to see the unemployment rate decline from its current level of 5.6 percent. Even though the United States has added nearly 1.4 million jobs since last August, that is still barely half the number of jobs lost since the start of 2001.
 Fed officials have long asserted that the economy still has considerable slack in the form of unemployed workers and unused factory capacity. But its statement Wednesday omitted any reference to economic slack. Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said that was ''not a surprise but nonetheless an indication that the committee is a bit more concerned than they were'' about inflationary pressures.
 In contrast to its practice in 1994, when the central bank raised rates much more abruptly than investors had been expecting, Fed officials have been telegraphing the arrival of higher rates for months.
 After its policy meeting in January, the central bank dropped its open-ended commitment to keep interest rates low for ''a considerable period'' and said instead that it would be ''patient.'' In May, the Fed implied that rate increases were imminent but said the pace was ''likely to be measured.''
 Indeed, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes climbed by nearly a full percentage point in April and May. Mortgage rates climbed noticeably, as well, leading immediately to a sharp decline in home refinancings and producing a slight cooling effect in some housing markets.
 Fed officials were openly pleased, contending that the markets had already begun to do much of their job for them in advance. 
 ''I think the Fed had to lay the groundwork because of the very ugly experience of 1994, when they did not prepare the groundwork,'' said Gregory R. Valliere, an economist at Schwab Soundview Capital Markets in Washington. ''They really wanted to avoid catching the markets off balance.''
 Many economists predict that the so-called measured pace of rate increases means a long series of baby steps, generally a quarter-point at a time, that would eventually lift the federal funds rate from its current level of 1.25 percent to more than 4 percent by the end of 2005.
 But that plan could be disrupted if inflation continues to climb faster than expected. 
 Mr. Greenspan and other top Fed officials have warned that they will ratchet up the pace of rate increases if their own prediction of mild inflation appears to be wrong.
 ''Our general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a concern in the period ahead,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee on June 15. But ''forecasts are subject to error,'' he added. ''And if our judgment as to how the economy is going to evolve and how inflation is going to evolve turns out to be mistaken, we will change.''
 Josh Feinman, an economist at Deutsche Asset Management in New York, said that the Fed had given itself some wiggle room. ''They think they will be able to move in this gradual, measured way,'' he said. ''But a zillion things could happen that they can't anticipate, and they need to stand ready. They don't want to say anything that constrains their ability to act in the future.''

HEADLINE: Those Were the Days

BYLINE: By Bruce Bartlett. 
Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, worked in the White House under President , Ronald Reagan and in the Treasury Department under President George H. W. Bush.

DATELINE: GREAT FALLS, Va. 

 BODY:
The death of Ronald Reagan led many of his liberal opponents to reassess his presidency, with some concluding that it was better than they thought at the time. The publication of Bill Clinton's memoir, meanwhile, has led many conservatives to reassess his presidency -- and most have concluded that it was as awful as they remembered.
 If they were honest with themselves, however, conservatives would view the Clinton presidency the same way many liberals now view the Reagan years. Just as Ronald Reagan was not as bad as many liberals thought, neither was Bill Clinton as bad as many conservatives think. 
 Like most conservatives, I thought Bill Clinton was a terrible president when he was in office. Especially after the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, we all dreamed of the paradise that would be ours if we could just get a Republican in the White House. We could fix the budget and the tax system, rein in the bureaucracy, neuter the trade unions and trial lawyers, and do all those other things that could never be done because Democrats were always blocking the way.
 It was foolish to think like this, of course, just as it is foolish for Democrats to think that every mistake President George W. Bush has made would have been avoided if Al Gore had won in 2000. Circumstances beyond any president's control determine much of what he does in office. If Mr. Gore had won, there would have still been a recession in 2001 that would have caused much of the surplus to disappear, even if there had been no tax cuts. And in all likelihood, the attacks on the World Trade Center would have happened, too.
 Yet presidents are not impotent. Sometimes their impact comes from what they don't do, rather than what they do. Sometimes the most important thing a president can do is resist the demand or temptation to act when the right course is to do nothing. And sometimes a president is forced to do things against his will. In the end, however, a president can be judged only by what actually happens on his watch; not by what he thought or intended or by what he might have done but wasn't able to.
 On this basis, conservatives should rethink the Clinton presidency. At least on economic policy, there is much to praise and little to criticize in terms of what was actually done (or not done) on his watch.
 Bringing the federal budget into surplus is obviously an achievement. After inheriting a deficit of 4.7 percent of gross domestic product in 1992, Mr. Clinton turned this into a surplus of 2.4 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 -- a remarkable turnaround that can be appreciated by realizing that this year's deficit, as large as it is, will reach only 4.2 percent of G.D.P., according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 More important, from a conservative point of view, Mr. Clinton achieved his surplus in large part by curtailing spending. Federal spending fell to 18.4 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 from 22.2 percent in 1992. Although he raised taxes in 1993, he cut them in 1997. He even reduced the capital gains tax -- something his predecessor, George H. W. Bush, tried but failed to accomplish.
 Although much of the budgetary savings came from lower defense spending and reduced interest on the debt, entitlement spending also fell to 10.6 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 from 11.5 percent in 1992. Mr. Clinton signed welfare reform into law in 1996, the only time in American history when an entitlement program was abolished. By virtually all accounts, welfare reform has been a success.
 Mr. Clinton was also steadfast in his support for free trade. It is doubtful that anyone else could have persuaded Congress to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement. On monetary policy, he reappointed Alan Greenspan, a Republican, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, thereby helping to bring inflation down to its lowest sustained level in a generation.
 By contrast, Mr. Clinton's Republican successor has caused the surplus to evaporate, raised total federal spending by 1.6 percent of G.D.P., established a new entitlement program for prescription drugs and adopted the most protectionist trade policy since Herbert Hoover. While President Bush has done other things that conservatives view more favorably, like cutting taxes, there is no getting around the reality that Mr. Clinton was better in many respects.
 The fact that Mr. Clinton accomplished conservative objectives against his will in some cases, and in others only because a Republican Congress prevented him from enacting more liberal reforms, is beside the point. What matters is what actually was accomplished while Mr. Clinton was in office. On that score, he did much that conservatives should approve of.

HEADLINE: As Greenspan Chases Inflation, Critics Shout, 'Faster!'

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Inflation and market interest rates are far ahead of Alan Greenspan's federal funds rate, which he raised yesterday to 1.25 percent. Now the nation will see how well Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, plays the game of catch-up. 
 Fears that Mr. Greenspan has opened wide the door to inflation in the United States by keeping interest rates too low for too long prompted a sell-off in the bond market recently. That has pushed short- and long-term rates far above the federal funds rate and produced the worst quarter for bond investors in almost 25 years. 
 Since falling to 3.68 percent in March, yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen nearly a point, to 4.58 percent yesterday. Yields on two-year Treasuries have risen to 2.69 percent from 1.46 in March. 
 When inflation outruns a central banker, price increases on goods and services not only take hold, they tend to feed on themselves, rising ever higher. Inflation is exceedingly difficult to bring under control once it has gained a foothold. 
 So it came as a surprise to some economists and portfolio managers that Fed policy makers thumbed their nose at inflation worries in the statement accompanying the rate increase. ''Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors,'' the policy makers said. 
 That is not the opinion of Alan W. Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen in New York. ''We believe that inflation has returned,'' Mr. Kral said. ''And the cause of it has been an overexpansive monetary policy for almost 10 years.''
 As a result, many say that Mr. Greenspan has two battles to fight: one against inflation and one against the view that he has been far too accommodating in keeping interest rates low. 
 ''I believe the Fed is behind the curve because the economy continues to be strong and the inflation rate is creeping up and will continue to creep up,'' said Henry Kaufman, an economist in New York. Its plan to raise interest rates gradually may be good for the economy, he said, ''but is not designed to put the system back into balance in terms of constraining inflation itself.'' 
 For weeks, the Fed has broadcast its intention to raise interest rates glacially, so yesterday's move surprised no one. Some economists said the Fed's approach was appropriate given the economic indicators. ''There are good reasons for this gradual approach in 2004,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis. ''With the declining price of oil, economic fundamentals, including productivity and global competition, will keep inflation in check.''
 In the statement accompanying the interest rate increase, the central bank acknowledged that the economy showed strength, and it ended by saying that it would ''respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.''
 But many view the Fed's extremely measured approach to curbing inflation, which is running at a rate of 2.9 percent so far this year, as a mistake. Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said such a tack allowed for too much inflationary pressure to build before meaningful brakes were finally applied. 
 Mr. Kasriel points to the past for evidence of what can happen when the Fed begins to raise rates well after inflation has taken hold. He identified two other periods during which the Fed began to increase rates when the Fed funds rate was in negative territory, adjusted for inflation, as it is now. Each time -- in March 1971 and July 1980 -- inflation soon took off with a vengeance. 
 ''Everyone recognizes that holding the Fed funds rate below the inflation rate is a recipe for accelerating inflation because it creates an incentive for people to go out and buy things and finance them at relatively low rates,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That act tends to drive the prices of those goods and services even faster. That was the predicament the Fed got itself into in the 1970's and spent a long time remedying. Now the Fed is in the early stages of squandering some of the gains that chairman Volcker made in eliminating inflation during the 80's.''
 Mr. Kasriel said he thought the Fed would be forced to abandon its measured approach to interest rate increases early next year when inflation pressures become undeniable. 
 The stock market barely reacted to the rate increase; the Dow Jones industrial average closed the day up 22.05 points. Bonds rallied, pushing yields on the 10-year Treasury down to 4.58 from 4.69 on Tuesday.
 Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he was surprised that investors seemed so optimistic about the Fed's move because corporate profits were no longer rising. A study of history, Mr. Bernstein added, indicates that financial disruptions have followed periods when the Fed raised rates while corporate profits slowed. 
 There have been only three times during Mr. Greenspan's tenure when rates rose while profits weakened, Mr. Bernstein said, and each ended badly. The first was followed by the recession of 1990-91; another such period preceded the financial crises of the summer of 1998; and finally, a period of rising rates and falling profits culminated in the collapse of the stock market bubble in 2000.
 ''Every time that profits growth has peaked out, people say it doesn't matter, and every time the Fed has started raising rates people say it doesn't matter,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''But every time it has mattered. The combination played a major role in terms of getting investors to be more risk averse. So to me it is a little remarkable that people are so sanguine about this.''

HEADLINE: What a Rate Increase Can't Hide

BYLINE: By Steven Rattner. 
Steven Rattner is managing principal at the Quadrangle Group, a private investment firm.

 BODY:
If history is any guide, yesterday's interest rate increase of one-quarter percentage point by the Federal Reserve -- the first rise in four years -- will be just the first nudge up the incline of higher rates. The question is not whether rates will continue to go up, but how far and how fast.
 Based on futures pricing, the bond market casino is betting on an additional percentage point (in Wall Street lingo, 100 basis points) over the balance of this year. But the unpredictability of factors that can affect interest rates means that no one, including Alan Greenspan, knows whether that bet will prove optimistic or pessimistic. 
 Some of what drives rates is beyond our reach. For example, when oil or other commodities spike, the Fed often responds with higher rates to prevent inflation from surging.
 But other factors are well within our ability to control. Central to low interest rates -- particularly long-term rates -- is keeping down federal borrowing. All the debt that Washington incurs to finance our federal budget deficit pushes interest rates higher than they otherwise would be.
 Some challenge that theory, particularly proponents of tax cuts, who have worked energetically to dismiss the link between interest rates and government borrowing. As proof, they note that interest rates have stayed low even in the face of mounting deficits.
 But that argument falters when you look more closely. When adjusted for the minimal inflation of recent years, interest rates have not been as low as they were during some other periods of slow growth. And although they were low, they would have been lower still with less borrowing. It's basic economics: When we want more of something, the price goes up. To deny that is to believe that the market for borrowing money is somehow different from all other markets.
 Projected high deficits -- which we certainly have now -- can be as important as existing ones. A survey by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center of studies by leading academic economists found that 13 of the 18 papers had concluded that large anticipated deficits pushed interest rates higher. Four saw mixed effects and only one found no effect. Other research suggests that if the budget were balanced, long-term interest rates would be one to two percentage points lower.
 Some experts suggest that in today's global capital markets, the impact of our deficits on interest rates is muted. Still, even R. Glenn Hubbard, President Bush's first chief economic adviser, has acknowledged in his research that a link remains.
 When interest rates go up, business investment goes down, according to almost any basic economic textbook, including one written by N. Gregory Mankiw, President Bush's chief economic adviser. And higher rates inflict damage on consumers not only by making mortgage costs higher, but also by depressing the value of important assets, including their homes. 
 Increased government borrowing, with its pernicious effect on interest rates, can, of course, result from either lower revenues or higher spending. By now, the enormous Bush tax cuts are familiar, but less attention has been paid to how they affect interest rates. Had the tax relief been more of an anti-recessionary, one-time nature, it would be phasing out now and increasing the likelihood of lower interest rates -- in a sense, the best form of tax cut -- for longer. 
 Still less familiar, perhaps, is the sorry record of the Bush years on spending: faster growth of discretionary outlays -- a 33 percent increase even when the military is excluded -- than during Clinton's first three years, when non-military spending grew by 8 percent. To be sure, some of the new spending that President Bush has urged is in popular areas like education and domestic security. But isn't it his job to find offsetting reductions elsewhere so that the government will live within its means?
 In addition, the president has yet to veto his first bill or to publicly pressure or scold his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill for their lack of fiscal restraint. By contrast, conservative policy organizations have been pummeling the Bush administration for what the Heritage Foundation calls ''a spending spree.'' Congress has been larding up legislation with local projects -- for trails, visitors centers, marina repairs and planning grants by the dozen.
 Business gets at least its share; for example, bills passed by the House and Senate to replace an export program that was ruled illegal have been slathered with provisions ranging from a $9.6 billion buyout for tobacco growers to $8 million in tax breaks for the archery industry. One House member called it ''an orgy of self-indulgence.''
 Particularly damaging was the Bush administration's decision to let lapse a somewhat obscure budgetary rule known as ''pay as you go'' or even more colloquially, ''Paygo.'' Under that rule, (a bipartisan effort put in place by the President George H. W. Bush) tax cuts or expansions of entitlement programs had to be offset by trims in other costs or increases in revenue. (Other spending is supposed to be limited by caps that Congress has been ignoring.)
 But the administration opposes reinstating the original Paygo rule, because it would effectively prevent Mr. Bush's tax cuts from becoming permanent. Even Alan Greenspan, who has quite clearly conveyed his support for Paygo, acknowledged the likelihood that extending Paygo would force at least a partial rollback of the Bush tax cuts.
 Some who are relaxed about the deficit say that we will ''grow into it,'' that a faster rate of growth will lead to more tax receipts and close the gap, thereby taking pressure off interest rates. But assuming current policies are continued, the government will need to borrow $5 trillion more over the next 10 years. Even one percentage point more in economic growth than is now expected -- a hugely ambitious goal -- would cut the $5 trillion only in half.
 There are many reasons that we need to find a national consensus to reduce the budget deficit -- bankrupting Medicare and Social Security, burdening our children with debt and the like -- but now that we have entered a period of rising interest rates, a higher cost of borrowing for both business and consumers is perhaps the most immediate.

HEADLINE: Court Lets Settlement Stand In Microsoft Antitrust Case

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
A federal appeals court handed Microsoft a convincing victory yesterday in the company's long-running campaign to put an end to its antitrust problems, by upholding the settlement the company reached with the government two years ago.
 Microsoft's general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, hailed the ruling as ''a landmark decision'' that removes a legal cloud over the company, freeing it up to use some of its more than $50 billion in cash to buy back shares or pay larger dividends.
 Microsoft also clearly hopes that the 83-page unanimous opinion by the federal appeals court in Washington will be closely read in Europe, where Microsoft is appealing a ruling against the company. In March, the European Commission fined Microsoft $600 million, ordered it to offer a version of the Windows operating system without its media player software, and told it to share more technical information with other software makers. 
 Throughout its antitrust struggles, Microsoft has resisted any efforts by government to tell the company what software can be included in Windows, the operating system on more than 90 percent of all personal computers. Yesterday's ruling came in response to a challenge to the United States settlement by Massachusetts, which sought stronger sanctions against Microsoft, including restrictions on Windows.
 Microsoft pointed to ''code removal'' as the heart of the appeals court ruling, and said it could have important implications for the European case. ''The court found that removing code from Windows is neither necessary nor useful for our industry or for consumers,'' Mr. Smith said in a conference call after the ruling was issued yesterday afternoon.
 Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, understands that the European case is separate. But he hoped that the federal court ruling would have some influence. What is true in the United States, Mr. Smith said, should be applicable in other markets, since ''there's no reason to think the facts are different anywhere else.''
 The opinion, written by Douglas H. Ginsburg, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, was unequivocal about the wisdom of the approach taken in the settlement. The consent decree forced Microsoft to loosen its contracts with industry partners, license its technical information to partners and rivals, and have its business practices monitored by a three-member panel.
 The settlement, Judge Ginsburg wrote, addressed Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct, ''without intruding itself into the design and engineering of the Windows operating system. We say, Well done!''
 The appeals court said that two trade associations, the Computer and Communications Industry Association and the Software and Information Industry Association, had the right to challenge the settlement. But its ruling on the merits of their complaints mirrored its ruling on the claims presented by Massachusetts. Seventeen other states that joined the federal antitrust suit against Microsoft have settled, as has the District of Columbia. 
 Legal experts see little, if any, room for an appeal of yesterday's ruling. ''This was the last gasp of the American case and the hope for strong remedies against Microsoft,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. 
 The attorney general for Massachusetts, Tom Reilly, said in a statement, ''This decision is bad news for consumers, bad news for competition and ultimately will be bad news for our economy.''
 For months, Microsoft executives have said the company needs to wait until its antitrust problems are effectively resolved before it can seriously consider a program to spend some of its cash reserves of more than $50 billion.
 After the court ruling, Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company, said in a note to clients that he expected Microsoft to announce a share repurchase program in July, which he said could be as much as $40 billion.
 Mr. Smith of Microsoft declined to comment on specific plans. But he said yesterday's ruling ''removes the last legal impediment'' to the company's previously announced intention to use its cash to increase the value of shareholders' investment in Microsoft.

HEADLINE: A Lyricist Unknown Sings of Key Rates

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Would you rather get your monetary policy explanations from Alan Greenspan or Bob Dylan? Well before the Federal Reserve announced its decision to raise interest rates yesterday afternoon, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland had posted on its Web site the June issue of Economic Trends, a publication that normally reviews economic data in a traditional, if not particularly interesting, manner. This time it took a different approach. 
 ''The Rates They Are A-changin''' was the headline, and what followed was a parody of one of Mr. Dylan's most famous songs:
 Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
 Recognize that inflation around you has grown
 And accept there's a chance it could rise through its zone
 Price stability is worth preservin'
 So less stimulus from the Fed don't bemoan
 For the rates they are a-changin'.
 Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
 Who are so confident in your opinions
 But don't speak too soon for the data still spins
 And there's no tellin' where it is goin'
 The theories out now could later be in
 For the rates they are a-changin'.
 The parody continued for several verses, ending with:
 The line it is drawn, the course nearly cast
 The risks we face now appeared small in the past
 But with measured steps the expansion will last
 Futures markets are anticipatin'
 A considerable time will be comin' to pass
 For the rates they are a-changin'.
 For those who may have wondered, the Cleveland Fed added a disclaimer:
 ''These lyrics are a Dylanesque take on the current situation; they are not an official statement about the likely course of monetary policy.'' 
 It did not identify the author, and a Cleveland Fed spokeswoman did not return a telephone call.
 As word of the parody spread yesterday, one economist, Robert J. Barbera of ITG/Hoenig, suggested that it was good the Cleveland Fed had not chosen to take off on another Dylan song.
 ''Can you imagine Greenspan singing, 'The sky, too, is falling onto you, and it's all over now, Baby Blue?''' he said.

HEADLINE: Showing Candidates, as They Praise Themselves and Bury Others

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The scariest campaign ad in modern presidential history is not the ''Willie Horton'' commercial that George H. W. Bush used against Michael Dukakis in 1988 or Lyndon B. Johnson's legendary ''Daisy'' ad of 1964 that fanned fears about Barry Goldwater.
 It is the one with Nancy Reagan, in a demure red suit and navy ruffled collar, staring frostily into the camera in a 1980 ad against Jimmy Carter.
 ''I deeply, deeply resent and am offended by the attacks that President Carter has made on my husband,'' she said in a tight, reproachful voice. ''I would like Mr. Carter to explain to me why the inflation is as high as it is; why unemployment is as high as it is; I would like to have him explain the vacillating, weak foreign policy so that our friends overseas don't know what we're going to do, whether we're going to stand up for them, or whether we're not going to stand up for them.'' 
 Even the harshest of President Bush's ads this year criticizing Senator John Kerry's voting record on defense are not as chilling.
 Wives are so often used to soften a candidate's profile that it is easy to forget that 24 years ago Mrs. Reagan was sometimes deployed as a Bob Dole-style attack dog. And it is that kind of amnesia that ''The Living Room Candidate,'' an online exhibition on presidential campaign ads (movingimage .us), was designed to combat. 
 Created four years ago by the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, the updated 2004 version, which is scheduled to go online today, allows Internet users to browse through a far richer collection of TV and Web campaign ads from 1952 to the present. 
 It is a truism that political campaigns nowadays are fought and won on television, but it is also true that at this point in the campaign some of the most talked-about ads are being shown only in swing states like Ohio or Florida. The Web site allows New Yorkers and Californians to see how the other half are being wooed.
 It also gives Internet users easy access to the current campaign's Web ads, which are more prevalent and troubling this election year than ever before. The Web site, for example, has the original version of a recent Bush Internet ad, ''Coalition of the Wild-Eyed,'' which blended Democratic figures like Al Gore and Howard Dean with images of Hitler. After the Kerry campaign and others complained last week, the ad was re-edited by the Bush campaign to make it clearer that the Hitler images were taken from an anti-Bush ad posted on the Web site of MoveOn .org, the political advocacy group. (The Bush ad does not explain that the attack ad with Hitler's image was not adopted by either the Kerry campaign or MoveOn.org, but was posted only as one of hundreds of entries in an Internet contest seeking anti-Bush commercials.)
 The Bush campaign Web site now includes only the amended version, but ''The Living Room Candidate'' allows viewers to link to it and compare it with the original.
 ''The Living Room Candidate'' is more than just a helpful tool for news addicts and journalists. Campaign ads are ''mini-movies,'' as David Schwartz, the museum's chief curator of film and a co-curator of ''The Living Room Candidate,'' put it: they do not just deliver the message of the moment but also reflect the mood and tastes of their era. 
 A 1968 Nixon ad reveling in Democratic Party chaos, for instance, is a wordless montage of the Chicago convention, Vietnam and civil unrest, set to a daffily jaunty rendition of ''Happy Days Are Here Again.'' It is a strange, and strangely effective ad that Mr. Schwartz described as ''very avant-garde'' and stylistically close to a popular variety show of the time, ''Laugh-In.'' 
 The ads for John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign are very much of their time, too -- cinema verite-style glimpses of the candidate explaining his positions to admiring crowds. But one ad is more unusual: Jacqueline Kennedy asking viewers in Spanish to vote for her husband: ''Que viva Kennedy!'' Mrs. Kennedy's accent was quite good, but her voice was as breathy in Spanish as it was in English, and she seems quite stiff reading a cue card while standing in front of surprisingly ugly wallpaper.
 The Web site has a search option, so that users can, for example, search for the word ''sex'' from 1952 to 2004. It does not come up, though Bob Dole did mention Paula Jones's ''sexual harassment lawsuit'' in a 1996 attack ad against Bill Clinton. (Like Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' with its film of President Bush on the links encouraging reporters to ''watch this drive,'' the ad uses a shot of President Clinton swinging a golf club to suggest dereliction of duty.)
 This year's ads are far fiercer and more negative than those from 2000. Then, one Al Gore ad showed the vice president politely endorsing his opponent's views: ''George Bush and I actually agree on accountability in education.'' And reflecting the spread of the Internet, MTV, cable TV news crawls and other attention-dividing forms of communication, today's ads cram much more information into ever shorter spaces. A seemingly soft and fuzzy Kerry ad titled ''Optimists'' uses split screens and quick cuts to flash a wide array of issues, from jobs and education to health care and national defense.
 But it is remarkable how unoriginal so many of today's high-tech, tightly honed ads really are. Just as Hollywood cannot resist a remake -- anything from ''King Kong'' to ''The Parent Trap'' -- political ads also cannibalize the past.
 A 2004 Bush ad called ''Defense,'' specially made for Florida voters, shows a sepia-tinted battleground. As the narrator lists weapons that Mr. Kerry voted against -- ''Apache helicopters, C-130 Hercules and F-16 fighter jets, components of which are all built here in Florida'' -- tanks and missiles vanish through the magic of computer graphics. The ad ends with the image of a forlorn-looking soldier and a narrator's voice intoning, ''Kerry even voted against body armor for our troops on the front line of the War on Terror.''
 In 1972, the Nixon campaign ran an ad about Senator George McGovern's proposed defense cuts. As a narrator warned -- ''He would cut the Marines by one-third, the Air Force by one-third. He'd cut Navy personnel by one-fourth'' -- a hand swept toy soldiers and miniature tanks and ships off the screen.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* ''BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO FROM CHINA,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, and Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9276, through Sept. 5. This perspective-altering exhibition, divided between two institutions, gives a panoramic glimpse of China's continuing cultural revolution after the Cultural Revolution, picking up where Asia Society's 1998 survey ''Inside/Out'' left off. The work ranges from documentary-style shots of avant-garde performances in the mid-1990's to identity-searching photographs and videos, to images of old cities being demolished as new ones rise. The 60 artists represent a mere tip of the creative iceberg in a country changing with breathtaking speed. One way or another, those changes will effect the world. An important show. Center's hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. Asia Society hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

* ''THE DOUGLAS DILLON LEGACY: CHINESE PAINTING FOR THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through Aug. 8. With treasures from the 8th through the 18th centuries, the Met is celebrating its comprehensive holdings in Chinese art, built up largely through the support of Dillon (1909-2003), a museum official for more than 50 years. Landscapes, bird and flower images, narratives and calligraphy fill eight galleries, punctuated by appropriate sculptures and ceramics. The highlights (everything here is a highlight, really) include a wonderfully stylized portrait of a fat and sassy horse, ''Night-Shining White,'' a favorite mount of the Chinese emperor Xuanzong, by the Tang painter Han Gan; ''Summer Mountains,'' attributed to Qu Ding, a visionary landscape in which travelers wind their way toward a lofty temple complex; and a scroll from a series of 12 by the 18th-century painter Xu Yang, recording in amazing detail Emperor Quianlong's tour of south China. Even for those unfamiliar with the complex cosmos of Chinese art, this show has a high enjoyment quotient. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, and this Monday (July 5) only, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Grace Glueck).

* ''FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,'' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That Native American art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting Native American art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).

''FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE WORLD: HINE, ULMANN, STRAND, ARBUS AND THE ETHICAL CULTURE FIELDSTON SCHOOL,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through July 18. A persuasive pitch for the influence of the high-minded, progressive Ethical Culture Fieldston School on four famous photographers: Lewis W. Hine, Doris Ulmann, Paul Strand and Diane Arbus. As a young teacher there, Hine (1874-1940) discovered his own photographic talent and went on to become one of the great documentary photographers of the poor and oppressed in the United States. Ulmann's tenure at the school strengthened her budding social consciousness; Strand was directly mentored by Hine; and Arbus, who received all her formal education there, developed her own vision of the outsider side of everyday life. Along with rather dull photographs of the school, examples of their work are displayed. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and 65+ (Glueck).

''CHILDE HASSAM, AMERICAN IMPRESSIONIST,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 12. A grossly inflated retrospective of this immensely popular American Impressionist, he of the candied views of patriotic, flag-draped New York during World War I. Retrospectives are supposed to change one's notion of an artist, so I suppose you could say that this one succeeds by definitively ratcheting Hassam's reputation several notches downward. The show is full of Hassam's cheerful, nostalgic views of Americana; skillful, high-keyed scenes full of flickering light, which, while occasionally brilliant, look especially facile brought together by the dozens, as they are here. Hassam could do almost anything technically in a variety of media: a night scene, the glint of water on the side of a horse-drawn carriage, dappled sun through a scrim of autumn trees, people massing in a canyon of tall buildings, a Seville courtyard in the slanting light of the late afternoon. Anything except what mattered most, which was offer up something deeper and daring. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman).

* ''LIVING LEGACIES: THE ARTS OF THE AMERICAS,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, permanent installation. In conjunction with its new facade and lobby, the museum has opened its revamped Hall of the Americas, the spacious display arena for objects from its collection of North, Central and South American art. Redone in vibrant colors, the hall offers three thematic shows as Phase I of its new installation. ''Enduring Heritage: Art of the Northwest Coast'' is the fiercest and most startling, with dramatic animal masks and a giant totem pole. ''Threads of Time: Woven Histories of the Andes'' presents 38 textiles and related materials from ancient times to now and ''Stories Revealed: Writing Without Words,'' the smallest, conveys how Indian cultures used graphic art rather than words to record their histories. A fuller account of the museum's collections will appear with Phase II, planned for 2006. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Glueck).

* ''MODIGLIANI: BEYOND THE MYTH,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, through Sept. 19. The first big New York retrospective of Modigliani since 1951, believe it or not, this is an overstuffed show that includes predictable duds, but also a select group of his best sculptures and paintings, which belie the stereotype of Modigliani as an impulsive lunatic, hellbent on self-destruction, doing poster-ready work. The good works indicate someone of worldly intelligence, patience, discipline and steady concentration. Modigliani's huge popularity has always depended on his risque reputation and on his languid, pretty, easily digested and unmistakable brand of delicately abstracted Modernism. As with the work of Chagall or Ben Shahn, Modigliani's could frequently tip over into kitsch or parody. But at its best, it is original and exquisite and suggests someone beyond the bohemian cliche, clearly wrestling with issues besides the formal felicity of elongated shapes, who died prematurely. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 9 p.m.; Fridays, to 5 p.m. Admission: $14; $11.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* ''MOMA AT EL MUSEO: LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through July 25. The first broad-scale exposure of the Modern's extensive holdings from Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, the 150 or so objects here are a small selection from the more than 2,000 it owns. But they form an arresting show, from the powerful Surrealist-influenced ''Jungle'' (1943) by the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam to an untitled 1995 sculpture by the Colombian Doris Salcedo that invokes the political violence in her country. The sardonic humor of Marisol (Venezuela) and Fernando Botero (Colombia); the geometric tweakings of Jesus Rafael Soto and Gertrude Goldschmidt (Venezuela); the Conceptual hatchings of Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Cuba) and Cildo Meireles (Brazil), among others, remind us of the artistic richness south of the border. This show joins the strength of the Modern's resources with the growing importance of El Museo as a showcase of Latino culture. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Glueck).

* AUGUST SANDER, ''People of the 20th Century: A Photographic Portrait of Germany'' and Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 19. Although only a sampling of his vast inventory of portraits of German society, the show, naturally, is too big: the prints are vintage but uneven, and the best pictures are not given enough breathing room. But genius is genius, and you may leave nearly overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of Sander's obsessive ambition and humanity. An accompanying display, ''Indexing the World,'' is a gem, providing a brisk, buoyantly eccentric overview of the dubious role of photography in the quest to index the world. It is often remarked that Sander photographed one era turning into another, Weimar Germany into Nazi Germany, which is true. His work, despite its scientific pretense, is suffused with the unconscious melancholy of a world he could see was already fading. But another way to describe him is to say that his project was both deeply reactionary and revolutionary, and this tension became the central, illuminating paradox of his achievement. (Through July 9 a selection of Sander's photographs of women is at Yancey Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646) 230-9610.) Museum hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

''SHOCK OF THE OLD: CHRISTOPHER DRESSER,'' the Smithsonian Institution's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through July 25. The first full-scale museum retrospective of this great 19th-century British designer reflects the career of an astoundingly busy man in tumultuous times. One of the first designers to embrace industrial fabrication, Dresser introduced innovative techniques and materials, helped ignite the Western craze for Japan and the revival of ancient styles and presaged much that we call modern. His career, eclipsed before he died, is still being explored. This show's profusion of vases in porcelain, earthenware or glass; silver-plate tea services, toast racks and decanters; wallpaper and textile designs; chairs, cabinets and cast-iron hall stands seems more like the survey of an epoch than the work of a single individual. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Roberta Smith).

* ''TOOLS OF HER MINISTRY: THE ART OF SISTER GERTRUDE MORGAN,'' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Sept. 26. If you wonder what it really means to say that art is a calling, see this ethereal show. A self-appointed prophet and street preacher, Sister Morgan was called by God to paint in the 1950's. Untutored but full of an uncanny grace, her vivid, high-key works have a plain-spoken ecstasy and inborn eloquence, both formal and literary, that can lift the soul. The mix of text and image relates to many modern artists and poets, none of whom she ever heard of or cared about. Her pictures are talismans of mystical devotion derived from inner necessity, conceived as teaching tools for lost souls. In heaven works like these would be eternally before our eyes. The world not being heaven, this is your opportunity to see them. The day has come, as Sister Morgan might say. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Fridays until 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

JORGE PARDO, Lever House Lobby Gallery, 400 Park Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets, there is no phone through July 31. If Ikea sold sculptures, they might look like the ones Mr. Pardo installed in the lobby of this famous Modernist high-rise: squat wooden constructions resembling the skeletons of biomorphic chairs, with attractive colored glass lights nested like eggs in the depressions where you sit. Curiously, the plywood elements that touch the floor have been cut into the silhouettes of animal feet: hooves, bear paws or tentacles (Ken Johnson).

GUY PENE DU BOIS, ''Painter of Modern Life,'' Graham, 1014 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 535-5767, through July 9. Pene du Bois (1884-1958) made some of the more appealingly peculiar paintings in early-20th-century American art. With a sensuously refined touch, he painted luminous, gently satiric pictures of doll-like, well-to-do people in situations of Henry Jamesian intimacy. This enchanting exhibition presents more than 50 paintings and works on paper from the first half of his career, 1905 to 1924 (Johnson).

STANLEY SPENCER, CDS Gallery, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555, through July 27. Religion, sex and his hometown (Cookham-on-Thames) preoccupied Spencer (1891-1959), who expressed his visions in robust paintings that combined the influences of Italian Renaissance masters and Modernist European movements. His powerful draftsmanship is seen in this show of 26 sheets from the early 1920's to the mid-1950's. Particularly evident is his adroitness at complex figural compositions. His softer, erotic side is evident in a study for ''Leda and the Swan,'' and there are a couple of wonderful portraits. This catchall display, in which some of the works are faded and faint, lacks the oomph one expects from a Spencer drawing show, but it gives a taste of the artist's superlative skills (Glueck).

''WEEGEE'S STORY,'' Ubu, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 23. Wielding his 4-by-5 Speed Graphic with a master's touch, the New York tabloid photographer Weegee probably shot more murders and fires in his heyday, the 1930's and 40's, than anyone in the business. But his passion for the city also drew him to its many other photo opportunities: the strivers and the homeless, festivities and freaks, politicians and celebrities, posh avenues and mean streets. This show of 220 Weegee vintage photographs, culled from a collection assembled during 30 years by the Berlin dealer Hendrik Berinson, reveals his remarkable range (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

''WOODWORK,'' Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 755-0434, through Aug. 27. Highlights of this 22-artist show of wooden sculptures include George Stoll's wooden sponge painted yellow; a big, lovingly smoothed, upright log by Jene Highstein; a bark-covered sphere like a giant cantaloupe called ''Tree Ball'' by Lars Fisk; a bearded man nicely carved in lime tree wood and hung upside down by Paloma Vargas Weisz; an improbably bent 2-by-4 by Matt Johnson; and a big human hand with many little hinged doors built into it by Los Carpinteros (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

''MARILYN,'' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through July 23. Marilyn Monroe is the inspiration for works by more than 20 artists. It starts with a small grainy close-up photograph of the young actress's worried face by Andre de Dienes and includes photographs of Andy Warhol-style Marilyns copied in crushed rhinestones and red liquid by Vic Muniz; a Marilyn-like self-portrait by Cindy Sherman; Zoe Leonard's photograph of a bearded woman in the famous nude-on-red-satin pose; and a sound piece by Jonathan Horowitz with the self-explanatory title, ''Talking Without Thinking (in the Voice of Marilyn Monroe)'' (Johnson).

''PSYCHIC LANDSCAPE,'' Yvon Lambert, 564 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3611, through July 30. Works in various media by six cosmic fantasists include Vidya Gastaldon's pod sculptures of yarn-wrapped wire; Mamie Holst's hypnotic painted circles; Jean-Michel Wicker's video meditation on the Cologne Cathedral; Ki'Wa's psychedelically colored video of a ghostly grafitti artist; Carlos Amorales's sharply graphic paintings of red-eyed crows, skulls and a giant spider; and, best of all, Alex Rutterford's hyperactively percussive animated video of mechanical elements, rapidly morphing to the music of Autechre (Johnson).

''PUBLIC.EXE: PUBLIC EXECUTION,'' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 31. This group exhibition is all but invisible at Exit Art itself, where another, long-running exhibition takes up most of the space. ''Public.ex'' has just two installations on the premises, along with some handouts, including a funky newspaper and a CD. But the bulk of the work consists of politically inflected events, video screenings and activist Internet sites. A result is a show that as far as possible sidesteps the institutional authority and moves out into the everyday world, where art and life, equally silly and serious, seem to interact on the random, non-linear model of the Internet itself. The exhibition's Web site is www.exitart.org/public.exe (Cotter).

''SOMMER SHOW,'' Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923, through July 30. Works by five artists represented by Sommer Contemporary Art, a Tel Aviv gallery, include Eliezer Sonnenschein's wooden guns with corporate logos painted on them; Rona Yefman's wry photographs of young people, like one of three topless women in Groucho Marx masks; Doron Solomon's percussive, gridded video projection, in which brief scenes of newsreel violence flicker on and off; Sharon Ya'ari's large, dreamlike, black-and-white photograph of a grocery store closed for the night; and Yehudit Sasportas's faux-technical drawing of fallen trees in a forest (Johnson).

* ''TERRORVISION,'' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through July 31. Terror comes in all sizes, shapes and degrees, and this show runs the gamut, with exhibits by about 50 artists facing up to their most ''extreme fears,'' from the general threats posed by Al Qaeda and its franchises to the traumas of personal catastrophe like breast cancer and heart operations. The gallery's multidisciplinary emphasis is manifest in film, video, audio and computer-generated creations, along with media as simple as prints and photographs. It is a mix of successful efforts and some that don't quite make it, the lightweight with the more substantial. But it is alive and kicking (Glueck).

Galleries: SoHo

''PLAYPEN,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 24. Process, the notion of art as action, is a fundamental dynamic in this mildly experimental show. Much of the work is site-specific and finished, including David Brody's mural-like wall drawings and a suite of sculptures by Gedi Sibony. Other pieces are both stationary and interactive. The exception is across the street in the annex gallery called the Drawing Room, where the collective Red67 has a project titled ''New York Public Archive,'' to which visitors can contribute material, on the utopian principle that everyone is an artist and everything can be art (Cotter).

GERHARD RICHTER, ''Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo,'' Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through July 31. Here is one of the very few sculptures made by Mr. Richter, the immensely influential German painter. It consists of two plaster heads cast from life, slathered in gray paint and mounted on pedestals. One head is Mr. Richter's; the other is of his fellow German painter Blinky Palermo. Facing each other with closed eyes, in a gallery that is empty but for a small study version in a shadow box on the wall, the faux classical sculptures create an ambience of dry existential ennui (Johnson).

* ROBERT RYMAN, ''Works on Paper, 1957-1964,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Sept. 25. Although Mr. Ryman is usually referred to as a Minimalist, he began his career as something more like an abstract conceptualist, making paintings at least as interesting to think about as to look at. This stimulating, richly varied exhibition of 30 works on paper catch him at a pivotal point in his career, which coincides with a fertile one in American art. They include paintings, drawings and collage, often in combination, and show an artist using abstraction's strangeness and uncertainties to think his way into his creative place in the world (Cotter).

Other Galleries

''ARCHITECTURE BY NUMBERS,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through July 9. Although the premise of this show is promising, an investigation by architects of ''architecture and its essential relationship with the numerical,'' its theory load is heavy and the visual quotient is low (Glueck).

* FELIX GMELIN, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-4977, through July 31. Utopianism, time-faded and tinged with doubt, is the subject of the spare but trenchant New York debut show of this Swedish artist. The centerpiece is his re-creation of a 1968 video shot by his father, who was at the time a teacher in Berlin. In the original, students carry a large red flag in a kind of marathon relay jog through the city: one figure taking the banner from another. In 2002 Mr. Gmelin recreated the performance, using his own students as runners, and the two videos, old and new, run side by side in the gallery. The ideas conveyed are contradictory; the juxtaposition very moving (Cotter).

* ''LASTING IMPRESSIONS,'' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690, through July 31. Regarding books as visual treasures, the club's library is an awesome repository of the history of printing and collecting in the Western world. The more than 150 objects on view here include not just bound rarities, but also manuscripts, prints, drawings, paintings, photographs and statues. Treasures range from a collection of tiny printed volumes going back to the 17th century, some so small they could fit on your thumbnail, to a handwritten inventory of the library of Madame de Pompadour. This is a show that's worth its weight in quality time (Glueck).

SZE TSUNG LEONG, ''History Images,'' Storefront for Art and Architecture, 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, through July 31. A photographer who divides his time between New York and Bejing presents extremely detailed, medium-large color pictures of construction and demolition sites in Chinese cities. Taken from elevated distances, the images convey a sense of the awesome scale of development in that huge, rapidly modernizing country (Johnson).

* ''THE REALITY OF THINGS,'' Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through July 11. Some things in this intriguing, 12-artist show are just what they seem, and some are not. Seemingly real cantaloupes by Martha Friedman are made of cast and painted urethane foam but Tony Feher's stacked brown and black milk crates involved no deception. Most stealthily surprising is Hans Accola's plastic jug of carpenter's glue. Tara Donavan's cube of straight pins, Robert Gober's fake newspaper advertising fliers and Shinique Smith's thrift store overcoat with added silver pinstripes further compound one's sense of existential slipperiness (Johnson).

''WORLDSCAPES: THE ART OF ERRO,'' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through July 17. The career of Erro, a prodigiously productive Pop-style painter and an acclaimed Icelandic artist, is featured in a nearly 50-year retrospective at the Grey Art Gallery. It will not persuade you that he is a great painter, but you may be taken by his manic graphic activity, antic humor and promiscuous sampling from popular culture. If so, you may also want to see ''Femmes Fatales'' at the Goethe Institute, 1014 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 439-8700, through July 17, which offers 10 colorful paintings from an Erro series devoted to female comic-book superheroes (Johnson).

Last Chance

* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Monday. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).

''NEXUS: TAIWAN IN QUEENS,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, through Sunday. Twenty artists, all Taiwanese, are assembled for an exhibition about immigration, assimilation, isolation, cultural identity and related issues. Many works are straightforward illustrations of the theme: Lu Hsian Fu's installation of red paper Chinese lanterns threaded with strings of Christmas lights, for example, is about the immigrant's bicultural experience. Some works, like C. J. Yeh's cybernetic translations of Mondrian paintings, resonate more broadly. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission, $5 (Johnson).

* ''PETRA: LOST CITY OF STONE,'' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through Tuesday. Petra, an ancient city in what is now the Jordanian part of the Negev Desert, was at its zenith from the first century B.C. to the third century A.D. Prosperous, safe and abundantly supplied with water, it was a center of bustling trade in incense, ivory, textiles and other precious goods, which flowed through it by camel caravan from points east to the Mediterranean. And it was a highly sophisticated cultural crossroads whose inhabitants carved from rock not only a lively metropolis but also a necropolis of monumental tombs for their kings and leaders. While learned diggers are still uncovering its ruins, this show, said to be the first cultural collaboration between Jordan and the United States, offers a generous glimpse of Petra's vibrant civilization through art objects, architectural elements, photographs and film. The installation, set up with the museum's usual expertise and helpful graphics, is one of the busiest around, but undaunted, Petra comes through. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Timed tickets to the exhibition: $19; students and 60+, $16.50; children under 12, $13 (Glueck).

* ''FRED WILSON, OBJECTS AND INSTALLATIONS: 1979-2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, through Sunday. Mr. Wilson, who represented the United States at the 2003 Venice Biennale, made his reputation with conceptually pointed, technically polished and visually engaging installations and objects that focused on excavating American racial history and illustrating the exclusionary power of cultural institutions shaped by social, economic and ideological domination. Elements of his subversive museum projects appear in this traveling show, along with sculptures and a fine, short new film. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 62+, $3; children under 12, free (Cotter).

General Motors and Ford Motor reported double-digit declines in United States sales in June, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals.
 Over all, auto sales in the United States were down 6 percent from a year ago. G.M.'s sales fell 15.4 percent and Ford's sales, including Volvo and Land Rover, were down 11.9 percent. Sales suffered in part from strong results in May, which could not be sustained, as well as from difficult comparisons to June 2003, when incentive programs buoyed sales. [Page C5.]

Stock Investors Await Jobs Report
Stocks fell with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 101.32 points, to close at 10,334.16. The S.&P. 500-stock index dropped 11.90 points, to 1,128.94, and the Nasdaq composite decreased 32.24 points, to 2,015.55. [C5.]

The Institute for Supply Management's gauge of manufacturing held close to a 20-year high in June, reinforcing forecasts that the economy is expanding. In another report, construction spending rose 0.3 percent in May, to an annual pace of $988.5 billion. [C2.]

Inflation Worried Fed in May
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee on May 4 indicated that nearly two months before the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday, some board members were more worried about inflation than Alan Greenspan was. [C2.]

InterActiveCorp Is Victor in Dispute
A Delaware judge has ruled in favor of InterActiveCorp, run by Barry Diller, in a tax-related dispute with Vivendi Universal. [C5.]

Clinton Memoir Selling Briskly
Knopf Publishing said that ''My Life,'' former President Bill Clinton's 957-page memoir, sold more than one million copies in the first eight days after its publication on June 22. Knopf said that it had already ordered a third printing, raising the total to 2.6 million. [C3.]

I.B.M. Tried to Counter Oracle Bid
Oracle's hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft caused I.B.M. to consider making investments in other software makers. [C5.]

Chairman Leaves J Sainsbury
The chairman of J Sainsbury, Sir Peter Davis, left, stepped down after criticism of his $:2.5 million ($4.55 million) bonus, which was awarded despite the company's poor results in 2003. Sir Peter will be succeeded by Philip Hampton, who was the chief financial officer at Lloyds TSB until the beginning of this year. [World Business, Section W.]

No Rate Increase in Europe
The European Central Bank decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent -- a decision as widely expected as the Federal Reserve's rate increase had been on Wednesday. [World Business, Section W.]

HEADLINE: Windows on the Many Chinese Revolutions, Political and Personal

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Few new worlds are brave. Even those that come with a plan, an ideal, some kind of vision thing, are cautious, expedient, accident-prone affairs, cruising from crisis to crisis, consolidating nuggets of political and cultural power and letting everything else, including the past, fall where it may, often on the trash heap. 
 That's one impression generated by the several exhibitions of photography from China that have converged in Manhattan this summer. A large survey of contemporary Chinese work at the International Center of Photography and Asia Society sets the tone, with images by a generation of young artists who are watching an urbanized, digitalized, McDonald's-ized culture lurch into being before their eyes. 
 But other shows contribute valuable information. A two-part exhibition at China Institute and a pocket-size archival display at the International Center of Photography together look back to an older China in the grip of different but no less shocking revolutions. And in an outstanding New York solo debut in a Chelsea gallery, the Beijing-based photographer Hai Bo weaves cultural and personal history together with a sadness so profound and restrained as to seem heroic. 
 Cultural history is the focus of ''China and the Chinese in Early Photographs'' at the International Center of Photography, a contextualizing footnote to the contemporary survey. It includes portraits of Manchu nobility, their imperial days numbered, by the late-19th-century Scottish photographer John Thomson, as well as shots of landscapes that emulated, with peculiarly glassy serenity, ink-and-brush painting. 
 This was the China Europeans wanted; these pictures were for them, though at least one odd-duck entry was intended for Chinese eyes. It is a photographic facsimile, dated 1842, of the document known as the Treaty of Nanjing, signed that year by China and Britain after China's defeat in the First Opium War. The agreement forced China to open ports to Western trade. And to further sharpen the humiliation, British authorities sent a photographic copy of the treaty to the Chinese government as evidence of the powers of Western technology.
 The chronological story picks up in the two-part ''China Fast Forward: Photographs of Daily Life, 1917-2002'' at China Institute, or at least in one of the shows installed there, a selection of pictures by the American social scientist Sidney D. Gamble (1890-1968). The earliest picture is from 1917. By then the Qing dynasty was gone, replaced by a republican government, but a centuries-old social structure and a predominantly agricultural economy were more or less intact. 
 Gamble, a Princeton-trained heir to the Proctor & Gamble fortune, arrived in China with an agenda, a utopian Christian capitalist belief that an application of science and religion might lift a backward culture up. It is Gamble the scientist who shines forth in the show, which is organized by Nancy Jervis, vice president of China Institute, and has been seen in various versions and different places, including China, in the past 15 years. 
 Gamble was an avid statistician, a connoisseur of quantity: he knew, for a given year, how many rickshaws there were in Beijing, how many ounces of opium had been confiscated and burned, and what percentage of women had bound feet. To supplement his fact-finding, he took pictures. A few he used in books he published; most he stored away. Some 5,000 negatives were found in a closet after his death. Prints made from 57 of them are in the show, and they're wonderful. 
 In line with Gamble's omnivorous appetite, the range of subjects is wide: nobles, peasants and pilgrims; coffin makers and silk-weavers; Yangtze River boatmen; university students in Panama hats; Taoist priests. Gamble gave equal attention to productivity and poverty and had no interest in the fantasy of a ''timeless Orient.'' He saw activity and change everywhere, and documented it. 
 He was in Beijing in 1919 when word came that European powers had handed Chinese territory over to Japan, and he photographed the protests that followed this betrayal, culminating in the great demonstrations that turned into the generation-defining May Fourth Movement. And just as he acknowledged the emergence of a new China, he recognized an old China on the wane. His 1918 picture of a wealthy dowager, swathed in silk, feet bound, cigarette holder clamped between her lips, is a classic embodiment of an antique culture that Maoism and Western modernism would sweep away.
 The second show at China Institute, ''Documenting China: Contemporary Photography and Social Change,'' considers the consequences of that sweep. Organized by Gu Zheng, a Shanghai-based photographer, for the Bates College Museum of Art in Lewiston, Me., it includes seven photographers with distinct approaches to an immense theme. 
 One, Liu Xiaodi, in his ''Village'' series from the late 1970's, focused on rural peasants, extolled by Mao as the spiritual elite of his ''People's China.'' This old-time orthodoxy is undercut, however, in another series, Zhang Xinmin's ''Besiege the City by the Country'' (1998). While the title refers to a strategy for a peasant revolution, it is applied to images of peasants who have migrated by the millions to cities, looking for work, only to find themselves on the lowest rung of the socio-economic ladder. Once social role models for a China-to-be, they are victims of the China that is. 
 Jiang Jian takes this subject in a different direction in tender 1999 color portraits of peasant families in their homes. But Zhou Hai's pictures of industrial workers caught in an inferno of smoke and grime return to other realities. A young man haloed with steam and staring defiantly at the camera could be the advance guard of a new proletarian revolution in a country every bit as explosive as it was in Gamble's day. 
 In fact, the only predictable thing at present is a continuing hybridity, evident in Luo Yongjin's photographs of new architecture in wild Chinese-Internationalist styles, and in a panoramic shot by Zhou Ming of Shanghai, with its Disneyesque skyline and boomtown energy from which at least some residents are in retreat. These Shanghailanders are themselves subjects of photographs by Lu Yuanmin: sepia-toned portraits of middle-class residents who have made their apartments into sealed environments to which manageable doses of past and present are admitted.
 Indeed, following a decade of extroverted work, many Chinese artists are looking inward. One is Mr. Hai, 42, who is seen both at Max Protetch in Chelsea and in ''Between Past and Future,'' the survey at the International Center of Photography. To the survey he contributes much-noticed older work. It include pairs of photographs of family and friends, with one picture taken during the Cultural Revolution and the other, of the same sitters, or those who survive, 20 years later. Although the work clearly has a political edge, time and memory are its real subjects, as they are of the recent work at Protetch. 
 His series titled ''Dusk'' (2002) literally resurrects the past by combining pictures from years ago in new, triptych-style formats. In one example, two head shots of the artist's aged, bedridden grandmother are followed by a coppery image of a landscape at sunset, a view she regularly saw from her window at the end of her life. The pictures date from 1993, the year she died, but were assembled as a unit two years ago, as were others of Mr. Hai's father and son. 
 The expressive dynamic here, at once valedictory and restorative, reappears in a quartet of pictures titled ''Four Seasons'' (2003), in which the artist himself is seen as a diminutive figure seated under a magnificent tree in a park. The series riffs on the Taoist theme of mutability that suffuses classical Chinese painting: the tree changes appearance from picture to picture; the seated figure remains constant, though with each change of season he has aged. 
 Characteristically for this artist, the series also has specific autobiographical content. The park is the one in which Mr. Hai played as a child; it is also where his brother accidentally drowned. And the memory of private tragedy haunts these pictures just as surely as the public tragedy haunts the group portraits, real and reconstructed, from the Cultural Revolution. 
 In fact, public and private meet in almost all of the most interesting Chinese photography concentrated in New York this summer, work that both engages with the brilliant, volatile, dangerous history it is part of and creates a morally incisive world of its own. To do the first requires breadth of vision; to do the second requires courage of a quiet, generous kind.

The two-part show called ''China Fast Forward: Photographs of Daily Life, 1917-2002'' remains at China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan, through July 31. ''China and the Chinese in Early Photographs'' remains at International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, through Sept. 5, and travels to George Eastman House, Rochester, Dec. 11 to Feb. 6. ''Hai Bo'' remains at Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, through July 30.

HEADLINE: Powell Meets Foreign Minister Of North Korea to Discuss Arms

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Friday, July 2 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with North Korea's foreign minister here on Friday in the highest-level meeting between the two nations in two years to discuss proposals intended to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, according to Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
 Mr. Powell and the foreign minister, Paek Nam-Sun, along with their delegations, met for about 20 minutes, Mr. Boucher said, and tried to clarify their positions on proposals advanced last month, in the last round of six-party talks on North Korea. 
 At those talks, the United States and four of North Korea's neighbors -- Japan, South Korea, Russia and China -- laid out a series of incentives for North Korea, including the promise of a significant infusion of foreign aid.
 That was seen as a softening by the Bush administration, which had previously insisted on complete disarmament as a first step to improved relations and aid. Washington was prodded by China, South Korea and Japan to abandon its hard-line stance.
 Mr. Powell, who was in Indonesia for a security conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, said there was an opportunity for ''concrete progress,'' Mr. Boucher said.
 The encounter was the first opportunity for American officials to register a reaction from North Korea, which until now has said it was studying the new proposal.
 That reaction seemed guarded.
 A North Korean statement quoted Mr. Paek, who referred to North Korea by the abbreviation for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as saying that ''if the United States is of the position to improve the bilateral relations, the D.P.R.K. also will not regard the U.S. as a permanent enemy, and that the prospect of the D.P.R.K.-U.S. relations entirely depends on the switchover in the U.S. hostile policy on the D.P.R.K.''
 The statement added that North Korea would ''maintain its goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and reaffirmed that there is no change in the D.P.R.K.'s position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue.''
 In a news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Powell spoke of the evolution in the administration's stance.
 ''We want a denuclearized Korean peninsula,'' he said. ''It's in the best interest of the world, the region, the peninsula and North Korea. We showed flexibility in our position last week because we wanted our colleagues in the six-party talks to recognize that the United States was seeking a peaceful, diplomatic solution.''

HEADLINE: Can Rising Rates Stimulate Housing? Fed Makes It Happen, for Now

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
RISING interest rates are supposed to slow the housing industry, but no one looking at the home sale numbers would think that any such thing is going on.
 The continued strength of the housing market, months after the bond market began to raise interest rates -- and just as the Federal Reserve begins to follow suit -- says interesting things about the state of the economy.
 First, it reflects the popularity of housing as an investment. The stock market has come back, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is almost 50 percent above its lows of October 2002. But the index is still about 25 percent below its peak, and it is not representative of the tech stocks where many made and then lost so much money. For many in America, housing remains the only investment they've made that has worked without fail. 
 Second, the strong housing market reflects the confidence of buyers that their jobs are safe. It took longer than usual for job growth to arrive in this recovery, but it has done so. Economists may worry about excessive consumer debt, but consumers do not.
 But there may also be a third reason, one that is in some ways perverse. It relates to the Federal Reserve, which stimulated the housing market by pushing interest rates down as low as they could go. That seemed wise at the time, what with talk about deflation and very weak technology and telecommunications sectors that had to work off the overcapacity caused by the technology stock bubble.
 After that crisis passed, the Fed gradually concluded that rates had to rise. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, remembers all too vividly what happened in 1994 when the Fed decided higher rates were needed. Hints were ignored, and it turned out that some prominent investors had placed huge bets, via derivatives, that relied on rates staying low. This time, Mr. Greenspan wanted to be sure that everyone had time to unwind such positions. A lot of positions were unwound, although it is hard to know whether it was Fed talk or bond market action that led to those moves by traders.
 But the prolonged talk about raising rates, including the widespread belief that there will be a series of increases, may have done the exact opposite of what a rise in rates is expected to do. Rather than depress sales, it is now stimulating buying and pushing prices higher. 
 When inflation is rampant, as it is in home prices, an increase in prices becomes a reason to buy now, before they go even higher. The apparent certainty that borrowing costs will rise has contributed to that frenzy. 
 If the price of homes were counted in the Consumer Price Index, as it once was, inflation would appear higher than it does -- and it is already so high that the real, or inflation-adjusted, federal funds rate is farther below zero than it has been since the days when G. William Miller was running the Fed in the 1970's. But the government instead measures rental prices for the Consumer Price Index, and those have lagged home costs, making overall inflation seem lower than it really is.
 Home prices are perhaps the only market where buyers and sellers measure prices quite differently. Sellers see a price of $500,000, or whatever it might be. Buyers see a price of so much a month. As rates fell, the seller's price could soar while the buyer's price did not. As mortgage rates rise, the reverse will be true, and those whom Mr. Greenspan is encouraging to buy now may suffer the most.
 Rather than focus on a gradual rise in interest rates, the Fed should be trying to set the appropriate rate given the strong economy and rising inflation. That rate is not 1.25 percent; it is probably above 3 percent. The Fed's policy of gradualism may be politically popular, but its economic effects may prove to be unfortunate.

PERSON: RACHEL S. MOORE

HEADLINE: Ex-Dancer With Briefcase Runs Ballet Theater

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
RACHEL S. Moore, the new executive director of American Ballet Theater, pauses to get her bearings backstage at the Metropolitan Opera House. Which way to turn? Ms. Moore has just stepped out of the main rehearsal room, where dancers are practicing their steps for the market scene in ''Romeo and Juliet,'' a production that will end the dance company's spring season tomorrow.
 It's not that she is merely a few months into her job, which she began in mid-April. The backstage area is a cavernous place with corridors leading into the vast bowels of the opera house. At one far end, there is an elevator the size of a large living room to move sets. 
 ''I still get lost,'' says Ms. Moore, a former member of Ballet Theater's corps de ballet.
 This moment of hesitation is a rare uncertain move for Ms. Moore, who comes across as supremely sure-footed during a long conversation on a recent afternoon.
 The chat begins when she strides into sight from the shadows of backstage right, setting down a leather briefcase and flashing a smile. She has just returned from a luncheon at Tavern on the Green for high-level donors. A look at those turned-out legs in black patent-leather pumps, and it's not hard to peg her former life. She danced in the company under the direction of Mikhail Baryshnikov from 1984 to 1988.
 Ms. Moore's performing role now is to bring stability to a premier company that has seen tumult in recent years, with questions raised by former trustees about the company's financial health, and a high turnover of executive directors. She is the fourth executive director in four years.
 And she thought she had it tough as a dancer, performing eight times a week, her poor feet taking a pounding on hard floors. It led to injury, surgery and the end of a dancing career at the age of 24.
 What a comeback. At 40, she is cheerfully optimistic about the challenges ahead. ''We are aiming for a balanced budget for this year; that's an absolute expectation,'' she says. ''I think it's very achievable. ''
 Ms. Moore previously directed the Center for Dance Education at the Boston Ballet, and also served as an interim leader for Boston Ballet during a similarly tumultuous period. 
 American Ballet Theater, which has a budget of $35 million this year, gets half of its annual revenues from donations, and the rest from earned income like ticket sales. Ms. Moore says the operating deficit in the last fiscal year was $1.1 million.
 On this afternoon, it is easy to be distracted by the merriment on the grand stage. Dancers, resplendent in costumes and makeup, are twirling and flitting high off the floor in a full-dress rehearsal of the comic ballet ''Coppelia.'' The orchestra warms up in a cacophony of sounds.
 Her arms folded, Ms. Moore peers through the curtains. Does she miss being out there? ''It certainly brings back memories,'' she says. ''You're always primed and gearing up for a show, so it's very high energy. The pressure now is very great but vastly different.''
 Ms. Moore is somberly dressed in a slate-blue Calvin Klein suit. As she talks, she is no-nonsense, her hands clasped. She chooses her words carefully. No juicy tidbit about Mr. Baryshnikov will be elicited on this day.
 So what are her plans for Ballet Theater? ''My challenge will be how to build a business model to allow us to have financial stability and continue to tour,'' she says. ''The key is the A.B.T. is one of the finest classical ballet companies in the world and when there is excellence, I believe we will find a way to make it thrive.''
 Is there any chance of American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet merging? ''I'd be surprised,'' she says. Are there any plans to find a permanent home for the Ballet Theater? ''It's not something that is at the top of the heap of what we're looking at,'' she says.
 MS. MOORE had been director of the Boston Ballet's dance schools from 2001 until this year. She also held administrative posts at a classical music school for minority students in Boston, at the Ballet Theater of Boston and at arts organizations in Washington. When she danced with American Ballet Theater, she was a member of the dancers' union committee and chairwoman of the Dancers' Emergency Fund.
 While in a cast from her foot surgery, she took college entrance exams and was accepted into Brown University, where she graduated with honors in 1992 as a philosophy major. She also has a master's degree in arts administration from Columbia. She is married to Robert Ryan, the chief executive of a pharmaceutical services company in Milwaukee. They see each other on weekends.
 The daughter of economists, Ms. Moore grew up in Davis, Calif. She began dancing at age 11, becoming hooked immediately. ''I danced from the heart,'' she says.
 There is time for one more peek on the stage. The renowned choreographer of the ''Coppelia'' revival, Frederic Franklin, spry at age 90, is putting the finishing touches to the performance with Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director. Mr. McKenzie breaks away from dancers to lope over to Ms. Moore's side. ''She's one of us,'' he says. 
 She looks pleased. She is home. ''Because I believe in this company and this art form,'' she says, ''it was not a risky proposition to come here.''

HEADLINE: Realism Aside, Now Is the Time to Savor Next Season's Goodies

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
It isn't often that journalists write about news releases; doing so will only encourage more to fill up our mail slots and clog our e-mail queues. That said, I was struck recently by a 15-page release from the theatrical press agents Boneau/Bryan-Brown trumpeting their ''fall preview 2004,'' meaning shows they are representing.
 I was not struck by the belle-lettristic quality of the prose (we belle-lettrists, or at least those of us who don't work for Variety, try to avoid the verb ''helm'' as shorthand for ''direct''). Nor does this release represent anything like the entirety of the forthcoming theatrical season, in New York or nationwide, although Boneau/Bryan-Brown has a pretty good list.
 What I began thinking about was the thrill, illusory but palpable, of anticipation. Every year in the late spring and early summer not just journalists but ordinary arts-loving mortals start noticing seasonal announcements in their newspapers, and brochures in their mailboxes. Browsing through this material provides its own kind of pleasure, sometimes even more pleasure than attending the actual events or, certainly, laying out the money for tickets and subscriptions, often for locations or dates that are not your first choice. 
 We live in an era (and, in New York, in a city) in which there is much fretting about the health of the theater. Broadway is cheesy. Off Broadway is underfinanced and ignored by the Tonys. The classics are woefully represented. There's little money for bold new productions on a grand scale (even if you broaden the concept of theater to include opera), and hence little experience of such productions, and hence philistine hostility against them. Hidden among the dross are gems, to be sure, but it takes a lot of effort and sophistication to find them.
 But that's just the experience of having suffered through a lot of shows in the past. With news releases and advertisements and brochures, we can live in a roseate future in which all that's been broken has been fixed, all that's been tawdry has become shiny and new. Looking at Boneau/Bryan-Brown's list, we see oldies like Arthur Miller's ''After the Fall'' and Reginald Rose's ''Twelve Angry Men''; maybe, all unexpectedly, they will speak to us with a fresh relevance, will be revealed as timeless masterpieces that have transcended their dated trappings. Tennessee Williams (''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and four early one-acters) will be back, too, as will Sam Shepard (''Fool for Love'').
 Or maybe it's stars you look forward to. I don't know if even Melissa Errico can get me to Frank Wildhorn's ''Dracula,'' but maybe, maybe. I will definitely be there for Mary-Louise Parker in Craig Lucas's ''Reckless.''
 Some stars lurk backstage. There are playwrights, aside from Mr. Lucas: new work by Bryony Lavery and Michael Frayn (his ''Democracy,'' a hit in London) and Neil LaBute (with an even more LaButian title than usual, ''Fat Pig'') and David Mamet and Charles Busch and Elaine May and Woody Allen. Wallace Shawn is revamping the book and lyrics for ''The Threepenny Opera,'' and there will be still more Stephen Sondheim (yet another staging of the eminently stage-worthy ''Pacific Overtures'').
 In the West End, but no doubt heading our way, the director Richard Eyre and the choreographer Matthew Bourne will try to pump life into ''Mary Poppins.'' Mike Nichols and Eric Idle are staging the film ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' in Chicago with an eye toward moving it to Broadway, under the perhaps unfortunate title of ''Spamalot.''
 Those are just some of the items on one agency's list. Beyond theater, there are seasonal announcements of exhibitions at our major museums. The big opera and dance companies tempt us with their wares. There are concert series at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. Jazz at the flashy new headquarters of Jazz at Lincoln Center in the Time Warner building. Preview lists of forthcoming films.
 It's enough to dizzy the mind, but it's almost as much fun, or more fun, than the actual effort will be next fall of schlepping off to the events you've chosen, paying for parking and dinner and a babysitter, and then being sleepy or bored or both.
 What's fun about anticipation, even if your rational mind suspects that the real thing may be not so hot, is that you can zero in on one aspect of a forthcoming event and ignore, for now, all the other elements. This is known as the Melissa Errico trumps Frank Wildhorn phenomenon.
 The 2004-5 Metropolitan Opera season, for example, looks grimly conservative and unimaginative, presumably reflecting timidity in the wake of the company's recent falloff at the box office. There are only four new productions: Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' (in a Julie Taymor production) and Gounod's ''Faust''; the other two are star vehicles, Handel's ''Rodelinda'' for Renee Fleming and Alfano's ''Cyrnano de Bergerac,'' which, with all due deference to its undoubted, if heretofore well hidden, genius is clearly another sop to Placido Domingo.
 That duly grumbled, delicious, delusory anticipation can still reign. The opera lover can look forward to individual performances: Barbara Frittoli in ''Don Carlo'' and ''Otello,'' for instance, or Karita Mattila in ''Kat'a Kabanova,'' Anne Sofie von Otter in ''Pelleas et Melisande,'' Deborah Voigt in ''Tannhauser,'' and a bunch of Russians (not always the best Russians from the Kirov Opera ''Ring,'' but Russians nonetheless) in ''Die Walkure'' led by Valery Gergiev. And then, for fun, there is the new-music specialist Dennis Russell Davies conducting ''Cav'' and ''Pag''; perhaps he'll do so brilliantly, but on the surface this doesn't sound like playing to an artist's strengths.
 Such are the musings that bedazzle the brain as news about a forthcoming season drifts in and gustatory speculation gets going in earnest. Of course, the very word gustatory should sound an alarm bell. Bertolt Brecht railed against bourgeois ''culinary'' culture. Not culture as confrontation or moral or spiritual or political enlightenment, but culture as good eats. We in New York know all about that kind of gorging. What could be closer to the culinary metaphor of an overweight culture vulture waddling down a table full of promised goodies, pecking away at what might be particularly tasty, salivating over a brochure like a restaurant menu. Calling Neil LaBute: ''Fat Pig'' indeed. 
 But forget Brecht, forget Mr. LaBute, at least for now. Today the goodies on the groaning board look too tempting, and visions of imaginary arts meals dance in our eyes. Who cares, for now, about the economic crunch that makes serious work harder and harder to do on Broadway? Who cares about the paucity of public support for the arts, or underfinanced arts education, or skyrocketing ticket prices? Never mind about those brain-dead Hollywood summer blockbusters and reality television shows and the dearth of vital new composers, conductors and choreographers. Or those imitative pop acts whose highest goal is to sound like someone else.
 Delusions! Phantoms! Munching our lotuses, we can live for now in that blissful season of anticipation, when all seems possible and cruel reality needn't trouble our dreams. We can believe that all the arts are robust, and that our own pleasures as culture consumers will be ample and infinite. For this brief moment, all's well with America and American culture. We'll worry about tomorrow tomorrow.

HEADLINE: City Report Differs With Jets On Gains From Stadium

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Sports and trade-show activity at a proposed $1.4 billion stadium for the Jets will more than cover the cost of the $600 million the city and state want to invest but will produce far fewer jobs and less tax revenue than the team has said, according to a report issued yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office.
 Under the budget office's most optimistic account, the stadium would generate about $28.4 million a year in new city tax revenue, more than enough to cover the $21 million a year in debt service needed for the city's $300 million investment. The state would get $24.9 million from the stadium, $11.9 million less than the Jets have estimated but enough to cover the state's debt service.
 Still, the report said, the stadium tax revenue would be $6.1 million a year less than the Jets said in their report. More important, the stadium would produce barely half the 6,971 permanent jobs estimated by the Jets, according to the report. 
 If the stadium, to be called the New York Sports and Convention Center, attracts only half the number of conventions the Jets predicted, city tax revenue would fall to $22.9 million, about what it would cost the city to service the debt.
 The Jets have said they would invest $800 million in building the stadium, while the city and state would provide a total of $600 million.
 Opponents have criticized the project for weeks, and yesterday its supporters, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, seized on aspects of the report to bolster their contention that the stadium over the West Side rail yards will be a economic engine for the city. The mayor said the report supported ''what we've been saying all along, and that is that this project will be a great economic boon to this city and that the anticipated tax revenues to this city will be much greater than the debt service.'' 
 The Jets described the report as ''pessimistic and inexpert,'' but also praised the budget office for analyzing the project's value as an exhibition hall, not simply as a stadium. All in all, the Jets said, the building will generate about $72 million a year in new state and city tax revenue, or about $30 million more than they believe it will cost the city and state in annual debt payments.
 ''They're halfway right because they analyzed it as both a stadium and as a convention center,'' said Thad Sheely, the Jets' vice president for development. ''They give us 100 percent credit for sports uses but cut the convention business in half and do not provide an accurate assessment of the demand for mid-sized exhibition space in New York City.''
 The budget office's report also raised a number of questions about economic forecasts for the project and the wisdom of such a large public investment. Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, said stadium advocates were not reading the report very closely.
 ''The message we're trying to convey is not exactly the message the Jets and the mayor are spinning,'' she said. ''Our report found that there would be half the jobs the Jets are expecting and significantly less tax revenues for the city. We also found that two-thirds of the tax revenues are coming from convention and exposition activity, rather than football. But we know from past experience at convention centers around the country that those are very speculative assumptions.''
 New convention centers in both Washington and Boston are struggling, in part because of a significant oversupply of exhibition space and the sharp competition between cities for conventions and trade shows.
 Although the Jets predict that the stadium will attract 40 conventions and trade shows a year, Ms. Lowenstein said that expectation had to be treated with some skepticism.
 New York is a hugely attractive destination, she said, but it is not always the choice for cost-conscious conventions and trade shows, because it is also relatively expensive. 
 The average room rate at hotels in New York City is $170.38 per night, 80 percent more than in Orlando, Fla., ($94.58) or Chicago ($96.56), 44 percent more than in San Francisco ($118.19) and 122 percent more than Atlanta ($76.70), according to Smith Travel Research, a leading hotel industry data firm.
 ''New York is an expensive market,'' said Randy Smith, chief executive of Smith Travel. ''As a result, they don't get the convention business that Chicago, Orlando and Las Vegas get. Those are cheaper markets, and they've geared themselves to conventions.''

HEADLINE: On Patrol In Playland

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

DATELINE: PROVINCETOWN, Mass. 

 BODY:
SCENE from a summer of law enforcement: Saturday night in Provincetown, good-time capital of Cape Cod. Just past midnight, Commercial Street is packed. A man of medium build disappears into the shadows between Commercial and the town wharf, outside the public bathrooms, which have been closed for hours.
 Matthew Covino, an intermittent officer with the Provincetown Police, radios in the call: ''Suspicious male by the bathrooms.'' Another officer on foot and the police chief in his Explorer head over to back him up. 
 Officer Covino's flashlight finds the man hiding behind a tree. The officer summons him into the light. The man does not appear to be an I.P. -- an intoxicated person -- or a vandal. Officer Covino, working his second summer in Provincetown, quickly sizes up the situation. He is dealing with an attempted urinator. 
 ''He was fine,'' Officer Covino said later. ''He just had to urinate.'' So Officer Covino decided to let him off with a verbal warning. 
 The chief, Ted Meyer, applauded his sound judgment. On a summer Saturday night, the chief said, ''you have to use some discretion.''
 For the brave men and women who guard the cape by land and by sea, just as for their counterparts in vacation lands across the nation, discretion and judgment are just about the only weapons in their arsenal that get any sort of regular use.
 Whether patrolling the pristine dunescapes of Cape Cod National Seashore, the potentially treacherous waters of Cape Cod Bay and the Atlantic, or the man-made wilds of Provincetown, wearing a badge on most of the cape is less about crime-fighting or life-saving than it is about supervising playtime for Mr. and Ms. America. Each summer, more than three million people flock to the cape in search of lobster rolls and clam bakes or the endless gay parties of Provincetown or simply that nearby-yet-faraway feeling that a cape vacation has been offering since the railroad came to Woods Hole in 1872.
 Sure, the cape has its occasional drownings and disasters. There are drunken drivers, boaters, swimmers. There are stranded seals and stranded toddlers, fistfights and lovers' quarrels. From time to time, there are major drug busts -- crystal meth in the gay clubs of Provincetown, pot plants in the marshlands of Wellfleet. There are countless parking-lot fender-benders. There are Provincetown year-rounders complaining about condoms littering their property.
 But just as most seaside vacationers suffer no fate worse than sunburn and mosquito bites, an empty fish cooler, a poorly sited sand castle or a spurned advance, so a summer weekend for the police in Cape Cod is largely a procession of off-leash dogs on the beach, requests for restroom directions, minor boating infractions and medical crises of the blow-out-a-flip-flop, step-on-a-pop-top variety.
 Even when the crowds swell to their summer maximum, as they will this weekend, said Ranger Scot Bowen of Cape Cod National Seashore, ''It's interesting how busy it can be and yet nothing happens.''
 LAST Friday morning, Ranger Garrett Moynihan made his way across a rolling, sandy field of heath and hog cranberry on Cape Cod National Seashore that was once an Army weapons range. ''Every now and then we'll find some ordnance or some old mortar rounds up here,'' Ranger Moynihan said. 
 Not this morning. The moor led out to a cliff overlooking the beach. Ranger Moynihan looked out and saw no illegal campers below, no traces of unextinguished beach fires. Nothing but a few puffs of morning fog and the surf chafing the coarse sand. 
 Ranger Moynihan, a compact 48-year-old with a bristly mustache, has worked in national parks for most of his life. He has dealt with ginseng poachers in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and illegal immigrants at Big Bend. For the last six years he has patrolled Cape Cod National Seashore, 70 square miles of glorious scenery, a miraculously intact landscape of dune and fen, marsh and beach, pond and forest. During that time, he said, he has made a handful of drunken-driving arrests.
 This spring he spent a night in a boat staking out a bay a few miles up-cape in Orleans, waiting for the men who illegally harvest blood from horseshoe crabs to make medical products. No one showed. He didn't mind. ''I like being outdoors,'' he said. ''You're basically independent most of the time. Every now and then you do some good.''
 Along a sand road winding through a pitch-pine forest on the bay side of Wellfleet, Ranger Moynihan spotted a rare phenomenon in the park: litter. Two Budweiser cans, to be exact. He stopped his Chevy Blazer, picked them up and noticed a crumpled Marlboro pack nearby. ''Next to some coyote scat,'' he pointed out. Ranger Moynihan bagged up the trash and drove on.
 Just across the Wellfleet town line in Truro, his colleague Ranger Scot Bowen came across two more empty beer cans on the shores of Snow Pond. Next to them was a canoe tied to a tree, its owner nowhere in sight. ''People are not supposed to do that,'' Ranger Bowen said. ''I'll check back in a day or two and see if they move it.''
 After checking out a damaged map box at a trailhead, Ranger Bowen returned to his car and put the beer cans in a bag containing several handfuls of Cheetos that he had gathered in a parking lot at Herring Cove Beach in Provincetown the day before. ''They were in a pile, fortunately,'' he said.
 Herring Cove, a curving stretch of sand at the tip of the cape, is one of the world's best-known gay cruising spots, its tall dunes providing shelter for countless trysts. Friday afternoon, though, the dozens of people spread out along the beach near the changing house were all decently dressed.
 If Ranger Bowen had ventured a half-mile up the beach, at least a little later in the day, he could have seen any number of things that were technically illegal: a nude man lying on the sand, a nude man walking down the beach, a nude man with a gray crew cut standing atop a dune and scanning the horizon as if waiting for a ship to come in. 
 But most of the time, Ranger Bowen said, the park rangers do not go too far out of the way to look for naked people. ''If I can walk up on them and they aren't even aware that a park ranger is walking up on them, maybe a family with children could come up the beach and see them,'' he said. ''In that case, they might get a citation. But if you're discreet, nobody's going to notice you.''
 BEING the police chief in a place like Provincetown is not an easy job. The entire economy of the town is built on partying, so enforcing laws too rigidly is bad for business. On the other hand, some degree of decorum must be maintained. When Chief Meyer took office in 2002, complaints came in that his officers were taking too many people into protective custody -- detaining them when they seemed sufficiently intoxicated to pose a threat to themselves or others -- and being a little too aggressive in their sweeps through the semipublic sex spots.
 Gradually, said Chief Meyer, an open-minded man with an easy sense of humor who has worked at police departments in New York, South Carolina, Florida and Texas, he found a balance. ''We're part of the marketing for the town,'' he said. ''If we're about tourism, and we are, then people need to know the cops are courteous.''
 ''Working here, it's what you make of it,'' said Glenn A. Enos, a patrolman and the 35-year-old son of a Provincetown shellfish constable. ''You can be miserable about walking around doing nothing, or you can choose to have a great time and really interact with people and help them.''
 At 8:40 Saturday night, Officer Enos turned his police cruiser onto Commercial Street for the first of the night's many passes up the town's narrow, winding, eternally congested midway. The drag queens were out, drumming up business for their club shows later in the evening. Driving slowly by the Post Office Cafe, Officer Enos gave a salute to Randy Roberts, who was dressed as Cher. Mr. Roberts returned the salute.
 Up Commercial, down Bradford, and up Commercial again, past the Lobster Pot, the Fudge Factory, Toys of Eros, Big Vin's Liquors, the clothing stores with their new stock of ''Just Married'' T-shirts. The street was jammed with evening strollers sipping lemonade, showing their muscles and tattoos, riding bicycles against the traffic.
 Outside John's Footlong hot dogs, Officer Enos slowed the car and shouted out the window at an older woman behind the counter.
 ''Carol,'' he called out. ''What are you doing?''
 ''What are you doing?'' his mother, Carol Enos, called back.
 ''I'm working,'' Officer Enos replied.
 Just after 9, Officer Enos decided to switch to a walking patrol up Commercial. He said hello to Miss Richfield 1981, a six-foot man in a white miniskirt and sugar-frosted white glasses. ''How are you, darling?'' Miss Richfield asked, giving the officer a hug. ''Oooh, you've been working out.''
 At 11, Officer Enos's mother finished her shift at the hot-dog place. She had to get up early to go to 8:30 Mass in the morning, so he gave her a ride home. ''Don't ever get old,'' Mrs. Enos said cheerfully as she got into the car.
 At 1 o'clock, the bars and clubs closed, and in a decades-old Provincetown ritual, most of their denizens gravitated toward Spiritus Pizza, which stays open until 2. To accommodate them, the police close Commercial to cars as hundreds of people mill around in the street, flirting, dancing to the music in their heads and eating slices.
 Chief Meyer stood a few feet away from his cruiser, ignoring several obviously drunk people leaning against it in favor of trading unprintable wisecracks with drag queens and tough-looking women. A sturdily built, well-marinated woman with a flat-top haircut, a black leather jacket and a mostly unbuttoned shirt hung all over him.
 ''Daddy, can I touch your radio?'' asked the woman, who gave her name as Vava, as she hugged the chief.
 ''Are you O.K.?'' he eventually asked.
 ''I'm fine,'' Vava said. ''I'm slightly buzzed.''
 ''You know I worry about you,'' he said.
 As the street cleared out, the chief offered Vava a ride home. He let her off near her house and she wobbled out into the night.
 ''Hey, darling,'' the chief called after her. ''Two more buttons.''
 AT 10:20 the next morning, with the sun streaming down on the wide blue channel of Cape Cod Canal, the four-man crew of a 41-foot Coast Guard utility boat spotted a 25-foot pleasure boat coming the other way with a little girl of about 7 riding on the bow. The utility boat's pilot, Petty Officer Third Class Nicholas Perry, swung a quick U-turn and took off in pursuit.
 ''You don't want to have your children or really anyone on the bow of the boat,'' Petty Officer Third Class David Carson, the boat's boarding officer, told the man behind the wheel. The man, looking slightly embarrassed, brought his daughter astern.
 ''Sometimes people don't understand what they're doing wrong at the time,'' said Petty Officer Carson, an earnest, four-year veteran of the guard who fell in love with the sea growing up on an island off Mobile, Ala. ''But once you explain it to them and they think about it, they realize it makes sense.''
 The Coast Guard station at Cape Cod Canal, at the base of the cape at Sandwich, about 70 miles from Provincetown, is a busy place. Last year, said the officer in charge, Mark Mello, the crews from the station, which covers the bays at either end of the canal, boarded 366 boats.
 Almost all the boardings were routine safety checks, though; unlike the police, Coast Guard officers need no probable cause to search a boat. ''We've increased the amount of boardings we do, and that has decreased the amount of search and rescue cases,'' Chief Mello said. ''Education is the key.''
 In the open water of Cape Cod Bay just west of the canal, the crew pulled over a 23-foot sport fisher out of Plymouth. Petty Officer Carson called out to the pilot of the boat, Paul Connolly, and his passenger, Mark Fazio. ''How you guys doing today? Any weapons on board?''
 ''No,'' replied Mr. Fazio, a 43-year-old with peeling shoulders and a cap reading ''Fidelity Investments.'' ''No weapons of mass destruction, either.''
 ''Excellent,'' said Petty Officer Carson, hopping across to the smaller boat. He peered at the engine. He tested the horn. He tugged the straps on the ''Need Help'' flotation cushion to make sure there were no rips or tears. He checked the dates on the boat's bag of flares. They were expired.
 Petty Officer Carson determined that the boaters planned to head back before sunset and let them off with a warning. ''Thanks a lot,'' he said. ''Probably be seeing you guys again sometime this summer.''
 ''Yep,'' Mr. Connolly replied. He turned up the throttle and headed out into the bay.

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.+ means discounted tickets were at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.++ means tickets were at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.

Broadway

++ * ''ASSASSINS'' (Tony Award winner for best musical revival; direction of a musical; featured actor in a musical, Michael Cerveris; lighting; and orchestration). This is what they always wanted, isn't it? A clear shot at the big time, where people would have to pay attention to them? More than a decade after they first surfaced to critical shudders and head-scratching, the unhappy have-nots of ''Assassins'' -- the glitteringly dark musical by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman about Americans who dream of killing their country's presidents -- have finally made it to Broadway. Accompanied by a sumptuously full orchestra and portrayed by a cast that finds the magnetism in rage and resentment, the frightening title characters of ''Assassins'' are restating their demand to be noticed in this Roundabout Theater Company production. And under Joe Mantello's direction, they are doing so with an eloquence and an intensity that make a compelling case for a show once regarded as a mere curiosity as a major piece from a major composer (1:50). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25 (Ben Brantley).

* ''AVENUE Q'' (Tony winner for best musical, original score and book of a musical). The inspired brainchild of the songwriters Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx, this canny toy chest of a musical takes its stylistic cues from ''Sesame Street,'' from its cheery urban set to its singing puppets of assorted colors and dispositions. And in doing so it becomes the first mainstream musical since ''Rent'' to coo with such seductive directness to theatergoers on the fair side of 40 in their own language, in which irony is less a mind-set than a loosely worn style. Directed by Jason Moore, with a book by Jeff Whitty, the show applies the coaxing, learning-is-fun attitude of children's educational television to the R-rated situations of postcollegiate life in the big city. Featuring a pitch-perfect ensemble of live performers and oversize hand puppets, ''Avenue Q'' is to ''Sesame Street'' what Mel Brooks's ''Producers'' is to vintage Broadway musicals: a connoisseur's tribute to what it only seems to send up (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 and $96.25, with a limited number of $21.25 tickets available by lottery at the theater at 5:30 p.m. for the evening show and at 11:30 a.m. for the matinee (Brantley).

''THE BOY FROM OZ'' (Tony winner for best actor in a musical). Hugh Jackman's shoulders must ache like the devil when he wakes up in the morning. This able-bodied, infinitely appealing young man is spending most of his nights engaged in some painfully heavy lifting that no shoulders, no matter how broad, should be asked to attempt. That's what happens when you put an indisputably authentic star like Mr. Jackman at the center of an indisputably bogus show like ''The Boy From Oz,'' the bathetic musical biography of the Australian entertainer and songwriter Peter Allen, directed by Philip Wm. McKinley. Were it not for Mr. Jackman, there would be no reason to recommend this backstage, back-story look at show business. But let it be said that the electric Mr. Jackman never looks as if he's even thinking about shrugging this soggy cardboard world of a show off his shoulders (2:30). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $101.25 (Brantley).

+ * ''FROZEN.'' For a play centered on a serial murderer of little girls, Bryony Lavery's humane, intelligent drama is striking for its sustained aura of ordinariness. ''Frozen'' is indeed the story of the brutal killing of a child and its repercussions. Yet no trace of sensationalism colors Doug Hughes's beautifully acted, carefully considered production, which stars Swoosie Kurtz (as the child's mother), Brian F. O'Byrne (who won a Tony Award for best featured actor in a play, as the murderer) and Laila Robins (as an academic specializing in serial killers). The characters, who often speak in monologues, don't so much vent their intense emotions as betray them through involuntary eruptions that they quickly stifle. In the age of the Amber Alert and Megan's Law, ''Frozen'' brings a coolly discursive attitude to a hot-button subject. This is not to say it is in any way unfeeling (2:15). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $85 (Brantley).

* ''HAIRSPRAY.'' Portraying the plus-size Baltimore housewife Edna Turnblad, Michael McKean is more creditable than credible. Having appeared in deadpan film mocumentaries like ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' Mr. McKean knows the value of playing comedy straight. He doesn't accessorize Edna's housecoat with overwrought feminine mannerisms, and his timing is dead-on. Yet unlike his Tony Award-winning predecessor, Harvey Fierstein, Mr. McKean never makes that final leap of faith that brings out the woman in a man. This shifts the show's emphasis to the younger generation in this pop fable of racial integration and rock 'n' roll. And Carly Jibson, as the boundary-breaking Tracy Turnblad, and Jennifer Gambatese, as her nerdy best friend, combine the hormonal glow of adolescence with the confidence of old pros. Though ''Hairspray'' can be tedious when preaching via big-throated anthems or satirizing via clunky caricature, it is newly vibrant in bringing out the the randy rhythms in early rock 'n' roll that made parents fear for their children's chastity (2:30) Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan.(212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 to $100, with a limited number of $25 tickets available by lottery at the theater at 5 p.m. for the evening show and at 11 a.m. for the matinee (Brantley).

+ * ''I AM MY OWN WIFE'' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Moises Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (ne Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at box office the day of show (Bruce Weber).

+ * ''JUMPERS.'' Acrobatics aren't just for athletes in this high-flying revival of Tom Stoppard's 1972 play. Though the show features an enthusiastic team of bouncing gymnasts, everyone in ''Jumpers'' jumps, in one way or another -- verbally, emotionally, morally. And with a cast headed by Simon Russell Beale, in a dazzling Broadway debut, such exertions turn this comic mystery of murder, marriage and metaphysics into one of the most entertaining exercise sessions available. Leaps of faith, back-flipping politics, somersaulting, self-inverting words and free-falling nervous breakdowns are all on offer in the restless, relativistic world of ''Jumpers.'' The director, David Leveaux, appropriately serves up a show that never seems to stop spinning. But at the same time, this luscious import from the Royal National Theater of Britain, which also stars the divine Essie Davis, finds a wounded, hungry heart beneath the razzle-dazzle. A play often dismissed as too clever by half now registers clearly as a poignant acknowledgment of the limits of cleverness (2:30). Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m.; Tickets: $60 to $95 (Brantley).

''A RAISIN IN THE SUN.'' Sean Combs's shadow precedes him in this seriously off-center revival of Lorraine Hansberry's epochal drama of an African-American family in Southside Chicago. Will the very 21st-century figure who is Mr. Combs (a k a P. Diddy), whose career has been a triumph of nerve over probability, be able to evoke a man of thwarted dreams from the mid-20th century? Unfortunately, while the opening, engagingly boyish moments of his performance have promise, his Walter Lee Younger never appears to change, happy or sad, drunk or sober. And while Audra McDonald (Tony for best featured actress in a play) and Phylicia Rashad (Tony for best actress in a play) do sterling work as Walter Lee's wife and mother, much of Kenny Leon's production exudes the single-note perkiness of a sitcom. Instead of contrasting the forces of an older, God-fearing generation with a fresh revolutionary spirit (embodied by Walter Lee and his sister, played by Sanaa Lathan), the show becomes an unwitting counterpoint of mature and callow acting styles (2:30). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $91.25 (Brantley).

''SIGHT UNSEEN.'' Laura Linney's emotionally incandescent performance has the effect of entirely shifting the focus of Donald Margulies's fine drama from 1992 about art, time and moral compromise. Theatergoers who saw ''Sight Unseen'' a dozen years ago probably left the show thinking it was about a charismatically egocentric painter who had sold his soul to that old devil, success. Audiences for this revival, directed by Daniel Sullivan, may conclude that it is about a charismatically uncertain woman, played by Ms. Linney, who erases her very sense of self through her love for an egocentric painter. Because she gives the one unconditionally authentic performance in this production, which also features Ben Shenkman in very low gear as the painter, her character becomes the prism through which everything else is refracted. While this creates a lopsidedness that is not to the play's advantage, anyone who has followed Ms. Linney's increasingly impressive career should make a point of seeing her here (2:15). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street. (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8; Sundays at 2. Tickets: $26 to $81 (Brantley).

++ * ''WONDERFUL TOWN'' (Tony winner for choreography). In this captivating revival of Leonard Bernstein's musical love poem to Manhattan, Donna Murphy gives one of the most dazzlingly accomplished performances you're ever likely to see. As the writer Ruth Sherwood, the role Rosalind Russell slayed 'em with in 1954, Ms. Murphy blithely juggles assorted gleaming styles without ever breaking character. If much of Kathleen Marshall's staging of this tale of dewy Ohio sisters from Ohio in New York isn't up to Ms. Murphy, well, what would be? Jennifer Westfeldt is charming as Ruth's boy-magnet of a sister. And the orchestra, under the direction of Rob Fisher, is superb, giving ebullient life to Bernstein's lighthearted city symphony of a score. The wisecracking lyrics are by Comden and Green. Gregg Edelman is the manly object of both sisters' affections (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101 (Brantley).

Off Broadway

+ ''ADDRESS UNKNOWN.'' You don't need to see swastikas to know when there's a Nazi onstage. From the moment William Atherton first appears in Frank Dunlop's dust-caked adaptation of Kathrine Kressman Taylor's short novel from 1938, he bristles with those telltale tics associated with films like ''The Damned'' and ''The Night Porter,'' made when brownshirt psychosexuality was all the rage. Such explicit iconography doesn't serve the best interests of this 75-minute, two-character epistolary drama, directed by Mr. Dunlop and also starring Jim Dale. The old-fashioned literary frissons of Taylor's best seller, one of the first American works of fiction to deal with Nazi anti-Semitism, come from watching a character who seems comfortably familiar turn by degrees into a rabid disciple of Hitler. But while Mr. Dale gives a typically fine-grained performance as the Jewish art dealer who is betrayed by his former best friend (Mr. Atherton's character), that shivery transformation never really registers in this static, literal-minded production (1:15). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40-$65, with a limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the performance (Brantley).

''AFTERBIRTH: KATHY AND MO'S GREATEST HITS.'' Those who live in other people's skins don't need to worry about their own aging flesh. That at least would seem to be the case with Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney, who became comedy cult stars in the 1980's. Whether portraying teenage girls pondering the lessons of ''West Side Story'' or feisty senior citizens in a women's studies class, Ms. Najimy and Ms. Gaffney still seem just as adolescent or geriatric as the occasion demands. Middle-aged audience members who have been rattled by seeing rock idols transformed into Madame Tussaud-ish creatures will receive no similar shock from ''Afterbirth,'' directed by Mark Brokaw. Though they have created a new sketch about cosmetic surgery, these performers (now in their 40's) both look their ages and consistently elude such categorization. If some of their sketches belong firmly to the past, the empathy with which they invest their alter-egos remains very much of the present (2:00) Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton. (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $60. (Brantley).

* ''BRIDGE & TUNNEL.'' Contemporary solo performance takes great craft and generosity. Sarah Jones has both: you see them in every moment of her new show. We're in the Bridge & Tunnel Cafe in South Queens for the annual ''I Am a Poet Too'' reading. The host, Mohammed Ali, a genial Pakistani accountant, proudly explains that the letters in ''I Am a Poet Too'' stand for ''Immigrant and Multiculturalist American Poets or Enthusiasts Traveling Toward Optimistic Openness.'' When Ms. Jones is Mohammed Ali, she dons a sports jacket over black pants and a black shirt. Her tops and accessories change. Her gestures and movements change, too, and multiple characters emerge: a Brooklyn rapper, a Long Island grandmother, a Vietnamese slam poet, an Australian vamp-provocateuse and a Jamaican poet-performer-playwright-actress-spoken word artist. Ms. Jones's ear and voice are flawless, and she is a fine writer, too. Pitch, accent, vocal rhythms and poetry styles: she gets them all. This young performer displays spirit and uncanny accuracy as she portrays a host of immigrants and outsiders who make up this hybrid nation (1:40). 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village. (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $26.50 and $50.50 (Margo Jefferson).

* ''FABULATION OR, THE RE-EDUCATION OF UNDINE.'' How you gonna keep a girl down in the projects after she's seen Park Avenue? That's the high-concept question posed by this busy, robustly entertaining new comedy by Lynn Nottage, the author of the acclaimed (and very different) ''Intimate Apparel.'' It's true that this satiric tale of the humbling of a self-invented public relations diva (an intense Charlyane Woodard) trades neatly on a well-worn chick-flick formula: career-driven, glamorous woman forced to confront the lowly life she thought she had left behind her. But while ''Fabulation,'' directed by Kate Whoriskey, may follow a much-traveled route to a guaranteed destination, the view along the way is far less predictable. The show could definitely benefit from tightening. But in charting the social fall and moral rise of its heroine, ''Fabulation'' subverts its comic and sentimental glibness with punchy social insights and the firecracker snap of unexpected humor (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $40 (Brantley).

''MUSICAL OF MUSICALS -- THE MUSICAL!'' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater, and parody is the best kind of narcissism. So many of today's musicals strut fancy sets and special effects. A good parody needs smart writers and winning performers; ''The Musical of Musicals -- The Musical!,'' a York Theater production, has four, and two of them are the composer Eric Rockwell and the lyricist Joanne Bogart. Taking their plot straight from corny old melodrama, they offer spoof in the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. The Jerry Herman segment is the weakest because his work is the simplest; the pretensions of Lord Lloyd Webber make a better target. The other three are good, zany fun. They have the joie de vivre we want from a musical (1:40). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 5 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Jefferson).

Last Chance

+ ''THE STRAITS.'' Gregory Burke's harshly predetermined drama surely deserves an award for most efficient use of a title. Set in the early 1980's in Gibraltar (as in Straits of), that last tenuous outpost of British colonialism, straits (as in dire) make up the existential condition of the play's four rudderless teenagers. This being 1982, the year of the Falklands War, you can assume that these itchy kids are standing in for an entire empire gone to seed. Directed with economy and flair by John Tiffany, ''Straits'' gilds an established sentimental formula -- young people coming painfully of age during one scorching season at the beach -- with shiny political allegory. (Think of the film ''Last Summer,'' the mean teen favorite of 1969, as reconceived by the playwright and polemicist David Hare.) Subtle it ain't. But this intermissionless drama, part of the estimable Brits Off Broadway festival, is stylishly staged and vividly acted by its young four-member cast: Peter McNicholl, James Marchant, Freddy White and Alice O'Connell (1:30) Theater A at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Brantley).

HEADLINE: City to Build Filtering Plant Under a Park In the Bronx

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
The city will move forward with plans to construct a disputed $1.3 billion water filtration plant under Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the city's environmental commissioner said yesterday.
 ''From the perspective of security and cost, the Van Cortlandt site is by far the best option,'' said Christopher O. Ward, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, after releasing the final draft of the department's environmental impact study. ''The data could not be more clear on this.'' 
 The city considered three possible locations for the filtration plant: under Van Cortlandt park, on a waterfront section along the Harlem River, and on 83 acres of city-owned property in Eastview in Westchester County.
 Last year, environmental protection officials expressed a clear preference for the Van Cortlandt location, but they agreed to study the matter more closely. 
 The Van Cortlandt option would involve excavating a 28 acre-section of the Mosholu Golf Course in the southeastern corner of the park, which is about half a block from the working-class Norwood neighborhood.
 Residents living near the park oppose the plan, arguing that it will create health problems, ruin precious greenery and worsen traffic in the area. 
 ''It's also just a huge waste of money,'' said Gil Maduro, a professor of economics at Baruch University who lives several blocks from the proposed site. ''The Van Cortland option is about $309 million more expensive and it poses steeper engineering challenges than Eastview because it has to be built underground.'' 
 But Mr. Ward said that the numbers being cited by critics were outdated. The most current studies reveal that the Van Cortlandt option would cost $1.3 billion whereas Eastview, the next cheapest option, would have cost $1.8 billion, he said.
 Mr. Ward also pointed out that an additional $243 million worth of park amenities had been included in the Van Cortlandt plan -- $43 million of which will go toward improving Van Cortland and the rest for other parks in the Bronx, he said. 
 ''The Van Cortlandt site has the added advantages that it is closest to those who need the water most, and it is within city limits, thus saving the city from paying unnecessary property taxes to Westchester County,'' Mr. Ward explained.
 ''The city already pays $83 million in local property taxes for city facilities that are situated outside the five boroughs,'' he said.
 During a news conference on Staten Island on Wednesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expressed his support for the Van Cortlandt option. ''Everybody is a winner,'' he said. ''The city will have a better water supply. And the people of the Bronx will benefit dramatically from this.''
 Lyn Pyle, who is the director of The COVE environmental justice committee, a neighborhood association in the Knox Gates neighborhood of the Bronx, calls the decision ''an outrage.'' The plant will involve trucks bringing chemicals in and carrying sludge out, she said. ''This also opens the way for the city to start turning parks into industrial zones.'' 
 To construct the 290-million-gallon-per-day treatment plant, the city will have to blast a hole several hundred feet deep and about as long as two football fields. City officials have promised that once the treatment plant is completed, the golf course will be restored to its original condition.
 The city has burrowed under parks before, most notably Central Park, where it has buried four huge valve chambers, the last one about 25 years ago.

HEADLINE: Japan Survey Puts Optimism At the Highest In 12 Years

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 1 

 BODY:
Business is better than at any time since the collapse of the bubble economy a dozen years ago, according to a survey of Japanese companies released Thursday by the central bank.
 The surprisingly strong results of the Bank of Japan's closely watched Tankan survey of some 10,000 companies showed that the two-year economic recovery remains on track. A wide range of businesses -- from conglomerates to restaurants -- said they were optimistic about their prospects, which reinforces the view that recovery has spread beyond exports, the main driver of growth so far. 
 ''The Tankan suggests that this indeed is the strongest recovery in the post-bubble era,'' said Ryo Hino, an economist at J.P. Morgan Securities Asia. ''It confirms that business conditions continue to improve and that the improvement is widespread.''
 The quarterly survey's benchmark index of large manufacturers, which includes about 1,200 companies, rose to plus 22 in June, from plus 12 in March. The index measures sentiment by subtracting the percentage of companies that say conditions are unfavorable from those that say they are favorable. A positive score means optimists outnumber pessimists. The latest figure was the highest since August 1991, and was the fifth consecutive increase.
 Among the most optimistic companies were steel makers, which have experienced growth thanks to strong demand from Chinese factories.
 The index for large nonmanufacturers rose to plus 9 in June, from plus 5 in March, and was the best score since February 1992, as restaurants and transportation companies grew more optimistic.
 Growing confidence among smaller companies and service providers, which depend closely on domestic demand, was seen as especially encouraging because it suggests a recovery in consumption in Japan. That element was missing from two earlier recoveries that fizzled out in the last decade as initial bursts of export growth faded.
 The survey also showed that companies planned to invest more. Big businesses said that they planned to increase investment an average of 5.7 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2005, compared with an average 0.6 percent cut in investment that they planned just three months ago.
 The rosy survey results follow a period of robust expansion for Japan. The economy grew at an annual 6.1 percent in the first quarter after expanding 7.3 percent in the last quarter of 2003.
 Despite the solid numbers, some economists still harbor doubts about how much longer Japan's growth spurt will last. Growth for the economy as a whole still depends to a great extent on exports to China and the United States, leaving Japan vulnerable to a slowdown in the United States and to attempts by Chinese central bankers to slow that country's expansion.
 A rise in the yen against the dollar could also take some of the steam out of the recovery as a stronger Japanese currency would make exports less profitable.
 Also, there are few signs that ordinary Japanese consumers share the optimism of the country's businesses. The job market has been slowly improving but unemployment among the young remains high. And though Japanese corporations have become much more profitable in recent years, many of the gains have come at the expense of ordinary workers who have seen their wages fall.
 And Thursday's survey presented a mixed outlook for the months ahead. Large manufacturers expect business conditions to deteriorate slightly in the next three months. 
 ''Firms are expecting a higher yen, which is one of the risk factors for the economy,'' said Shuji Shirota, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo. ''We expect some adjustment phase for the Japanese economic recovery early next year.''

HEADLINE: The Fed as Enabler

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Move by the Fed'' (editorial, July 1):
 The Federal Reserve has pursued a low interest rate policy of ''rewarding'' borrowers. In a country where the consumer is already predisposed to buy (while not saving), debt levels have exploded, the inflation genie is out of the bottle, and numerous markets have leveraged themselves to low rates. The Fed needs to raise rates aggressively, but it has created an environment where that is no longer possible.
 In your editorial you liken central banks to ''stern parents who weather their children's criticism because they know there's good reason to impose discipline.'' Well, I would characterize this Fed as an enabler that has allowed the consumer to bury himself in debt.

HEADLINE: Ex-Occupation Aide Sees No Dent in 'Saddamists'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Mark Glassman contributed reporting from New Orleans for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
More than a year of intensive efforts by the American military and the Central Intelligence Agency to destroy the insurgency in Iraq has failed to reduce the number of ''hard-core Saddamists'' seeking to destroy the interim Iraqi government, a former senior official of the just-dissolved American-led occupation authority said in an interview on Thursday.
 The senior official, speaking with a small group of reporters near the White House, said he was repeatedly ''disappointed we haven't had better insight into the command and control of the insurgents.''
 The official was touching on one of the continuing mysteries of the insurgency: how has a relatively small rebel force organized, and how can it be broken? In recent days, other officials have offered varying assessments on this question. Last Friday, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, speaking at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said: ''Someone's giving general orders, and other people are following them. I think that's clear.'' 
 But Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a few minutes later that ''whether it's a central nervous system or some other form of coordination'' was an open question and that ''the intelligence community, as far as I know, will not tell you, will not give you an answer, because they can't give me an answer.''
 On Thursday, the former senior occupation official estimated that the number of insurgents had stayed constant at 4,000 to 5,000, suggesting that as soon as they are killed or captured, they have been replaced.
 ''I have seen no evidence that the number has changed,'' he said, adding that ''the intelligence on this stuff is not as good as it should be.''
 Moreover, said the former senior official, who has spent more than a year in Iraq and had access to the highest-level intelligence, American officials had found it ''almost impossible to penetrate'' the network organized by the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is believed responsible for many of the suicide bombings that have killed both American troops and Iraqis. 
 The official also said that over the last year, both Iran and Syria had stepped up their activity in Iraq, and that the Iranians might have been financing Moktada al-Sadr, the young radical cleric whom the Bush administration first promised to capture or kill, then decided had to be spared to avoid urban warfare in Najaf, his stronghold. The Iranians have ''become more active over time, and not helpful,'' the official said, though he said intelligence indicated that far more foreign fighters were coming over the border from Syria than from Iran.
 Taken together, the description of the paucity of intelligence still available to the 138,000 American troops in Iraq and the assessment of how few inroads have been made at reducing the insurgency sounded a very different note from the optimistic-sounding messages that President Bush has been sending all week about the prospects of the new Iraqi government. 
 In fact, when officials speak on the record -- from Baghdad to Washington to New Orleans -- they describe an Iraq that is making significant political and economic progress, despite the insurgency.
 A specific cause for optimism involved economic policy, in the view of former American administrator in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, who left Baghdad on Monday. He said in Washington that he was convinced that the just-disbanded occupation authority had ''accomplished quite a lot,'' and had succeeded in ''introducing the concept of a devolution of power and the balance of power'' for a new Iraqi government.
 ''We have tried to find ways to make sure that not all decisions are made in Baghdad, as they have been for the past thousand years,'' he said.
 On Thursday in Washington, Mr. Bremer ticked off a series of economic reforms that he enacted before leaving Baghdad: balanced budgets -- a contrast, he acknowledged with a grin, to the deficits run by the United States -- a new currency and openness to foreign investment. 
 Yet the insurgency, Mr. Bremer said, ''will be very hard to root out,'' and ''stopping corruption is going to take time.'' But he concluded: ''Can they get security enough under control to hold that credible elections will be held in January? I believe they can.''
 While Mr. Bremer spoke in Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, in a political speech at the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, argued that the Clinton administration, which he never actually named, allowed a series of crises to brew, all of which, he argued, the Bush administration had to tackle after Inauguration Day in 2001. 
 ''When we took office,'' Mr. Cheney said, Pakistan was in danger of falling to Islamic extremists, ''terrorists were also receiving support in Saudi Arabia,'' and Libya, North Korea and Iran were acquiring arms from A. Q. Khan, the former head of Pakistan's main nuclear laboratory.
 ''All of these dangers were gathering,'' he said. ''In short, this was the situation when President Bush and I came to office: a world where terrorists were emboldened by years of being able to strike us with impunity.''
 The former senior occupation official, speaking in Washington on condition of anonymity at the request of the White House, described a situation in which efforts to cut off the influx of foreign terrorists entering Iraq had been only partly successful.
 He said that the Syrian border ''was the most important one where foreigners were coming in, and terrorists,'' but that the number could not be reliably quantified. The captured fighters were ''mostly Syrian -- there were Sudanese, Yemenis, some Saudis and then the odd Egyptian and Moroccan.'' Many of the foreign fighters had contacts both with former Hussein forces, he said, and with Mr. Zarqawi's network, but it was unclear who was coordinating their entry, if anyone.
 He appeared less concerned about the appeal of the Zarqawi fighters, who he said were reviled in much of Iraq. The Hussein insurgents are a more significant threat, he said, in part because they are supported by an outer ring of ''less hard-core'' supporters, including teenagers and others paid to shoot rocket-propelled grenades at passing American troops.

HEADLINE: Factory Index Strong, but Job Claims Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A gauge of manufacturing held close to a 20-year high in June and construction spending increased for a fourth consecutive month, reinforcing forecasts that the economy is expanding, according to reports released yesterday. 
 Separately, though, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, up 1,000, to 351,000. It was the second consecutive increase; Bloomberg survey economists had forecast a drop instead, to 342,000. The four-week moving average of claims, which tends to smooth out weekly fluctuations, also rose -- to 347,000 from 344,500. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's factory index was 61.1 in June after a reading of 62.8 in May. The index, where readings above 50 signal expansion, reached 63.6 in January, the highest since December 1983. 
 Economists had expected a reading of 61 in the factory index. The index has indicated expansion every month since June 2003, and has exceeded 60 for eight consecutive months, the longest such stretch since February 1984. Gauges of production, new orders, inventories, export orders and employment all showed increases in June.
 ''The manufacturing sector remains quite strong, even if the rate of growth is cooling a bit,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa. Factories ''are hiring more people and have even started building inventories.''
 Construction spending rose 0.3 percent in May, the Commerce Department said. The increase pushed construction spending to a record annual pace of $988.5 billion in May, bolstered by a 0.8 percent gain in home construction. April's revised gain was 1.2 percent. Home building will add to growth in coming months as builders fill orders, economists say.
 Today, the Labor Department is to report employment figures for June. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that 250,000 jobs were added. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in four years amid stronger growth and ''somewhat elevated'' inflation.
 Jobless benefit claims have averaged 347,200 a week this year, about 55,000 fewer than last year's average. Claims are ''consistent with a continued strong labor market,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc., ''because we don't think claims can get much lower in a market of this size.''

HEADLINE: Ford and G.M. Sales Both Fell More Than 11% in June

BYLINE: By FARA WARNER

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 1 

 BODY:
General Motors and Ford Motor said Thursday that their United States sales for June had double-digit declines, as Detroit continued to lose ground to Japanese and Korean rivals. 
 Over all, sales in the United States were weaker than expected, down 5.97 percent from a year ago, when adjusted for an extra sales day this year, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars and light trucks tumbled to 15.4 million in June from 17.8 million in May, Ward's said.
 Sales in June suffered in part from unusually strong sales in May -- helped by incentives and sales to car rental fleets -- which could not be sustained, as well as from difficult comparisons to June 2003, when aggressive incentive programs helped sales. 
 ''It's fair to describe the month as disappointing,'' said Paul Ballew, chief sales analyst at General Motors, ''but from a broader perspective, the industry is closely tracking what we expected earlier this year.''
 Signs of a softer market for cars run counter to recent reports -- on consumer confidence and personal consumption -- that point to increased spending by consumers. The auto industry, which has been promoting sales since 2001 with big cash and financing incentives, may have trouble keeping growth strong in the months ahead.
 ''We have been jamming the system aggressively since 2001 with aggressive promotions and incentives,'' said Joe Phillippi, a principal with AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J. ''We've been pushing 16 to 17 million units a year for more than six years, and there is an issue of saturation that we are going to have to contend with.'' 
 But higher consumer interest rates, in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to raise its benchmark rate a quarter of a percentage point, are not expected to have an impact on sales, at least in the short term. Automakers, especially the domestic automakers, are likely to choose to absorb the higher cost of borrowing money -- at the expense of profitability -- rather than ratchet down incentives. That is especially true for Ford and General Motors, which are both sitting on higher-than-normal inventories going into the summer selling season. 
 General Motors had more than 1.35 million vehicles sitting on dealer lots at the end of June.
 ''That's 150,000 units too high,'' Mr. Ballew of G.M. said. ''We definitely need to pick up the pace through the second half of 2004 and through 2005.''
 With supply that high, the only way to move cars is to offer incentives for the rest of the year, said Jesse Toprak, director of pricing and analysis at Edmunds.com. ''The $4,000 or $5,000 rebates we have been seeing won't go away.''
 General Motors reported sales declines in several important segments, including its highly profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles. The Chevrolet Silverado, the country's second-best-selling truck, was off 11.8 percent, and the Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicle slid 26 percent. The company's one bright spot was Cadillac, with a 10 percent increase in sales in June. Over all, G.M. sales were down 15.4 percent.
 Ford, including Volvo and Land Rover, reported an 11.9 percent decline in overall sales.
 DaimlerChrysler, which includes the Chrysler Group and Mercedes-Benz, posted a slight increase in sales, 0.68 percent, helped by strong sales in the Chrysler Group for its new 300C sedan and the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle. But those sales gains were offset by double-digit declines for the group's PT Cruiser, Pacifica and Jeep Grand Cherokee brands.
 Many Asian automakers, however, were not disappointed with the month's sales.
 Hyundai Motor America's sales were up 19 percent, with strong sales growth for the Sonata sedan and the Santa Fe sport utility vehicle.
 Hyundai, once a perennial bottom dweller on quality ratings, has recently won several quality awards, bolstering its profile among consumers. 
 Both Honda Motor and Toyota Motor were able to rack up sales increases as well, despite having strong sales in June 2003.
 Honda's sales rose 1 percent, with big increases in its minivans and small sport utility vehicles, and Toyota's sales were up 5 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
 While gas prices have eased somewhat in the last few weeks, James Press, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Toyota Motor Sales, said he had noticed that sales of many of Toyota's high-gas-mileage cars had increased while sales of less-fuel-efficient vehicles had declined.
 Sales of the Sequoia, a sport utility vehicle, were down almost 20 percent in June, but the company cannot make enough of its hybrid electric-gas vehicle, the Prius, to keep up with demand.

HEADLINE: Bush Marks Anniversary of the Civil Rights Act

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
President Bush marked the 40th anniversary of the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on Thursday, telling an audience at a White House ceremony that the United States has been a better place since the law was passed but that the problem the legislation addressed has yet to be eradicated.
 ''The work of equality is not done, because the evil of bigotry is not finally defeated,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Yet the laws of this nation and the good heart of this nation are on the side of equality, and as Dr. King reminded us, we must not rest until the day when 'justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.''' 
 Mr. Bush spoke in the East Room of the White House, where on July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law, a day after it passed the Senate, 73 to 27. Among those present on Thursday was Luci Baines Johnson Turpin, President Johnson's daughter, and Mr. Bush spoke admiringly of the roles played by Johnson and President John F. Kennedy in proposing the act and getting it passed.
 ''It was more than the force of Johnson's personality that helped win the day,'' Mr. Bush said of his fellow Texan. ''It was the force of President Johnson's conviction on behalf of a just cause. As a young man, he'd seen the ugly effects of discrimination. As president, he was determined to fight it by law regardless of the political risk.''
 Although Mr. Bush's remarks transcended election-year partisanship and reflected what his aides say is a deep and longstanding commitment to racial reconciliation, there was still politics in the air. 
 Mr. Bush has long sought to broaden his party's base of support and to eat away at the hold Democrats have had on big majorities of black voters and other minorities, especially Hispanics, by casting himself as a ''compassionate conservative'' whose policies promote social equality and economic opportunity for all people. 
 Mr. Bush received about 8 percent of the black vote in 2000, down from 12 percent for Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996. He did better among Hispanic voters, getting 31 percent compared with Mr. Dole's 21 percent. But the White House political team has long viewed winning over more minority voters as an urgent imperative because of the rapid growth in the nonwhite population.
 Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, calculated several years ago that if the Republican ticket were to take the same percentages of the Hispanic, black and white vote in 2004 as it did in 2000, it would lose the popular vote by three million ballots and the Electoral College. In 2000, Mr. Bush received 544,000 fewer votes than Al Gore but won the Electoral College.
 Asked about Mr. Bush's record on civil rights and racial matters, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Thursday that the president could point to ''a record of accomplishment.'' In particular, he cited Mr. Bush's advocacy of the education bill passed early in his term, which had a strong emphasis on improving performance among underperforming schools in poor neighborhoods. He also pointed to an increase in the minority homeownership rate and what he said was vigorous enforcement of civil rights laws by the Justice Department.
 The presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has been trying to shore up support among minority voters. On Thursday the Kerry campaign attacked Mr. Bush's record on racial issues. The Kerry campaign said Mr. Bush had nominated federal judges who wanted to roll back civil rights, sought to curtail affirmative action programs in university admissions, underfinanced the education bill and cut back on civil rights cases at the Justice Department.
 ''When it comes to civil rights, the gap between what George Bush likes to tout and what he's actually done is enormous,'' Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: New Governor Vows Integrity In Connecticut

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN and STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 1 

 BODY:
Vowing to help end ''the culture of corruption that has plagued our state for far too long,'' M. Jodi Rell took the oath of office on Thursday as Connecticut's 87th governor. It was a simple but dignified ceremony that aides said was intended to set the tone for the new administration.
 Addressing a supportive crowd of 1,000 from the steps of the Capitol, Mrs. Rell reassured the crowd in a calm manner and frank tone that her administration would break with any practices that had brought shame to state government. She minced few words in describing the ''profound disappointment and disillusionment'' felt by many about the ''seemingly unrelenting series of events'' that helped usher her predecessor, John G. Rowland, out of office with two years left on his third term, catapulting her into power. 
 Nor was it lost on some in the crowd that Mrs. Rell addressed these issues with more candor than Mr. Rowland did in his last public appearance on June 21, when he announced that he was resigning.
 Mr. Rowland's announcement brought a halt to the hearings and an investigation by a legislative panel that had been weighing since January whether to recommend his impeachment. A federal grand jury is also investigating Mr. Rowland and others in connection with the awarding of state contracts.
 Mr. Rowland was not at the ceremony, and aides would not say what his plans are or how he was spending the day. On Wednesday, he issued a statement expressing ''great faith in Connecticut'' and confidence in Mrs. Rell, who had served as his lieutenant governor since 1995. ''I know our government will be in very good hands,'' he said.
 In her speech, Mrs. Rell drew applause when she promised not to allow ''the actions of a relative few to tarnish all who serve, or more significantly to discourage future generations from answering their call to service.''
 To that end, she announced from the dais Executive Order No. 1, effective immediately, imposing stricter ethics restraints on state employees. Last week, Mrs. Rell announced that she would be hiring Rachel Rubin, a lawyer formerly with the State Ethics Commission, to serve as the chief public integrity officer in her cabinet. On Thursday, Mrs. Rell promised that Ms. Rubin would report directly to her and ''work with enforcement agencies on matters involving corruption, unethical practices or alleged abuses of public authority.''
 Her tone softened only when she asked the crowd to ''take a moment to acknowledge that these have been very difficult and trying times for everyone, including Governor Rowland and his family.''
 ''My thoughts and prayers are with them,'' she said, ''and I ask you to think of them and remember them as well.''
 Mrs. Rell's speech did not deviate much from her printed remarks handed out to the news media. The one exception was the addition of the word ''all'' to her final ''thank you,'' a hint of the childhood years she spent in Virginia before moving to Brookfield, Conn., with her husband, Louis R. Rell, now a retired pilot, in 1969. 
 Walking to the steps, holding her husband's hand, after bagpipes from the Connecticut Firefighters Pipes and Drums had announced her arrival, Mrs. Rell was received by a 19-gun salute, two more than lieutenant governors are accorded.
 She was sworn in by Chief Justice William J. Sullivan of the Connecticut Supreme Court. On the dais were her two grown children, Meredith and Michael, as well as dozens of dignitaries, including former Gov. William A. O'Neill.
 Kevin B. Sullivan, 55, a Democrat who had been the Senate president pro tempore, was sworn in two hours later as lieutenant governor.
 Mrs. Rell, 58, stated the obvious when she told the crowd that she had not sought out this moment ''through the normal course of electoral politics, but little has seemed normal over the past several months.''
 She added, ''It has been a moment in history that we never thought we would see, and fervently hope that we never see again.''
 Mrs. Rell provided few specifics about her agenda over the next two years, other than to say that she would work ''to create jobs and grow our economy'' and would offer initiatives on ''the economy, education and campaign finance reform.''
 ''The tone of her speech was appropriate and proper,'' said United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who, like many Democrats present at the swearing-in ceremony pledged to support the new Republican governor.
 ''We're all very conscious of how she arrived,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''She did not seek the job, and she deserves the support of everyone.''
 Robert M. Ward, a Republican from North Branford who is House minority leader, said the purpose of Thursday's address was to restore public trust, not lay out a platform. He said the ''grace and poise'' displayed by Mrs. Rell ''exemplifies the Jodi Rell I know.'' He said he was also impressed that she tackled head-on the sad fact that ''there's been corruption in Connecticut.''
 Though the inauguration, by design, had fewer of the trimmings than past ceremonies, Mrs. Rell looked comfortable in the spotlight and lingered for a few minutes after the ceremony to shake hands with well-wishers. The ceremony was followed by lunch upstairs in the Capitol in her new second-floor office.
 Mrs. Rell has brushed back speculation on whether she will run in the election of 2006. ''Obviously, if Jodi Rell wants to run, she's obviously going to have the support,'' said Chris Healy, a Republican strategist.
 ''If she doesn't, Aniskovich is the strongest candidate and who knows what will happen between now and then,'' Mr. Healy added, referring to William A. Aniskovich, the Senate minority leader pro tempore.
 Meanwhile, in a concrete sign that a new administration has arrived in Hartford, the state's Department of Transportation began patching -- though not replacing -- about 70 signs bearing the governor's welcome posted on highways and parking lots throughout the state. Workers fanned out in the afternoon to chip away Mr. Rowland's name from the signs or, in some cases, apply an overlay with Mrs. Rell's name. The expected cost of the makeover is $6,000, according to Pam Sucato, the department's spokeswoman.
 Though she was introduced as ''Her excellency, M. Jodi Rell,'' as is customary, many visitors to the Capitol spoke about her simply as ''Jodi.'' Mr. Rowland once broke off a union negotiation because he felt disrespected when someone called him by his first name. Mrs. Rell's spokesman, Dennis Schain, said that while his boss is ''friendly and accessible,'' he hopes people will address her in a way befitting her office.
 ''I think it's too late,'' said Diane Farrell, the first selectwoman of Westport and a Democratic candidate for Congress in November. ''We've known Jodi as Jodi for so many years, and that's part of her attraction, that she's accessible.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Central Bank Declines to Follow Fed

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 1 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve may have heralded a new era for global monetary policy, with its long-awaited lifting of interest rates this week. But the European Central Bank served notice that the world's second-largest economic bloc will not join the upward march.
 The central bank announced on Thursday that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent -- a decision as widely expected as the Fed's modest rate increase had been the day before. 
 Europe's major economies are rebounding, but with far less vigor than the United States. Inflation, while stubbornly above the threshold preferred by the European Central Bank, poses less of a risk today than it did last month, when crude oil was trading at more than $40 a barrel.
 Some analysts detected a tougher tone in the statement released after the bank's meeting, particularly its emphasis on risks from inflation. That, they said, could open the door to a rate increase later this year.
 But the general murkiness of the outlook led the bank to refrain from tightening its policy, despite the shift toward higher rates in the United States, as well as in Britain, Switzerland and Poland.
 ''We are not influenced in any respect by what has been decided across the Atlantic, or what has been decided in the past across the Channel, or what has been decided elsewhere in the world,'' the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said at a news conference here.
 ''The U.S. is the U.S., the euro area is the euro area,'' he added. ''We are in different universes, with different fundamentals, with different episodes in the business cycle.''
 Some economists took issue with that, noting that Europe and the United States face the same dangers, chief among them the effect of expensive oil on consumer prices. Still, they said his comment was significant because it betrayed renewed concern about the fitful pace of growth here.
 ''This was quite a stark statement,'' said Jorg Kramer, chief strategist at Invesco, an asset management firm in Frankfurt. ''It was an implicit admission that growth is weak in the euro zone.''
 Retail sales in Germany declined 1.5 percent in May from April, underscoring the fragility of Europe's largest economy. Few economists expect Germany to relapse into recession, but the Ifo Institute's closely followed survey of business confidence has shown a decline for two consecutive months.
 The central bank also seems resigned to a period of uncomfortably high inflation. Europe's inflation rate edged down to 2.4 percent in June, from 2.5 percent in May, but remains above the bank's 2 percent target. Mr. Trichet said that might persist through the first half of 2005.
 Wading into a tense political issue, Mr. Trichet warned labor unions not to push for wage increases during negotiations this year. The bank is worried about so-called second-round effects of inflation.
 Siemens signed a landmark contract last week with Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall, that extends the workweek to 40 hours, from 35 hours, but does not increase the hourly wage.
 With the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, facing criticism for waiting too long to raise rates, Mr. Trichet studiously avoided being drawn into a discussion of whether central banks loosen policy too readily in downward cycles, but resist rate increases during upswings.
 ''It is a theoretical question of great importance,'' Mr. Trichet said.

HEADLINE: Some at Fed Raised Inflation Concerns in May

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
Nearly two months before the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates on Wednesday, some board members made it clear that they were more worried about inflation than Alan Greenspan was.
 According to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee on May 4, several members were dubious about an assertion by Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the labor market and factory capacity still had enough slack to allow for rapid growth without rising prices. The minutes were made public on Thursday. 
 Some members of the committee, which sets interest rates, also had misgivings about Mr. Greenspan's attempt to reassure investors by asserting that the Fed could probably afford to raise interest rates at a gradual or ''measured'' pace.
 Though the Fed minutes provide a highly sanitized summary of discussion among the 19 committee members, the minutes from May suggest at least some unease with Mr. Greenspan's sanguine view that most signs of inflation stemmed from transitory events rather than a pickup in underlying price trends.
 The issue is central as the Federal Reserve now begins to reverse one of the most prolonged periods of cheap money in the country's history.
 On Wednesday, the central bank raised the federal funds rate on overnight loans to 1.25 percent from 1 percent, the first rate increase in four years, and made it clear that more increases are on the way.
 But some analysts complain that Mr. Greenspan has kept rates too low for too long, allowing an accumulation of inflationary pressures that could force the central bank to impose painful measures in the future.
 In their public comments, Fed officials have been remarkably uniform in their views.
 Almost without exception, most officials have endorsed Mr. Greenspan's view that recent jumps in consumer prices have largely been caused by one-time factors like a run-up in prices for oil and many commodities.
 The meeting on May 4 came at a critical turning point, because all Fed officials seemed to agree that they would need to start raising rates sooner rather than later. The big issue was how fast to proceed, and Mr. Greenspan had said that he saw no need to rush.
 The May minutes offer no evidence of a heated conflict, but they do reveal a skepticism about the benign pace of inflation.
 ''Some members saw underlying inflation as relatively stable and put low odds on the probability that prices now were accelerating,'' the minutes recounted. ''Others, however, were less confident about the degree of restraint on prices, noting that inflation predictions based on estimated output or employment gaps were subject to considerable error.''
 The reference to output gaps was a reference to a view of Mr. Greenspan and many other officials that unemployment remains relatively high even though the economy has expanded at a rapid pace since last summer and although job creation has surged since January.
 Some board members also apparently balked at the best way to hint about future rate increases.
 At the close of the meeting on May 4, the committee declared that inflation was low enough that rates could be increased at a ''pace that is likely to be measured.''
 But some Fed officials feared they would be boxed into a position that might be inappropriate if signs of inflation became more pronounced.
 ''A number of policy makers were concerned that such an assertion could unduly constrain future adjustments,'' the minutes reported.

HEADLINE: Charting the Road Ahead, And Taking a Bit of Advice

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 1 

 BODY:
Pick two or three priorities within reach, starting with ethics. Ask every commissioner to submit a letter of resignation. And keep your house in Brookfield, so that you do not have to move full time into the mansion where Gov. John G. Rowland and his family have lived for the last nine years.
 That is the advice that many old hands in government had this week for Connecticut's new governor, M. Jodi Rell. Signs are she's already moving in those directions. 
 ''She certainly has the qualifications and the personality to step in at this type of situation that we have,'' said former Gov. William A. O'Neill, delicately.
 He said she could expect a one-year respite from partisan infighting, in part because of the circumstances and in part because the legislative session does not begin until January. But, he said, ''She's got to work the crowd.''
 As a former lieutenant governor himself, who ascended in 1980 when his fellow Democrat Ella T. Grasso resigned because of failing health, he had one other piece of advice for Mrs. Rell: ''The more publicity she gets, the better known she'll become.''
 A Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday shows that his assessment about her name recognition's being low is correct. Of those polled, 34 percent said they had a favorable opinion of Mrs. Rell, and only 7 percent had mixed or negative views about her. But the largest segment, 59 percent, said they had not even heard of her.
 Her tough talk on ethics has already made a favorable impression. The first hire she announced was Rachel Rubin, a lawyer who testified on ethics rules during the recent legislative hearings weighing whether to recommend impeachment of Mr. Rowland. Mrs. Rell has also given Ms. Rubin wide berth to propose reforms and root out corruption. ''That was her first real act, and I think it speaks volumes,'' said Chris Healy, a Republican strategist.
 Now, the new governor must decide whom to prune from the administration.
 ''She has to show it's not all talk,'' said Edward L. Marcus, the former head of the state Democratic Party. High on his list of who should go is Arthur H. Diedrick, the chairman of the Connecticut Development Authority. As a witness in the impeachment hearings, Mr. Diedrick had a hard time recalling much about the $3.6 million loan guarantee that his agency gave to a company controlled by one of Mr. Rowland's friends, Robert V. Matthews.
 Stanley A. Twardy Jr., a Republican who was chief of staff under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., said his inclination was also to clean house. ''Everybody has to go, whether it's on July 2 or Labor Day,'' he said.
 But Howard Reiter, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Connecticut, said: ''It's kind of like de-Baathification in Iraq. You can get rid of everybody, but you'll throw out some good people along with the mediocre.''
 Opinion seems split on one member of the former administration, Marc Ryan, the secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. Though he was intimately involved in just about every major project undertaken by the Rowland administration, he also has fans.
 Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat who was speaker of the House and is now a partner at a Hartford law firm, said the General Assembly has great faith in Mr. Ryan ''because when you shake hands with him, the deal is done, which is much different than the people who preceded him.''
 Mrs. Rell's inaugural speech gave few clues to the agenda she will embrace in the two years left in her term. She briefly mentioned a desire to ''create jobs and grow our economy'' and promised to introduce initiatives on ''the economy, education and campaign finance reform.''
 Unclear in those statements is whether she will maintain Mr. Rowland's vigorous, but costly aid to towns and cities. That has been a crowd pleaser in the state's Democratic enclaves, but it might thwart Mrs. Rell from her stated goal as a fiscal conservative of helping to replenish the state's rainy day funds, a crowd pleaser on Wall Street.
 ''If they cut aid to cities and towns she'll have a hard time,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''If she cuts the Department of Agriculture, I don't think anyone will care.''
 The future of state aid was not on the mind of Mayor John Fabrizi of Bridgeport, a Democrat. He was trying to buttonhole the new governor to see if she got his five-page letter about restoring the public trust. ''That's the No. 1 priority,'' he said. 
 Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, a Democrat who said he will run for governor in 2006, wanted to dwell a bit on the breakdowns in good government that led to this day. He said Mrs. Rell should create a blue-ribbon commission to analyze the lessons that can be gleaned from recent events including the unfinished impeachment inquiry. ''The idea you spent $4 million to $5 million investigating and that stuff is just packed in boxes is troubling,'' he said.
 Where the governor puts her head on the pillow at night will also be laden with symbolism. Unlike Mr. Rowland, who spent nine years cosseted in a state-owned, Georgian-style mansion on Prospect Avenue, Mrs. Rell will still call Brookfield home, her aides say.
 ''I think it's important that a governor is rooted in the everyday rigmarole of life,'' Mr. Healy said. ''I'm pretty sure she's going to keep her residence because that is what keeps her grounded.''
 Thomas J. Meskill, a former governor who is now a senior judge on the Second Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, resisted offering advice because he has been out of politics since 1975. ''I would not give anyone advice,'' he said, ''as long as they honor their oath of office. That's all we can ask.''

HEADLINE: Bush and Kerry Campaigns Vying for Rural Supporters

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: CLOQUET, Minn., July 1 

 BODY:
Four years ago, George W. Bush won some of his biggest and most decisive margins among rural and small-town voters. 
 But Democrats say that economic troubles and the war in Iraq have taken a disproportionate toll on rural communities. They vow that the struggle for these voters will be -- must be -- far more competitive this time around. So Senator John Kerry will come on Friday to Cloquet, not far from Duluth, and kick off a three-day, Independence weekend bus tour across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, trying to connect with small-town America. 
 The Republicans are hardly ceding this political ground. The Bush campaign fired off a rough bon voyage to Mr. Kerry on Thursday, with a news release headlined, ''Top 10 Reasons Why John Kerry is Wrong for Rural America.'' (No. 1 was his opposition to Mr. Bush's tax cuts, while No. 4 was his ''F'' rating from the National Rifle Association.)
 And Vice President Dick Cheney will embark this weekend on his own bus tour, beginning in Parma, Ohio, passing through West Virginia's northern panhandle, ending up in western Pennsylvania, at a baseball game in Altoona.
 It will be a battle of heartland imagery as Mr. Kerry tries to show a different side from the urban, liberal Northeasterner so often caricatured by his Republican opponents -- to show rural voters that ''he looks like them, talks like them, and cares about them,'' as John Norris, his national field director (who hails from Iowa), puts it.
 Mr. Kerry will listen to the concerns of farmers in Bloomer, Wis.; eat barbecue with voters in Independence, Iowa, and watch the fireworks on the Mississippi River near Dubuque. He might even do some shooting, as he did during the Iowa caucus campaign last year. He will also meet with veterans and military families along the way, in a region where many have a personal connection to a soldier in Iraq.
 Past elections show just how important this effort is for the Democrats. Bill Clinton held his own among rural voters in both his presidential campaigns, losing that bloc by only a few points to President George Bush in 1992 and Senator Bob Dole in 1996, according to surveys of voters leaving polling places.
 But the rural vote, which amounted to 23 percent of the electorate in 2000, broke decisively, 59 percent to 37 percent, for Mr. Bush four years ago, according to those surveys, while Vice President Al Gore carried the cities and the two men split the suburbs.
 Republicans say they are confident that rural voters will in the end make the same judgment about Mr. Bush that they made four years ago -- that he understands them, shares their cultural values on issues like abortion restrictions and the rights of gun owners and is, essentially, one of them.
 Matthew Dowd, the pollster for the Bush campaign, said that, if anything, Mr. Kerry, given his background and voting record as a Massachusetts Democrat, would have an even harder time making inroads with these voters than did Mr. Gore, who had represented Tennessee in the Senate.
 The Republican trend among rural voters has been building for a decade, Mr. Dowd said, in large part because ''they finally decided on a variety of social and cultural issues that the Democrats don't stand for the same things that they stand for.'' 
 That was clearly reflected in the views of Jon and Fay Haataja, a police officer and a stay-at-home mother of three from nearby Esko, heading to breakfast this morning at the Family Tradition Restaurant. Mrs. Haataja said ''moral issues'' were uppermost for her, and added, ''We're going to vote for the president.''
 Bill McInturff, another Republican pollster, said that ''the notion that there's some consensus in rural America shifting in this race seems to me to be substantially overblown.'' Mr. Bush may have slipped some among rural women because of Iraq and the economy, he added, but Republicans can make up that ground by election time.
 But Democrats say that times have changed. The loss of manufacturing jobs, the ''outsourcing'' of jobs overseas and the continued troubles in the farm economy have put the economic agenda front and center in these communities, they say. 
 Dealing with rising health insurance costs, a main part of Mr. Kerry's program, is even more important in towns with many struggling small businesses. And with the disproportionate number of retirees in many of these communities, preserving traditional Medicare and Social Security looms large, Democrats say.
 At the same time, Mr. Kerry's aides say, the campaign is not giving ground on some of the key cultural issues. ''We will do things to make sure people understand that guns should not be an issue because John Kerry is a sportsman, a hunter,'' said Mr. Norris, who helped Mr. Kerry win the Iowa caucuses earlier this year. While Mr. Kerry has supported some ''gun safety'' issues like the ban on assault weapons, the Kerry campaign says, the candidate is firmly committed to protecting the Second Amendment.
 His latest biography advertisement, in fact, declares, ''He's a husband and father, a pilot, a hunter, a hockey player,'' and shows an image of Mr. Kerry hunting.
 Moreover, aides say they will simply fight harder for rural votes this time. They are sending organizers to many rural communities, they said. 
 ''And we are going to talk to them more directly than any Democratic presidential candidate has talked to them in years,'' Mr. Norris said.
 Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who says Mr. Bush has already suffered erosion with these voters, added, ''I think Bush is still going to win rural areas, but he needs to win them at the margins he won in the past.''
 The most recent New York Times/CBS News showed some decline in Mr. Bush's approval rating among rural voters, reflecting the national trend, but he was still, on balance, given a positive rating.
 Mr. Kerry is beginning his small-town tour in an area of Democratic strength, in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District. Representative James L. Oberstar, the Democrat who has represented this area since 1974, described his voters as interested in ''progressive economics'' -- ''people who belong to strong unions, want a strong wage, strong Social Security, a strong Medicare drug benefit'' -- but ''cautious on social values'' and ''very, very strong for gun rights.''
 The war is felt heavily here, Mr. Oberstar added. ''It's the uncertainty of people being ripped out of their homes and their families,'' he said. ''This Iraq incursion has created a great deal of disruption among the guards and reserves.''
 A small group of Kerry supporters who met in a tavern here Wednesday night reflected that. Mike Sundin, chairman of the Carlton County Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that his son had just returned from Iraq the day before. State Senator Becky Lourey said her son had just returned from Fallujah. And, she added, ''I've been to three funerals of really wonderful kids.''

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, New Faces in Both Top Positions

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of Gov. M. Jodi Rell's inaugural address:
 Good afternoon. A few moments ago, I raised my right hand, humbled in spirit and with hopefulness in my heart, to take the oath of office as governor of the state of Connecticut.
 It is not a position I sought through the normal course of electoral politics, but little has seemed normal over the past several months. Few could have accurately predicted the incredible, seemingly unrelenting, series of events that have led to today's actions. 
 It has been a time of profound disappointment and disillusionment. It has been a moment in history that we never thought we would see, and fervently hope that we never see again. 
 Yet while the people's trust in government has been weakened, I know that Connecticut is resilient. Ours is a strength that is centuries old, but ever new. The wellspring of our state's strength is untainted by corruption and untouched by controversy. It's the optimism of Connecticut families, always ready to look forward to tomorrow. 
 A new administration is taking shape, and though awed and inspired by the incredible responsibilities that await me. I assume the governorship of our great state with respect, honor and modesty. 
 The time to heal has begun. Yes, our trust has been broken. Our faith in government has been shaken. Our belief in the inherent virtue of public service has been called into question. We have been tested. We have been tried. 
 But there can be no doubt, with this historic transfer of power today, that the very principles upon which our constitution, our laws and our system of government are built are far stronger and far greater than the frailties and failures of any one individual or group of people.
 Today we chart a new course. Today, we begin to restore faith, integrity and honor to our government. It is our solemn obligation. It will be our lasting legacy. I deeply believe that public service is a noble and necessary cause.
 For generations, indeed for more than two centuries, well-intentioned, virtuous men and women have served our state well. We cannot allow the actions of a relative few to tarnish all who serve, or more significantly, to discourage future generations from answering their call to service. 
 We must and we will recommit ourselves to ending the culture of corruption that has plagued our state for far too long. 
 To that end, my first order of business as the 87th governor of Connecticut is to issue Executive Order No. 1, which imposes strict ethics restraints on those who serve in government. 
 It also creates a new public integrity officer in my cabinet, a person who will report directly to me and who will work with enforcement agencies on matters involving corruption, unethical practices or alleged abuses of public authority. She will also aggressively educate and train state employees on both the spirit and letter of the laws regarding ethics.
 Let the message be clear: From this day forward, if you are entrusted with public office, you will uphold the highest standards of public integrity and ethical principles.
 Ours is a rich and proud history, and we will return pride to our state. Connecticut will again be home to innovation, idealism and integrity in government service. To be sure, this is a time unlike any in our state's history, and in many ways we have a most unique occasion to govern. 
 We should view our opportunity to lead as a gift -- a gift holding unlimited potential and promise for addressing long unmet needs and longstanding policy problems. Let us not squander our opportunity, for there is too much work to do and too many pressing priorities ahead.
 My administration will work steadfastly to create jobs and grow our economy. Over the next few weeks and months, we will be proposing new initiatives on the economy, education and campaign finance reform. 
 We will also seek a spirit of cooperation and public service transcending partisanship. We will work together to find common ground in philosophy and workable solutions to complex issues. 
 Before turning the page and moving forward, let me take a moment to acknowledge that these have been very difficult and trying times for everyone, including Governor Rowland and his family. My thoughts and prayers are with them, and I ask you to remember them as well. 
 My pledge, as your new governor, is a simple one: I will work tirelessly, with honor, dignity and civility in the days and weeks to come. I ask for your support, your understanding and your prayers. But now we start anew. And so the journey begins. Thank you, all, and God bless the great state of Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Treasuries Rally, but Stocks Go Down As Wall St. Reads Employment Report

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bond prices shot higher yesterday and interest rates fell after the government reported that job growth in June was much weaker than expected. Stocks declined, however, and the dollar fell more than 1 percent against the euro.
 The buying in the bond market capped a four-day rally that indicated, at least for now, that interest rates had moved too high, too fast in anticipation of this week's Federal Reserve interest rate increase and signs of accelerating inflation.
 The drop in rates also shows that some investors are now less worried that the central bank will follow this week's rate increase of a quarter percentage point with a half-point jump at its next meeting in August. 
 In the Treasury market, which closed early for the Fourth of July holiday, the yield on the 10-year note dropped to 4.46 percent, from 4.56 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 26/32, to 102 9/32. Since Monday, the 10-year yield has fallen slightly more than a quarter of a percentage point. 
 In the stock market, the weaker jobs data seemed to lead some investors to conclude that even a mild slowing in the pace of economic growth would hurt corporate earnings, which are already forecast to show slower growth in the second half of this year.
 It is possible, however, that stock investors will focus next week on the angle that bond investors took -- that the Fed can move at a measured pace in raising rates and still curb inflation. If that is the case, stocks could rally. 
 As for the dollar, its gains against the euro since May have been supported by the expectation that interest rates here would be moving higher. Data indicating that the pace of rate increases could be slower undermine the dollar's value. 
 The surprise in the employment report was that only 112,000 new jobs were created last month, less than half the 250,000 expected in Wall Street forecasts. Manufacturing employment fell for the first time since January, and average hourly earnings inched up just 0.1 percent. 
 The slower job growth, coming after a three-month average of 315,000 new jobs, and the small increase in hourly earnings said to many investors that economic growth may be slowing a little and, therefore, that inflation may be a little less of a threat. During the three months ended in May, inflation rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent.
 ''These numbers indicate that inflation is not likely to be a problem going forward,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief economist for Perigon Wealth Management, a San Francisco-based advisory firm.
 ''The bond market is doing better,'' he added, ''because the fear of half- point tightenings in the near future has been reduced by these numbers.''
 Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said bonds were also rallying because the Federal Reserve had been very good to the bond market this week. ''The Fed moved as gently as it could,'' he said of the Fed's announcement Wednesday that it was raising its benchmark short-term interest rate for the first time in more than four years.
 But Mr. McCarthy said that interest rates should move higher again because the economy is still strong, inflation has not yet faded and the Fed will still be raising its benchmark rate -- which is now 1.25 percent -- in the months ahead. ''We are looking at a temporary interruption in a rising-rate environment,'' he said.
 The easing of concern about big rate increases by the Fed in the months ahead is reflected in the drop in the yield on the Treasury's two-year note and in the performance of the futures contracts on the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate on loans between banks and serves as the Fed's benchmark rate. 
 In trading yesterday, the yield on the two-year note dropped to 2.53 percent, down from 2.64 percent on Thursday and 2.86 percent on Monday. As for fed futures, the contract for August, when Fed policy makers meet next, now shows that investors are betting there is a 12 percent chance of a half-point rate increase then, compared with a 50 percent chance last Monday.
 Louis Crandall, the chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, said this change in the fed funds futures contracts reflects both a revised expectation about the actual Fed action and a diminished risk in that bet. He said slower job growth and the Fed's wording this week have helped policy makers believe that future rate increases can come at a measured pace. 
 ''Now that we know that they kept the measured-pace language and that payrolls are lower, there is less that can go wrong between now and the August meeting,'' Mr. Crandall said.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,125.38, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 8.89 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,006.66. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 51.33 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,282.83. For the week, the S.&P. 500 was down 0.8 percent, the Nasdaq off 0.9 percent and the Dow down 0.9 percent. 
 In the currency markets, the dollar dropped 1.2 percent against the euro in afternoon trading, with the euro valued at $1.2324, up from $1.2177 Thursday. But against the yen, the dollar was little changed, at 108.38 yen, compared with 108.19 yen Thursday.

HEADLINE: Harvard and Russian Oil Company Clash Over Payment of Dividends

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 2 

 BODY:
Harvard University is squaring off against one of Russia's largest oil companies in a legal dispute that is drawing attention among companies that are considering investing in the Russian energy industry.
 Through its asset management arm, Harvard is one of the largest foreign owners of stock in Surgutneftegaz, the fourth-largest oil producer in Russia, and the university contends that the company has failed to pay more than $400 million in dividends owed to shareholders. 
 This week, Harvard sought binding arbitration of the dispute, filing a claim with the American Arbitration Association in New York; the university is seeking class-action status for the claim. Harvard is owed at least $3.7 million, it said in its claim. 
 Surgut, as the company is known, responded with a terse statement posted on its Web site this week, saying that the legal action was ''just an attempt to heat the market.'' Surgut also called on the ''president and fellows of Harvard College,'' the formal claimants in the case, to familiarize themselves better with the company's history of paying dividends. 
 The dispute is the latest in a series of challenges to the way Surgut treats its shareholders. These efforts have so far had little success in persuading the company's management to alter policies. But Harvard's legal action is a departure from earlier challenges, because the university is seeking to have its claim decided by an arbitration panel in New York, where Surgut's shares trade as American depository receipts. 
 If the panel rules in Harvard's favor, the university said, the decision would be enforceable in Russia under international treaties. Surgut see things differently, saying that ''any action of the type is to be entertained solely in courts of the Russian Federation.'' 
 Such statements from Surgut have been dispiriting for the investors that have been challenging the company in recent months. William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, a Moscow-based investment firm, said, ''Russian courts are more like a Turkish bazaar than a place for the rule of law to be upheld.'' 
 Harvard's interest in Surgut stems from about $130 million worth of shares it bought through the Harvard Management Company, which supervises most of the investment activities of the university's $18 billion endowment fund. 
 In its complaint, Harvard argues that the dividends declared by Surgut over the last six years have been far below the amounts set forth in the company's charter and that the company has reported artificially low profits to its shareholders, figures that bear little connection to the profits Surgut reported to tax authorities. Harvard said that the dividends Surgut distributed were as little as one-fifth of the amounts shareholders were entitled to. 
 ''It's not that we have a desire to be shareholder activists, but this is a story about a contract that has not been honored,'' said Jeff Larson, managing partner of Sowood Capital Management, which manages more than $500 million on Harvard's behalf. Mr. Larson was the international equity portfolio manager for Harvard Management when it invested in Surgut. 
 Harvard is no stranger to the complexities of business in Russia. Its arbitration claim against Surgut was filed on Tuesday, a day after the United States District Court in Boston ruled that two people with Harvard ties -- Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor, and Jonathan Hay, a former employee of the university -- conspired to defraud the federal government in the 1990's.
 The two men invested in Russian companies at the same time that they were involved in a government-financed program, run by Harvard, to help Russia convert its economy to free-market capitalism, the court found. 
 The court also found that Harvard violated its federal contract by certifying that the program in Russia was fulfilling its requirements.
 The university issued a statement after the ruling, saying that ''the court did not make any finding on damages, but in all likelihood any damages assessed against Harvard for the contract violation would be only a fraction of the damages sought by the government,'' an amount initially set by prosecutors at $102 million. 
 Joe Wrinn, a spokesman for Harvard, said that he was not aware of any connection between the Surgut complaint and the Boston court ruling. 
 Potential investors in Russian energy are closely following Surgut as a test of how minority investors and shareholders are treated under Russian and international law, just as they are following the prosecutions on tax and other charges of the country's largest oil exporter, Yukos Oil, and its billionaire founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. 
 Shares in Yukos have fallen by half since Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested in October. The government froze the company's bank accounts on Thursday, a move that Yukos said might force it out of business. 
 Yet while the Yukos case is seen as largely political, growing out of a power struggle between the Kremlin and Mr. Khodorkovsky, Russian richest man, there does not appear to be a significant political component to the Surgut dispute. Instead, it is seen as an example of ''a company that has managed to interpret the law in its own favor,'' regardless of shareholders' interests, said Alexander Branis, a director in the Moscow office of Prosperity Capital Management, a Swedish investment firm. 
 ''We're praying for a ruling in Harvard's favor,'' Mr. Branis said.
 Surgut, which takes its name from its home city in western Siberia and has more than 90,000 employees, has given little indication that it will budge in the dispute. In its response to the arbitration filing, Surgut said its policies had allowed it to ''boast the strongest production, personnel and financial potential among its Russian peers.''

HEADLINE: Tug of War Over a Yosemite Lodge

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, July 2 

 BODY:
The gingerbread cookies are baked, the front porch swept and the American flags unfurled. Every detail has been tended to for this weekend's centennial celebration at Le Conte Memorial Lodge, a library and education center here that has been run by the Sierra Club since the days when John Muir was its president.
 Even within the Sierra Club, the fairy-tale looking building of granite boulders and redwood beams was somewhat unknown until recently. In a park that receives more than three million visitors a year, 15,000 or so make it to Le Conte.
 But the three days of centennial events have come to carry significance far beyond the lodge's reach, drawing renewed attention to a political struggle between the liberal Sierra Club and one of its staunchest conservative critics in Congress, Representative George P. Radanovich of California. 
 Mr. Radanovich, a Republican who grew up near Yosemite and represents the farming district that borders it, has written legislation that would require that the lodge be removed from the park. Mr. Radanovich says it is only fair to strip the Sierra Club of its ''special use'' since the club pushed for provisions in a plan by the National Park Service that would reduce camping and vehicle use in the Yosemite Valley, the most visited part of the park.
 ''The Sierra Club is leaving themselves vulnerable to this kind of criticism because of some of the positions they take on access issues for other people,'' Mr. Radanovich said in a phone interview from Washington.
 He added, ''Quite frankly, I think they have to be reminded of how they treat other people.''
 Mr. Radanovich says he supports the overall Yosemite plan, which includes such things as moving roads and redesigning the entrance to Yosemite Falls, but opposes the camping and vehicle restrictions. Since April, much of the plan has been delayed because of a federal appeals court ruling that more environmental studies are needed.
 The Radanovich bill passed the House Resources Committee on a 21-to-20 vote last fall but has been stalled ever since. Members of the Sierra Club were hoping the bill had quietly died. Some here were encouraged when Mr. Radanovich made a surprise visit to Le Conte last month with Yosemite Superintendent Michael Tollefson, who favors keeping the lodge where it is.
 It was Mr. Radanovich's first visit, which was so filled with pleasantries that the subject of moving the building was never broached. ''It's beautiful,'' Mr. Radanovich said of his first impression of the Tudor-style lodge.
 But it seems no minds were changed. Mr. Radanovich said he was still working to salvage his legislation by attaching some or all of its provisions to an omnibus spending bill. Only one small aspect was likely to change, he said. The legislation would be amended to allow the lodge to remain in the park, so long as it was somewhere outside the Yosemite Valley. The Sierra Club insists any move would be unacceptable. 
 ''The service they provide, which I think is a good service, could be provided at pretty much any location,'' Mr. Radanovich said. 
 The threat to Le Conte has brought harsh reactions from the Sierra Club. Shortly after last fall's vote, the group's executive director, Carl Pope, described the congressman in a newspaper opinion piece as ''a vindictive politician employing blackmail and other bully tactics to realize his political ambitions.''
 In an article about the lodge's centennial celebration in last month's Sierra, the club's magazine, Le Conte was characterized as a ''sanctuary under siege'' and Mr. Radanovich as the centennial's ''biggest party pooper.'' The article closed with an appeal for volunteers to work at the lodge. 
 Sierra Club devotees take particular umbrage because the relationship between the club and Yosemite began in 1898, even before there was a national park here.
 The Sierra Club was contracted by the state of California to provide visitor services, first in a wooden building and later at Le Conte, which was built and paid for by the Sierra Club, in part through a $1 levy on its members. The lodge was named for Joseph Le Conte, a geologist and close friend of Muir who was a charter member of the Sierra Club and who died at Yosemite in 1901.
 The building, designated a national historic landmark in 1987, was disassembled and rebuilt in 1919 about a half mile from its original location. There are grand views from its front porch of Yosemite's two most popular landmarks, the Yosemite Falls and Half Dome.
 Though the National Park Service has long since had its own visitors' center, the Sierra Club kept its contract to provide educational programming for visitors, something Mr. Tollefson, the Yosemite superintendent, said was unusual for a national park but something he hoped would not change. Though the building's displays tout the origins of the Sierra Club and the advances of the environmental movement, most of its space is devoted to a collection of 3,000 or so books about nature and conservation.
 ''The Sierra Club has done a good job in maintaining the separation from their advocacy role to their traditional role here in education,'' Mr. Tollefson said.
 He added, ''The Sierra Club is known to be probably not aligned with Radanovich's political views, and I think he was looking at it from that standpoint and not from the educational standpoint.'' 
 Bonnie J. Gisel, a Muir scholar and the Sierra Club's curator at Le Conte, said the threat to the lodge had been an unhappy distraction at a time when attention was supposed to focus on the centennial. 
 Her response, Dr. Gisel said, had been to step away from the politics as much as possible and devote her energy to Le Conte's core mission of helping visitors connect with the things that inspired the lodge -- a conservation ethic, a love for wilderness and a longing for quiet repose.
 ''It took me some time to work through it,'' Dr. Gisel said. ''We've taken a historic stance, not a fighting stance.''
 Dr. Gisel said Mr. Radanovich was looking to increase tourism in the Yosemite Valley because it had spillover benefits for the surrounding communities and ensured the economic vitality of the park.
 The Sierra Club, on the other hand, wants to better preserve the park that Muir knew by reducing commercialism and crowding in the Yosemite Valley, mainly by limiting parking and relocating campgrounds to less visited areas.
 ''It is not really a debate over Le Conte,'' Dr. Gisel said. ''It is a debate over how many people.''
 Narayan Scaff, an artist and self-described professional hermit who volunteered this week at Le Conte, said the conflict actually ran much deeper. He blamed both Mr. Radanovich and the Sierra Club leadership for politicizing conservation along the red-blue divide that has come to define so many disagreements in the United States.
 Mr. Radanovich, he said, was unjustly trying to rewrite Yosemite history, which was inextricably linked with that of the Sierra Club. But the Sierra Club, which has taken on numerous political causes, including a campaign to defeat President Bush, has become too consumed with its own partisan mission, he said.
 ''Part of this is that the Sierra Club has forgotten its own history,'' Mr. Scaff said. 
 The lodge, which was built in 1903 and dedicated in 1904, will be rededicated on Saturday. A small group of people will gather on the front porch to commit the lodge officially to another 100 years of environmental education. Several Sierra Club officials will be among the keynote speakers. Mr. Radanovich said he does not expect to attend.

HEADLINE: Powell Says He Restated Views On Arms With North Korean

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 2 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who had a rare meeting with his North Korean counterpart on Friday at a conference on Asian-Pacific security, said afterward that the two envoys essentially restated their current positions on talks aimed at disarming North Korea rather than engaging in negotiations.
 Mr. Powell, who met later on Friday with Indonesian students for a discussion at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, said he had briefed the other parties to the talks -- China, Russia, South Korea and Japan -- about his 20-minute session with the North Korean foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun. The forum groups together the 10 members of the association, or Asean, and 13 other Asia-Pacific countries and the European Union. 
 Mr. Powell cautioned against seeking instant solutions and said he looked forward to another round of discussions on North Korea's nuclear program in the early fall. ''In my brief discussions today with the North Koreans, they reaffirmed that they want to continue with the six-party framework, and they reinforced the positions they gave to us last week, and we reinforced our position,'' Mr. Powell said.
 ''These are difficult negotiations; it just doesn't happen overnight,'' he said. ''There's a great deal of mistrust between the United States and North Korea. We'll have to work our way through this.''
 Asked about the court appearance on Thursday of Saddam Hussein, Mr. Powell recalled a litany of abuses during the former Iraqi leader's rule, but said people should have an open mind as the legal proceedings begin. ''I think the people of the world should watch carefully and listen carefully, presume he's innocent if you will, and let the Iraqi people through their courts decide,'' he said.
 Mr. Powell expressed regret over the number of impediments put before foreigners seeking to visit the United States. He said Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, agreed on the need to ''start backing off'' of some of the more onerous requirements. 
 ''We have to move the visa process along,'' Mr. Powell said. ''We suffer when we don't have students such as you wanting to study in the United States because we've made it too difficult. We suffer when Indonesians are reluctant to come and go to Disneyland or Disney World or to use our hospitals or just to go see Grand Canyon or visit Washington, D.C., as tourists.''
 He was not specific about what changes were under consideration.
 ''You will see in the months ahead that these policies will get back to a more normal set of standards,'' he added. ''But we have to know who is coming into the country.''
 As he has in many of his travels, Mr. Powell took time to meet with students and seek to bridge the gap with Muslim nations. He referred to ''our Muslim brothers and sisters,'' and said the United States was a force for good. ''There is a lot of anti-Americanism in the world today because people, I don't think, fully understand what we are trying to do in Iraq or with respect to the Middle East peace process,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Today's Bank Robber Might Look Like a Neighbor

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
The case of J. L. Rountree seemed at first an aberration, something from ''News of the Weird.'' Last August, Mr. Rountree, 91 years old, walked into the First American Bank in Abilene, Tex., and handed the teller a note reading ''Robbery.''
 ''You're kidding,'' the teller said.
 ''Hurry up,'' snapped Mr. Rountree, who was unarmed. ''Or you'll get hurt.'' 
 Mr. Rountree -- no sprinter -- left with $1,999 and was soon arrested by the local police, who gave him the perfect headline-grabbing nickname: the Grandpa Bandit. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
 Then in December, Sally Ann Smith, 56 and described by a neighbor as ''a wonderful, caring and loving person, and a devoted grandmother,'' was arrested at her home in Peoria, Ariz., on charges of robbing two banks at gunpoint. Ms. Smith, too, got a nickname: the Grandma Bandit.
 Then there were Robert Day, an armed 68-year-old bank robber in Texas, and Brenda Bishop, the Granny Bandit of Macomb County, Mich., who was unarmed; both are now in prison. And on Thursday, the police said, an unarmed 70-year-old man named Gordon Bryant tried to rob the Farmers State Bank in Versailles, Ill. The police said they had found Mr. Bryant outside the bank with a stocking over his head. 
 While it may be tempting to view these bank-robbing grandparents as evidence of a moral collapse among older Americans, more likely they say something about the changing nature of bank robbery. Once the pursuit of hardened, shoot-'em-up bandits like Bonnie and Clyde, and later of violent street gangs packing 9-millimeter guns, bank robbery has become a kind of everyman's felony. 
 While about half of bank robberies in the United States are still committed by drug addicts desperate for money and a third by veteran bank thieves, law enforcement officials and criminologists say an increasing number are being pulled off by thieves who have a lot more in common with Willy Loman than Willie Sutton. They are teenagers and senior citizens, stay-at-home parents and career types -- in short, anyone with an acute need for cash.
 ''The word of mouth is that it's easy, it's safe and it's gratifying,'' said Robert McCrie, a professor of security management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York who has studied bank robbery for 30 years. ''So it's not surprising that the octogenarian, or a mother with children at home, or people with all sorts of uncharacteristic backgrounds would be attracted to trying to give it a go. It can be just about anybody.''
 The number of bank robberies nationwide has fluctuated for 15 years, spiking during tough economic times and falling during good years. Although violent bank robberies are still a problem -- banks in Washington, for example, have recently been terrorized by a gang of masked, heavily armed robbers -- the majority of the 7,412 robberies last year were so-called ''note jobs,'' crimes committed by pen and paper rather than a weapon. Twenty-five years ago, according to the F.B.I., only about a third of robberies were note jobs -- the preferred method of the Average Joe and Jane bank robber with no criminal past, experts say.
 ''Most of these are people who have no record at all,'' said William J. Rehder, a former bank robbery expert for the F.B.I. ''They start off as virgins to crime and they jump into this as a first option.'' 
 New York City experienced a kind of note-passing epidemic last year. Bank robberies surged 64 percent, and though 84 percent of the robberies involved no weapons, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly admonished bank executives for not paying enough attention to the problem. 
 The people pulling off some of those robberies hardly fit the profile of seasoned crooks. Last September, the police said, a 12-year-old boy made away with $30,000 from an East Village branch of Citibank after passing a note that read, ''Give me the money or I'll shoot you.'' He was later arrested and his mother charged for putting him up to it.
 In January, Pamela Kaichen, 44, a riding instructor known as the ''soccer mom bandit,'' pleaded guilty to the unarmed robbery of six banks in Connecticut and Westchester County and received a four-year sentence. Ms. Kaichen, who wore a blond wig during the holdups, blamed stress from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for her crimes. She had volunteered at ground zero.
 Outside New York, the story is much the same. Last June, for example, Tighue Shields, 53, a South Florida greenskeeper well known in the golf world for his work on the P.G.A. Tour, was arrested in connection with three armed bank robberies in Scottsdale, Ariz. The authorities said Mr. Shields had flown to Scottsdale to rob banks on his days off.
 Security and law enforcement officials say a number of factors are to blame for the democratizing of bank robbery, chief among them the knowledge, widespread among the public, that bank tellers are often instructed to comply with robbers in order to get them out of the bank as quickly as possible.
 Michael MacLean, the bank robbery program manager at the F.B.I.'s headquarters in Washington, said that robbing a bank once required specialized knowledge, usually passed among veteran robbers. Now, he said, debriefings of bank robbery suspects have revealed ''a more general knowledge about how to commit a bank robbery.''
 ''It used to always be 'I was in prison with a guy who did bank robberies and he told me how to do it,''' he said. ''You're seeing now people who know how to do it without being in custody. They know the drill: you write the note, you get the money.''
 John Hall, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association in Washington, the industry's largest trade group, said banks were in a complicated position.
 ''Bankers do walk this line between convenience and security,'' he said. ''Customers shouldn't be treated like they're bank robbers.''
 Mr. Hall said that a bank's priority during a robbery was safety. ''It might appear they are being compliant,'' he said. ''But they're making sure that no violence takes place.''
 Security experts say that combating bank robberies has been made more difficult by banks' emphasis on consumer-friendly buildings that are convenient not only to customers but, it turns out, to robbers.
 Jim Moore, who spent 23 years in corporate security at Citibank and now is a consultant at Kroll, a risk consulting company based in New York, said that while banks once were fortresslike structures with columns and bars on the windows, today they are more like retail outlets. They are less likely to have armed guards than in the past. They tend to have multiple exits for customers' convenience and to be located along busy thoroughfares -- touches that also favor fleeing bandits.
 ''There's been this tension between marketing and security,'' Mr. Moore said. ''You're trying to be customer-friendly, and you want to draw people into your establishment. You don't want them to think they're coming into some enclosed-vault atmosphere.''
 If there seems a lack of urgency among banks in dealing with the problem, it is perhaps due to the low incidence of violence in bank robberies. Only about one in every 1,000 results in a death. Also, the money lost in bank robberies annually is a relative pittance to the banking industry -- around $70 million. Mr. McCrie, the criminology professor, said the banking industry considered these ''acceptable losses.''
 Check fraud, by comparison, cost banks nearly $700 million in 2002, the last year for which data are available. 
 New York banks, though, have taken a number of steps recently to improve security. Michael P. Smith, the president of the New York Bankers Association, said that local banks had formed a task force in response to the surge in note passers, and that they had improved surveillance cameras, installed plexiglass ''bandit barriers'' and increased the number of undercover guards. Banks are more aggressive in using dye packs, exploding ink bags that stain stolen money and the thief, he said, and they now maintain a direct computer link to the police department, so the authorities can be informed immediately. The measures may be working: bank robberies in New York City are down 35 percent this year compared with the first half of 2003.
 As it is, about 57 percent of all bank robberies are solved, according to the F.B.I. Mr. Rehder, the former F.B.I. investigator, said the average take in a ''note job'' was usually $2,000 to $3,000, far less, he said, than most amateur bank robbers need to get them out of financial trouble. Many try again, he said, and are eventually caught.
 Amateur robbers, though, continue to try their luck. Last July, a San Francisco personal trainer named Ricky Beale hired a stretch limousine to go to his girlfriend's house. He asked the limousine driver to stop, then ran into a Bank of America, which he robbed of $5,000. Mr. Beale was arrested a few blocks away. In March, he pleaded guilty and was given a year in the county jail and five years' probation.

HEADLINE: New Immigrants Find Parallels With Changes in Home Country

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
The American occupation of Iraq may seem far away for most New Yorkers. But for one small group of new Americans, talk of building democracy in a broken country sounds all too familiar. 
 They are newcomers from Russia.
 Consider their recent history. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, a feisty, young Russian government, with help from American advisers, set about tearing down the totalitarian system. It rewrote laws, placed state property in private hands and expected democracy to follow. 
 It didn't.
 Instead, the new freedoms and subsequent efforts to change unleashed a political and economic chaos that many of the people interviewed for this article came to America to escape. And as they prepare to celebrate Independence Day, some for the first time as American citizens, they remain skeptical about the prospects of transplanting American democracy. 
 Viktor Lushin of Sheepshead Bay, a radio host for WSNR-AM, a Russian-language station in Brooklyn, has heard many American speeches on Iraq. ''People are finally free,'' he said, paraphrasing them. ''Give them some money, pass some laws, and you will have a democracy.'' To him, it sounds just like the American view of Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. 
 ''But freedom,'' Mr. Lushin said, ''is a very tricky matter.'' 
 The early days after the fall of Communism were full of heady optimism. Mr. Lushin and his friends tried to start a book publishing business in his native St. Petersburg. Zoya Vernik of southern Brooklyn, who is now at WSNR, went to work at a start-up news agency run by young people in Odessa, in Ukraine. Her husband turned his skills as a telecommunications technician into a small business. 
 ''There was a feeling that Russia would become Great Britain in three months,'' said Yan Vizinberg, a filmmaker and television journalist, who became an American citizen in May. 
 In Moscow, young political leaders were working to revamp the old Soviet system. They embraced Western models. A number of Western economists and other experts advised them.
 ''The general assumption was they would just copy wholesale the Western economic and political systems the way they were advised,'' said Ekaterina Razoumova, a doctoral candidate at the University of Rochester, who lives on the Upper East Side. The government's attitude was, '''Look, everything is going wonderfully, so just shut up and let us do our thing,''' she said.
 But transplanting Western-style democracy proved difficult, she said. Judges and police officers, who used to serve Soviet leaders, were easily controlled by politicians and businessmen. Inflation soared. Salaries shrank. The news media were being bought up -- and used -- by wealthy businessmen.
 Democracy was starting to get a bad name.
 In St. Petersburg, Mr. Lushin abandoned books and went into real estate, a business heavily controlled by new criminal groups. Two of his former business partners were killed. In Odessa, Ms. Vernik's husband went into hiding after a powerful former client threatened him. 
 ''Court?'' said Ms. Vernik, who immigrated to New York with her family in 2000. ''To even say the word raises very loud laughter. Everything was decided through money and connections.''
 Laws were remarkably pliant. The legal maneuvering was baffling to foreigners, but came as no surprise to Russians. For centuries, a combination of conflicting laws and random enforcement has caused Russians to come up with elaborate ways to avoid compliance.
 Regina Khidekel, who moved to New York from St. Petersburg in 1993, recalled a Russian folk saying that describes the law as a wagon axle: it goes in any direction you want to pull it.
 Then came privatization. The Russian government drew up plans to parcel out state-owned companies, from bakeries to the oil industry. Advisers at the United States Treasury Department urged speed.
 The idea, said Joseph E. Stiglitz, who was on President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1997, was to quickly create a broad class of property owners who would have a stake in building institutions and obeying laws.
 But the state was weak, and a politically connected elite hijacked the process, buying up the most valuable companies for very little money.
 Historians will debate Russia's state property sales for years to come. Supporters of the process argue that there was no better alternative at the time and that it did eventually lead to an improved economy. Indeed, the country's economy has been growing steadily since 1999. Professor Stiglitz, who has criticized United States policy toward Russia in his book ''Globalization and Its Discontents,'' is an opponent. 
 ''It was blind faith in markets,'' said Professor Stiglitz, now at Columbia.
 Whatever the case, ordinary Russians felt left out of a process that they saw as corrupt. The experience served to further sour them on the idea of democracy.
 ''Democracy was very good for those who had money,'' said Boris Kraytman, a soccer coach in southern Brooklyn, who immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in the mid-1990's.
 In February, Professor Stiglitz wrote in a syndicated article that a quick privatization in Iraq, talked about briefly by the Bush administration before the recent explosion of violence took priority, would lead to results similar to those in Russia: a rich elite and a bitter populace. Beyond their many differences, he wrote, both countries are oil powers, have economies that are sagging after years of neglect and have extremely weak legal institutions. 
 Despite Russia's painful wrangling with aspects of the American system, Russian-Americans interviewed for this article said they deeply appreciated the opportunities offered by life in the United States and admired its system of democracy.
 Most of the 240,000 Russian immigrants in the New York City region supported the war in Iraq, according to Nargiz Shekinskaya, in charge of polling at RTVI, a Russian-language television network based in Manhattan. Most left Russia when it was still the Soviet Union, many as refugees from anti-Semitism, so they have warm feelings toward the United States and its policies.
 Those who immigrated later have warm feelings too, although many say they view their new home with more skeptical eyes. On a recent Sunday night on the terrace of Anyway Cafe, a popular East Village hangout for young Russians, Yulia Florinskaya discussed the benefits of American life with two friends. 
 Ms. Florinskaya, who came to this country as a teenager in the early 1990's, said she values the stability in America and the confidence that it brings. 
 Yet Americans themselves sometimes show a shallow understanding of their own system, she said. In many respects, America has been lucky with its patchwork of history, culture and traditions.
 ''Their democracy is freedom of speech,'' Ms. Florinskaya said. ''It's Michael Moore being able to get up there and make fun of Bush.''
 Mark Rasstanny, a screenwriter in upper Manhattan who is about to receive his green card and is married to an American citizen, thinks that the key is the rule of law. ''I like the American model,'' he said. ''Intellect is stronger than might. You can go to court. It is part of people's consciousness that they are not defenseless.''
 But even though the American system may be easy to appreciate, it is not so easy to transplant to other countries. ''There is not a universal blueprint for democracy,'' Mr. Rasstanny contended.
 Anna Aunon, 25, of Midtown, who came to the United States in 2001, agreed. ''So much depends on tradition and culture,'' she said. ''Socialism was in people's consciousness for so many years. Our people are trying to take things from the West. But without the past experience, it's very difficult to catch up.''
 Most of the immigrants interviewed agreed that conditions in Russia were gradually improving. 
 In fact many said that time is the answer, for Russia's problems and for Iraq's. ''Things will eventually change in Iraq, but not because the Americans came,'' said Mr. Vizinberg, the filmmaker. ''Iraqis will go through their own historical process.''
 Leon Aron, the author of ''Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life'' and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, said Russia was making progress, but acknowledged that Western policy makers had expected too much too soon. ''We all believed it would be easy in many respects,'' he said. ''But what we found was that liberty was not democracy.''
 ''Democracy proved difficult because it was going against the grain of the previous 75 years, and arguably, the previous 400.''
 ''And you cannot,'' he added, ''fast-forward history.''

HEADLINE: Death in Darfur

 BODY:
The growing disaster in the Darfur region of Sudan, which may have already killed as many people as have died in the fighting in Iraq over the last year and a quarter, demands that Secretary of State Colin Powell and the U.N. secretary general, Kofi Annan, go beyond the kind of welcome but government-manipulated visits we saw this week. Without tough and immediate actions by Washington and the U.N. Security Council, a half-million people or more could die before the end of the year from Sudanese government-sponsored attacks and the starvation and disease that inevitably follow.
 To save these lives, as many countries as possible must put direct pressure on Sudan's leaders by freezing their foreign assets, sharply restricting their international travel and banning their arms purchases until they keep their promises to disband the Janjaweed militias, which have been attacking non-Arab Sudanese in Darfur for more than a year while the outside world largely looked away. Allowing relief workers and observers in while the attacks continue will not be enough. The Sudanese government must stop supporting the Janjaweed, disarm its fighters and fulfill its duty to protect the non-Arab people of Darfur. 
 Sudan's leaders may imagine that ending the long civil war that killed millions of non-Arab Sudanese in the southern part of the country is enough to allow them to reap an economic bonanza by peacefully exploiting Sudan's oil deposits. That must not happen without an end to the killing in Darfur. 
 Any illusion that Sudan's leaders are now prepared to act responsibly without being compelled to do so should have been dispelled by their cruel and cynical behavior during the Powell and Annan visits. Whip-wielding government soldiers drove Darfur residents away from Mr. Powell's entourage as he visited a carefully selected refugee camp on Wednesday. It's hard to understand why Mr. Powell has still not protested forcefully and publicly. The same day, university students seeking to deliver a petition on Darfur to Mr. Annan in Khartoum were shot by government security forces. That night, Sudanese authorities forcibly emptied a Darfur refugee camp that Mr. Annan was to visit.
 The Bush administration has been far too timid in proposing punitive sanctions only for Janjaweed leaders. That remains the main thrust of a Security Council resolution that Washington is circulating. It would be much more effective to put direct pressure on the leaders of Sudan's government, who can shut down the attacks quickly.
 The Security Council remains divided between the Sudanese government's critics and apologists and has been unwilling to take strong action. Mr. Powell and Mr. Annan need to follow up on their visits by breaking this deadly diplomatic stalemate. America's new representative to the United Nations, John Danforth, who was President Bush's special envoy to the peace talks on Sudan's north-south civil war, ought to lobby countries like Pakistan, Algeria, Angola and China, which have been slow to grasp the world's responsibility to act on Darfur. 
 If the Security Council still refuses to act, the United States, the European Union and the African countries that assert a claim to continental leadership, like Nigeria and South Africa, should work together to convince Sudan's leaders that their government will become a pariah if it does not stop what looks increasingly like genocide in Darfur.

HEADLINE: Trend Still a Friend, The Bush Camp Says

BYLINE: By EDMUND A. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2 

 BODY:
Six months ago, in an anemic job market, President Bush would almost certainly have been delighted to hear that the nation had added 112,000 jobs the month before. On Friday, though, he found himself on the defensive.
 In an otherwise buoyant speech shortly after the government reported a surprisingly weak increase in employment in June, Mr. Bush struck a momentarily cautious note. 
 ''We've got an economy which is changing,'' he told a group of small-business owners at the White House on Friday morning. ''The nature of the job base is changing. And all of that means it's been a difficult period of time.''
 Even as he declared that ''we're getting stronger'' and that the economy had ''momentum,'' Mr. Bush seemed to lower his goals ever so slightly. 
 ''We don't need boom-or-bust-type growth,'' he said. ''We just want steady, consistent growth so that our fellow citizens will be able to find a job.''
 With the presidential election just four months away, few if any domestic issues are as crucial to the outcome as unemployment.
 Mr. Bush and an army of top administration officials tried to make the best of the new job numbers, saying that the nation had added 1.5 million jobs since last August. Advisers to Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, quickly retorted that the nation was still more than a million jobs short of where it was when Mr. Bush took office.
 Both sides are keenly aware that statistical snapshots are far less important than the broader direction, and that the most crucial issue of all is how voters perceive that direction on Election Day.
 ''The trend is our friend,'' Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said in a statement, adding that the nation had added at least some jobs in each of the last 10 months.
 The problem for Mr. Bush is that the addition of 112,000 jobs in June is a big drop from the pace of the previous three months, and barely enough to keep up with the increases in the adult population. The pace of job growth, which was torrid in April and May, seems to be slowing, and over the last year has been far weaker than in past economic recoveries.
 Although one recent poll suggested that Mr. Bush might be winning more approval for his handling of economic issues, his ratings on the economy were sliding steadily even as the pace of job creation picked up sharply in the spring. 
 The reasons for that dissatisfaction range from a spillover of disillusionment about Iraq to an array of economic pressures -- from high gasoline prices to stagnant growth in wages -- that have persisted even as employment has increased. 
 Because the labor market finally seemed to be recovering, Mr. Kerry had shifted his criticism from the absolute number of new jobs to the broader if more nebulous idea of a ''middle-class squeeze'' and a declining quality of life.
 ''John Kerry has a plan to carve out a brighter future for America's families by creating 10 million new jobs and addressing all of the issues facing the middle class, including health care, energy prices and tuition costs,'' said Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry.
 ''Real wages are declining for typical American workers,'' Mr. Singer added, ''and the new jobs being created are, on average, paying less than the jobs that were lost.''
 Real disposable income, which is often a good predictor of voter attitudes toward an incumbent president, has increased over the last year. But that increase is almost solely because of last year's tax cuts. Adjusted for inflation, hourly wages have declined over the last year.
 Another potential source of unease lies in the fairly high number of people who have stopped looking for work. It is normal in an economic downturn for discouraged workers to drop out of the labor market, but people usually jump back in when job prospects improve.
 That has not been the case in this recovery. The work force participation rate dropped to 62.3 percent in Friday's report from 64.7 percent in the spring of 2000. Despite big monthly jumps in employment this spring, the participation rate has barely moved.
 Some of that loss may be explained by demographic shifts and an increase in self-employment that does not show up in the official numbers. But the data still suggests that the American job creation machine may not be as vigorous as it once seemed.
 Administration officials say that almost all economic indicators point to strong economic growth for the rest of the year. That, they add, proves that Mr. Bush's program of tax cuts and ''putting more money in people's pockets'' was the correct prescription for a recovery.
 Administration officials also point out that the monthly jobs data is notoriously jumpy, based on estimates from two often-conflicting surveys. In an economy with 147 million workers, the margin of error in measuring fluctuations of 100,000 or 200,000 jobs is enormous and the numbers themselves are extremely volatile.
 Mr. Bush's problem is that after nearly three years of relentlessly bad news on the jobs front, he needs solidly good news from now to November.

HEADLINE: For Bloomberg, 'Rich' Is Just Too Weak an Adjective

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
How rich is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg?
 So rich that he paid his household help more than $250,000 last year, according to the heavily edited tax returns he released yesterday.
 So rich that his bill for New York City taxes alone topped $500,000.
 So rich that he gave away $135.6 million to 653 charities and arts groups, from Aaron Davis Hall, the Harlem performing arts center, to Young Playwrights, a group founded by Stephen Sondheim. 
 So rich that he checked the box on his tax form to donate $3 to the presidential election campaign -- no, wait, even nonbillionaire nonmayors can afford that.
 The $3 check-off was significant for another reason. It is the only specific, detailed payment revealed by the mayor, whose accountants did not use actual dollar figures in the documents released publicly. Instead they used monetary ranges.
 This has been the practice since the mayor began releasing information about his financial situation when he started running for office. His personal finances are intertwined with those of the company he founded and still owns most of, Bloomberg L.P., which sells financial data and news. 
 Releasing details of Mr. Bloomberg's tax returns could reveal too much to his company's corporate rivals, said his director of communications, William T. Cunningham.
 So on the edited tax returns made available to reporters for two hours yesterday, amounts from $1,000 to $5,000 were represented by the letter A, $5,000 to $35,000 by B, and so on up to G, $500,000 or more. Most entries on the tax return were G's.
 Total income, G. Taxable interest received, G. Tax-exempt interest received, G. Dividends received, G. State and local taxes paid, G. Gifts to charity, G. Total taxes, G.
 Only in the case of the charitable contributions did the mayor reveal how much more than $500,000 the G represented ($135.1 million more). The gifts were made by the mayor and his ''related entities,'' which include foundations he controls and contributions made by the Bloomberg company.
 The beneficiaries of some of this largess were picked by the Bloomberg company's employees, rather than by the mayor himself, Mr. Cunningham said. He could not say which of the 653 nonprofits were the mayor's personal choices, he said, adding that a California library, just for example, was probably picked by an employee.
 The institutions on the list included New York City icons, like the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Opera Association, and more obscure choices, like Volcano Love, a circus-inspired dance group based in Brooklyn.
 The mayor did not release information about how much each group received. The total was about 3.6 percent higher than last year's.
 Two groups received no-interest loans from the mayor, who reported the ''imputed interest'' that he could have received on those loans. The interest on a loan to the Gracie Mansion Conservancy would have been worth $5,000 to $35,000 had the mayor collected it; interest on a loan to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, would have been worth $100,000 to $250,000.
 The mayor, who takes a salary of just $1 a year and makes most of his money through his investments and ownership of the company he founded, had two unusual sources of income last year.
 He received between $60,000 and $100,000 from ''show horse winnings''; his daughter, Georgina, rides horses that he owns.
 And he received more than $35,000 (but less than $60,000) from the ''auction house class-action settlement.'' In 2002, Sotheby's Holdings and Christie's International agreed to pay more than $500 million to settle a suit brought by clients who accused them of fixing prices at auctions.
 Serving as mayor has been costly for Mr. Bloomberg, who was ordered by the city's conflict of interest board to sell all his stocks in 2002. He has not revealed how much of a bath he took on the sales, except that it was in category G ($500,000 or more).
 He was able to deduct about $3,000 of that loss on his 2003 return, Mr. Cunningham said.
 But the mayor remains really, really rich. So rich that he pays taxes at what his accountants say is functionally the highest marginal rate: 34.76 percent.

HEADLINE: Kerry, in Midwest Tour, Laments Lost Jobs

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: CLOQUET, Minn., July 2 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry began his Fourth of July bus tour of the Midwest Friday with a patriotic paean to the heartland and a scathing indictment of the Bush administration for being too willing to settle for modest job growth. 
 At a rally festooned in red, white and blue that drew thousands to this small city near Duluth, Mr. Kerry said that the latest employment numbers were simply not good enough. The Labor Department reported Friday that employers added 112,000 jobs in June, fewer than half the number in recent months. 
 ''This administration says to you that this is the best economy of our lifetime,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''They say that this is the best that we can do. They've even called us pessimists.''
 Mr. Kerry's campaign noted that despite recent hiring, private-sector jobs were still down 1.8 million since President Bush took office. ''We have a million and a half jobs lost, and I don't believe that's the best that we can do,'' he said. 
 Cloquet was the first stop on Mr. Kerry's three-day, 546-mile bus tour through Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, an effort to reach out to small-town and rural America. Mr. Kerry's 22-vehicle caravan was covered with signs about ''Celebrating the Spirit of America,'' and Mr. Kerry himself reached for a folksy air. 
 He took off his jacket, made jokes about Washington and mocked the Starbucks dependency of the traveling press corps. He mentioned the local hangouts. And he promised to ''honor the values that built our country -- family, responsibility, service -- values rooted in the heartland.'' 
 Beneath an old movie marquee that declared, ''God Bless America, Welcome John Kerry,'' Mr. Kerry also talked about the flag that was waving throughout the scene. Recalling his service in Vietnam and citing the service of many others in Iraq, Mr. Kerry declared again that the flag does not belong to one party or one ideology. ''That flag stands for the best hopes of all Americans and it belongs to the American people.''
 Mr. Kerry ended his day at a rally in Bloomer, Wis., where another sprawling crowd listened to Mr. Kerry describe Mr. Bush's job creation record as the worst since Herbert Hoover. The rally ended with a fireworks display over the cornfields and Mr. Kerry making an impromptu appearance with the band playing the guitar to the Woody Guthrie song ''This Land Is Your Land.'' 
 Mr. Kerry also made an impassioned call for action on the rising cost of health insurance. He asked the crowd, ''Have your premiums gone up in the last few years?'' The audience shouted back that they had. ''Have your co-pays gone up?'' Again, the answer was yes.
 Then, Mr. Kerry said, ''It's up to us to say to this administration, which has no plan, 'We're fed up and your time is up.''' He added, ''This president not only has no plan, he doesn't even talk about it.''
 Mr. Kerry was accompanied by some of his old crewmates from Vietnam, and was introduced as a man more than ready to be commander in chief by Representative Jim Oberstar, the Democrat who represents this district. ''John Kerry has been shot at and in combat,'' Mr. Oberstar said. ''He will not mislead America into war.''
 Amid swirling speculation on his choice of a running mate, Mr. Kerry gave one hint Friday about how he would disclose his pick. He said he would announce his decision by e-mailing it to the estimated one million people who are now registered at johnkerry.com. ''They're the people that have been closest, closest to the campaign,'' he said.
 In an interview in Cloquet, Mr. Kerry was critical of the administration's economic performance. The net job growth this month, he said, was ''very weak,'' adding that workers were being hurt ''every day'' by the loss of well-paying jobs overseas.
 The Kerry campaign also put out what it asserted was the ''Bush misery index'' for Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa -- including the increase in the cost of gas, tuition and health insurance, the rise in bankruptcies and the increasing reliance on low wage jobs. 
 The Bush campaign scoffed at the idea that rural and small-town America would fare better under Mr. Kerry, and continued to argue that this crucial bloc of support for Mr. Bush would hold firm. 
 In general, though, Mr. Kerry was not relying only on economics to make his connection here. When asked how he hoped to connect to rural voters, the Massachusetts Democrat replied, ''I actually represent the conservative values that they feel.''
 In his speech in Cloquet, he talked of how the war in Iraq and Afghanistan affected small towns. ''You've lost friends and family members, firefighters, police and many others across our nation that mean so much to your communities,'' he said. He noted that three marines from the area died in the war this year. 
 Mr. Kerry ended his speech, and his bus caravan began its long journey through the small towns of the Midwest.

HEADLINE: The Sluggish Wage Recovery

 BODY:
It would be wrong to read too much into one month's statistics, but there is plenty of reason to worry that this expansion is not raising wages as much as American families need. The American economy added 112,000 new jobs last month, far fewer than expected. That number represents a notable slowdown from the strong pace of hiring in the previous three months. 
 President Bush tried to put a good spin on the jobs report yesterday in talking about the economy to a group of business executives: ''This economy of ours is steady and strong. It's steady and strong. It's steady and strong, which means people are going back to work: 1.5 million jobs since last August. That is steady growth.'' Mr. Bush's speech attributed much of this strength to his tax cuts. 
 Assigning the White House too much blame or credit for job losses or gains is a silly game in a free-market economy that is cyclical by nature. What's surprising is that President Bush would want to play the game. The economy has still lost 1.1 million more jobs than it has gained on his watch, leaving Mr. Bush at risk of being the first president since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net loss of jobs.
 In his rosy remarks yesterday, Mr. Bush also failed to mention that average hourly earnings have not kept up with inflation in the last year. They are up only 2 percent. Nor did he mention that his huge tax cuts for the affluent have done little to help those living from paycheck to paycheck.
 The nation's impressive productivity growth will make it difficult to significantly reduce the 5.6 percent unemployment rate. And in the absence of a tighter labor market, there is little chance that workers will see wages increase anywhere near as much as corporate profits have. Indeed, take-home pay, as a share of the economy, is at its lowest level since the government started keeping track in 1929. All of this suggests that the recovery remains a work in progress for many Americans.

HEADLINE: Military Draft? Official Denials Leave Skeptics

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1 

 BODY:
The Pentagon says no. The Selective Service System says no. And Congressional leaders say absolutely not.
 Yet talk of reinstating the military draft persists around the country, driven by the Internet, high-profile moves by the military to shore up its forces and fears that all those solid reassurances about no need for conscription could quickly melt away if world events took a turn for the worse.
 ''The mood of, if not the country but a significant plurality of the country, is highly skeptical,'' said the founder of StopTheDraft.com, Barry Zellen, who has seen traffic to his site jump in recent months. ''If the world spun madly out of control, where would they get the boots on the ground?'' 
 Congressional aides say their offices receive a steady stream of telephone calls and e-mail messages inquiring about the status of the draft. Lawmakers themselves are regularly asked if Congress is preparing to re-establish the system, abolished by President Richard M. Nixon 31 years ago. 
 ''Everyone says, 'We've got young children, and we don't want them in the draft,' '' said Bill Ghent, a spokesman for Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware.
 At the offices of the Selective Service System, which in 1980 resumed registering men at age 18 in the event the draft was ever resurrected, inquiries arrive daily along with a barrage of requests from news organizations for interviews about the idea of restoring mandatory military service. 
 ''People think it is some big government conspiracy,'' said Harald Stavenas, a spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee, which gets its share of draft questions as well.
 But top lawmakers, joined by Pentagon leaders and administration officials, say that there are definitely no plans to resume the draft and that the military is much better off relying on a substantially motivated volunteer force rather than on conscripts.
 ''The idea of bringing back the draft, I think the chances are slim and none -- and slim left town,'' one member of the House committee, Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California, said this week after returning from Iraq. ''People can relax about that issue.'' 
 The senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin of Michigan, agreed.
 ''I don't think we're going to need to reinstitute the draft,'' Mr. Levin said. ''The combination of recruiting and retention is doing fairly well.''
 The roots of the anxiety about the draft can be traced to several developments, among them recent steps taken by the Defense Department to bolster forces stretched by service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this year the Pentagon issued an order requiring some soldiers to remain in uniform beyond their expected dates for leaving the service. This week the military announced that it would recall to the barracks 5,600 former active-duty soldiers with certain skills who have time remaining as reservists. And Congress is moving to expand the size of the Army and the Marines.
 Lawrence J. Korb, an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, says unease about the prospect of a draft surfaces frequently in his travels around the country. He says unwillingness to accept official reassurances is attributable to public cynicism about the Bush administration's case for war in Iraq.
 ''I think it is skepticism that we have been misled so many times about this war: weapons of mass destruction, ties to Al Qaeda, a cakewalk,'' said Mr. Korb, now at the liberal Center for American Progress. ''People are clearly worried and figure, 'They are just waiting until the election is over to spring the bad news on us.'''
 He and others said this could appear to those people to be nothing less than logical progression, after the military's resorting to an extension of tours of duty and the recall of former active-duty soldiers.
 ''I think what is behind the current public discussion is the sense the Defense Department is using coercion to maintain the service of those who might otherwise get out,'' said James Burk, a sociology professor at Texas A&M who studies the intersection of military and public policy issues. ''That kind of coercion has a resonance of what the draft is all about.'' 
 Neither Mr. Korb nor Professor Burk believes that compulsory service will be reinstituted without mobilization of a scale far beyond anything now needed. But neither do they believe that the buzz will subside. ''It will simmer on the back burner and in the chat rooms,'' Professor Burk said.
 The issue has also been addressed on opinion pages of newspapers around the country. A column in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer called a draft a ''poison pill'' too unrealistic for the president to consider. Another, in The Chicago Tribune, said that with a military whose members are all volunteers, ''we lose our sense of shared sacrifice as a nation.''
 Indeed, many editorials and op-ed articles focus on the idea that a draft would distribute the burden of war across racial and economic divides. In The Washington Post this week, Noel Koch, who as a Nixon speechwriter wrote a legislative message on the draft's end, said nonetheless that the draft had ''shattered class distinctions'' in the military, mixing high school dropouts with college graduates, rich with poor.
 Seeking to blunt public speculation, the Web site of the Selective Service System carries a long notice saying in part that ''both the president and secretary of defense have stated on more than one occasion that there is no need for a draft for the war on terrorism or any likely contingency, such as Iraq.''
 ''Additionally,'' the notice says, ''the Congress has not acted on any proposed legislation to reinstate the draft.''
 ''The bottom line,'' said Dan Amon, a spokesman for the Selective Service System, ''is it would take an act of Congress because we could not turn it on ourselves. And there is no mood or sentiment in Congress whatsoever for the draft.''
 Polls show there is little public sentiment for it either, no small consideration in the Congressional thinking. In a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 70 percent of those surveyed were against reinstating the draft, and the opposition was shared almost equally among Democrats, Republicans and independents.
 The speculation was initially spurred last year when the Selective Service System began trying to fill vacancies on local draft boards. That was accompanied by reports that the agency had received an extra $28 million in its budget.
 But Mr. Amon said the draft board recruitment effort had been undertaken because of the expiration of the 20-year terms of members appointed after President Jimmy Carter re-established registration in 1980. And the $28 million was the agency's regular budget, cut to $26 million by Congress, he said.
 E-mail messages circulating about a draft also point to legislation pending in both houses of Congress that would require either military or some other national service. But those measures, written by Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, both Democrats, are much more a political statement than potential law, since they have no Republican support and no chance of passage this year. 
 Mr. Rangel acknowledges that his initial goal in introducing his measure was to stir opposition to the war in Iraq, his point being that privileged Americans -- including politicians -- would be far less eager to commit troops if their own sons and daughters had to fight alongside those who join the military to get ahead. 
 He said the inequality in the burden of warfare was being borne out by the ''cruel'' Pentagon decision to call back former active-duty soldiers. And he said Americans were right to remain vigilant about the possibility of a draft, given the Iraq conflict.
 ''If we are really saying we are going to stay there for as long as it takes and we don't have international people sharing the sacrifice,'' Mr. Rangel said, ''sooner or later Americans have to say, 'They are now talking about us.''' 
 Many of his colleagues reject that view, saying there are plenty of Americans willing to join the military on their own.
 ''You have drafts when you can't get the requisite numbers,'' said the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California. ''There is not now indications that you can't get the requisite numbers. But we watch those numbers every month.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Invoking 'Values' Theme To Frame Issues

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 2 

 BODY:
Forty-eight minutes into a rambling speech about education, health care, jobs and equal opportunity here the other morning, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts went off-script to sum up his White House quest in a simple sentence. ''In the end it's about values,'' he told a conference of the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
 Mr. Kerry, the expected Demo-cratic presidential nominee, had used similar language to dispatch the first two queries at a news conference the day before. ''I'm optimis- tic about how America could live up to our values,'' he said when asked about a new Republican Internet advertisement. 
 A moment later, he said of the Supreme Court decision concerning detainees that he wished the Bush administration had done ''what was in keeping with the values and spirit of our country.'' 
 Last Saturday, Mr. Kerry used the V-word no fewer than eight times in a 36-minute speech to Hispanic leaders and next Wednesday he is scheduled to give a speech on his ''plan to restore America's values to the White House.''
 It sounds the same whether he is discussing the minimum wage or immigration, foreign policy or his own biography: Senator Kerry is increasingly adopting a traditionally Republican refrain to give his campaign -- and himself -- grounding and context in broad moral terms.
 This is a shift from Mr. Kerry's pitch during the primaries -- when several of his opponents, most particularly Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, spoke frequently of family, values and faith -- but it follows President Bill Clinton's 1996 playbook.
 Mr. Kerry also occasionally invokes God, either when talking about his own recovery from prostate can-cer, or to say ''God bless'' soldiers, for example. But the focus on values may be less an appeal to the religious right, a constituency seen as a critical part of Mr. Bush's coalition, than outreach to what Democratic strategists call ''secular values voters'' -- people concerned about balancing work and family, opportunities for their children, and America's leadership in the world.
 Democratic strategists say they believe President Bush is vulnerable among these voters because he no longer emphasizes the ''compassionate conservative'' theme of his 2000 campaign, and because of how the Iraq war has been conducted.
 With this year's election expected to turn in large measure on external events -- a boom in the economy, say, or an unraveling in Iraq -- winning votes through an appeal to values seems more stable. Kerry aides also say the increased use of values-laden remarks signals a new phase in Mr. Kerry's presentation, in which he explains his policies as extensions of his convictions.
 ''Americans speak in values terms, so when you use the values language, it's much easier to connect with ordinary people,'' said Al From, chief executive of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, which listed a belief in ''the moral and cultural values that most Americans share'' in its founding document in 1990, a position that Mr. Clinton used effectively in his campaign. ''People look for grounding. They want to see what's at the core of somebody who's running for president.''
 Mark Penn, who helped develop Mr. Clinton's values strategy in 1996, said a recent survey of likely voters that he conducted for an independent group of Democrats found that one in five said values would be the most important issue to them this fall. That is fewer than those who named the economy or security, but still significant.
 The polling also showed that Mr. Bush has a significant advantage with such voters, but that Mr. Kerry could make inroads, Mr. Penn said. He noted that even though Mr. Bush led Mr. Kerry among such voters, Mr. Kerry held a slight advantage when the voters were asked which candidate ''shares your values.'' Mr. Kerry performed better on tolerance, responsibility and compassion; Mr. Bush had the edge on leadership, strength and moral character.
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls in 1996 and 2000 showed Mr. Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore performed about equally among the voters who agreed with Democratic positions on issues like abortion or gun control. But Mr. Clinton did better than Mr. Gore among those voters who disagreed. That makes Democrats think they can win over people in part by the way they frame the discussion. 
 Mr. Penn said the audience Democrats hoped a values theme would appeal to were not those affiliated with the religious right, but voters -- mainly women -- whose choices were guided by ''compassion, responsibility, honoring your parents and protecting your kids.''
 That is whom Mr. Kerry sought to reach on Friday in Cloquet, Minn., when he promised to ''honor the values that built our country and strengthened our communities,'' listing family, responsibility and service as ''values that are rooted in the heartland.'' And those are the people he was trying to address on Monday in Baltimore, when he characterized the election as ''a values choice,'' one between tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 a year or financing for the Youth Build neighborhood program he was visiting. ''My value is with these kids and with the future of this city,'' Mr. Kerry said.
 Those were also the ears he sought when he told the Hispanic leaders last Saturday that illegal immigrants dying in the desert or working in poor conditions did not ''reflect our values as a country built by immigrants.'' The same ones that he hoped heard him promise, last week in Denver, to pursue scientific advances ''guided in our standards by our morals and our values.''
 Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said that what was new in Mr. Kerry's campaigning was not the substance but the terminology -- Democrats, she said, had more typically spoken of ''rights'' while Republicans invoke values.
 For Mr. Kerry, Ms. Jamieson said, ''values are rebutting the charge that he's flip-flopping, because they suggest that he's anchored in moral principle.'' Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's communications director, said that many of the values references recently were the candidate's own ad-libbed flourishes.
 A senior consultant to the campaign said he had urged Mr. Kerry to share more of himself, to explain how his accomplishments and positions were rooted in his background.
 ''We gave them the core structure of who this guy is, but now we're filling in the texture of him,'' said the consultant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to detract attention from Mr. Kerry. ''O.K., you're for health care -- why are you for health care? 'It's the right thing to do. It's a value I've learned.' What out of your life story really answers why you are doing these things and what you're about?'' 
 That process is reminiscent of President Clinton's 1996 re-election effort when aides revised his message after finding his speeches rife in programmatic detail. Thus, overhauling the welfare system became a discussion about the value of work. Balanced budgets were framed as the value of living within means.
 ''We went back and we stated all the programs in terms of the values they represented or were trying to achieve,'' Mr. Penn recalled. 
 Mr. Clinton's second-term struggle concerning his affair with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment hurt the Democrats' credibility on value issues and let Mr. Bush step in promising to ''restore honor and dignity to the White House.'' 
 In turn, Mr. Kerry now vows to restore the nation's esteem in the world, as he tries to frame 35 years in government as ''a lifetime of service and strength'' rather than a lengthy list of legislation.
 ''Both of my parents, like yours, taught me values, they taught me the value of service,'' Senator Kerry told 3,000 members of the Service Employees International Union at their convention last week in San Francisco. ''You better tell this administration that we're fed up and their time is up, we're changing the value system in this country that's broken.''

HEADLINE: U.S. JOB GROWTH FOR JUNE SHOWS STEEP SLOWDOWN

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Job growth slowed sharply in June, the government reported yesterday, pulling back from a recent period of strong employment gains and casting doubt on the vigor of the nation's economic expansion.
 The Labor Department reported that employers added only 112,000 jobs in June, less than half the average monthly increase of the first five months of the year. 
 The reported increase, which includes adjustments intended to account for normal seasonal variations, was under the 150,000 threshold of jobs needed for employment to keep pace with natural labor force growth. It was also well below the 250,000 forecast on average by Wall Street economists, who have been consistently wrong about jobs for the better part of the last year. 
 The unemployment rate, which essentially has not budged all year, remained unchanged from May at 5.6 percent. 
 ''It's pretty clear the economy downshifted in June,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis. 
 The renewed weakness in employment provided unwelcome news to President Bush's re-election campaign, which has been counting on drawing attention to an improving job market to make the case for its economic policies. And it offered fresh ammunition for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic challenger, whose criticism of Mr. Bush's economic track record has been undermined since hiring began setting a fast pace earlier this year. [Page C1.] 
 Several economists, however, suggested that the sluggish June data may have been a fluke, noting that the payroll report can be highly volatile from month to month, and they predicted that it would rebound in July.
 ''It will take more than one weak month to convince us that the economy is struggling,'' said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital.
 At the White House, where President Bush spoke before a group of small-business owners, Mr. Bush sought to cast the new job figures in a positive light. ''The jobs increased by 112,000 in June, which means we've had a total of 1.5 million new jobs since last August,'' the president said. ''To me, that shows the steady growth.''
 N. Gregory Mankiw, the White House's chief economic adviser, dismissed the job report as an aberration. He noted that other economic indicators -- including consumer confidence and the monthly survey of purchasing managers -- still point to a robust economic recovery. 
 ''We should not overweight any specific monthly statistic,'' Mr. Mankiw said. The slowdown in hiring came as Mr. Bush's approval rating on economic issues appeared to be improving. In a Gallup poll in late June, 47 percent of respondents said they approved of the president's handling of the economy, up from 41 percent in a similar poll conducted at the beginning of the month.
 The Kerry campaign seized on the data, issuing a report highlighting the job market's weaknesses since President Bush took office, including a net loss of 1.8 million private-sector jobs.
 ''We've seen three decent job months in the last three and a half years,'' said Jason Furman, the economic policy director of the Kerry campaign, ''but we're still a long way from making up for the millions of jobs lost under President Bush.'' 
 While many economists are confident the economy will maintain a strong pace, a variety of recent signals suggest the recovery may be losing some steam. 
 Last week, the government trimmed its original estimate of economic growth in the first quarter to 3.9 percent from its initial estimate of 4.2 percent. Other recent indications of weakness in retail sales, auto buying and durable goods also hint at a pullback in the economy's strong performance of recent months.
 Stocks were driven down by the sluggish employment report, while bond prices rose sharply as the data allayed fears that accelerating economic growth would fuel inflation. That helped validate the Federal Reserve's professed strategy to raise interest rates gradually. The dollar fell against major foreign currencies on expectations that American interest rates would remain lower for a longer period of time. 
 ''It makes the Fed look right in its approach,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. 
 Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., argued that the job survey was out of step with other economic evidence. 
 Mr. Shepherdson ventured that the Labor Department's new method for seasonally adjusting data might be responsible for the unexpectedly low number. Other economists mentioned that the data might have been distorted because many workers got a day off for the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan, which occurred during the week of the jobs survey and could have artificially reduced the recorded number of hours worked. 
 ''The least likely explanation is that the economy is reversing trends,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''The United States economy doesn't spontaneously implode.''
 Still, until new evidence emerges, the June employment report left a broad impression of weakness. Wages of private nonsupervisory workers -- which account for some 80 percent of total employment -- barely inched up to $15.65 an hour. That represents a mere 2 percent increase from last year, not enough to maintain workers' purchasing power against an inflation rate now running around 3 percent.
 The average workweek fell to 33.6 hours in June from 33.8 hours in May. As a consequence, weekly earnings for private nonsupervisory workers actually declined over the month, before accounting for inflation, falling to $525.84 in June from $528.29 in the previous month. 
 Casting perhaps the broadest pall over the state of the economic recovery, the total index of weekly hours worked in the private sector -- which, as a measure of all the hours worked by all the workers employed, provides a good gauge of the overall state of the economy -- fell to 99.6 in June from 100.2 in May.
 Some previous bright spots dimmed. Construction, which had added 250,000 jobs over the previous 11 months, stalled. Growth in hotel and restaurant jobs slowed. The brief burgeoning of manufacturing employment was cut short, with the number of manufacturing jobs falling by 11,000, after rising by 24,000 in May.
 Even if the slowdown in job creation points to a deceleration in economic growth, the latest figures probably do not spell an end to the recovery.
 ''This doesn't mean that the expansion is over,'' said Jared Bernstein, of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning economic research institute. ''But this expansion never has been pure blue sky. This boosts the sense of insecurity about the expansion.''
 Indeed, many economists will now be eagerly awaiting the next batch of job figures.
 ''It makes me worry a bit about the solidity of what up to now looked like a very solid recovery,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist who is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and now advises the Kerry campaign on economic matters. ''If we get a second weak month it will really change my view.''

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing Back to Southeast Asia

BYLINE: By JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

 BODY:
MANY Americans who invested in Southeast Asian markets in the late 1990's have painful memories. The region endured a severe financial crisis, detonated in 1997 by the devaluation of the Thai currency. The crisis exposed a web of cronyism in business dealings, brought down some of Southeast Asia's most established companies and scared many investors and fund managers, who retreated to other regions.
 But in the past two years, Southeast Asia has rebounded, as governments have instituted policies that created higher consumer spending, rebuilt currency reserves, benefited from rising exports to the United States and tightened corporate governance standards. 
 ''Corporate governance has improved significantly,'' said Mark Headley, portfolio manager of the Matthews Pacific Tiger fund, whose investment region includes Southeast Asia. ''Companies are making efforts to take their shirts off and show you everything that's happening inside their operations.'' 
 Now foreign investors are being drawn back to the main markets of the region: Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. The economy of Thailand is projected to expand 6 percent this year, while Malaysia expects to grow at least 5 percent. Indonesia, which completed its International Monetary Fund reform program in December, expects at least 4 percent growth in 2004. 
 While many of the markets have slumped in recent weeks there is still considerable optimism among foreign investors. Indonesia's bourse reached its highest point in decades in April; the Bangkok stock exchange doubled in value last year. ''There's been massive freeing up of the Thai economy, and restructuring of the banking sector,'' said Edmund Harriss, portfolio manager of the Guinness Atkinson Asia Focus fund, which invests in Southeast Asia, China and South Korea. 
 In fact, overall investment in Asia funds based in the United States, and excluding those that focus on Japan, topped $5 billion in 2003, to a six-year high. In the first quarter this year, such funds rose by 10.8 percent, on average, versus 3 percent for general stock funds that invest in the United States. In the second quarter, they fell by 4.9 percent. 
 Though the region began to heat up months ago, ''there are a lot of exciting stories still in Asia,'' said William Samuel Rocco, senior analyst for emerging market funds at Morningstar. Price-to-earnings ratios in most Southeast Asian markets remain cheaper than in developed markets. 
 But Mr. Rocco warned that people should not put a large percentage of their investments in Asia-only funds if they already own core foreign funds that include Asian emerging-market stocks in their portfolios. ''An Asia fund would be a supplemental holding, and you want your supplemental to diversify a lot from your core holdings,'' he said.
 Mr. Rocco said he thought that Malaysia and Thailand would continue to deliver strong performance this year. He likes the Asia Pacific fund from Matthews Asian Funds because it is a broad regional fund with investments in many Southeast Asian markets. Southeast Asia has many small markets, he said, so specialized funds like Matthews that study each domestic market enjoy an advantage. The Asia Pacific fund rose by 3.3 percent in the quarter. 
 Mr. Rocco also favors the T.Rowe Price New Asia fund, which invests in companies across Asia, though not in Japan. New Asia is less aggressive than Matthews's Asia Pacific fund, he said, but is ''exceptionally cheap, even for a no-load fund.'' Its expense ratio is 1.17 percent, compared with 2.29 percent for similar funds, according to Morningstar. The New Asia fund was up 9.9 percent in the quarter. 
 Rather than focusing on specific countries, other Southeast Asia specialists invest in sectors and in the companies that they regard as positioned to take advantage of the region's most important trends: economic integration, rising consumer spending and China's rapid growth. ''You have to be careful not to pick companies that could be leapfrogged by China,'' said Sam Wilderman, portfolio manager at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company for the Emerging Markets fund, which is closed to new investors. Mr. Wilderman favors technology companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a large semiconductor foundry. He says its workers are so highly skilled that they are years ahead of their mainland competition. American depository receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor trade on the New York Stock Exchange and were down more than 11 percent in the first six months this year. 
 Mr. Harriss, at Guinness Atkinson, says he is convinced that Taiwan Semiconductor, as well as the Taiwan computer giant Acer and the Singapore shipping company Neptune Orient, also have enormous technological advantages over Chinese companies. The American depository receipts of Neptune Orient trade over the counter in the United States. The global depository receipts of Acer are on the London Stock Exchange. 
 Most Asia fund managers also look for companies that appeal to Asian consumers, whose affluence is growing. ''The telecommunications companies clearly are benefiting from the rise in consumer spending,'' Mr. Headley said. He favors the Indonesian Satellite Corporation, or Indosat, one of Indonesia's largest telecommunications providers, and Telekomunikasi Indonesia P.T., sometimes known as Telkom. A.D.R.'s of both companies trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 DESPITE its strengths, Southeast Asia poses political risks. Taiwan and the Philippines held contentious elections earlier this year, and Indonesia's presidential election this summer could be disrupted by violence. Any slowdown in China's economy, or in America's consumer spending, could seriously damage Southeast Asian exporters. Worse, terrorism is always a threat. Southeast Asian intelligence services said they broke up several terrorist plots in the last year.
 T.Rowe Price classifies its New Asia fund as one of its riskiest, and Mr. Wilderman counsels potential investors to have an investment time frame of no less than six months. 
 Mr. Rocco agreed. Because of the potential volatility, ''you have to have a long-term view in Southeast Asia,'' he said.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THE Chrysler 300 would like your attention, please. And attention must be paid, because this car is significant for a variety of reasons. 
 It is the sort of spacious family sedan that Americans used to love, but that has mostly faded from the streets. It represents a return to rear-wheel drive, a setup that Detroit, spurred by the Japanese, mostly abandoned for automobiles long ago.
 And it is proof that there truly have been synergies -- the buzzword that became a dirty word as corporate mergers faltered -- from Daimler-Benz's 1998 takeover of Chrysler. If these 2005 models are the best Chryslers ever made, which they probably are, it is partly because there is a lot of Mercedes-Benz buried inside. 
 But the 300's styling is what grabs you, and like it or loathe it, the car sticks to your eyeballs. The look is fresh, yet familiar, like great American cars of the distant past. Giant slabs of sheet metal cover the long hood and high body sides. The car's greenhouse seems low in comparison, with the scrunched-down windows you might expect in a fortress.
 The look is vaguely menacing and gangsterish; the 300 belongs in the cast of ''The Sopranos,'' perhaps with a stiff in the trunk and Silvio mumbling at the wheel.
 Yet the 300 has an elegant, regal stance. The chief designer, Ralph Gilles, 34, said he kept the word ''noble'' in mind as he refined the design -- meaning noble in the vein of classic Duesenbergs, Rolls-Royces and Chrysler's original 300 of 1955, a powerful coupe with understated styling and a reputation as ''the bankers' hot rod.''
 Consider this comment about the new 300: ''It's American. It's bold, and it's an absolute home run.'' Those are not the words of a Chrysler executive or a company news release, but of a competitor, Kip Wasenko, a General Motors designer. Mr. Wasenko, who has his own solid record as the mastermind of Cadillac's successful new look, lavished praise on the 300 during a recent panel discussion on car design.
 With chrome ornamentation everywhere, the 300 flaunts its bling-bling. Its most striking feature is its supersize chrome-plated egg-crate grille. As a 300 drove toward us, my 16-year-old daughter said, ''Look at that thing that looks like a grill.'' That is, I pointed out, the car's grille. ''No,'' she responded, ''I mean a barbecue grill.'' 
 Inside, the 300 is tailored and elegant. Controls are simple and straightforward. The black-on-white gauges of my 300C test car resembled the faces of expensive watches. The trim looked like tortoise shell instead of the expected wood. My only complaint with the interior: the plastic around the center of the dashboard, painted to match the exterior chrome, looked chintzy.
 Naysayers had predicted that Americans wouldn't like such an aggressively styled rear-drive sedan. After seeing a concept prototype a couple of years ago, a Wall Street financial analyst went so far as to describe the 300 and its sibling, the Dodge Magnum, as Chrysler's ''big leveraged bet.'' 
 But the bet is paying off. Chrysler has sold 36,059 since the car went on sale in April and has enough orders to swallow up all the cars produced at the Brampton, Ontario, plant for the rest of the year.
 Further, the 300 is stealing sales from competitors, mostly the hometown rivals. About 40 percent of the trade-ins are Chrysler and Dodge models, according to Power Information Network, an affiliate of J.D. Power & Associates that gathers vehicle purchase information from dealers. 
 But nearly 20 percent of the trade-ins have been General Motors vehicles; another 14 percent were Fords and Lincolns. 
 Proving that the car has mainstream appeal, the 300 is hitting its demographic mark, mostly men around 50 years old. That is more than 10 years younger than buyers of other rear-drive American cars with V-8's, like the Mercury Grand Marquis. 
 Yet the 300C also appeals to the young style-obsessed hip-hop crowd. Snoop Dogg called Chrysler's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, to ask how he could get one. The car is featured on the latest cover of Dub, a magazine that is highly influential with the customizers who ''pimp'' their rides with gargantuan tires and costly, flashy wheels. 
 The 300 comes in four versions with three engines: the base model ($23,595) with a 190-horsepower 2.7-liter V-6; the Touring ($27,395) and Limited ($29,890) with a 250-horsepower 3.5-liter V6; and the 300C ($32,995) with the 340-horsepower Hemi V-8.
 The V-6's are paired with a Chrysler four-speed automatic transmission; the Hemi is mated to a modified Mercedes-Benz five-speed automatic, built in Kokomo, Ind. A hotter version is said to be in the works with an even more powerful Hemi.
 More than half of the 300's leaving showrooms have the Hemi, surprisingly more than Chrysler expected. It's not hard to see why, as I found when I test-drove the 300C . The engine delivers lightning-quick takeoffs from a dead stop -- Car and Driver timed a 0 to 60 m.p.h. run at 5.3 seconds -- and autobahn-capable passing power. To improve fuel economy, the Hemi is designed to shut down half of its cylinders under certain conditions, like highway cruising. Try as I might, I could not detect when the cylinders shut down.
 Still, the Hemi's mileage rating isn't great, at 17 in town and 25 on the highway, but unlike many competitors Chrysler doesn't require premium fuel. The 2.7 engine is rated at 21/28 and the 3.5 at 19/27. 
 I spent a week with the Hemi, but a short test drive with the 3.5 engine, a tried-and-true Chrysler V-6, proved that it had plenty of smooth power, too. It's too bad the 3.5 isn't paired with the same silky five-speed.
 Still, the mix of 300's being sold is far richer than Chrysler expected, generating a much-needed lift to Chrysler's bottom line. 
 Styling is only part of the story. From the start, engineers insisted on rear drive, something Chrysler hadn't had in its cars since the 1989 Fifth Avenue -- produced when Lee A. Iacocca was chairman. 
 One of this car's predecessors, the 300M that was offered until this year, had a V-6 only; its front-drive layout couldn't accommodate the powerful V-8 that is considered essential in a flagship luxury sedan. 
 Although Chrysler has spent two decades persuading Americans of front drive's benefits, its executives say they think the public is ready to shift back, given the popularity of rear-drive trucks.
 To address concerns about rear drive in snowy climates, Chrysler will follow Europeans' lead and offer an all-wheel-drive option, starting in September. German automakers have done well by offering all-wheel-drive versions of their sedans, and the trend is reaching Detroit. 
 Traction and stability control, which provide some added bad-weather prowess, will also be standard or optional on rear-drive 300's.
 Under the 300's provocative American skin are some solid German bones. The 300's chassis is loosely derived from the one under the Mercedes E-Class. Chrysler also borrowed that car's steering, supportive seats, electrical components and five-speed automatic transmission.
 Although the 300 looks substantial and massive, it is actually a bit shorter than the 300M it replaces. The designers purposely stuck to a length of roughly 5 meters (16.4 feet) so the 300 could avoid big-car taxes overseas. (It will be available in Europe, Australia and China, where a turbodiesel engine will be offered.)
 Though shorter over all, the 300's wheelbase is a lengthy 120 inches, about a half-foot longer than that of the Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis. The combination of short length and long wheelbase provides roomy inside accommodations and a spacious trunk of 16 cubic feet, yet the handling is surprisingly nimble, even in parking lots.
 The suspensions are tuned to match each model. The ride of the tested 300C was so quiet and comfortable that I started thinking of the car as a Chrysler Mercedes.
 The 300 diverts from the Mercedes with its exceedingly reasonable prices; at $24,000 and up, it is right in the heart of the midsize market. Even a fully loaded 300C would be less than $40,000, a spot where few roomy, rear-drive performance cars can be found.

HEADLINE: After a Moment in the Sun, Bear Funds Go Back to Sleep

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
BEAR funds, which can fall in and out of favor as quickly as rock stars, made a brief comeback this spring, rising to the top of the charts for a while in April and May. But then stocks rebounded, and the bear funds ended the quarter as one of the industry's weakest groups.
 No doubt, some short-term speculators made money in bear funds, which seek to profit from declines in stocks or bonds, but investors who held onto their shares this spring did not. The same holds true over the last few years. Many bear funds had spectacular returns in 2000 and 2002, when stocks swooned. But by this point in the stock market rebound, the bear fund category -- the Prudent Bear fund being a notable exception -- has lost money over the last one, three and five years. 
 ''These are generally not funds for individual investors to play around with,'' said David Kathman, a fund analyst at Morningstar. ''They are marketed for pros.'' 
 ''If you think the market has reached a top, you might be tempted to put some money in a bear fund,'' he added. ''I wouldn't recommend it, but if you do, treat it as almost like gambling.'' He suggests a maximum allocation of 5 percent of a portfolio.
 Bear funds are typically marketed as a way for investors to hedge their portfolios, or for speculators to pursue short-term gains. Again, Prudent Bear is an exception. Its adviser, David W. Tice, advocates long-term investing, and his firm, David W. Tice & Associates, based in Milwaukee, added a redemption fee on July 1 to make the fund less attractive to market timers. Now any investor who sells shares within 30 days of buying them will pay a 1 percent fee, which goes into the fund's assets. 
 In contrast, Michael L. Sapir, chief executive of ProFunds, which has some of the largest bear funds, promotes them as market-timing investments. ''We would not advocate people investing in bear equity funds for the long term,'' Mr. Sapir said, adding that sophisticated individual investors might want to place short-term bets in them. ''We tend to look at bear funds as funds that you might want to date, but you wouldn't want to marry.'' 
 Both ProFunds and its rival, Rydex, offer index-style funds that seek to return the opposite of major stock market indexes. Some of the ProFunds aim for double the opposite returns; for instance, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falls 2 percent in a day, the ProFunds UltraBear fund should rise 4 percent.
 Day to day, the ProFunds and Rydex funds usually come close to their goals, Mr. Kathman said. ''But if you look over a quarter, it almost certainly won't be exactly the inverse or twice the inverse,'' he said, especially when there are ''a lot of ups and downs.''
 Hersh M. Shefrin, a finance professor at Santa Clara University in California who specializes in the psychology of investing, is wary of bear funds in general. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of participants in some test groups say they are ''above average'' at anything they take some pride in, like investing, he said, compared with about 10 percent who rate themselves ''below average.''
 ''The folks that market these funds will appeal to that overconfidence,'' Professor Shefrin said. ''They'll say, 'This is right for you because you're a sophisticated investor.'''
 BUT market timing is incredibly difficult, even for professional investors, he added. ''The market is essentially so close to being random,'' he said. ''There is a little bit of predictability for smart professional investors, but most individual investors don't have the technical skill to do it.''
 But to Mr. Tice of Prudent Bear, market timing is not the issue. He argues that stocks are still in the early stages of a long decline, much like the bear markets that began in 1929 and 1966, both of which lasted 17 years. ''I have never been more convinced of anything in my life,'' Mr. Tice said, adding that he considered the stock market gains of 2003 a bear market rally. The nation's economy is now ''built on a foundation of debt,'' he said, and he expects the broad market indexes to be lower in 10 years than they are today. 
 Unlike the larger index-style bear funds, Prudent Bear is actively managed. Mr. Tice tries to minimize losses during market rallies by shorting individual stocks and by holding defensive stocks like gold companies, which historically have tended to do well during market selloffs.
 Prudent Bear was the top-performing bear fund in 2000, returning 30.5 percent, and in 2002, rising 62.9 percent. It even rose over the three-year period ended June 30, returning 13.4 percent, annualized.
 The last year and a half have been difficult, though. Prudent Bear declined 10.4 percent in 2003, which Mr. Tice called ''a nightmare period for a short seller,'' and it lost more than 9 percent in the first six months this year. Mr. Tice attributes the drop this year to a decline in his gold stocks, although he is holding onto them. In fact, he said, most of his own money is either in the Prudent Bear fund or in gold stocks.
 He is so convinced that a bear market looms, he said, that ''it's hard for me to say that 5 percent is enough'' to invest in a bear market fund, ''because if you lose your job and your equity portfolio declines, 5 percent isn't going to do much.''
 In the second quarter, however, the only two bear market funds with strong returns bet against bonds, seeking to profit as rates rose.
 The ProFunds Rising Rates Opportunity fund returned 7.6 percent in the investor class of shares, which are sold by brokers. Investors in the Rydex Juno fund made 6.2 percent on investor class shares. Rydex Juno C, with a smaller minimum initial investment, returned 6 percent in the second quarter. 
 Mr. Sapir suggested using ProFunds Rising Rates Opportunity to hedge a bond-heavy portfolio. ''There's much more room for interest rates to go up than there is for them to go down,'' he said.
 Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York, disagreed. ''That's like putting your money on both red and black at the roulette wheel,'' he said. ''The appropriate way for people to hedge bonds is to shorten their maturity.''
 Reflecting widespread concern over rising interest rates, the ProFunds Rising Rates Opportunity fund took in $292 million in new investments in the last quarter, and Rydex Juno took in $1.266 billion, according to AMG Data Services.
 Both of those funds are more costly to own than a typical bond fund. The ProFunds Rising Rates investor shares, with a $15,000 minimum investment, have 1.57 percent in annual expenses. There is also an adviser class of shares with a $5,000 minimum, but the charge is 2.57 percent. Rydex Juno's investor share class has expenses of 1.41 percent, and its adviser class charges 1.91 percent. Both require a $25,000 minimum. Rydex Juno C, with a $2,500 minimum, and a 1 percent back-end load, charges 2.4 percent. Average annual expenses for mutual funds that invest in bonds are 1.12 percent, according to Morningstar.
 ''When something is novel, they can get away with charging more,'' Mr. Schatsky said. ''For most people, bear market funds don't justify the expense.''

HEADLINE: The Chinese Century 

BYLINE: By Ted C. Fishman. 
Ted C. Fishman, a contributing editor for Harper's Magazine, is writing a book about China's place in the world. This is his first cover article for The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
China used to be far away, the country at the bottom of the world. Certainly that must be how it seemed just 20 years ago in a place like Pekin, Ill., a city of 34,000 residents on the Illinois River that took its name from the Chinese capital in the 1820's. According to local legend, Pekin is directly opposite Beijing on the globe. The high-school teams there were still called the Chinks until 1981, when they were renamed the Dragons. A smart and forward-looking decision, it turns out: as is happening throughout the United States, the Pekinese have in their own local ways grown inextricably linked to the Chinese of today. They are now connected not by an imaginary hole through the earth but by the world's shipping lanes, financial markets, telecommunications networks and, above all, the globalization of appetites. 
 Follow the corn, for example. Trade deals struck between the U.S. and China in April will, farmers around Pekin hope, lead China to lower its import barriers and buy half a million metric tons of American corn this year. Illinois corn farmers get higher-than-usual prices for their exports because they have ready access to river transportation and in turn to big ports. Pekin is also home to the plant of Aventine Renewable Energy, the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, a fuel derived from corn. (Ten percent of the American corn crop is converted to fuel.) China recently passed Japan as the world's second-largest consumer of petroleum, and growing Chinese demand has lately been pushing up oil prices worldwide. That makes ethanol an increasingly attractive alternative. And, indeed, ethanol prices climbed 40 cents a gallon this spring, dragging up U.S. corn prices as a result, a boon to Pekin's farmers and industry.
 Then there's Excel Foundry and Machine, a local factory that makes parts for machinery used in heavy construction and mining operations. Doug Parsons, the current head of this family-owned business, has already relocated 12 percent of the company's production to China in order to hold onto business that would otherwise be lost to China's huge, cheap foundries; during the next decade he may well have to move much more of his production offshore. Parsons has China on his mind for other reasons too: over the past few months, the prices of copper and iron, like those of oil, have skyrocketed in response to Chinese demand, driving up Excel's costs as a result. At the same time, however, his international mining customers have been buying more Excel products in order to feed that same Chinese appetite for commodities. And Parsons himself recently started a new company that he says will build and service advanced rock-crushing machines -- in part to take advantage of the frenzied construction boom under way in China. (One measure of just how big this boom is: China currently has more than 15,000 highway projects in the works, which will add 162,000 kilometers of road to the country, enough to circle the planet at the equator four times.)
 Even something as all-American as Pekin's new Wal-Mart Supercenter spreads China's influence around town. Because 12 percent of China's exports to the U.S. end up on Wal-Mart's shelves, and because Wal-Mart's trade with China accounts for 1 percent of that country's gross domestic product, the company exerts tremendous downward pressure on prices. Its buying power enables it to dictate, in effect, what a Chinese manufacturer will get for producing goods that American consumers want. By selling Chinese-made portable DVD players with seven-inch L.C.D. screens for less than $200, for instance, Wal-Mart helped to cut the price of these trendy devices in half over the last year. Competitors have to match the chain's prices or go under. Nearly every shopper in Pekin will therefore save money by shopping at Wal-Mart -- which is to say he or she will profit from the retailer's China connection. Of course, this very connection may also contribute to Wal-Mart's ability to drive other Pekin-area stores out of business.
 In short, Pekin, Ill., is not so different from lots of American places. China is everywhere these days, influencing our lives as consumers, providers, citizens. It has by far the world's most rapidly changing large economy, and our reactions to it shift just as quickly. China is at one moment our greatest threat, the next our friend. It siphons off American jobs; it is essential to our competitive edge. China is the world's factory floor, and it is the world's greatest market opportunity. China's industrial might steals opportunities from the developing world, even as its booming economy pulls poorer countries up (lately it has been getting credit for helping Japan out of its slump too). China exports deflation; it stokes soaring prices. China will boom; it will bust. Or perhaps the country's economy is feeling its way right now to the soft landing that will prevent another Asian economic crash, and all the recent record numbers on trade, industrial output, consumer spending and debt are simply now in scale with China's size. The truth about China is that, like all big countries, it is full of real contradictions.
 Another truth is that the current feelings about China do not fully reflect today's reality. The U.S. economy is about eight times the size of China's. Our manufacturing sector is bigger than the entire Chinese economy. Americans, per capita, earn 36 times what the Chinese do. And there is no shortage of potential roadblocks in China's path, either. Its banks may collapse. Its poor and its minorities may rebel. Uppity Taiwan and lunatic North Korea may push China to war. The U.S. could slap taxes on everything China ships to us. 
 Still, barring Mao's resurrection or nuclear cataclysm, nothing is likely to keep China down for long. Since 1978, its gross domestic product has risen fourfold; in straight dollar terms, China's economy is the world's sixth-largest, with a G.D.P. of around $1.4 trillion. It has gone from being virtually absent in international trade to the world's third-most-active trading nation, behind the U.S. and Germany and ahead of Japan. Tom Saler, a financial journalist, has pointed out that 21 recessions, a depression, two stock-market crashes and two world wars were not able to stop the U.S. economy's growth, over the last century, from $18 billion ($367 billion in 2000 dollars) to $10 trillion. In constant dollars, that is a 27-fold increase. 
 China is poised for similar growth in this century. Even if China's people do not, on average, have the wealth Americans do, and even if the United States continues to play a strong economic game and to lead in technology, China will still be an ever more formidable competitor. If any country is going to supplant the U.S. in the world marketplace, China is it.

Mao as Proto-Capitalist
 Mornings at Wanfeng automotive factory outside Shanghai begin with a neat line of employees doing calisthenics to martial music broadcast over a P.A. system. The blue-uniformed workers, nearly all of them young men, make for a clean-cut, well-pressed company line. The Japanese introduced courtyard exercises and company songs to the world back in the 70's, when that nation appeared to have the world's best industrial jobs. Today, Japan is just stumbling out of a long malaise, and its dwindling pool of young laborers seem to lack the compulsion to work like hell. 
 But the striving Japan of old still sets a good example for would-be worldbeaters, as Wanfeng's management knows -- only the Chinese manufacturer goes one better. Its employees regularly have their spirits revved at company boot camps run by People's Liberation Army drillmasters who inculcate the twin virtues of patriotism and hard work. The results are impressive. Ten years ago, Wanfeng was hammering out motorcycle wheels by hand in a Chinese garage; a few years later it was the No. l seller of aluminum-alloy motorcycle wheels, first in China and now in Asia. The company soon became a top national and global seller in alloy automobile wheels too.
 Wanfeng may have received some breaks on the way up: the company-produced video that describes its rapid ascent does not identify the early contracts that enabled Wanfeng to grow so fast, nor whether Wanfeng had insider connections to state-run companies in the motorcycle and car businesses. There is nothing in the company literature about how the private company secured its financing, either. Nonetheless, Wanfeng today is still scrappy, aggressive and capable. It now turns out about 60,000 vehicles a year that, if you squint just a little, appear to be remarkably like Jeep Grand Cherokees. They look great, come with every modern luxury, including leather seats and DVD video systems, and purr when driven.
 Yet Wanfeng's factory itself is a bare-bones machine. Most tellingly -- this goes a long way toward accounting for China's current status as an economic juggernaut -- there is not a single robot in sight. Instead, there are hundreds of young men, newly arrived from China's expanding technical schools, manning the assembly lines with little more than large electric drills, wrenches and rubber mallets. Engines and body panels that would, in a Western, Korean or Japanese factory, move from station to station on automatic conveyors are hauled by hand and hand truck here. This is why Wanfeng can sell its hand-made luxury versions of the Jeep (to buyers in the Middle East, mostly) for $8,000 to $10,000. The company isn't spending money on multimillion-dollar machines to build cars; it's using highly skilled workers who cost at most a few hundred dollars a month -- whose yearly pay, in other words, is less than the monthly pay of new hires in Detroit. Factory wages in the country's booming east coast cities can be $120 to $160 a month and half that inland, according to Merrill Weingrod of China Strategies, an affiliate of Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting firm.
 Wanfeng is hardly the first to mobilize Chinese labor as a stand-in for machinery. Mao Zedong believed that China could leapfrog other developing countries by employing an effectively unlimited supply of human labor. Chinese peasants and urban laborers would take the place of the expensive machines that the Western industrial powers had spent 100 years developing; China's wealth, Mao reasoned, lay in its abundant population. 
 He was right, though China failed disastrously to execute his Great Leap Forward in the late 50's. Most famously, Mao exhorted the Chinese to build backyard furnaces to melt down their iron implements, all in service of his goal to have China outproduce Great Britain in steel and to surpass the British economy in size in 15 years. Instead, the people were left without the few tools, pots and pans they had started with. And they starved: the Great Leap Forward was the direct cause of the famine that killed 30 million people, among the deadliest man-made disasters in history.
 But even as the Communists pauperized the nation and continued to exercise complete control over the deployment of labor -- determining, for example, who would be moved out of the countryside and into the cities -- they also primed China for the capitalist successes to come. Prasenjit Duara, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Chicago, acknowledges the paradox: ''The Communists made the work force docile and organized labor to be a managed entity that could be continuously mobilized,'' he says. ''A Marxist might see China under Mao as producing the conditions of capitalism.'' (Duara adds that the institutions created by the Communists to provide housing, education and medical care later saved capitalists the price of developing the work force.) An obedient labor force keeps management costs down too. Despite the enormous numbers of workers in Chinese factories, the ranks of managers who supervise them are remarkably thin by Western standards. Depending on the work, you might see 15 managers for 5,000 workers, an indication of how incredibly well self-managed they are.
 ''There is a reason why the world is so impressed by Chinese workers,'' Weingrod says. ''Culturally, the Chinese put a very high premium on not losing face. In manufacturing, that translates into not making mistakes on the production line. Their self-discipline and their ability to adapt are key factors driving Chinese competitiveness.'' And for every worker disinclined or unable to apply himself with energy and concentration, there is always another poor Chinese worker waiting to escape the farm or adrift in the so-called floating population of the underemployed, willing to take his place. 
 Still, it's not only cheap labor that drives China's economy. ''If you look just at low wages, you overlook the talents of Chinese manufacturers to drive their costs down,'' Weingrod says. The best operations are as efficient and as responsive as the world's elite manufacturers. 
 China's miracle economy can come at you in a lot of ways. By now most of us know that China is the factory floor of choice for the world's low-road manufacturing: it assembles more toys, stitches more shoes and sews more garments than any other nation in the world. But moving up the technological ladder, China has also become the world's largest maker of consumer electronics, like TV's, DVD players and cellphones. And more recently, China is climbing even higher still, moving into biotech and high-tech computer manufacturing. No country has ever made a better run at climbing every step of economic development all at once. Behind China's rapid economic ascendancy over the last 25 (and especially last 10) years is the basic fact of China's huge population. China is home to close to 1.5 billion people, probably, which would make the official census count of 1.3 billion too low by an amount equal to roughly the population of Germany, France and the United Kingdom combined. China has 100 cities of more than a million people. Since economic liberalization began in 1978, under Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese have started tens of millions of businesses. The number of Chinese who have left farms and now trawl the cities for work probably exceeds the entire work force of the United States.
 China is not home to the cheapest work force in the world. Even at 25 cents an hour, Chinese workers cost more than laborers in the poorer countries of Southeast Asia or Africa. In the world's miserable corners, children carry rifles and walk mine fields for less than a dollar a day. China is the world's workshop because it sits in a relatively stable region and offers manufacturers a reliable, pliant and capable industrial work force, groomed by generations of government-enforced discipline. 
 The other great contributing factor is the migration of hundreds of millions of peasants from the countryside now that the government makes it easier for them to leave. Indeed, the country's embrace of market capitalism over the last decade and the government's insistence that farmers fend for themselves are combining forces to all but evict peasants from the land. The plots allotted to farm families are on average 1.2 acres but can be as small as an eighth of acre; in hundreds of millions of cases these farms fail to generate enough money for a family. Average city incomes, according to the Chinese government, are $1,000 a year, which is three times what they are in the countryside. That disparity has set in motion the largest human migration in history. By 2010, nearly half of all China's people will live in urban areas.
 What these numbers mean is that China's people must be regarded as the critical mass in a new world order. The productive might of China's vast low-cost manufacturing machine, along with the swelling appetites of its billion-plus consumers, have turned China's people into probably the greatest natural resource on the planet. How the Chinese (and the rest of the world) use that resource will shape our economy (and every other economy in the world) as powerfully as American industrialization and expansion has over the last hundred years.

We Have Created a Monster
 In the political debate over trade and jobs, China is the place where the world's companies choose to exploit low-cost manufacturing. The framing of this debate implies that American consumers and businesses have strong choices in the market; in fact, China, supplying ever more goods as it does, in ever more varieties and at ever better prices, is straitjacketing the choices of American businesses. China's size does not merely enable low-cost manufacturing; it forces it. Increasingly, it is what Chinese businesses and consumers choose for themselves that determines how the American economy operates. The American political debate on China's economic threat overlooks this dynamic entirely.
 The experience of Motorola, the U.S. telecommunications giant, offers a lesson in how China's size changes the rules of competition and consumption there and everywhere else.
 Every month, five million new subscribers sign up for mobile-phone service in China. The country's 300 million mobile-phone users make China by far the largest such market in the world (and hundreds of millions more accounts are up for grabs). Hence the world's makers of handsets need to be in China. It gives them a chance to grow at a time when the big European and U.S. markets are saturated. Not that it's a seller's market: for equipment makers, China is also the most competitive and protean environment in the world. New manufacturers appear out of nowhere; new phones materialize daily at big-city stores. There are 800 current handset models to choose from. Young urban consumers change phones on average after only eight months -- they sell them to someone else or pass them to family members. Mobile phones in the hands of migrant construction workers, whose annual wages might not cover the cost of a phone, are a common sight in Shanghai and Beijing.
 And this mobile-phone market in China is one that Motorola invented.
 For Robert Galvin, the company's former and longtime chief executive, China in the early- to mid-80's promised a market that could more than make up for Motorola's having been foiled in Japan for years. But first the company had to develop a top-drawer telecommunications infrastructure. In an unscripted bold stroke at a dreary state ceremony during a tour of the country, Galvin turned to the minister of railroads and asked him whether he wanted to do a good job as minister and be done with it or whether he wanted to create a world-class society. In doing so, Galvin tapped a thick vein of economic patriotism.
 Motorola's company archives on its move into China are deep and open. They show that Galvin and his team knew that eventually the transfer of technology to China would sow formidable Chinese competitors. Nevertheless, Motorola decided its best strategy was to get into China early. Before long, Motorola's reports to China's political leaders -- infused with the same missionary vocabulary on industrial quality that had made the company a model for American manufacturers -- were soon parroted by China's leadership. Galvin also brought Motorola's best technology to China. The proof today is in the size and efficacy of the country's mobile communications network: calls get through to phones in high-rises, subway cars and distant hamlets -- connections that would stymie mobile phones in the U.S. 
 What no one at Motorola saw was that the Chinese market would become the most competitive one of all. Nokia and Motorola now battle for market share in the Chinese handset business. German, Korean and Taiwanese makers figure strongly. And all these foreign brands are now facing intense competition from indigenous Chinese phone makers. ''Competition goes through a cycle in China,'' says Zirui Tian, a researcher at Insead, the French business school. ''At first the foreigners can make things at much lower cost than the Chinese. But as local companies come along to supply the multinational companies, the supply network expands very fast. Then local Chinese manufacturers can start to source their parts in China and drive the prices of their products far lower than the multinationals.''
 One of Motorola's most important suppliers is the battery maker BYD Company Ltd., based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. In only a decade, the private company has gone from virtual invisibility to owning more than 50 percent of the global market in mobile-phone batteries. Before BYD, phone batteries were made in highly automated plants, like those run by Sanyo and Sony in Japan. But BYD, like Wanfeng, stripped robots and other machines out of the manufacturing process and replaced them with an army of workers. By paying for Chinese salaries, and not for million-dollar American, German or Japanese machines, BYD slashed the price of batteries. Initially the company could not meet Motorola's quality demands, but the American company sent a team of engineers to work with the upstarts, and six months later BYD earned a Six Sigma certification, a universally recognized badge of quality (which Motorola itself invented). The fact that in China machines can be replaced by people for huge cost savings and without sacrifice in quality changes the competitive landscape of the global marketplace. When Motorola and Nokia were pressed to lower their prices by Chinese competitors, they turned to BYD. 
 One of the biggest challenges facing Motorola and other global manufacturers is that Chinese suppliers are getting too good. Their quality, low-priced parts have helped create new, homegrown and extremely aggressive competitors. More than 40 percent of the Chinese domestic handset market now belongs to local companies like Ningbo Bird, Nanjing Panda Electronics, Haier and TCL Mobile. Ningbo Bird will produce 20 million handsets in 2004 and is likely soon to nudge its way into the ranks of the top 10 mobile phone makers in the world. Yet Motorola can't exactly exit the Chinese market. If it did, says Jim Gradoville, Motorola's vice president of Asia Pacific government relations, the Chinese companies that emerged from the crucible of their market would be the leanest and most aggressive in the world, and a company like his would have no idea what hit it. So Motorola stays. Already the largest foreign investor in China's electronics industry, Motorola plans to triple its stake there to more than $10 billion by 2006.

More Power to the Chinese Consumers
 Generalizing about Chinese business always raises exceptions. The country's crazy quilt of state-owned, village-owned, private and hybrid businesses was stitched together over 25 years of rocky reforms. Peasant entrepreneurs, opportunistic officials, government planners, new urban sophisticates and foreign investors all created operations that best fit the moment they stepped into the evolving market economy. And yet, looking at the marketplace from the broadest perspective, one overwhelming fact stands out. Ninety percent of everything made in China is in oversupply; in other words, nearly every manufacturing industry has surplus capacity. And instead of using cheap labor to push their profit margins higher, Chinese companies use cheap labor to drive down prices to the sweet spots for the great mass of Chinese consumers.
 A Chinese family can live a life comfortably close to that of the American middle class for a fraction of the cost. Though China claims urban per-capita income is $1,000, ''the government numbers on incomes don't tell nearly the whole story on the consumer class, especially not in the eastern cities,'' says Merrill Weingrod of China Strategies. Weingrod, working with Linsun Cheng of the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, surveyed incomes in Shanghai and several other cities in industrial centers. ''People tend to have two and three jobs, with many taking in short-term assignments here and there,'' he says. ''Real income in Shanghai, for instance, is close to $2,500 per capita, $5,000 per household.'' The Chinese can, on average, buy nearly five times in goods and services per dollar what an American can with the same dollar in the U.S. ''If you multiply income against China's purchasing power parity,'' Weingrod says, ''Chinese urban incomes approach the buying power of Americans making $12,500 a year. For working couples, that's the equal of $25,000. Do the math, and you can understand why Shanghai looks as prosperous as it does and why it seems like everyone is out shopping all the time.''
 According to Weingrod's and Cheng's research, China now has 100 million people who are comfortably middle class. They buy (in reduced measure) what the American middle class buys. The allure of China's market is obvious: the huge volumes of potential sales mean even products with the most modest of margins can earn lots of money.
 Wilf Corrigan, the chairman and C.E.O. of LSI Logic, an American company in the Chinese video player market, says that Chinese manufacturers have short-circuited one of the most predictable trends in consumer electronic manufacturing. ''Typically,'' he says, ''a new technology would be released at $1,000 in Japan, and it would take two years to drop below $1,000 and make it to the U.S. and Europe, and it would take a total of five to seven years for it to make it into the mass market.'' As features were added, prices rose. Now China's low-cost labor and the vastness of its consumer population are combining to bring bargain electronics into homes in record time. Chinese companies build sophisticated goods with components produced locally and rush them by the millions into their huge domestic market. New companies arise. Competition shrinks the time it takes for new products to appear. New features are added while prices are likely to drop. Anything to pump sales.
 Corrigan's company is now supplying Chinese consumer electronics manufacturers with the chip sets they need to make digital video recorders, machines that record DVD's and that are displacing VCR's on retail shelves. Currently, the Japanese and Korean brand-name giants have consumers' attention. Corrigan, however, sees no reason DVR's won't go the way of DVD players, plummeting in price as the Chinese enter the competition. Expect the recorders to be on sale for $100 within the next two years.

Collective I.Q.
 Look, China is the most exciting place in the world right now to be a manufacturer,'' says Mark Wall, president of the greater China region for G.E. Plastics. His operation sells the plastic pellets used to make everything from DVD's to building materials. Within two years G.E. will sell $1 billion in advanced materials, including plastics, in China. Wall, who came to China from G.E. Plastics, Brazil, describes a country in love with manufacturing like no other, where engineers come in excited and readily work long days. Where university students clamor to get into engineering and applied sciences. Like many American manufacturing executives in China, Wall talks about working in China with the delight that young computer whizzes felt when they found cool in Silicon Valley. There's no going to a cocktail party and then trying to talk around the fact that you make things in factories. Wall says he feels at home. He loves it. G.E. has every plan to capitalize on the local zeal for manufacturing. It recently opened a giant industrial research center in Shanghai, and by next year will it employ 1,200 people in its Chinese labs. The company has also set up scholarship programs at leading Chinese technical universities. It will have no shortage of good candidates.
 The government is pouring resources into creating the world's largest army of industrialists. China has 17 million university and advanced vocational students (up more than threefold in five years), the majority of whom are in science and engineering. China will produce 325,000 engineers this year. That's five times as many as in the U.S., where the number of engineering graduates has been declining since the early 1980's. It is hard to imagine Americans' enthusiasm for engineering sinking lower. Forty percent of all students who enter universities on the engineering track change their minds.
 The case for the ability of American industry to stay ahead of its international competition rests on the national gifts and resources that the U.S. devotes to innovation. Certainly, the confidence of big American companies like Motorola, General Motors and Intel, all of which have billion-dollar-plus stakes in China, is based on the brainpower they have at home. The research gap between the U.S. and China remains vast. In December, Washington authorized $3.7 billion to finance nanotechnology research, a sum the Chinese government cannot easily match within a scientific infrastructure that would itself take many more billions (and years) to build. Yet, when it comes to more mainstream, applied industrial development and innovation, the separation among Chinese, American and other multinational firms is beginning to narrow.
 Last year, China spent $60 billion on research and development. The only countries that spent more were the U.S and Japan, which spent $282 billion and $104 billion respectively. But again, China forces you to do the math: China's engineers and scientists usually make between one-sixth and one-tenth what Americans do, which means that the wide gaps in financing do not necessarily result in equally wide gaps in manpower or results. The U.S. spent nearly five times what China did, but had less than two times as many researchers (1.3 million to 743,000). 
 For now, the emphasis in Chinese labs is weighted overwhelmingly toward the ''D'' side -- meaning training for technical employees and managers. Nevertheless, foreign companies are quickly moving to integrate their China-based labs into their global research operations. Motorola has 19 research labs in China that develop technology for both the local and global markets. Several of the company's most innovative recent phones were developed there for the Chinese market.
 Motorola's newest research center is located 40 minutes from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, a province in southwestern China. Sichuan is slightly larger than California, but three times as populous. There are around 90 million people in the province, 43 universities and 1.2 million scientists and engineers. Sichuan's fragmented transportation system prevents Chengdu from rivaling the eastern powerhouses as a manufacturing center, but the city is promoting the advantage of its plentiful, relatively low-cost brain pool with its new research corridor, the West High-Tech Zone. And Motorola regards its building -- subsidized generously by the development zone -- as a world center for software engineering. The company now employs more than 150 developers there and has plans to add hundreds more. That will pit it against a growing number of the world's top research-driven enterprises taking advantage of Chengdu's largess: Intel, Ericsson, D-Link, Siemens, Alcatel, Mitsui & Company and Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan and more than 200 other firms in one of the area's special tech districts.
 In all, foreign companies have been involved in establishing between 200 and 400 of their own research centers in China since 1990. China's People's Daily has reported that 400 of the world's transnational corporations have set up research and development projects in China. In part, tax incentives attract such financing. But the biggest incentive of all, of course, is access to China's consumers. The Chinese government knows that foreign tech companies can be coaxed into sharing technology and training in exchange for easier access to the Chinese marketplace. The World Trade Organization forbids formal bargains that demand international tech transfers, but it does not police winks and nudges.
 The likely outcome of all this R.&D. investment in China? Even more overcapacity. Just as China's abundant unskilled workers feed the world more shoes and more gadgets than it needs -- or at least more than it can absorb without forcing prices down -- China's abundance of newly skilled industrialists threatens to swamp the world's most highly prized, high-tech markets. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that in the past three years foreign investors have invested or pledged $15 billion to build 19 new semiconductor factories. China imports 80 percent of the semiconductor chips it needs, $19 billion worth, and the government has made it a point of national pride to end the country's dependence on foreigners. Industry observers seem to agree that China will be able to compete with the world's leading semiconductor makers in a decade, but even before that it may exert strong downward pressure on chip prices. Will there be a 2005 recession in the chip market? Morris Chang, the influential founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world's largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry, asked an industry gathering last September. ''Yes, I think there will be,'' he said. And who will cause it? China, thanks to all the capacity it's building.

The China Price
 China now offers the world a labor supply with depth unlike anything ever seen. In a recent policy brief for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Sandra Polaski, a former State Department special representative for international labor affairs, writes that to put things in perspective, ''if all U.S. jobs were moved to China, there would still be surplus labor in China.'' That fact highlights what is most sobering about China's booming economy: it can force down the value of work in any job that is at all transferable.
 In American business this is called the ''China price.'' It is the price American suppliers to other American businesses have to match to keep their customers. It is the price at which Chinese manufacturers can deliver the same goods and services. Last November, the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank noted the complaints that ''automakers have reportedly been asking suppliers for the 'China price' on their purchases.'' It also observed that U.S. suppliers had been asked by their big customers to relocate production to China, or to find subcontractors there.
 The bellwether of American industry may very well be its foundries. Casting is one of those unsexy industries that rarely get top mention in personal ads. But no amount of buzz could overstate its importance. Without metal casting, the United States would boast hardly any industry at all. The U.S. Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy notes that more than 90 percent of all manufactured goods and capital equipment use metal castings, or are made with equipment that uses them. 
 The American casting industry is the world's largest, with more than $25 billion in annual sales. Nearly 3,000 foundries are spread across the country, and are especially concentrated in the Midwest. Most are small businesses, with fewer than 100 employees who, on average, outearn their counterparts everywhere else in the world. The metal-casting industry once had generous trade surpluses with the rest of the world, but imported castings have increased their share of the American market by 50 percent since the mid-1990's; they now have 15 percent of the market. Imports from China are growing at between 7 and 10 percent a year, and worldwide by volume China is now the top producer of castings. The effect has been severe pressure on American foundries, 140 of which closed their doors in 2002, the last year for which the American Foundry Society has figures.
 Bob Schuemann is executive vice president and part owner of Signicast Corporation, a privately held casting business located at the edge of Hartford, Wis. Hartford is one of the state's many midsize towns whose roads are shared by farm tractors and semitrailer trucks making their way to the loading docks of manufacturers that since the 1970's have stayed competitive by migrating out of the urban Midwest and into the more economical countryside. Schuemann, like many, now lives under the sword of the China price. His company owns proprietary technology for producing metal machine parts with extremely high precision. Yet the network effect means that the company's fate is tied in part to the economic vitality of its business community. Wisconsin lost roughly 90,000 of the 2.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs that disappeared over the last four years. Signicast survived with automation. Robots fill its factory, moving everything from thumb-size precision parts to the boxes in the warehouse. Workers are scarce. Walking through the plant is a lesson in how the hardware business has become a software business. The whole plant seems to be run by smart ghosts. 
 Even so, the company feels the gravity of China's growing influence in manufacturing. Schuemann says some of his corporate customers also want the company to make the move to China and have offered to help cover the costs of doing so. The company won't move. Schuemann fears the Chinese will usurp Signicast's processes and thus its strength. Schuemann knows too that his company's selling points evaporate quickly when overseas investment casters drastically undercut the price of its parts. ''We don't need to match the China price dollar for dollar,'' he says. ''If we stay within 20 percent of their price, our customers will stay with us.'' It's getting harder to keep them anyway, however. The company used to have livelier business with a big local power tool maker, but the customer moved production to China and found jerry-built substitutes for Signicast's high-quality parts. ''Our part was one sturdy piece, and their new one is two inferior pieces,'' Schuemann says. ''Theirs will break more easily, but it's a lot cheaper.''
 The business cards of executives at Milwaukee Valve Company Ltd., located in Wuxi, a city of more than four million outside Shanghai, list the company's address at ''End of Guangrui Road.'' By the outward appearance of the trio of decades-old, corrugated-tin roofed industrial buildings that make up the small factory, ''end of the road'' might seem an apt description. Along the interior of a wall at the back of the factory yard is a pile of wooden kindling that is used to stoke the factory's large furnace when the local electric grid is out of power, which lately has been often. Inside one of the barns, the furnace's orange glow heats and dimly lights a shop that looks little different than that of a foundry early in the last century. Sandboxes with molten brass are assembled manually and set end to end in the black earth floor to cool. 
 While the method looks primitive -- the Chinese have been making castings for 2,500 years -- workers in Wuxi manage to produce quality castings comparable to those made in spiffier factories in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Milwaukee Valve is a family-owned company whose manufacturing is still anchored in the United States. Its management entered China 20 years ago, soon after economic liberalization began. The company's valves are critical components in pipelines used in many industries. A faulty valve produced by one of the company's Chinese suppliers several years ago nearly ended the relationship with China. But that mistake, according to the company's management, is what made this Chinese manufacturer a ''world-class operation.'' Engineers from both countries redesigned the valve and changed the production process. Since then, Milwaukee Valve has stationed five Chinese quality-control engineers as roving inspectors at all of its factories in China. Apply this learning-curve experience at the Wuxi plant to China's manufacturing economy generally, and you get a sense of how the country is moving up the manufacturing feeding chain so quickly. (Of course, no one would be interested in seeing the Chinese improve if the cost of high quality were not still a bargain.)
 Out in front of the valve factory is another telling symbol of China's competitiveness. It is a small $2,000 truck, a circus car of a truck, and one of many quaint but operable models still turned out by China's state-owned vehicle factories. In the U.S., cheap trucks prone to failure and always in need of new parts would wreck production and delivery schedules by causing down time and burden bottom lines with $50-an-hour mechanic bills. But in China, mechanics can tend such cheap trucks the way pit crews tend Indy cars -- and for less than a dollar an hour. Chinese factories can take advantage of all sorts of machinery that is one, two or three generations past its usefulness in more expensive economies, because the Chinese can afford to run them and fix them. Thus China wrings further cost savings from the manufacturing process, and American companies are forced to go there to get them.
 ''First there was the wholesale price, then the retail price and now there is the China price, and it is very real,'' says Oded Shenkar, a professor at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University. Big manufacturers, Shenkar says, come into their American suppliers with the China price in hand and present ultimatums, often veiled, that the price be met.

The China Savings
 No politician declares it. There is no Association of Big Box Store Customers beating the drum. But, as nearly any shopping trip in America will teach you, China saves American consumers enormous amounts of money.
 The worry that Chinese producers are hurting American businesses and eliminating American jobs misrepresents the problem -- at least geographically. While the U.S. trade deficit with China is growing, most of the goods from China, between 60 and 75 percent of them, simply would have been imported in past years from other countries. Still, because the China price forces manufacturers the world over to drop their own prices, the jobs that have not moved have been shaken up all the same, in the U.S. and in other countries. In Mexico, for example, which has lost nearly half a million manufacturing jobs and 500 maquiladora manufacturers, workers earn four times what their Chinese counterparts do. So for Mexican factories to stay competitive, they must get by with fewer hands or smaller profits.
 Americans who would demonize China also have a local problem: the China price is a boon to American consumers. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, has done some rough math that shows how. ''From time immemorial,'' Hufbauer says, ''most American and Japanese businesses have been reluctant to move their manufacturing to new locales unless they can save at least 10 to 20 percent with the move.'' For the $152 billion worth of goods coming in from China last year, those savings have already been realized.
 The multiplier effect on the rest of the world's manufacturers, however, dwarfs the savings that come directly from China. Hufbauer figures some $500 billion in goods come from countries that are China's low-wage competitors, and another $450 billion in goods come from China's American and Japanese competitors. That means savings on nearly a trillion dollars of goods. If the savings on that non-Chinese trillion dollars' worth of trade are just 3 to 5 percent, rather than the 20 percent the Chinese can deliver, Hufbauer calculates further savings starting at $500 for the average American household. And people who spend more, get more back. Have a drawer full of $3 T-shirts, a DVD player in every room, a Christmas tree annually encircled with piles of toys? You probably have tons more stuff -- and additional savings -- thanks to the China price.
 This inexorable downward pressure on prices now shows up even when the prices of raw materials rise, costs that in the past were hurriedly passed on to consumers. The Chinese industrial boom has, for example, pushed up the cost of copper, aluminum, nickel, plastics and nearly every other important industrial commodity. Chinese demand has caused the price of steel to rise 20 percent this past spring. (China is now the world's top steel producer, by the way, while the U.K. has dropped out of the top 10.) Nevertheless, the price of cars, which reflect nearly the entire commodity index, has been weak. In April, cotton climbed to its highest price at this time of year in seven seasons, but the price of clothing declined.
 American firms can find it hard to compete. ''China hits domestic U.S. manufacturers twice,'' Oded Shenkar says. ''They drive down the price of goods, but they drive up the price of raw materials. It's a wholly different environment.'' And yet it's a good one for Americans too.
 The efficiencies forced on the market by Chinese factories also hold U.S. inflation in check. Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can keep interest rates low, making money more freely available for investment in new and stronger industries. Chinese competition forces American businesses -- Signicast, for example -- to use capital as efficiently as possible. And to run their plants full tilt. And to find ways to save on labor costs. The Americans who lost manufacturing jobs over the last three years, and the millions more who are expected to see their white-collar jobs migrate overseas, may have not only China to blame, but also the very economic benefits that China has provided for them.
 And that's to say nothing of what happens once the Chinese countryside, thinned of its oversupply of farmers, turns into efficient farms. Already the Chinese have their eyes on cash crops. Though it has only recently begun exporting apple juice, China already produces seven times as many apples as the U.S., enough to cause a depression in the price of apple juice worldwide. Whole apples for exports are individually wrapped by hand in a foam sock. Given the country's wealth of manual labor, it can assert dominance in crops that must be tended by hand. 
In a stable China, where its great resource, its people, are allowed to work and spend money in a reasonably well functioning market economy, the growing place of China in a global economy cannot be legislated away with tariffs, quotas or tax incentives for struggling industries. China's strengths cannot be altered by changes in the value of its currency or by restricting the flow of foreign investment into the country. By having changed itself, China is changing the world.
 That doesn't necessarily mean things will be worse for Americans as the century -- the Chinese century -- unfolds. Following World War II, the nations of Western Europe, Japan and the so-called tiger countries of Asia rose from the ruins, aided, not thwarted, by the strength of the American economy. In turn, those economic booms fed our own.
 So perhaps we will be as Europe is to us today, and China will be our America.
 Imagine Pekin, Ill., a few decades from now. It may, like innumerable small Chinese cities today, be accustomed to a stream of foreign business managers. Perhaps the regional boss for a Wanfeng Automotive dealership is there to be host of a ''dig to China contest'': the team that gets closest in 40 minutes might win one of the company's hot new red-and-gold Lucky 8 hybrid sports coupes, worth $4,000. As a promotion, Wal-Mart's new World Store is rolling prices back to 2004 levels for the day -- shoppers are grabbing the steaks and fish, whose prices Chinese consumers have driven up fourfold since then. Wal-Mart might have competition, however, perhaps from a new giant outpost of Homeworld, a Chinese retail giant that has learned to exploit its proximity to Chinese suppliers and beat Wal-Mart on price. A big event scheduled for the evening might get knowing smiles from the town's old-timers. The Foreign Devils, a high-school basketball team from Manhattan, a new suburb of Beijing, is due in for an exhibition game. Provided its flight, on an all new Chinese jumbo jet, arrives on time.

HEADLINE: Want More Stuff? Lend a Few Rooms To the Nearest Bank

BYLINE: By Hubert B. Herring

 BODY:
Here's a radical idea: Americans could live on their paychecks. On second thought, forget it. It's far too radical. 
 Granted, balanced budgets are tough for those forced to trade in junior executive duds for Wal-Mart uniforms. But even the affluent suffer from the national disease of craving more and more goodies, whether BMW's, fancy gas grills or ivied educations. 
 How to pay for those goodies? There is always plastic, but the interest is ruinous, and nondeductible. But homeowners, watching in awe as house prices float off into la-la land, have not hesitated to grab some of that play money before it vanishes -- whether by refinancing or taking out home equity loans. The refinancing party may be over, though; the Federal Reserve's rate increase last week seems just a start, so that low fixed-rate mortgage may be a keeper. That could leave equity loans as the only game in town -- though a risky one, if home prices return to earth.

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
After weeks of anticipation by investors, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week, and the markets barely reacted.
 Stocks declined modestly before the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, and rose a bit immediately afterward. 
Then they drifted downward on Thursday. By that time, the rate increase was old news. On Friday, stocks fell after a government report showed that jobs growth in June was less than half as much as expected, leading to fears that the economy may be faltering.
 The net results for the week were small declines in the three major market gauges. For the week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.05 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,125.38. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 89.01 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 10,282.83. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 18.81 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,006.66.
 In the Treasury market, prices rose and yields fell to their lowest levels in more than two months, largely in response to the jobs report. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.46 percent from 4.64 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: As Bills Mount, Debts on Homes Rise for Elderly 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
As Americans have rushed to borrow at historically low interest rates, an unlikely group has led the charge: the elderly. 
 As a result, the cushion that could provide financial security for older people -- their homes -- is no longer so secure. People reaching retirement age are now less likely to own their homes free and clear than their predecessors, according to an analysis of government housing and Census data.
One in four families headed by someone 65 or older still had a mortgage to pay in 2001, the most recent data available. In 1989, just one in six still had house payments to make. 
 For many aging Americans, lingering expenses from their peak earning years, like car payments and college tuition for their children, have made it difficult to rip up their mortgages. Others have taken out fresh loans on their homes to pay off other debts, help their children and cover medical expenses. 
 Some brush off concerns, saying they expect to live longer and to work longer. Why not take out a 30-year home loan at age 65 to raise cash now? At low enough interest rates, the monthly housing payments could remain manageable. 
 But as older borrowers try to stretch what are often fixed incomes to cover the payments, they are increasingly putting their homes at risk, running into financial trouble, turning to their adult children for help and even filing for bankruptcy protection, policy groups and bankruptcy lawyers say. Many are forgoing retirement and taking on part-time work. 
 As a group, people over 65 have the distinction of having not only the fastest-growing home debt, but also the fastest-growing share of personal bankruptcy filings and the biggest growth in demand for credit counseling. At 71 and 77 years old, respectively, James and Doris Stevenson of Espanola, N.M., have 29 years left on their mortgage, which they recently refinanced for a lower interest rate. They live in their dream home, Mr. Stevenson said -- a pueblo-style house overlooking the Rio Grande. The couple, retired teachers, bought it six years ago by using two-thirds of Mr. Stevenson's retirement fund for a $35,000 down payment. 
 To chip away at the remaining $75,000 or so, he occasionally coaches high school teams and serves as a church pastor, and both work at local polls during elections. 
 At one point, the mortgage costs made it difficult to meet their credit card payments, so they sought credit counseling and entered a two-year repayment plan, which they have since completed. 
 Mr. Stevenson says that battling their debt has already taken too much of a toll. He even believes it contributed to a heart attack he had in late 2002. ''I was told it had to do with stress,'' Mr. Stevenson said. 
 Mortgage debt owed by older households nearly quadrupled between 1989 and 2001, even after accounting for inflation, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zhu Xiao Di, a research analyst at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. In 2001, the typical household headed by someone 65 or older had $44,000 in mortgage debt, compared with $12,000 in 1989, Mr. Zhu says in a forthcoming paper. The mortgage debts of younger homeowners, though still considerably larger at $75,000 on average, grew barely a fifth as quickly. 
 Although much of the increase is doubtless a result of homeowners tapping rising home values, borrowers must still find the money to make the payments while living on limited incomes. 
 ''All the indicators would suggest that there is increasing debt being assumed by older Americans,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director for the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. ''It used to be the notion that when you were old, you wanted to extinguish your mortgage. Increasingly, people don't look at it that way. They look at their home as liquid; it's a way to substitute cheaper debt for higher debt.'' 
 While home loans are usually their biggest payment, the elderly have been rapidly accumulating other debt as well. Credit card bills -- to cover everything from minor emergencies to ongoing essentials -- have risen sharply. All told, the debt burdens of borrowers between the ages of 65 and 74 doubled between 1992 and 2001, compared with an increase of 83 percent for the general population, the Federal Reserve says. 
 Even as interest rates have fallen, private surveys make clear that the debt burden for the elderly is still rising, although it remains far below what younger Americans owe. Of course, low interest rates have encouraged just about everyone to take on more debt, but other age groups have years of earnings ahead of them to pay off the debt. 
 Whether such debts are of little concern depends on how much wealth and income older borrowers have on hand. While Fed data show that, as a group, older Americans possessed more assets in 2001 than a decade ago, those assets grew only half as quickly as their debts. Census data show that their incomes over the same period remained flat. 
 More and more of the elderly are in outright financial distress. One in seven households headed by someone 65 or older was considered heavily indebted in 2001 -- devoting at least 40 percent of their incomes to debt payments, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances. That compared with one in 10 among all households with debt. 
 To Mary Caspermeyer, even 40 percent sounds bearable. Her mortgage and car payments, she said, now consume almost all her income, which includes a small pension, Social Security and hourly wages from working as a medical technician. 
 Mrs. Caspermeyer, who is 67 and lives in O'Fallon, Mo., explains that she and her husband had paid off credit card debts and helped their children with expenses by refinancing their mortgage and taking out a second one. But after her husband died last year, his monthly Social Security check of $1,400 stopped coming. Now, she is unsure what to do. 
 ''I don't want to file for bankruptcy,'' she said. ''I don't know if I can work the rest of my life. And I don't think anybody wants to be a burden to their kids.'' 
 Credit counselors are where many turn for help. Money Management International, which is based in Houston and is one of the country's largest credit counselors, says its overall client base has grown by a modest 3 percent in the past year, but almost 40 percent among people who are 65 or older. One in 10 of its current clients is of retirement age. 
 Those in the worst shape file for bankruptcy protection. From 1997 to 2001, bankruptcies among the elderly tripled to 82,000, says the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, a consortium of university researchers. The number of people 65 or older grew only 3 percent during that time. 
 Why is this happening, given that over all the elderly are financially better off today than in any previous generation? In various consumer surveys and bankruptcy studies, heavy health care expenses are consistently cited. ''It's always medical bills -- and credit cards to pay for medical bills,'' said Barbara May, a consumer bankruptcy lawyer in Arden Hills, Minn., and a board member of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. 
 She described one of her current cases, involving an elderly couple who have amassed $44,000 in credit card debt largely for medications to treat heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes, among other ailments. Ms. May described the couple's adult son weeping in her office. 
 ''Before, I would have one of these horror stories a year,'' she said. ''Now I'm getting two a month.'' 
 But bankruptcy lawyers say another reason for distress is that more of their elderly clients are also helping out their adult children. 
 In studying bankruptcy filings in 2001 as a member of the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School, found the trend startling: ''I was very surprised to see the number of older people who explained their bankruptcies in terms of their children's failed marriages, their children's drug addictions, their children's lack of health insurance. The impulse to take care of one's children never goes away.'' 
 For Ruth Gibson, 70, having two of her adult sons living in her four-bedroom Chicago home assuages loneliness. But paying for much of their medical and living expenses as they look for steady work helped push her into bankruptcy proceedings in 2001, shortly after her husband of 51 years died, and has since threatened her with foreclosure. 
 ''I always pictured it as some place that my kids would have to come to,'' she said. 
 Advocacy groups accuse some lenders of seeking business from vulnerable older people with little regard for their ability to pay. 
 Many banks seem to issue credit cards indiscriminately, they said, while mortgage lenders offer people payment terms they cannot possibly meet, made even worse by wrapping other debts into the loan. 
 Lenders, for their part, point out that a few bad apples do not represent the industry and that they are careful to extend the same offers to people no matter their age to avoid accusations of discrimination. 
 Timothy Williams of Chauvin, La., says that a credit card stranded his mother, Eula Williams. At 85, Ms. Williams owes $8,000 on the card, which was offered to her by telephone marketers and mailed to her without even an application form. 
 ''They called and asked me all kind of stuff, and I don't hear too good,'' Ms. Williams said. Living on Social Security payments of $600 a month, she received a card with a $7,000 limit. She used it to buy Christmas presents and groceries. 
 Mr. Williams said he was giving her some spending money each month -- but by the time he found out about the credit card, the balance had grown to $6,000 and a collection agency was calling. 
 After trying unsuccessfully to negotiate with his mother's creditor, Mr. Williams advised his mother to ignore the debt. 
 ''I'm 85 years old; I can't live forever,'' said Ms. Williams, who still receives offers for credit cards.

HEADLINE: Looking for More Than a Few Good Directors

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: Palo Alto, Calif. 

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time or at least until a couple of years ago -- an invitation to serve on the board of a publicly traded company could be like a request from the gods of easy money. A handsome annual fee in the tens of thousands of dollars was yours in return for maybe a week or two of work. First-class accommodations were common, a generous stock package a given. For those lucky enough to serve on the right board, the stock package could eventually mean hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars -- and all for a post saddled with few obligations and low expectations.
 How has life on the board changed? To gauge it, Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School, nods toward a set of books on his desk. Each is thicker than the phone book of a midsize American city, and each is larded with the new rules that Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and listing bodies like Nasdaq have imposed on directors in the post-Enron era. 
 ''You need massive upper-body strength just in order to keep up with the rule changes,'' he said.
 For 10 years on the Stanford campus, Mr. Grundfest has run the Directors' College -- a sort of boot camp for those so eager to serve shareholders faithfully that they dedicate three days of their lives to learning what Mr. Grundfest describes as ''best practices in corporate governance.''
 Until recently, the Directors' College was a modest affair. All along, Mr. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. member, has consistently drawn an impressive array of speakers, from the head of the S.E.C. (the three men who have served in that post over the past decade have attended) to William S. Lerach, the plaintiffs' lawyer who has pursued shareholder fraud suits.
 Yet only in the past two years has Mr. Grundfest had to turn people away from the annual session. Where once it drew 60 directors in a good year, this year Mr. Grundfest had to cap attendance at 200.
 That is no surprise, said Richard H. Koppes, one of 60 faculty members whom Mr. Grundfest roped into serving at this year's event, held June 20 to 22. For years, Mr. Koppes, a lawyer based in Sacramento for the Jones Day law firm, served as the general counsel for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, an institutional investor known for aggressively applying its muscle when it is displeased with a wayward board. 
 ''The days of putting in a week or two as a director and never having to ask questions is over,'' said Mr. Koppes, who serves on the board of the International Corporate Governance Network. ''The stakes are personal now. It's not just that there's more possibility of being sued. People's reputations are at stake.''
 To be sure, directors are still well compensated. Total remuneration for directors jumped to an average of $156,000 in 2003 from $112,000 in 1998, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, the compensation experts. But serving on the board of a publicly traded company today eats up substantially more time than it did just two years ago, the year of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, perhaps the most stringent corporate governance legislation in decades.
 And that average is inflated by a very small number of directors who reaped huge payouts from stock options from successful start-up companies like eBay, Mr. Grundfest said. Stock of eBay, the online auction site, has tripled in the last two years.
 A typical director is paid closer to $25,000 a year, according to an informal survey of participants at the Directors' College, and receives 5,000 to 10,000 stock options a year -- if not outright grants of stock. And how much time have directors been devoting to the job in the last couple of years? Estimates vary from four to six weeks a year, or more for members of audit committees.
 ''These are typically very well-off people,'' Mr. Grundfest said. ''For a very large percent of the directorship population, you have to ask yourself, 'Why do these people even bother serving on boards?'''
 Attendees might have been asking themselves that same question one or two days into Mr. Grundfest's boot camp. First the group heard the harsh assessments of Roman L. Weil, a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. For more than four years, Professor Weil has been administering a 25-question multiple-choice test of a director's ability to assess a corporate balance sheet.
 As he sees it, a competent director should answer at least 16 of the questions correctly. But those in the audience who chose to take the test before arriving here fared as poorly as those who came before them. ''Basically Roman stood up and told everyone that a majority of directors fall short of his standards of financial literacy,'' said Dan Siciliano, who, as the executive director overseeing the law school's law, economics, and business program, helps Mr. Grundfest run the Directors' College. (All sessions were off limits to the news media, though directors were fair game during social hours.)
 Professor Weil was followed by Linda Thomsen, deputy director of the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement. She played roughly the same role at the meeting as the police officer who visits a high school classroom as part of a ''scared straight'' program.
 ''People need to hear from the people who are going to sue 'em,'' Mr. Grundfest said. ''Each year I have someone from the S.E.C. explain how they look at the behavior of directors: 'If we catch you doing the following kinds of things, you can expect a subpoena delivered in the morning.'''
 Of course, it is a self-selected group that chooses to pay the $4,000 tuition and devote time to considering issues like the best way to value a company's inventory, or whether a director serving on an audit committee should really meet seven or more times with an external auditor.
 ''I said to Linda Thomsen from the S.E.C. after her talk, 'You can look around this room, but it's unlikely that you'll ever see any of these people''' in your official capacity, said Michael J. Murphy, who serves on the board of Quanta Capital Holdings, where he is also the chief operating officer. ''The simple fact that people are here demonstrates they want to do the right thing.''
 Not surprisingly, more than one attendee this year worried that fewer qualified people would want to serve on boards. Given the time required, studies show, chief executives are less likely to serve on the board of a company other than their own -- and more than a few people who might have the time are no doubt scared away by the enormous risks involved.
 Still, Jeff McNealey, a lawyer based in Columbus, Ohio, who has served on boards of publicly traded companies dating back to the 1970's, says he thinks that there will always be people like him who feel an obligation to serve.
 ''Companies need to be governed,'' Mr. McNealey said. ''It's work that needs to be done, and you'll always find people who feel that degree of service is important.''

HEADLINE: Over the Counter, Yes, but Out of the Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, Carrie Howland's 4-year-old son, Bobby, who has Down syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease, which affects his colon, was taking one prescription heartburn pill a day. But when the medication, Prilosec, became available over the counter in June 2003, Bobby's insurer stopped paying for it.
 The Howlands, of Shrewsbury, Mass., ended up paying about $30 a month out of pocket for the medication, on top of nearly $1,000 a month for his other health care needs, including insurance premiums, other medical supplies and frequent trips to the hospital. When the monthly premium on his insurance rose by $161 not long ago, Ms. Howland scoured her budget for possible savings. 
 ''We have a comfortable income,'' she said. ''We're not skipping meals or are unable to heat the house. But every penny counts.'' 
 She came up with an answer that might sound counterintuitive at first: she turned to a similar heartburn drug that required a prescription. But it was covered by insurance, meaning that her net expense was less.
 While high prescription costs hog the spotlight, more and more consumers are being hit with another expense: over-the-counter drugs that aren't covered by insurance. Allergy drugs like Zyrtec and Claritin, as well as heartburn medications like Prilosec, can now be bought without a prescription, and drug makers are pushing to sell cholesterol drugs directly to consumers, too.
 ''It's good news and bad news,'' said Robert I. Field, director of the health policy program at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. ''The bad news is, you're not going to have insurers who'll want to cover O.T.C. drugs.''
 Consumers may like the convenience of bypassing doctors and pharmacists when they need certain drugs, but it can be costly. For the year ended May 14, sales of over-the-counter health products were $25.6 billion, according to A.C. Nielsen, the marketing information company, up from $24.4 billion in the period ending in 2002. 
 Uninsured consumers and those with high co-payments have benefited most, health care experts say, because drugs are usually less expensive when they hit drugstore shelves, and prices tend to fall further as competitors appear. But for patients accustomed to having insurers picking up a big part of the bill, it is another story. 
 Much of the shift, Mr. Field said, stems from insurers seeking to reduce their expenses. It started, he added, in 2001, when WellPoint Health Networks of Thousand Oaks, Calif., petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to have allergy drugs like Claritin and Zyrtec sold directly to consumers. ''It was the first time an insurer wanted a drug to go O.T.C.,'' he said. ''It was the shot heard around the world.'' 
 Drug companies also have a stake in offering medicine directly to consumers, said Eric J. Mack, assistant professor of pharmaceutics at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Boston. If a drug is losing patent protection, he said, it makes sense for the drug company to sell it over the counter and start a huge marketing campaign, in the hope that consumers will continue to buy a particular drug even if similar drugs soon enter the market. And with no prescription needed, he said, more buyers may appear.
 Charles Ganley, director of the F.D.A.'s over-the-counter drug division, says that the only factors the agency considers in deciding whether to allow a drug to be sold over the counter are ''safety and effectiveness.''
 ''A lot of this is based on changes in society,'' he said. ''There is more emphasis, for whatever reason, on self-care.''
 Consumers, of course, want to pay less for over-the-counter medications. In September, the Internal Revenue Service announced that individuals could use pretax dollars, through flexible savings accounts, to pay for such drugs. But vitamins and nutritional supplements are not eligible, and the cost of over-the-counter drugs cannot be deducted on a tax return.
 Dr. Kathleen W. Wilson, an internal medicine specialist at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, said her patients had various ways of coping. ''They do not buy lifestyle medicine such as Claritin unless they can afford it or their symptoms really bother them,'' she said. ''They adapt to the high price of reflux drugs by using them intermittently on the worst days and using the lower-priced drugs on the other days.''
 And as many insurance plans raise the co-payments for prescription drugs, some consumers find that switching to over-the-counter medications -- even if they are not covered by insurance -- can save money, especially if they shop around.
 Shev Rush, a publicist from Palm Springs, Calif., was taking prescription drugs for his allergies and acid reflux disease. Two months ago, when he switched insurance plans, his co-payment for Flonase, an allergy drug, rose to $65 from $15 for a month's supply. His co-payment for Protonix for acid reflux went to $90 from $30. 
 After some comparison shopping, Mr. Rush found Prilosec, an alternative his doctor had recommended for acid reflux, for less than $20 for a month's supply, and NasalCrom, an over-the-counter allergy drug, for about $10 for a month's supply.
 ''It's easier to buy O.T.C. than go through the hassle of using my insurance if the prices and efficacies are similar,'' he said.
 Consumers may be uncomfortable bargain-hunting for a drug, but experts say they should do so. Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League, a nonprofit group in Washington, said that consumers should use coupons and consider buying in bulk, but also monitor expiration dates.
 Consumers need to use the system to their advantage, as Ms. Howland did. A drug that is sold over the counter may still have a prescription counterpart that is covered by insurance, and the insurer can be consulted to compare out-of-pocket costs for prescription and over-the-counter drugs. 
 Some insurers may require patients to try over-the-counter drugs first. Kathleen Sheerin, an Atlanta allergist and the public education chairman of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, says that many insurance companies require her to put in writing that a patient has tried over-the-counter medicines, without success, before going to a prescription.
 Currently, most insurance companies do not cover over-the-counter drugs. But Fred Eckel, editor in chief of Pharmacy Times, said efforts to keep drug expenses down could push insurers to cover them someday. He pointed to a recent decision by the North Carolina Medicaid system to cover drugs like Claritin and Prilosec. If necessary, he said, consumers should review their choice of insurers when it is time to renew coverage.
 MS. GOLODNER said consumers should also be wary of overusing over-the-counter medicines. ''People might think you can't overdose with these drugs and take two pills instead of one,'' she said, leading to higher costs and possibly health problems.
 Consumers may also consider money-saving generic versions of over-the-counter drugs. Generics are similar to brand-name medicines, but certain ingredients, like binders, differ, said Devon Herrick, health economist for the National Center for Policy Analysis. It is important to talk to your pharmacist or doctor about possible generics, he added; if one drug disagrees with you or is ineffective, try another. Negative reactions are rare, but if they occur, he said, stick with the brand name.
 Over-the-counter drugs, of course, are not sold only at the drugstore. They are increasingly showing up at supermarkets and wholesale clubs, and on the Internet. Mr. Herrick said consumers should be wary of unknown sites. But online branches of retail stores and sites like Drugstore.com have proved reliable, he said.
 With the increase in shopping choices and ease of use, the chances for harmful drug interactions will rise, said Mr. Mack of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy. Keep track of the drugs you take and how they interact, he advised, and keep your doctor abreast of your self-medicating.

QUICK READ
If your insurer covers the bulk of your prescription bill and your copayments are low, you will probably have to pay more money when a medication starts to be sold over the counter. But there are ways to ease the burden:

FIND OUT -- if a similar drug -- one that works as well, with few or no side effects -- is available by prescription, and covered by your insurer.

CHECK -- with your local pharmacist or doctor about less-expensive generic alternatives among over-the-counter drugs. Because of possible differences between generics and name brands, compare effectiveness and any adverse reactions.

ASK -- your insurer if it will pay for any over-the-counter drugs, and review your insurance choices during the open-enrollment season to see if any plans offer the coverage. Many health care experts expect that some insurers will pick up a portion of the over-thecounter bill soon.

SHOP AROUND -- for bargains. But if you buy in bulk, pay strict attention to expiration dates, and do not forget about shipping costs when buying online.

HEADLINE: As Interest Rates Rise, So Do the Market Hazards

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
INVESTORS may not know how fast or how high market interest rates will ultimately rise once the Federal Reserve is done tightening the nation's monetary policy. But they do know that as rates climb, they will reassess what they are willing to pay for stocks.
 Common sense tells us that people are less likely to pay steep prices for shares of equities if alternatives -- like Treasury securities -- become more attractive. 
 That is certainly the way it has worked in the past. 
 Ned Davis Research, an investment advisory firm in Venice, Fla., recently compared 10-year Treasury yields and the so-called earnings yield of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index from March 31, 1965, to March 31, 2004. The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio; as such, it measures the amount of corporate profits investors are buying with their equity dollars. 
 Ned Davis researchers found a correlation between the two yields. In fact, a majority of moves in earnings yields can be explained by moves in long-term Treasury rates, they say. ''There are periods where, for a little bit of time, this doesn't hold true,'' said Sam Burns, senior equity research analyst for Ned Davis. But over time, he added, ''there is a relationship.''
 If earnings yields tend to rise with Treasury yields, then P/E ratios -- as their inverse -- are likely to fall. And that is exactly what tends to happen.
 So if history is any guide, P/E ratios, which have already fallen considerably from the lofty levels of the late 1990's -- because of falling prices in the bear market and rising earnings in the economic recovery -- may drop even more as the Fed raises rates to keep the economy from overheating.
 While Treasury yields have dropped this week,, they have risen sharply since the end of the first quarter, from 3.86 to 4.46 percent on Friday. Of course, that won't necessarily translate into lower stock prices, at least not right away. P/E ratios could fall simply if corporate earnings (the ''E'' in P/E) grow at a faster rate than stock prices (the ''P''). That has generally been the case so far this year, as earnings for the S.&P. 500 rose an estimated 27.5 percent in the first quarter and 20.8 percent in the second. Stock prices, without dividends, have risen only around 2.6 percent since the start of the year. 
 But if Treasury yields move higher, it would mean that investors, particularly those who benefited from owning more speculative, high-P/E stocks last year, will need to reassess the risk in their portfolios. That is especially true now that the Fed has begun to raise rates and the pace of corporate earnings growth is expected to be slower in the year's second half.
 ''Overvaluation in the stock market doesn't cause prices to go down, but it does cause your level of risk to rise,'' said James Stack, president of Stack Financial Management in Whitefish, Mont., and editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter.
 What can investors do to lower this risk?
 First, they shouldn't overreact. Bill Nygren, manager of the value-oriented Oakmark Fund, notes that corporate earnings are expected to continue to grow this year, though perhaps not at the blistering rate they did in the second half of 2003. He argued that if inflationary worries turned out to be overblown and if rates didn't rise as much as expected -- a real possibility, he said -- stocks could end up performing better than many analysts predict.
 Because the gap between P/E ratios on high-quality and speculative shares has narrowed in recent years, Mr. Nygren said, worried investors should consider higher-quality stocks -- big household names like McDonald's and Anheuser-Busch. (Both are holdings in his fund.)
 Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Smith Barney, agreed. He said that ''the very largest of the large caps, the megacap names, look attractively valued'' relative to the rest of the market. He was referring to the largest 25 companies in the S.&P. 500 large-cap stock index. Historically, these giants have traded at a premium to the overall market, but that is not true today.
 Another option is to hunt for sectors of the economy that have tended to do best amid rising rates. 
 Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.&P., recently looked at the six periods in which the Fed has raised interest rates multiple times since 1970. Among the industries that outperformed the market were a couple of classic conservative sectors: health care and energy. Health care, in fact, was one of the few industries to have positive returns, on average, a year after the first rate increase during those periods, according to S.&P. 
 The energy sector continues to intrigue many money managers, and for a couple of reasons. For starters, many believe that while oil prices have declined from their recent highs, they are likely to stay above $30 a barrel for a while. That should help energy company earnings. Moreover, because energy profits are still rising amid high oil prices and strong global demand, the sector is trading at an average P/E of less than 12.3, based on estimated 2004 operating earnings. That is the lowest multiple among the S.&P.'s sectors. 
 The S.&P. study found that technology was the best-performing sector, on average, after initial rate increases in those six periods since 1970. But David Dreman, co-manager of the Scudder Dreman High Return Equity fund, said technology might not do so well this time around.
 Why not? Blue-chip tech stocks trade at an average of 25 times their 2004 estimated operating earnings, the highest P/E among sectors in the S.&P. ''The higher that interest rates go, the less you're willing to pay for the future,'' Mr. Dreman said. ''So my thought is, the Nasdaq, the tech sector, the dot-coms and other fast-growing segments of the market may have problems with P/E compression.''

HEADLINE: The Ripple Effect Of Losing a Landmark

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
ONE of the key reasons the Goodspeed Opera House decided to leave its longtime home lies tucked behind Main Street of East Haddam, a storybook village that invokes an image of Oz, minus the Munchkins. 
 Behind tri-colored houses draped with gingerbread, rainbows of flowers sneaking over their edges onto the paths of the narrow street and the grand, old Goodspeed -- a Victorian mansion set atop the Connecticut riverside -- there are acres and acres of wetlands. 
 For many who live and work in the little village that surrounds the Goodspeed, the wetlands are worth saving. For the Goodspeed, they were perfect for parking lots. 
 The Goodspeed Opera House has long been a cornerstone of tourism in Connecticut and its commitment to musical theater has brought it acclaim. But modernization has bypassed the Goodspeed for many years. 
 Six years ago, the Goodspeed's administrators gave East Haddam officials their plans for expansion. Almost immediately, several citizens of the downtown section of East Haddam formed the grassroots Village Planning Group. 
 ''We went in with the expectation that Goodspeed was going to expand here and we wanted to be sure it was done in the most balanced way possible,'' Kris DiErrico said as she sat in her office overlooking the wetlands in question.
 Ms. DiErrico is the design half of Lifespace, an architecture and interior design firm a few houses away from the Goodspeed. ''The question was, 'Could we handle the scope of this massive project in this little town?''' 
 After years of meetings with town officials, the Goodspeed got tired of waiting for the answer and took Middletown up on its offer to provide two sites for a new Goodspeed to open four years from now. One site is for the theater, the other for offices, a production shop, a library. The announcement surprised few in the village section of East Haddam who had been monitoring negotiations between the theater and East Haddam and the theater and Middletown. It appalled outsiders, though. 
 ''It's a sin,'' said Lisa Aurora as she fluffed her daughter's wedding dress outside the Goodspeed a few days after the announcement.
 Mrs. Aurora's wedding pictures had been taken at the Goodspeed, and now the daughter was standing where the mother had stood, on the steps of the theater. 
 ''We would not be shooting photographs here if the Goodspeed was not producing shows, oh no,'' Mrs. Aurora said. ''There's just something about the Goodspeed and the history and the presence.'' 
 Those are words local restaurateurs, who have made at least some of their living from Goodspeed patrons, did not want to hear. The bride was posing just steps away from the Gelston House, bought by the Carbone Restaurant Group eight years ago. The company transformed the aging inn, opening a grill, a tavern and a beer garden and refurbishing several rooms above for overnight stays. The restaurant is only steps from the theater and is so dependent on theater clientele that it structures the hours of its grill room to accommodate matinees and special showings.
 ''The sun will come up tomorrow,'' said Michael Androw, the general manager, invoking a line from the hit show, ''Annie,'' which made its debut at the Goodspeed. ''Our business is going to be here tomorrow. And it still remains to be seen. No shovels have hit the earth yet.''
 The drawbridge of the East Haddam Swing Bridge went up, and cars began to accumulate, waiting for the bridge to reopen. From the porch of the Gelston House, Carol and Herb Criswell of Signal Mountain, Tenn., watched the line grow. 
 ''We've always heard of the Goodspeed,'' said Mr. Criswell, who was in town to see his daughter, Kim Criswell, perform as lead actress in Goodspeed's current production, ''Call Me Madam.''
 ''I think moving the Goodspeed to another town is a disappointment. It's the keystone of this little town.''
 Across the street, Jacqueline Cacace, who co-owns LaVita Gustosa, a restaurant and bakery, stood behind the bakery counter talking about the move.
 ''Of course we were upset and disappointed,'' said Mrs. Cacace, who with her husband has been negotiating to buy the building where their businesses stand.
 Although the bakery gets little business from Goodspeed patrons, the restaurant depends on them for more than a quarter of its business, Mrs. Cacace said. ''We're worried about property values dropping once the Goodspeed leaves,'' she said. ''But we're going to do our best to adjust to their changing situation.''
 At Fish Sisters, a clothing boutique, the owner, Carole Scherrer, said she doesn't depend on the Goodspeed for her customer base. But she lives in town, she said, and is disappointed with the Goodspeed's decision.
 ''The Goodspeed is East Haddam and East Haddam is the Goodspeed,'' she said. ''People come here from all over just to visit the opera house.''
 The theater is nonprofit, so it does not rate in the town's Top 10 taxpayer list, according to the tax assessor's office. The theater employs about 200 people in the summertime, when it runs two shows. Year-round, Goodspeed employs about 60. The theater's move will be profound in the loss of millions of dollars of spin-off spending, town officials said.
 Middletown's offer is contingent upon about $30 million in state bond money. Gov. John G. Rowland has been generous with state bond money in the past, particularly for urban reclamation projects such as the one Middletown is trying to affect on its Main Street. With a new governor, however, and the issue not yet before the state bond commission, no one, including Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, a member of the commission, could say for certain if bond money would be allocated for the project. ''I think most commission members at this point are getting their information from the newspapers,'' Mr. Blumenthal said Monday.
 In East Haddam, Brad Parker, East Haddam's first selectman, was buying coffee and sweets at La Vita Gustosa's bakery counter. Just when he thought the Goodspeed was swinging East Haddam's way, theater officials took the Middletown offer, he said. 
 ''We've been working very hard with them in recent weeks,'' he said. Then he took umbrage with Middletown's use of state money to lure the theater there, and said he had already written a letter to the governor expressing his concerns.
 ''The state shouldn't get involved with this,'' he said. ''What kind of message will the state be giving to small towns if they start following this practice?'' 
 Middletown's mayor was unapologetic. ''They never got so far as even giving them permission,'' Mayor Domenique Thornton said. ''They never granted the theater approval, and as a matter of fact their zoning requirements were so restrictive that there was no way this type of structure would ever have been built in East Haddam.''
 East Haddam officials said they have worked long and hard to keep the Goodspeed in town, short of destroying wetlands. ''It's hard to turn a swamp into a parking lot,'' Mr. Parker has said in the past.
 The town was in the process of enacting a zone change to accommodate the size of the Goodspeed's expansion, but there was little it could do about the wetlands issue, he said.
 At least one village merchant was unmoved by the announcement.
 ''I'll miss the actors and the actresses who come in,'' said Mike Billings, the proprietor of Delo's package store. ''There's going to be changes. But what comes with change is possibility.'' 
 Mrs. Aurora wasn't happy, though.
 ''This is a landmark in Connecticut,'' she said, fixing a flyaway hair on her daughter's brow. ''This is what Connecticut is, right here.''

HEADLINE: Indonesians Hope a Real Election on Monday Will Bring Real Change

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: PROBOLINGGO, Indonesia, July 2 

 BODY:
Over baskets of warm rice and vats of steaming soup, the election patter at the breakfast stall, a few rickety benches deep inside the food market here, got off to a brisk start. 
 There was no way, said the proprietress, a spry 64-year-old military widow called Ariyo, that she would vote for anyone from the ancien regime that ruled Indonesia with an iron hand for more than 30 years. 
 Nor was she going to listen to the recommendation of a prominent Muslim leader. The incumbent, President Megawati Sukarnoputri, was not an option either, she said. 
 ''I'm voting for S.B.Y.,'' Mrs. Ariyo said with a triumphant smile, carefully enunciating the initials of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former general. ''He can stabilize the prices, and make things safe.'' 
 General Yudhoyono, a relative newcomer to Indonesia's rough and tumble politics, is the front-runner in the presidential election on Monday, according to voter surveys. He has consistently received more than 40 percent in the opinion surveys in the last several weeks, far ahead of four other rivals. 
 The voting will be the first round in a two-tiered election, the first time that Indonesians will directly choose their president. It will be a milestone in the democratic development of this, the world's most populous Muslim country.
 General Yudhoyono, until recently the minister for national security in Mrs. Megawati's cabinet and a graduate of two military training programs in the United States, will probably fall short of 50 percent of the vote, the polls show, meaning that he would face a runoff vote on Sept. 5.
 Most political analysts here are saying, though, that he will emerge as Indonesia's next president. 
 Much of General Yudhoyono's support appears to come from people like Mrs. Ariyo, who feel unencumbered in their choice by loyalty to political party, religious organization or even village headman. People say they are choosing whom they want, and the polls indicate they are choosing based on their feeling that he is trustworthy, rather than on any specific issues or stances.
 ''We're supposed to follow Gus Dur,'' said Mrs. Ariyo, using the nickname of Abdurrahman Wahid, a former leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, the country's biggest Muslim organization. ''But he's there for religion, and this is politics.'' A couple of early patrons murmured agreement. 
 Moreover, she said, she did not approve of Mr. Wahid's choice for president, General Wiranto. (Many Indonesians use only one name.) The general, a former chief of the armed forces under Suharto, has been indicted for crimes against humanity in East Timor by a tribunal supported by the United Nations.General Wiranto won the nomination of the Golkar Party, the established political machine from the Suharto era. But Golkar appears to be unable to deliver with its customary efficiency. 
 In recent months five presidential candidates have gone through the trappings of campaigning that are common in well-entrenched democracies: public rallies, a televised debate and expensive television advertisements. 
 Newspapers have been filled with campaign coverage, and in some cases publications have made points in indirect ways. To show General Wiranto's cozy connection to the Suharto government, for example, the weekly magazine Tempo found an old photograph that showed Suharto signing a piece of paper on the back of General Wiranto, who was leaning over to be used as a desk by the dictator.
 Almost slyly, the magazine found an old photo of a young President Megawati with her husband, Taufik Kiemas, both looking very slim compared with their portly figures now. 
 In a poll by the International Foundation for Election Systems, released Thursday, General Wiranto received the support of only 14.2 percent of respondents, compared with 43.5 percent for General Yudhoyono. 
 Despite the lack of openness in the financing of the campaigns, people who have worked over the last dozen years to bring democracy to Indonesia seemed pleased with the way they have unfolded.
 ''It's almost revolutionary that people think they can choose independently of their organization,'' said Smita Notosusanto, director of the Center for Electoral Reform, who led the effort to get a constitutional amendment that allowed for a direct presidential election. 
 But as Election Day nears, independent choice is not the case everywhere. 
 At Nurul Jadid, an Islamic boarding school in Paiton, 25 miles east of here, one of the principals, Malthuf Siroj, said he was instructing students of voting age to vote for General Wiranto. Of the more than 7,000 students at the school, about 60 percent could vote, he said. Huge banners for General Wiranto hung across the entrances to classrooms and dormitories. 
 The principal explained that he was supporting General Wiranto because his running mate, Salahuddin Wahid, is the brother of Abdurrahman Wahid, the former leader of Nahdlatul Ulama and the spiritual leader of the school. 
 Indeed, General Wiranto specifically chose Salahuddin Wahid as his vice presidential candidate in an effort to capture a big slice of the votes here in the Nahdlatul Ulama stronghold.
 But in another sign of the newly competitive nature of Indonesian politics, President Megawati countered by choosing the current leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Hasyim Muzadi, as her running mate.
 None of the five candidates favor the introduction of an Islamic state in a country known for its largely tolerant practice of Islam. 
 Aside from the institutional trappings of electioneering that have emerged, the campaigning has produced a new kind of political creature in Indonesia: organizers who have not previously been involved in politics. 
 At the Nirwana restaurant here, an upscale version of Mrs. Ariyo's food stand, one of General Yudhoyono's precinct workers was marveling over how hard she had worked in the last two months. 
 The organizer, Yuniar Sulastri, a 46-year-old mother of two who owns the restaurant with her husband, said she had gone house to house in the district handing out pamphlets, battery-operated wall clocks and coffee mugs emblazoned with the candidate's face. 
 Ms. Sulastri joked that her task had been made fairly simple. 
 The recently elected local legislator representing General Yudhoyono's Democratic Party was a very popular Indonesian movie star, Adjie Massaid. He is usually seen in television soap operas in jeans and a T-shirt. 
 ''We put him in Muslim clothes,'' said Ms. Sulastri, handing around palm cards of the movie star dressed in a white Islamic hat and white robes. ''I campaigned with him for three months. That made it easy.'' 
 The campaigning has been fairly light on the discussion of issues, even though Indonesia's economic growth falls behind its neighbors and unemployment continues to grow. 
 Focus groups conducted by the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs showed that voters were interested in the personal probity of candidates. ''Corruption, collusion and nepotism'' were the most consistently cited problems with the country's politics, the institute said. 
 Indonesia was listed as the 10th most corrupt country in the world in the most recent ratings by Transparency International, a watchdog group. But voters told the focus groups that General Yudhoyono appeared to be a man of ''integrity, quiet competence and authoritative bearing.'' 
 That judgment seemed to be borne out at the breakfast stand. ''I'm voting for S.B.Y., he's clean,'' said Halimah, 35, the daughter of the owner.

THE OLD IRON ROAD
An Epic of Rails, Roads,
and the Urge to Go West.
By David Haward Bain.
Illustrated. 434 pp. Viking. $27.95.
 IMAGINE a picaresque race across the country, east to west. Some of the racers -- like the historian David Haward Bain and his family, for instance -- live in the present. Some live in the past, like Samuel Clemens, the Donner-Reed party, assorted forty-niners and Mormons and emigrants. A few, like the Bains and Alice Huyler Ramsey, who in 1909 became the first woman to drive across the country, pay little attention to the clock. Others, like Grenville Dodge, chief engineer for the Union Pacific, are really racing against bankruptcy, and to them time is everything. Many begin the journey in St. Joseph, Mo., the traditional jumping-off point for the westward journey, but most come from farther east, like the Bains, who started in Vermont. Some take the train, some lay the rails, some walk, some drive oxen, and some drive the Lincoln Highway or the country roads that thread away from the Interstate. Set them all on the road together, as simultaneously as the linear nature of words will allow, and you have Bain's book ''The Old Iron Road.''
 Bain is the author of ''Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad'' (1999), a history of the enterprise that culminated in the joining of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads in the Golden Spike Ceremony at Promontory, Utah, in May 1869. Researching and writing that book took 14 years, and Bain planned the cross-country journey he describes in ''The Old Iron Road'' as a way to reward his wife and children for their patience and support -- and, really, to show them some of the wonders he had come across in his work. In one sense, then, ''The Old Iron Road'' is a retelling of ''Empire Express'' from a personal angle. Instead of the chronologies of politics and economics and track laying, this book is anchored by the geographies of the many Americas Bain and his family found as they made their way west by car.
 But another impulse also drives this book. Writing a big book -- and, just short of 800 pages, ''Empire Express'' is very big -- requires a tunnel vision that gets narrower and narrower as time passes. You forget how much you know and remember only how much there is to know. You stop looking around and start staring at your next few steps. In ''The Old Iron Road,'' Bain affords himself the luxury of wandering -- literally -- over the tracks his previous book set down across the American West. But this time he gets to make all the detours, take all the dead-end roads, meet all the characters he did not have time for or did not know about the first time around. In ''The Old Iron Road,'' the dead seem to rise up to greet him as he goes, and the living save all their best stories for him.
 We meet a lot of familiar folks on the road with Bain -- John C. Fremont, Calamity Jane, Henry Fonda, Fred Astaire, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But we also meet a lot of people who are less well known, like Edwin E. Perkins, late of Hastings, Neb. Perkins was an inventor whose imagination was wedded to the hyphen. He created Motor-Vigor, Glos-Comb and Jel-Aid before finally perfecting in 1927 the product that made him wealthy, Kool-Aid. We get to know railroad ghost towns before the people moved out and the ghosts moved in. We get a distant glimpse of the thousands of Chinese who worked on the rails nearly a century and a half ago, their ''acres of canvas tents staked out along the railroad grade'' and their ''cook fires redolent with peanut oil, garlic, cuttlefish and pork.''
 It is impossible to cross this country by land without being changed by the experience. ''The Old Iron Road'' captures this fact vividly, in as many different forms as Bain can find room for in its pages. And if, at times, we feel as though we've been dragged through far too many county museums and eaten in far too many historic hotels with unhistoric food, it is still engaging to cross the country in the company of someone who knows the road so well. Best of all, Bain leads the reader to people who know every inch of the crossing -- by rail or ox cart -- better than he can imagine. We are lucky to be in their company, even for a while.
 For many readers, ''The Old Iron Road'' may seem like a book to travel with, to lead them off the main roads and into a hidden country. When it becomes a paperback, I hope it will be reprinted in the form of an old-fashioned AAA TripTik, one of those customized plastic-bound route guides that the auto club prepared, and still prepares, to guide travelers on their way. In a TripTik, each new page is a new stretch of road, with side routes and attractions properly marked. ''The Old Iron Road'' is a book that cries out for that kind of graphical representation, a way of visually chronicling all the American journeys it contains.

HEADLINE: Russia Wants to Supply Energy to North Korea

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, June 29 

 BODY:
Russia is moving to become a major supplier of electricity and gas to North Korea at a time when the supply of nonnuclear energy sources available to that impoverished country is emerging as an important bargaining chip in talks intended to defuse North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 ''We are building energy transmission lines to the North Korean border,'' Sergei Darkin, governor of Russia's Pacific Maritime region, said in an interview on Monday. Governor Darkin said that if President Vladimir V. Putin ''gives us the task of transmitting energy to North Korea next year, we will be ready to do that.''
 North Korean negotiators said at the recent talks in Beijing that one price for freezing their nuclear-bomb program would be getting fuel supplies from other nations to provide two million kilowatts of power a year. That is roughly the output that was expected from the two nuclear reactors that were to be built under the 1994 international accord intended to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program. 
 Although South Korea spent about $800 million on the initial construction of the power plants, the program was frozen 18 months ago after North Korea ended international monitoring of nuclear materials that could be processed into bomb fuel.
 What is behind North Korea's demands for power is a shortage that has contributed to the nation's industrial collapse.
 Governor Darkin said Russia was completing plans to export excess electricity from Russian hydroelectric dams to the Korean peninsula, sending power also through North Korea to South Korea. Skeptics say such a project would enable North Korea to turn off lights in South Korea. But supporters say that North Korea would become dependent on the arrangement and moderate its behavior.
 At a conference in June to discuss energy-sharing between Russia and the Korean peninsula, North Korean officials agreed to provide by August basic data on its electric power system to the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, a South Korean government research group.
 Separately, Russian and Korean energy planners are studying routes for a Korean peninsula extension to a gas line now under construction to Khabarovsk from huge gas deposits off the Pacific coast of Russia's Sakhalin Island.
 A 1,900-mile pipeline from these reserves to Seoul would take four years to build and would cost up to $3.5 billion, Selig S. Harrison, a Korea expert at the Center for International Policy in Washington, said in an interview in Seoul. North Korean officials strongly favor building this line, said Mr. Harrison, who had extensive meetings with North Korean officials in April in Pyongyang, the capital. South Korea would probably finance the construction. 
 The ExxonMobil Corporation, the lead developer of one gas field in Sakhalin, has started to build a gas line to Khabarovsk. Russian officials want the line extended 450 miles south, to Vladivostok. The line could be extended through North Korea to Seoul, regional energy experts say.
 North Korea ''built its economy primarily around the abundant, low-cost Chinese crude oil flowing directly to its refineries,'' Mr. Harrison wrote in a recent essay explaining the North Koreans' desperate energy shortage to a regional energy cooperation conference in Seoul. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the conversion of China from oil exporter to oil importer, North Korea's crude oil imports have dropped by 85 percent, he wrote. By allowing the construction of gas and electric lines from Russia through its territory, North Korea could earn transmission fees, paid in energy.
 If its economy revives, North Korea could also buy Russian oil, which is expected to come to a maritime terminus near this port city as part of a planned pipeline from the eastern Siberian reserves. Vladivostok increasingly hopes to become a Northeast Asian crossroads. Last Sunday, a dozen English-language teachers from both Koreas mingled amiably at an academic conference in Vladivostok, long considered neutral ground by Koreans. 
 This weekend, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei V. Lavrov, is visiting both South Korea and North Korea, reportedly to lay the groundwork for a fall summit meeting in Vladivostok with President Putin of Russia and the leaders of the two Koreas. 
 ''Kim Jong Il is a man who goes by protocol, a very methodical person, so first there should be meetings by foreign ministers,'' said Olga P. Maltseva, a Vladivostok journalist who on Tuesday celebrated the publication here of her new book about the North Korean leader, ''A Waltz With Kim Jong Il.''
 In recent days, Russian railroad stations between here and the North Korean border were on alert for a possible visit by Mr. Kim in his armored train. He rode the train to Moscow on an earlier visit.
 His father, Kim Il Sung, visited the Soviet Union 10 times, often meeting Soviet leaders secretly in Vladivostok, Larisa Zabroskaya, a Korea expert at the Russian Academy of Science, said in an interview here. Ms. Zabroskaya, who believes that President Putin is trying to broker an inter-Korean summit meeting here this fall, said, ''In Soviet times, there was a tradition that whenever a Soviet leader came to Vladivostok, the North Korean leader would come to Vladivostok.''
 Pak Jong Song, director general of the North Korean Railway Ministry, recently endorsed Mr. Putin's plan to create a rail network that he calls the ''Iron Silk Road'' to link North and South Korea's railroads with the Trans-Siberian Railway. In a return gesture, Russia sent 35,000 tons of wheat to North Korea, Russia's first food aid to North Korea, through the United Nations World Food Program.
 North Korea's courting of Russia is part of a wider diplomatic offensive started this spring to isolate the United States, American analysts say.
 In April, Kim Jong Il traveled to Beijing. In May, he received a visit from Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. Also in May, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Han Song Ryol, floated the possibility of North Korea signing a peace treaty with the United States and South Korea. [On Friday, Mr. Koizumi told the Japanese NTV television network that he wanted to normalize relations with North Korea within one year, adding, ''The earlier, the better.'']
 North Korea wants to improve ''bilateral relations with Tokyo and Seoul while remaining on good terms with Beijing and Moscow,'' C. Kenneth Quinones, a Washington-based Korea expert, wrote recently for a Japanese newspaper. ''Pyongyang's efforts have deflected much diplomatic pressure back on to Washington.''

HEADLINE: Marching Sideways Into the Second Half

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
DOMESTIC stock mutual funds have extended their winning streak to five quarters -- but just barely, as the threat of rising interest rates, inflation and uncertainty in Iraq has set a sober tone on Wall Street.
 In many ways, the second quarter was transitional for the markets, investors and the mutual fund business, which faced new rules from federal regulators to bolster the independence of fund boards.
 The average general mutual fund that invests in domestic stocks eked out a gain of about 0.8 percent, on average, in the quarter. Among all domestic equity funds, the average gain was just 0.7 percent. That compares with a gain of 3.3 percent in the first quarter and 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, a remarkable year for the equity markets. 
 For now, though, the buzz seems to have worn off, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up only 2.6 percent in the first half and 1.3 percent in the second quarter, and the Dow Jones industrial average showing a slight loss of 0.2 percent for the first half, and a tiny gain of less than 0.1 percent for the quarter. 
 At least stock funds made money. Bond funds, coping with the threat of rising inflation and interest rates, lost 1.8 percent, on average, in the recent quarter as bond prices fell. 
 Russel Kinnel, director of mutual fund research at Morningstar Inc., said the stock market ''has been drunk on cheap money from the federal government for a while,'' referring to low interest rates and the fiscal stimulus. 
 ''You have to figure the hangover is coming,'' he said.
 It may already be here. Investors got a sobering taste of it on the final day of the quarter, as the Federal Reserve Board began the painful process of weaning Wall Street from its addiction to historically low interest rates.
 Last week, the central bank raised its target on the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent, in the first of what many people expect to be a series of rate increases in coming months.
 The wait for the rate move kept the major stock indexes in a tight trading range for weeks, making the job of equity fund managers that much more difficult. 
 ''A sideways market to me is a very logical development when you have a confluence of good economic data and good corporate profits supporting the market, but two major uncertainties pressuring it,'' said Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati. Mr. Sargen was referring to geopolitical concerns surrounding the violence and transition of authority in Iraq, which led to higher oil prices in the second quarter, and, of course, to the outlook for interest rates.
 The mere threat of inflation and rising rates has already had an impact on the bond market, where the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, for example, was up to 4.58 percent at the end of June, from 3.86 percent at the end of March.
 As a result, long-term government bond funds, particularly vulnerable to interest rate risks, posted average losses of 4.7 percent.
 INTEREST rate fears also seemed to slow the performance of stock sector funds that invest in industries whose earnings may be hurt by higher borrowing costs. Among them were financial-services sector funds, which fell 2.7 percent, on average, in the quarter, and real estate funds, which were down 5.5 percent. That was a major turnaround from the first quarter, when real estate funds outperformed other categories of domestic stock portfolios, posting gains of around 12 percent. Technology funds were also among the poorer performers in the second quarter, posting average returns of 0.1 percent. 
 Still, fund investors did not appear too discouraged by the results, as they continued to put money into equity funds in the quarter. Nor did they seem fazed by news of industry reform, stemming from the mutual fund trading scandals that began last year. 
 In the quarter, the Securities and Exchange Commission made a big change in the way mutual fund boards operate. By a vote of 3 to 2, the S.E.C. approved a requirement that all fund boards eventually be led by an independent chairman. The agency also requiredthat 75 percent of all board members be independent themselves. 
 Moreover, investors saw yet more settlements between major fund companies -- including Janus Capital, Strong Capital Management and Pilgram Baxter & Associates -- and state or federal regulators in the last quarter.
 The big question for fund investors in recent months has been where to put their money. Unlike the first quarter, when there were clear-cut winners -- small-capitalization stock funds, real estate funds and emerging-market funds, to name a few -- the second quarter was ''all over the map,'' Mr. Kinnel said.
 The performances of large-cap and small-cap funds, for example, were fairly similar, as were those of growth and value portfolios.
 But some market watchers say they saw a shift of sorts in market leadership in the quarter. ''I think we really saw the turn in April and May, particularly related to the heightened geopolitical problems in Iraq,'' said Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Banc of America Capital Management.
 While speculative segments of the stock market did well in the first quarter, continuing a trend from 2003, investors began to embrace higher-quality assets, including blue-chip stocks and stock funds, in the second.
 Large-cap stocks held their own in the last quarter, but higher-quality large caps appeared to perform even better. Standard & Poor's categorizes stocks in the S.&P. 500 index based on the quality of the underlying companies' earnings and dividends and applies letter grades to them, from D to A+. In the second quarter, the C's fell 1.2 percent, while those rated A-, A or A+ rose 1.1 percent; in the first quarter, both groups rose, but the C's were far ahead. 
 There was another sign that speculation might be over: diversified emerging-markets funds fell by 9.1 percent over the last three months. That helped drag down the performance of international stock funds in general; they lost 2.4 percent, on average.
 But some market watchers are not convinced that the solid performance of domestic blue-chip stocks reflected a fundamental shift in investors' thinking.
 Some of the best-performing stock funds in the second quarter, for instance, were not blue-chip funds, but rather small-cap portfolios like Excelsior Small Cap, a growth fund that was up 6.6 percent. 
 Douglas H. Pyle, lead manager for the fund, said its success stemmed from its strategy of stepping only into stocks that had already experienced major declines in share price. Moreover, the fund has historically ignored real estate investment trusts, an avoidance that certainly helped in the quarter. ''What you don't own can often add to your performance,'' he said.
 As for the broad markets, there is disagreement over whether they are headed for a summer rally or the doldrums.
 The markets may be treading water this summer, said Mr. Sargen, of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, because of continuing worries about Iraq as well as terrorism fears, partly related to major summer events like the Olympic Games and the major political conventions. 
 BUT others point to a potentially positive wild card: corporate earnings.
 Mike Thompson, director of research at Thomson Financial , said Wall Street analysts had been steadily increasing their estimates for third-quarter S.&P. 500 earnings growth, to 14.1 percent at the end of June from 11.8 percent on April 1. Estimates have also climbed for fourth-quarter earnings, to 15.5 percent from 13.1 percent in April. 
 While that estimate would pale in comparison to 28.3 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2003, ''These are fantastic numbers,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We're growing at a blast-furnace pace.'' If the estimates materialize, overall profit growth for 2004 could exceed 20 percent. And that could be just the surprise to re-energize the markets, market watchers say.

HEADLINE: As Businesses Wander, New Jersey Fights Back

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to business, New Jersey is raising the ante.
 Buffeted by recession, corporate poaching by other states and defections in New Jersey's signature pharmaceutical industry, the McGreevey administration has begun -- although belatedly -- to beef up efforts to attract new companies and hang on to those already here.
 After scaling back incentives and raising corporate taxes in last year's budget, Governor McGreevey has restored and in some cases enhanced the state's main program aimed at attracting and expanding business. Indeed, in the latest budget that was approved by the Legislature a little more than a week ago, new incentives were added to keep New Jersey businesses from straying.
 Not that all is well on corporate campuses around the state. Corporate tax rates remain among the highest in the nation, and the newly enacted ''millionaire's tax'' -- which despite its name applies to all personal income over $500,000 a year -- could alienate corporate leaders. 
 Nonetheless, James Leonard, vice president for government relations at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, says, ''We hope we've turned the corner from the days of bashing the business community.''
 Mr. Leonard said it remains to be seen what effect the millionaire's tax may have on corporate locations but , ''Over all, I would say there is a better balance.''
 The governor is even getting into the act personally.
 When produce merchants in Philadelphia were recently considering a move across the Delaware River, Mr. McGreevey put in a conference call to them -- addressing many by name -- in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to lure 1,100 workers to a $94.9 million state-financed center in Camden. And in April, he ordered his entire cabinet to a special meeting with executives from pharmaceutical companies to discuss how the state could keep them happy -- and right where they were.
 ''We're in a very competitive environment,'' said State Treasurer John E. McCormac. ''We owe it to our residents to try and bring in projects that create jobs.''
 Compared with neighboring New York City, New Jersey is a bargain, and price-conscious businesses have flocked to the northern part of the state in recent years.
 ''New York City is obviously a relatively high-cost jurisdiction and many of the companies spurring development in Jersey City are interested in that,'' said Gaulberto Medina, who was chief executive of the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission in the Whitman administration and is now director of the technology enterprise group at Cushman & Wakefield in East Rutherford.
 In the southern tier, the state is eager to jump-start development in Camden, where it has already made a $175 million investment and is about to embark on a $1.3 billion redevelopment project. With that squarely in mind, officials offered enticing packages to coax both the produce merchants and the Cigna Corporation, an insurance company based in Philadelphia with 1,500 employees, across the Delaware River. In both cases, the businesses decided to stay where they were.
 For now at least, Mr. McCormac says that New Jersey will respond to companies only when approached, even though companies in the state are regularly courted by other states trying to attract high-paying technology jobs, particularly in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
 ''We don't play the game,'' Mr. McCormac said. ''We don't aggressively seek companies. We react to inquiries. We don't do mailings. We don't do visits. We don't do cold calls.''
 As for what New Jersey has to offer, Mr. McCormac says the state's business assets, including a well-educated work force and high-tech research infrastructure, speak for themselves.
 ''Anybody looking to expand or move would not be fulfilling their fiduciary obligations if they didn't consider New Jersey, particularly if they are in pharmaceuticals or financial services,'' he said. 
 In May, the most recent month for which figures are available, employment in New Jersey reached a record 4.04 million, according to the State Department of Labor. 
 New Jersey has the nation's highest median family income -- $70,488 a year, according to 2000 Census figures -- and a stable of high-paying manufacturing and professional jobs. But historically, the state has been less hungry than other locales to slug it out for new business, said Richard Harris, a professor of political science at Rutgers-Camden and director of the Rand Institute for Public Affairs.

Now, More Aggression
 ''Now the recent economic downturn has begun to pinch those high-end jobs as well,'' Professor Harris said. ''As a result, the state is becoming much more aggressive.''
 States are battling for companies like CareGain, a three-year-old startup that develops software for health insurers.
 In 2003, the company had 15 employees working in the corner of a warehouse. Since then, CareGain has grown to 45 employees and expects to have as many as 120 workers by the end of next year. The company moved in the spring to new space in East Windsor after qualifying for the state's Business Employment Incentive Program, which could be worth up to $950,000 over the next 10 years. In addition, the company expects to receive state job-training funds valued at up to $750,000 over the next 18 months.
 At the end of 2003, CareGain began to explore opportunities in Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut as well as New Jersey. ''You've got to consider all of the economics,'' said William Hackett, the chief financial officer at CareGain.
 In the end, the company was satisfied with the state's help in financing its expansion. ''Our bias was to remain here, but absent these grants we would at least have gone further down the road in terms of offers from Pennsylvania and Connecticut,'' Mr. Hackett said.
 Critics say that such incentives are taxpayer-financed gifts to business that drain the public treasury. 
 ''What's happening here is companies are playing states off one another to get money,'' said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonprofit research group. ''I have a feeling that behind the closed doors of the boardroom they're having a nice chuckle -- and we're paying for it.''
 The state's primary economic incentive program is the Business Employment Incentive Program, or BEIP, which provides grants equal to up to 80 percent of the state income tax that would be generated for each new job created. Since the program began in 1996, the state has awarded 206 grants worth a total of $650 million. For that outlay, according to the State Economic Development Authority, the grants are expected to generate a total of 45,000 jobs.
 Last year, Governor McGreevey cut the program while wrestling with a bulging budget, but he restored it in September after the decision had drawn howls from the business community, particularly from companies that had already decided to relocate in the state based on a 10-year payout.
 ''The governor received a lump on his head when he threatened to eliminate the BEIP program,'' said Philip Schepel, president of Mintax Inc., a consulting firm in East Brunswick that helps Fortune 1000 companies evaluate and negotiate government incentives. ''He and his staff have realized that business retention is very important in this state.'' 
 Another factor driving the state's more aggressive business posture, Mr. Schepel said, was a decision earlier this year by Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, to build a vaccine plant that employs 200 people in North Carolina. Merck, which has its corporate headquarters in Whitehouse Station and in fact once employed Mr. McGreevey, did not even ask New Jersey to make a bid for the project. 
 ''It wasn't that many jobs,'' Mr. Schepel said, ''but it had a psychological impact because it was Merck.''
 Indeed, mergers and cost pressures on pharmaceutical companies -- the state's leading industry -- have raised some alarms.

Battle for Drug Companies
 Last year, employment in the pharmaceutical industry remained at 63,000 -- the first time it had not gone up in more than a decade, according to the Health Care Institute of New Jersey. 
 Novartis, the Swiss drug-maker with operations in New Jersey, chose to expand in Cambridge, Mass., though it has since received a $5.8 million state grant to bolster its operations in New Jersey. Aventis, with its United States headquarters in Bridgewater and 3,500 workers in the state, is being acquired by a French rival, Sanofi-Synthelabo, which could jeopardize New Jersey jobs.
 Pfizer, which employs 5,500 in New Jersey, is seeking a grant for a possible expansion that will be presented to the state Economic Development Authority this month. The company is expected to argue that without state assistance it may have to look elsewhere, possibly Michigan, where it has additional laboratory space. The company has said that it would like to develop a $400 million research and commercial operations campus in Morris Plains that could involve up to 5,000 workers.
 ''Drug companies are our No.1 industry,'' Mr. McCormac said. ''We've got to make the extra effort to, first and foremost, keep them here and, second, make sure they consider New Jersey when they are thinking about expansion.'' 
 To underscore that point, when the state restored the incentive grants, it sweetened the program. In the past, New Jersey required companies applying for grants to create 25 new jobs if they were situated in an economically distressed part of the state and 75 positions elsewhere. Now companies can qualify for a grant if they hire just 25 workers anywhere in the state. Moreover, the job requirement drops to just 10 new positions for companies in certain high-tech industries. 
 In addition, the state extended the credit for workers who live in Pennsylvania -- making New Jersey more attractive to companies in that state looking for new space. Yet the state also tightened some provisions: it limited each grant to $50,000 per employee; it required that companies provide health care for the new workers; and it restricted the incentives to companies that agreed to build in conjunction with the governor's development policies. 
 But the biggest change was a provision allowing the state to finance the grants by borrowing rather than with general tax revenue. Not everyone agrees with that move. 
 ''The idea that we're going to go into debt to give this money back to businesses sets a bad precedent,'' said Mr. Shure, whose organization recently analyzed the incentive program.
 For his part, Mr. McCormac said the ability to float bonds to finance the grants was crucial to gaining business confidence in the program, particularly after the McGreevey administration cut the 2004 budget appropriation.
 Mr. Shure said that certainty came with a price, however: bond debt that must be paid off by taxpayers. 
 ''What is ever certain about running a business?'' he asked. ''What about the uncertainty of a senior citizen who may or may not get pharmaceuticals if we let business go to the front of the line?''
 He said it was dangerous for governments to get involved in picking winners and losers in business. And he suggested that the state would provide a better environment for companies if it took its business incentive money and invested in standard government services like education or better transportation systems.
 And as the analysis by New Jersey Policy Perspective pointed out, since 2001 at least eight companies that received grants have laid off a total of 2,794 workers in the state.
 Caren Franzini, chief executive of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which oversees state business incentive programs, said that companies must say they will have to leave New Jersey if not for the grants, but that inevitably plans change.
 ''We recognize that corporate reorganizations are a business reality,'' Ms. Franzini said. ''The BEIP grants that we award are always estimated amounts based on the facts as we know them at the time of the award.''

Incentives Are Examined
 As a result of the criticism, Mr. McCormac has asked Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, to examine the program. Mr. Seneca said his report, which is expected to be completed shortly, will take a close look at state borrowing to finance business incentives as well as the level of accountability and public access to information about the grants.
 Over all, he said he thought that the program has been effective because it emphasizes employment, not real estate development or other attraction tools used in some states.
 ''In a world without state government and state boundaries it's probably true, we wouldn't need state business incentives,'' Mr. Seneca said. ''But in the real world, states compete for jobs and economic development, and they've done this since the beginning of the Republic.''
 The real world now extends to Eastern Europe, India, China and other parts of Asia where governments, eager to stimulate economic growth, routinely offer tax holidays, said Kathleen Norat, vice president for economic development at Mintax, the relocation consulting firm.
 ''That's the crux of incentive programs today,'' Ms. Norat said. ''It's no longer just competition among states within the U.S. for jobs.''
 In addition to the new provisions regarding the incentive grants, the state is expected to restore part of a program that allows money-losing companies to sell tax credits to profitable companies that need write-offs against New Jersey taxes, Mr. McCormac said. The program, which appeals to research-based companies in fields like biotechnology , was suspended in 2002. Mr. McCormac has told legislators that with revenue running $692 million ahead of forecasts, the state can afford to restore at least part of the program.
 In the latest budget, the state also made an important change that will help keep companies in New Jersey.
 ''BEIP doesn't help with a company that's looking to move,'' Mr. McCormac said, ''and we're trying to keep them here.''
 The new program grants a credit of up to $1,500 for each employee who remains in the state, up from $400 that was provided in a program that was started in 1997 and expired in 2002. Companies with more than 2,000 workers relocating to a specially designated urban development zone would be eligible for an additional $750 bonus. The new program applies only to companies with 250 or more workers, up from 25 in the old program, and has a cap of $20 million.
 ''The retention program will be critical even as New Jersey is working so hard to attract jobs the other states are working to entice companies in New Jersey to expand in their localities,'' Mr. Schepel said. He added that other states, particularly those from the South, frequently make three-day treks to New York and New Jersey to try to entice companies with incentives and lower costs.
 In addition to the Merck vaccine plant, North Carolina was able to snag an 850-employee Verizon call center with a $10 million grant up front, Mr. McCormac said.
 ''We could not compete with that,'' he said, dismissing that move as a minor setback. ''Individually, nothing is a big blow, but collectively we want to make sure that we're on the right track.'' 
 As states continue to emerge from recession, competition for companies will heat up, said Sujit Canagaretna, a senior fiscal analyst with the Council of State Governments in Atlanta.
 Mr. Canagaretna said that incentives can work for states and companies on the margin, but that in most cases relocation decisions are made on larger economic factors like overall costs or labor availability.
 ''You might have this little song and dance, but by and large it's going to come down to the economics,'' he said.

'Not About to Break the Bank'
 The produce merchants that state officials tried to lure to New Jersey ultimately decided to remain in Philadelphia, but only after the city offered them $150 million in incentives to stay.
 ''We'd like to have had them come, but there are competitive limits,'' Mr. McCormac said. ''We're not about to break the bank just to get a deal.''
 New Jersey now has that much more in its war chest -- and Pennsylvania that much less -- to deploy in the next skirmish over a corporate tenant, said Mr. McCormac, who is keen to land a top corporate tenant to validate Camden's redevelopment. ''If our competition keeps overpaying, then it will be beneficial to us.''
 Dennis Yablonsky, Pennsylvania's commerce secretary, said that in addition to the publicly announced deals, like the produce center and Cigna's flirtation with Camden, New Jersey has put Pennsylvania on the defense with a handful of other companies.
 Still, Mr. Yablonsky said, ''We haven't lost one yet.''

HOW SOCCER
EXPLAINS THE WORLD
An Unlikely Theory of Globalization.
By Franklin Foer.
261 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $24.95.
 In his 1975 book ''The Painted Word,'' Tom Wolfe advanced the theory that Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art were cruel hoaxes foisted on the public by a cabal of Gotham con men. This was basically an indefensible position, but there was no one better equipped to fight such a gallant rear-guard action than the cunning Mr. Wolfe. Ultimately, the author found himself in the enviable position of having published one of the most entertaining books ever written about modern art, even though it was impossible to take the book's premise seriously. 
 Franklin Foer has achieved a similar feat with ''How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization.'' A dud athlete but an excellent reporter (mostly for The New Republic), Foer believes that soccer can be used to ''explain'' everything from nationalism to hooliganism to hatred of globalization to the nebulous prospect of Islamic democracy to the disintegration of Yugoslavia as a nation. This is a nice hook for a book and a savvy promotional gimmick, but Foer has overplayed his hand here; the fact that soccer can be ''linked'' to so many cultural phenomena does not mean that it ''explains'' them. But Foer's book is such an eccentric, fascinating expose of a world most of us know nothing about that his inability to prove his central thesis seems almost irrelevant. 
 The author certainly did his homework, and on a few occasions even seems to have put his life at risk while interviewing particularly vile soccer fans in Eastern Europe. During a six-month sabbatical from The New Republic, he spent quality time with cretins from Belgrade to Glasgow, traveled to Brazil to find out why no one wants to play there anymore, then spent even more quality time with cretins from London. He also devoted enormous amounts of energy to researching the history of a long-forgotten all-Jewish team from Vienna that briefly ruled the Austrian football cosmos during the 1920's. (The team fell apart after a visit to America; most of the squad took one look at New York City and decided to ditch Mitteleuropa for good.) He even trekked to Ukraine to visit an itinerant Nigerian player who never quite managed to adapt to the mysterious brand of mechanical, mathematically oriented soccer practiced in that unfortunate nation. Finally, Foer returned home to the United States, a land where soccer is generally ridiculed, ignored or played badly. 
 The book starts off like a house on fire, with a harrowing account of the connection between Serbian football hooligans and the massacres that occurred in Croatia and Bosnia in the early 1990's. It then moves on to a treatment of the venomous, idiotic warfare between Roman Catholic and Protestant fans that has been raging in Glasgow for more than a century. Here, Foer makes his most interesting point, that modernization, economic rebirth and a general rise in sophistication have not reduced tribal rivalries in all highly advanced societies, that pointless internecine warfare is almost a hobby for some people. As he writes, ''The city has kept alive its soccer tribalism, despite the logic of history, because it provides the city with a kind of pornographic pleasure.''Or, as he explains it elsewhere, ''Nobody, it seems, hates like a neighbor.''
 Foer also does a nice job explaining why so many American pundits, shock jocks, sportswriters and professional wise-alecks go out of their way to deride a sport whose strange, minimalist beauty escapes them. One reason: soccer aficionados bring it on themselves.
 ''I wish that my side, the yuppie soccer fans, were blameless victims in these culture wars,'' he writes. ''But I've been around enough of America's soccer cognoscenti to know that they invite abuse. They are inveterate snobs, so snobbish, in fact, that they think nothing of turning against their comrades. According to their sneering critique, their fellow fans are dilettantes without any real understanding of the game; they are yuppies who admire soccer like a fine slab of imported goat cheese; they come from neighborhoods with spectacularly high Starbucks-per-capita, so they lack any semblance of burning working-class passion.'' Touche. 
 ''How Soccer Explains the World'' bristles with anecdotes that are almost impossible to believe. Forty-six thousand fans once packed the Polo Grounds to see Hakoah of Vienna, the all-Jewish team, play an exhibition match. A popular Italian television program meticulously reviews controversial penalties, while referees are accused of rigging matches to appease powerful owners. Serbian teams used to throw games rather than risk being shot in the kneecaps by thugs in the employ of a gangster who later resurfaced as a mass murderer during the war in Croatia. And Protestant fans in Glasgow regularly chant vile insults directed at the pope, even though their team includes several Catholic players.
 All this makes for very engaging reading, but it won't get anyone in the United States any more excited about soccer. Since we already have ice hockey, a ferociously repetitive low-scoring game where nothing ever happens, and since hooliganism is not something we need to import to these shores, I suspect most readers will come away from this book relieved that professional soccer, like French pop music, German stand-up comedy and Indian movies, is something profoundly annoying that mercifully stays overseas where it can't do any damage to our fragile republic. Perhaps inadvertently, Foer has written a paean to a sport he loves that will provide even more ammunition to those who loathe it.

HEADLINE: One Cornerstone, but Many Loose Ends

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The language this morning during the cornerstone laying for the Freedom Tower at ground zero will probably be as lofty as the skyscraper itself. 
 But no one gathered around the great granite block -- not the governors, the mayor, the civil servants, the developer, the planners, and certainly not the reporters -- can say for certain how much of the current vision for the new World Trade Center will be realized.
 Guessing the future of long-term megaprojects is a fool's game. Their momentum depends on an alignment of political will, popular support, market demand and economic conditions that shift constantly, beyond the ability of anyone to control or predict. 
 These forces are not now in exact alignment at ground zero, although it is possible -- given the tortuous history of other major development projects in the city, like 42nd Street and Battery Park City -- to marvel at the fact that an official plan has been promulgated so quickly.
 Even more astonishing is the amount of damage caused by the warlike attack of Sept. 11, apart from the loss of 2,749 lives and the twin towers, and the amount of reconstruction that has unfolded in 34 months. This first phase of rebuilding may turn out to have been the easier part.
 Gov. George E. Pataki has gone to great lengths to identify himself personally with the rebuilding of the trade center, while the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has kept itself at some distance. The mayor's office is far more closely identified with an ambitious and controversial plan to redevelop the far West Side as a higher-density commercial, residential and entertainment quarter, an effort that is certain to affect the prospects of Lower Manhattan, despite official demurrers.
 Larry A. Silverstein of Silverstein Properties controls the development rights to all the office buildings on the trade center site. But after losing several rounds in a legal battle with his insurers, he lacks the insurance proceeds to pay for much more than the construction of the Freedom Tower. State officials continue to support him publicly, but are preparing themselves, as one said last May, ''for any eventuality.''
 Question marks hang over nearby properties, too, most notably the damaged and unoccupied Fiterman Hall of the Borough of Manhattan Community College, whose fate is the subject of a stalemate among city and state officials that may be settled soon.
 A resolution could not come soon enough for Antonio Perez, the college president. ''It's so disheartening,'' he said last week. ''I look out my window every day and I see the same building I saw at 6 o'clock on Sept. 11, 2001. All that's missing is the smoke.''

HEADLINE: A Good Deed, and an Eviction Notice

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
DOLORES KAPEN'S suggestion that her roommate inquire about renting the apartment next door seems like proof that no good deed goes unpunished.
 Mrs. Kapen, 84, has lived in her rent-stabilized two-bedroom apartment in a co-op building at 18 West 70th Street since 1969. And since the early 80's, after her children moved out, she has rented that extra room to a series of roommates. 
 Then, in December 2000, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal revised the Rent Stabilization Code, limiting the amount a rent-stabilized tenant can charge a roommate to a proportionate share of the rent. 
 Mrs. Kapen's monthly rent is $806. Under what is called a Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption, however, she pays only $585, with her landlord receiving a tax abatement. Mrs. Kapen's monthly income, mostly from Social Security, is $659. The young man renting that bedroom paid her $550 a month.
 But he needed more space. And figuring she would have little difficulty finding a new roommate, Mrs. Kapen told him about the sublet available next door. ''I said, 'Why don't you look into that one?' and I gave him the landlord's number,'' she said. ''The landlord asked, 'How much do you pay Mrs. Kapen?' And he told him.'' 
 In November 2001, the co-op's sponsor, Lepow Associates, began eviction proceedings. ''Our client's contention,'' said Mitchell H. Kossoff, a senior partner at Kossoff Alper & Unger, which represents Lepow Associates, ''is that Mrs. Kapen took advantage of the artificially low rent afforded by rent stabilization by subletting 50 percent or less of her apartment to a series of individuals over a prolonged period at rents which sometimes equaled those sums she was obligated to pay to the landlord.''
 Mrs. Kapen's lawyer, Jacqueline Burger of Legal Services for New York, which represents poor people in civil cases, contended that her client ''was not overcharging because she provided other services.''
 Mrs. Kapen said: ''I paid the whole renter's insurance. I paid to clean the place; the soaps, anything that broke, a bulb. So I wasn't making money.'' 
 Mr. Kossoff countered that such claims are ''fairly commonplace when tenants are tasked with the burden of proving that they are not engaging in impermissible profiteering.''
 The position of the state housing division is that only a roommate can claim an overcharge. But in two court rulings -- Ram 1 v. Mazzola and the BLF Realty Holding Corporation v. Kasher -- landlords have been allowed to seek eviction of tenants for overcharging roommates. In the first case, the roommate paid $2,200 when the rent was $1,847. In the other, a loft tenant was charging three times the $551 rent.
 Courts have since carved out exceptions. In 719 West 180th Street v. Gonzalez, the court ruled that the tenant could charge more than the proportionate share to cover additional services. And in L.E.S.P.M.H.A. Inc. v. Nunez, and 365 West End v. Kristaponis, the courts found that overcharging a roommate is a curable violation, meaning that if the tenant refunds the overcharge the tenant cannot be evicted.
 Even if one assumed that her client was overcharging, Ms. Burger contended: ''The landlord should not be able to evict, because there was no harm to the landlord. The purpose of rent stabilization is to preserve affordable housing. If she's evicted, he will be able to sell this apartment.''
 However, Mr. Kossoff said: ''It's true that if she is ousted the landlord stands to make more money. But I'm not going to apologize for that because renting and selling real estate in New York is a business.'' 
 ''My client is not unmindful that Mrs. Kapen is on in years,'' Mr. Kossoff continued, ''and I don't think this woman has enough to pay the rent herself without engaging in this type of activity. As a result, we offered to relocate her to premises she can afford -- on 88th between Fifth and Madison, not a bad address.''
 Mrs. Kapen turned down the offer. And, after preliminary court proceedings, the parties have resumed negotiations. The young man has since moved out -- not to the apartment next door -- and a new roommate has moved in.
 ''I haven't done anything wrong,'' Mrs. Kapen said. ''My friends are here. This is my home; I want it to be that forever.''
 ''I haven't had a good night's sleep since this started,'' she added. ''My blood pressure went up, so I'm on two pills now instead of just one. I keep thinking and hoping and wondering and wanting it to go away.''

HEADLINE: Death Toll Rises to Six After Workplace Shooting

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Kan., July 3 

 BODY:
A sixth man died early Saturday of wounds suffered during a rampage here on Friday at a meatpacking plant, where an employee opened fire with two handguns he had smuggled into work. Police officials identified the victim as Ardell Edwards, 55, a production line worker from Grandview, Mo. 
 The police said they still were not sure about the motive of the gunman, Elijah Brown, 21, who killed himself, except to say that he had acted with apparent deliberation in choosing his victims, some of whom he had just been sitting down with for an employee meeting.
 ''He knew exactly what he was doing,'' Kansas City's police chief, Ronald Miller, said at a news conference outside the ConAgra Foods plant where Mr. Brown and the victims all worked second shift on the manufacturing line, making products like bologna and braunschweiger. 
 Chief Miller said that two other men wounded in the attack were expected to survive, and that the investigation was continuing. 
 ''It's a complex situation,'' he told reporters. Then, in the next breath, Chief Miller seemingly reversed himself. ''It's really a pretty straightforward situation,'' he said.
 Interviews with employees, family members of the victims and people familiar with the stresses, strains and singular workplace quirks of the industrial meat-processing economy here in eastern Kansas said much the same thing: What happened at ConAgra is a shocking mystery -- ultimately unsolvable, perhaps, because Mr. Brown is not alive to answer for his crimes -- but on another level, it hardly seems a mystery at all, after other such recent incidents in the American workplace. 
 One witness said he believed Mr. Brown had had a confrontation of some sort with co-workers earlier this week. Another said he believed Mr. Brown had been teased or taunted. Police investigators and company officials declined to say what the employee meeting had been about that occurred just before Mr. Brown's attack.
 A spokeswoman for ConAgra, Julie DeYoung, said at Saturday's news conference that the company would not comment on its security procedures or how the guns got into the plant, nor would she say whether there were any disciplinary or grievance issues involving Mr. Brown. She said he had been hired last September as a manufacturing line worker, laid off earlier this year because of a production slowdown and rehired six weeks ago.
 The police also were not sure whether it was coincidence or not that three of the dead men were related. Lonnie Ellenberg, 46, and Travis Nelson, 23, both of Kansas City, and Mr. Edwards, the man who died early Saturday, were all part of an extended family, said Col. Sam Breshears, a deputy police chief.
 Colonel Breshears said one of the dead men was a Mexican citizen whose name would not be released until his family could be located. He identified the other victim as Leonardo Rodriquez, 49, also of Kansas City. Two other wounded men are expected to survive, Colonel Breshears said.
 People who work in the meatpacking industry here and in the auxiliary niche businesses that serve the industry, from warehousing to refrigerated shipping, said the environment of a meat factory is probably an important element in explaining what happened at the plant. The work is high-speed and high-pressure, they said, which often means a person cannot spare too much attention noticing whether a co-worker who is acting suspiciously or not. Lose focus, the workers said, and you risk getting behind on the line.
 ''It's a very stressful environment,'' said Eleazar DeLeon, 39, who left meat manufacturing after a few years and now works for a meat shipping and distribution company. Mr. DeLeon works nights at his job and had stopped for breakfast after work at a diner around the corner from the ConAgra plant. ''Any processing plant is repetitive line work,'' he added. ''It's very hard.''
 Employees at ConAgra said the bulky coats that everyone wears, both for warmth in the 40-degree refrigerator chill of the factory and for identification -- production side workers at ConAgra wear blue coats, packaging side workers wear white -- would also make it easy to conceal a weapon once it was on the factory floor. Many people also carry lunch boxes and coolers into the plant that have not routinely been searched in the past, one employee said.
 Edna Perkins is a career meat-processing worker, with 28 years on the line. She was one of the 160 or so people at the plant on Friday, and was also related to Mr. Ellenberg, Mr. Nelson and Mr. Edwards, though she described the men as being from ''another side of the family.''
 Just after 5 p.m., Mrs. Perkins said, she was at her job as usual -- she's a white-coated ''boxer'' on the packaging side, assigned the task of packing prepared meat for shipping -- when she saw people running above her on the catwalk that extends out over the production floor. A few seconds later a man walked by above her, bleeding. 
 ''My first thought was that they'd had a mechanical accident,'' she said. Then everyone started running and next thing she knew she was outside the plant in the parking lot. Interviewed by telephone Saturday morning from her home, Mrs. Perkins said she had been unable to sleep all night.
 On Saturday, the plant was closed, sealed by police barricades on the driveway, and the ConAgra spokeswoman, Ms. DeYoung, said she did not know yet when it would reopen. Counseling sessions were being offered on Saturday for employees.
 The shooting followed by a year and a day an attack in which a manufacturing plant employee in Jefferson City, Mo., killed three people and then himself. 
 Meat industry work has deep roots in Kansas City, where a nexus of railroads and ranching combined to build a culture of stockyards and packing plants beginning in the late 1800's.
 The industry has declined significantly over the last 50 years, but remains alive in the neighborhoods like Amourdale, named for the meat company, and in factories like ConAgra. In recent years, workers here say, the plants have also increasingly become the province of immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries. 
 Even on Saturday as the ConAgra plant sat silent and employees mourned, the city's culture of heavy trucking, rail and agriculture continued. As Chief Miller and other officials spoke at the news conference, reporters repeatedly had to lean in to hear, the speakers forced to shout, as another tractor-trailer rumbled by the factory door.

HEADLINE: First, Get a Green Card. Next, Hire a Publicist.

BYLINE: By Gary Shteyngart. 
Gary Shteyngart is the author of ''The Russian Debutante's Handbook,'' a novel.

 BODY:
Lately I haven't been a good immigrant. I can't get myself to work an 80-hour week. I won't walk 20 blocks to save a subway fare. And I don't have that crazed, adrenaline-driven certainty that life will soon get better for me or mine. Maybe it's the gloomy times we live in. Maybe it's the economy. Maybe it's the war. But most likely it's that I'm sated -- the young immigrant's hunger and worries are gone. I'm not fat and doughy just yet, but my midriff looks, to quote an old friend, ''prosperous.''
 Want and fear drive America: the want of security, dignity and wild affluence, the fear of coming up short on all counts, the fear of extinction in an unforgiving market economy that rewards only the tireless and the unblinking. ''Remember the lesson of the . . . dodo bird,'' Monette Adeva Maglaya cautions the newcomer in her remarkable new book, THE COMPLETE SUCCESS GUIDE FOR THE IMMIGRANT LIFE: How to Survive, How to Thrive, How to Be Fully Alive (PDI Books, paper, $19.95). ''One must learn to adapt or else, perish.'' 
 I say Maglaya's book is ''remarkable'' not because it is a compendium of bizarre clip art, well-worn inspirational cliches, practical advice and religious hoo-ha, all of which it is, but because few books have come closer to telling me what it means to be an immigrant in America today. And if Maglaya is to be believed, it means living in a land of turbo-Darwinism that would shock the likes of Huck Finn and Augie March, a landscape of hucksters and dreamers, of work-at-home schemes, fake children's modeling contests and rampant identity fraud. It means, for the most part, living in Southern California amid tribes of Cambodian doughnut tycoons and Chinese laundry empires. It means believing in God (and preferably Jesus Christ), and making him (them) a part of everything you do. Religious, resourceful, highly flexible and yet essentially conservative, the immigrant is the most reliably American of all Americans, the indispensable citizen, the bedrock of the American dream with all its tainted pleasures and millennial lunacies.
 That said, the face of immigration, or at least the face of immigration guidebooks, is unrecognizable to me today. When my family came to the United States from the Soviet Union around 1980, we were given a slim instructional volume from a resettlement agency. Aimed squarely at the Soviet immigrant, the book stressed the prodigious use of deodorant and the need to grin painfully whenever an American was present (''smell-'n'-smile'' is how I committed this advice to memory). 
 As far as Maglaya is concerned, the modern superimmigrant has no need for such obvious instruction. Instead, he should gain quick proficiency with MapQuest and Google. Once these are mastered there are ''very strong arguments'' in favor of learning English, ''apart from the usual benefit of being able to read road signs.'' With English and the yield sign under his belt, the immigrant faces the quandary of finding a good house servant. Watch out, Maglaya warns, for they don't come cheap in this country. Immigrants who have had ''domestic help to do things for them'' will be ''in for a shock.'' Now that the tempest-tossed refugee has secured the services of a reputable manservant, it is time to find a suitable activity to occupy his time. ''Should he go into business? Should he pursue the arts?'' These are all difficult decisions to make for someone who has just sneaked across the Rio Grande, but if one finally settles on entrepreneurship it is often helpful to ''get a professional spokesperson or a mascot.'' You know, to help out with publicity.
 The author, who came to the United States in the 1980's from the Philippines with a master's degree in communications, leaves us with a list of recommended books, including Pat Buchanan's ''Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization'' and other examples of ''the boat is full'' philosophy. Maglaya's assessment of the way immigrant groups perceive and treat other immigrant groups is yet another remarkable aspect of this book. We learn, for example, that ''Jews and Armenians have long histories of being involved in business in every area around the world where they settle,'' while Koreans have ''a somewhat hardy resistance to acculturation.'' Mexicans, despite being abundant in the author's adopted Southern California, are suspiciously absent from the list of enterprising immigrant groups. Possibly they have little of value to impart to Maglaya's ''bright, bushy-tailed eager beaver of a newcomer.'' The world rightfully looks to America as the nation most welcoming to immigrants -- and yet what many highly educated immigrants do not know, or do not care to know, about one another's struggles could fill a book. This one, for instance.
 But I couldn't help learning from Maglaya. She has compiled so many facts about living in America that by the end of this book I felt genuinely indebted to her. Were you aware, just for example, that disreputable modeling schools are a big draw because ''one of the hot buttons among immigrant parents is their dreams of success for their children''? Or that the policy of the United States is not to admit ''terrorists, Nazis and people likely to become dependent on welfare,'' possibly in that order? Or that you can stop credit bureaus from selling your name by calling 1-888-5OPT-OUT? Or that ''when pumping gas,'' you should ''prefer to do it yourself . . . rather than give your card to the attendant,'' who can ''steal your number at random''? 
 After learning the difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy and the importance of stuffing every piece of financial mail into a good paper shredder, I felt more ready than ever to participate in our nation's rich economic life. Also, I felt scared -- scared like an immigrant; scared that in this capricious land everything I have worked for could be taken away with the click of a computer mouse or by my enrollment in the wrong modeling school. 
 Between meditations on immigrant fear and immigrant striving, the author keeps our spirits up with inspirational quotations from the likes of Shakespeare (''Rest, rest, perturbed spirit'') and Jenny Craig (''Self-love is the only weight-loss aid that really works in the long run''). There are also some exquisitely strange, naive, almost moving, illustrations -- including a homemade collage of Jesus floating above the earth. For Maglaya, being an immigrant means finding solace in religion. There are few paragraphs devoted to an immigrant's natural propensity toward ''homesickness, loneliness and despair,'' the debilitating feelings that crushed many members of my parents' immigrant generation, but lots of talk about craning one's neck toward Eternity. ''Look heavenward,'' the author instructs us. ''Put God first in your life and everything falls into place.'' ''Coming to America may have been part of God's Grand Design in order for you'' to fulfill your purpose. And for the harried, multitasking immigrant, this advice: ''Jesus Christ was stressed too.'' 
 Along with the Father and the Son, there is a worship of Country. At a time when most of the world is learning to despise us, the immigrant's faith in America's promise remains staggering and, to many, inspiring. Why else would millions of people regularly give up their mother tongue, their childhood friends, their elderly parents, their native hills and mesas and, of course, their cooks, chauffeurs and houseboys to come here? Maglaya puts it all into perspective: ''Barring unforeseen catastrophic circumstances induced by humans and extremely rare cosmic collisions like a comet or asteroid scoring a direct fatal hit on earth . . . America will continue to hold a prime position in world geopolitics for some time.'' 
 I don't know if she's right on that one. But I am going to get that paper shredder.

HEADLINE: In a Galaxy of Hotel Ratings, Are 5 Stars Enough?

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
AT the Burj Al Arab hotel, housed in a glass skyscraper molded like a billowing sail that soars over the Persian Gulf in Dubai, the cheapest room goes for $666 a night, and a standard two-bedroom suite costs $2,231. It is beyond dispute that this ranks among the world's great hotels.
 But is the Burj Al Arab merely in the upper tier of ''five star'' hotels -- a designation that has long been the standard for the world's best? No: according to the hotel and many travel writers, it is the world's first seven-star hotel.
 It is not alone in leaping into new galaxies of self-definition. As other lodging companies rush to establish their highest-level brands in cities and resort areas the world over, scores of luxury hotels now claim six-star status. 
 What is going on here? Has grade inflation come to hotel rating scales? 
 Well, yes -- but for good reason, argues David Beer, a founder of Brennan Beer Gorman Architects, a company that has designed top luxury hotels, including the Peninsula in Bangkok. There has been so much expansion and improvement in the five-star category in the last decade, he said, that there is a need to add an extra star to describe the creme de la creme. (Mr. Beer has a list of 11 hotels worldwide that he says meet this standard, and the Burj Al Arab is not on it.)
 ''At hotels in this country and around the world, a five-star rating may encompass anything from a very nice Sofitel or a very good Westin to the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong or the Gritti Palace in Venice, and they really aren't the same,'' he said, citing two hotels he believes deserve six-star status.
 Which brings up the question: Who, exactly, doles out these stars? Whether used to describe a basic motel beside a highway or a luxurious resort, the rankings confuse many travelers. That is mostly because there are no clear standards, and there is no definitive source.
 The Mobil and AAA travel guides, and the Michelin Red Guides in Europe, are well respected, though they do have detractors. But beyond those lies a vast gray area, where -- especially in Europe -- the use of stars can be so indiscriminate as to be nearly meaningless. 
 The best advice for travelers is to treat all ratings with skepticism and to check for the specific amenities a hotel offers. And remember that high price does not automatically mean high quality. 
 So what might six stars mean, if the universe can stretch that far? In Mr. Beer's estimation, the designation should go to hotels that maintain ''champion status,'' with exquisite personal service, unparalleled location and genteel exclusivity. Knocking elbows with fashionable locals in a flashy lobby bar is not something one does at a six-star hotel, he said. Though price is not the defining factor, he added, ''these are hotels that are basically for the guests who are paying $700 or $800 a night, which is a lot different from luxury five-star hotels with lots of shops in the lobby and outsiders coming in and weddings being held on the staircase.''
 SOME traditional luxury hoteliers resist ratings supersizing. 
 ''I wouldn't use the term 'six-star hotel' myself,'' said Ricci Obertelli, the global development director of the Dorchester Hotel Group, whose luxury properties include the Dorchester in London, the Beverly Hills Hotel in California and the Hotel Meurice in Paris.
 But Mr. Obertelli knows a six-star hotel when he sees one. ''For example, if you were a wealthy entertainer and you came to the Dorchester in London,'' he said, ''and let's say you just finished your show and you wanted to have a five-course meal at two in the morning, you'd expect a chef to be there to prepare it. And that expectation would be met.'' 
 The global hotel industry is dominated by about 10 international chains, most of which have developed brands that fit into four or five categories, roughly corresponding to star ratings. A typical one-star chain is Motel 6, owned by Accor Hotels, which also has the five-star Sofitel brand. A big player in the crowded three-star niche is Courtyard by Marriott, from Marriott International, which also owns the five-star Ritz-Carlton chain.
 Because corporate travel reimbursement policies often spell out the price level and even the hotel brands an employee may use, many frequent business travelers can readily rank domestic hotels on the five-tiered scale. But some ranking systems claim to be far more discriminating. 
 The two major ones in the United States are the Mobil Travel Guides, which award stars, and the AAA travel guides, which award diamonds. Ratings in these guides, which promote themselves largely to leisure travelers, are based on evaluations by teams of inspectors who are armed with detailed checklists when they visit hotels. 
 To earn three stars from a Mobil inspector, for example, a hotel needs to pass muster on a long list of requirements -- from ''complete room service'' and two phones to ''framed artwork or interesting architectural features in room.''
 In its ratings for 2004, Mobil gives five stars to only 30 of the estimated 50,000 hotels in the United States. AAA awards five diamonds to only 68 hotels domestically. 
 Both Mobil and AAA say their strict grading is in stark contrast to what Mobil calls the ''wildly fluctuating'' and ''suspect'' galaxies of stars awarded elsewhere, especially on Internet travel sites that rank hotels while at the same time selling their rooms.
 Peter Greenberg, the author of ''Hotel Secrets From the Travel Detective'' (Villard), recommends taking all guides with a grain of salt. ''They're guidebooks, not bibles,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who is the travel editor for ''Today'' on NBC. For hoteliers, he said, they are important ''partly because getting a good rating allows them to justify a higher rate.'' 
 ''It's sort of like the Academy Awards,'' he added. ''When you get the Oscar, your rate just went up.'' 
 Travelers abroad, especially in Europe, are also often confused by hotel ratings. In some countries, hotels are given star ratings by government-affiliated tourist agencies, which rely mostly on simple evaluation of physical property -- is the bathroom in the room or down the hall? -- and room rates. ''The assessment is based exclusively on objective criteria. Individual evaluations are emotional and subjective,'' the German Hotel and Restaurant Association acknowledges on its Web site. 
 MR. GREENBERG said that ''overseas, a star rating can represent a government designation that signifies, for tax reasons, what a hotel is charging.''
 ''A five-star hotel can simply mean you're staying in the most expensive hotel in town,'' he added. ''It doesn't necessarily mean you're staying at a great hotel.''
 Of course, a well-informed travel agent with many industry sources and lots of personal experience can provide good hotel evaluations. 
 Yet even top travel agents say they are sometimes bewildered by the stars. ''Really, you have to know the hotel, because the ratings systems are really all over the lot,'' said Blake Fleetwood, president of Planetarium Travels in New York. 
 He did offer a general rule of thumb about the relationship between price and rating at the highest levels: ''It's about $100 a star,'' he said.

Starstruck
Assigning hotel star ratings can be highly subjective. But some travel professionals agree on certain criteria, and on some types of chain hotels that generally fall into each tier.

HEADLINE: A Picture Is Worth 216 Newspaper Articles

 BODY:
IN 1988, Gerhard Richter created one of the most riveting works of modern political art with a series of paintings about the German terrorist group known as the Baader-Meinhof gang. The paintings were blurry deadpan adaptations of black-and-white snapshots, whose ambiguities fueled the ongoing debates about the nation's history and ambitions. Now Mr. Richter, 72 and perhaps the most influential painter in the world, has returned to a political theme with ''War Cut.'' Typically indirect and multilayered, it takes the form of an illustrated book. 
 The topic is the war in Iraq. Again, ambiguity is a theme, but unlike his earlier political work, the result is colorful and abstract. The book consists of collages: 216 photographic details of Mr. Richter's 1987 painting ''No. 648-2,'' accompanied by an equal number of newspaper articles from The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on March 20 and 21, 2003, the beginning days of the war. The result links two normally unrelated mediums, creating a hybrid commentary that can be seen as a kind of absurd historical novel. 
 ''War Cut'' was published by Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther Konig. The following interview was done in German in April at Mr. Richter's Cologne studio by Jan Thorn-Prikker, a freelance critic and the editor of Kulturjournal, a cultural magazine of the Goethe Institute in Munich. The translation is by Tim Nevill.

JAN THORN-PRIKKER -- Can you say something about the abstract painting that served as a starting point for ''War Cut''?

GERHARD RICHTER -- That picture was done long ago, in the 1980's, so the Iraq War wasn't involved. I was slightly surprised when the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris bought the picture; there are more attractive works, not so rough and harsh. But about two years ago I took close-ups of the work in the museum without knowing what I might use them for. When the war started, I heard all these conflicting opinions. I thought newspaper reports were salutary -- impotent and ineffectual as everything else in the face of catastrophe -- but their plain presentation of the facts consoled me.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Do you include all the articles published about the Iraq War in the paper on those first two days, or did you leave out some?

RICHTER -- I left out some. My layout determined what I included or didn't include. It was not something I had specifically in mind before I started. I wanted to vary the layout, to move from empty to full and back again. I had a general plan, a sense of balance. But the specific arrangement evolved as I worked on it, until at some stage there were 324 pages. I read most of the texts only after I placed them with the pictures. I read them as literature, which was very pleasing. I was not looking for straightforward narrative, which is maybe also why I chose that particular abstract painting. Some of my other abstract pictures are less ambiguous. Their atmosphere is either very agitated or tranquil or almost storylike in their narrative flow, so that they seem nearly representational or surreal. This picture had none of that. It was close to being uncommunicative, which I don't mean negatively.

THORN-PRIKKER -- The Iraq war was a television war. Why did you reject using those images?

RICHTER -- ''War Cut'' only very indirectly involves reality. Even the facts in the newspaper articles somehow become unrealistic in this context. I removed the headlines and bylines from the articles. I respect the writers. But I like to think that maybe by removing the headlines I contributed toward having these texts read as literature. It would be like taking a newspaper photo and putting it in a museum as an oil painting, which is I suppose what I did with Baader-Meinhof.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Then would you say that ''War Cut'' was also a kind of plea: ''Look closely at these texts; they talk about your world''?

RICHTER -- Yes, but also I mean that the texts now survive longer than the single day when they were in the newspaper.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Why did you use The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung?

RICHTER -- Because I have been reading it for 40 years.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Why March 20 and 21, 2003?

RICHTER -- The outbreak of war is the date that people remember. Just like the start of Hitler's war on Sept. 1, 1939. On the other hand, it seems to me that March 20-21 didn't have an impact comparable to, say, Sept. 11, 2001.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Did you order the texts chronologically?

RICHTER -- No, only approximately. After all, I had this strict framework where every page had fixed arrangements and magnitudes. But that still left sufficient latitude for preferences and specific confrontations with images, and for a certain breadth of themes. The real gift for me was the fact that chance could bring about wonderful combinations.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Could you say something about the unusual form of ''War Cut?''

RICHTER -- My approach to form is very simple. Whatever is real is so unlimited and unshaped that we have to summarize it. The more dramatic events are, the more important the form. That is why people marry in a church and why we need a priest for a funeral.

THORN-PRIKKER -- With ''War Cut,'' did you give these dramatic events form by putting them between book covers?

RICHTER -- The book covers and the way the material between them is treated. And the way texts and images influence one another, change their meanings, with the images changing incomparably more because they are much more open and ambiguous.

THORN-PRIKKER -- But the images and texts are placed alongside one another almost blindly.You have great trust in the chance occurrences involved in such form.

RICHTER -- Form is all we have to help us cope with fundamentally chaotic facts and assaults. Formulating something is a great start. I trust form, trust my feeling or capacity to find the right form for something. Even if that is only by being well organized. That too is form.
 As for chance, consider John Cage. His musical compositions were never a total appropriation of a chance acoustic event. He devised an ingenious system to build structures from dumb abundance. And he devoted even more skill to giving form to this succession of sounds. That is the absolute opposite of chance, nature and rubbish. 

THORN-PRIKKER -- When people hear you say that form is the most important aspect, that could easily be understood as meaning that you are unconcerned about the politics or the human cost of the war.

RICHTER -- No, no. In this case the facts are so overpowering, the contents so crucial, the form is also all the more significant. We need it simply to be able to deal with the subject matter.

THORN-PRIKKER -- How did you decide how to arrange the texts with the photographs?

RICHTER -- My method was to attach a number of texts to a number of images without having to think about whether something would be better positioned to the left or the right, above or below. Or whether a specific image fit together with a particular text or not. Most did fit together, and only a few inappropriate or banal conjunctions had to be changed. The images are always arranged in accordance with -- what shall I call it: aesthetic criteria? I placed these images so that a connection develops in terms of colors, structures and other characteristics. It all starts somewhat casually. It was like putting together a story or a film, which begins somehow or other, has tranquil and wild, nasty and fantastic passages, and then once again fades away, ending in white. A dream.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Once you put a text alongside an image, both lose their independence. It immediately establishes a relationship.

RICHTER -- Some images match the cruelty and the madness described in the texts shockingly well. And others can even serve as illustrations when the texts speaks of deserts and other landscapes.

THORN-PRIKKER -- ''War Cut'' seems to show aerial photographs. Oil fields on fire. Pools of oil, blood -- things that in reality aren't depicted. Sometimes ghosts, death heads, hideous faces emerge from the images.

RICHTER -- I have nothing against that.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Your book is contradictory. As an artist's work it says, ''That's how things are. That's how the world looks.'' However the same book simultaneously says, ''That's unacceptable. Things can't continue like this.'' The book both raises a protest against the world as it is and confirms that state of affairs.

RICHTER -- Yes, that is also why I wanted to try and see this war from a completely different angle. Admonitions, protests and such are not my thing.

THORN-PRIKKER -- To what extent is ''War Cut'' an attempt at coming to grips with a war? I've met a few people who reacted to ''War Cut'' with something close to annoyance. They say that you take everything and simply throw it together -- that this is merely a simulation of sympathetic interest. They say that you could just as easily have made a collage with anything.

RICHTER -- Of course that isn't the case. Anyway, it's not possible. How could one be in this world without feeling dismayed by it? Even if one paints flowers and gingerbread.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Do you think your book involves a sense of mourning?

RICHTER -- Yes, and rage, too. Mainly rage because war is upsetting, because it demonstrates our impotence, because obviously we can't prevent it, because we cannot assess it anywhere near adequately. That becomes apparent in the many different judgments, prejudices and simplifications we hear and read. That is also why I absolutely avoided expressing an opinion, which is completely useless here and obstructs the attempt to come somewhat closer to the truth. In addition, my opinion is certainly just as wrong as that of my friends who almost all greatly simplify matters, condemning the war and grumbling about Bush in a way that is close to kitsch. That is not my way.
 I certainly don't think the war is unnecessary. Otherwise it wouldn't happen. And we are certainly far from being able to do without wars. But I did not have so much cause to mourn. Sept. 11 horrified me to a greater extent.

THORN-PRIKKER -- Does the fact that you belong to the generation that experienced World War II influence your feelings about war?

RICHTER -- Yes. Those experiences are present, like an underlying theme.

THORN-PRIKKER -- But you keep the wound fresh. Whether you mean it that way or not, that is a way of expressing sympathy.

RICHTER -- Yes, it is. But the greatest pleasure was to complete this book. Then it was fun to have produced something beautiful. I found my way back to painting. That was a new beginning after a long intermission. After all, I hadn't painted for two years. It was good to produce something like this. Something storylike, something fantastic. The absolute opposite of war.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A picture on July 4 with an article about Gerhard Richter's book ''War Cut,'' depicting his abstract painting ''No. 648-2,'' was reproduced upside down and in reverse. The corner with the concentration of orange paint should have been at the upper right, not the lower right. 

GRAPHIC: Photos: Gerhard Richter and his 1987 painting ''No. 648-2,'' which is in the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. Mr. Richter photographed the work in a series of extreme close-ups and used 216 of the resulting details for his book ''War Cut.'' (Photos by PMVP/Jean-Yves Trocaz [above]
Agence France-Presse [right])(pg. 27)
The first paragraph of the text, at left, reports on the mood at a German housing area for American troops who have left for Kuwait. The next article is about worldwide anitwar demonstrations. The text accompanies details from the painting ''No. 648-2.''
The first paragraph says that hope for a quick end to the war has given the dollar new strength against the euro. The second paragraph reports that in view of the still weak German economy and the Iraq crisis, the air travel industry appears to be in for an extremely weak year.
This is the conclusion of an article about whether American Jews influenced the Congressional debate on going to war in Iraq. The second paragraph is about sandstorms in Kuwait and the American and British troops waiting in the desert for orders.
 This passage reports that Turkey will not let American troops use Turkish soil to invade Iraq, a decision that might help its application to the European Union. Washington is angry, Europe is still skeptical and the Turkish military is gaining strength. (pg. 26)

MOST mutual funds eked out very small gains in the second quarter, but it wasn't easy. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose only 1.3 percent for the quarter, and domestic stock funds, for the most part, couldn't even manage that performance. Still, there were some standouts. 
 Managers of three strong performers among no-load funds, those that do not have sales charges, talked about their portfolios and their thoughts about the market for the rest of the year.
 The $101 million UMB Scout Small Cap fund returned 10.3 percent for the quarter. David R. Bagby, 54, the manager, said he aimed to buy ''very well-financed small companies that produced significant amounts of excess cash flow.''
 ''Ideally,'' he added, ''they are eventually acquired by bigger companies in their industry.''
 Indeed, all three of the fund's top-performing stocks were from companies involved in acquisitions during the second quarter. Tom Brown Inc., a natural-gas exploration and production company in Denver, was acquired in May by the EnCana Corporation, an energy company based in Calgary, Alberta, that holds natural-gas reserves in the Rocky Mountains. ''With market prices markedly higher, they saw this as a good opportunity,'' Mr. Bagby said. Shares of Tom Brown rose 27.6 percent from March 31 through May 21, when trading stopped. 
 Another holding, Isco Inc., a maker of water-testing instruments that is based in Lincoln, Neb., was acquired in June by Teledyne Technologies, the electronics and aerospace company based in Los Angeles, for $16 a share in cash. Isco shares rose 32.5 percent in the quarter until they stopped trading on June 16. ''Eight or nine companies were interested in acquiring Isco,'' Mr. Bagby said. ''Teledyne was a surprise because it's a little out of its industry.'' 
 In June, GE Energy, a supplier of power generation and energy delivery technology, based in Atlanta, signed a definitive agreement to acquire BHA Group Holdings, a company in Kansas City, Mo., that provides air-quality control products and services, for $38 a share. The transaction is expected to close in the late summer. ''GE makes turbines that produce electrical power, and this company makes the filters that are used in the turbines,'' Mr. Bagby said. ''I thought it was a perfect fit.'' Shares of BHA rose 26.2 percent in the quarter.
 Looking ahead, Mr. Bagby is optimistic about the market. ''Stocks tend to perform strongly during election years,'' he said. 

Less Tech, More Health Care
 Philip C. Fine, 54, the lead manager of the $57 million Loomis Sayles Aggressive Growth fund, calls himself a ''bottom-up stock picker'' who aims to buy rapidly growing companies. The fund returned 7.21 percent in the quarter. 
 In the last six months, Mr. Fine said, he has reduced the fund's stake in technology companies to 23 percent of assets from more than 35 percent. He used the money to raise the stake in health care companies to nearly 30 percent of the portfolio, up from the midteens. In particular, he saw opportunities in the biotechnology industry.
 One winner was OSI Pharmaceuticals in Melville, N.Y. The company announced good results in its long-term clinical trials of its cancer drug, Tarceva, which is being developed in a global alliance of OSI, Genentech and Roche. The stock rose 83.4 percent in the quarter.
 Another pharmaceutical company, ImClone Systems, rose 69 percent. It began marketing its new drug, Erbitux, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year. Sales of Erbitux, which is used to treat colorectal cancer, were ''stronger than expected,'' Mr. Fine said.
 Over all, the fund's technology stocks made money in the quarter. One big winner, up 46.7 percent, was Research in Motion, based in Waterloo, Ontario. The company develops and markets products for the mobile communications market, including the BlackBerry hand-held device. ''It's selling like hot cakes,'' Mr. Fine said of the BlackBerry, ''and demand is exceeding supply.'' 
 He also expects a strong market during the rest of 2004 because of the election, but he is less optimistic about 2005. ''I think we'll have decelerating earnings and rising interest rates,'' he said, ''and that's a tough combination.''

A Value Formula
 The $83 million ICON Materials fund was up 6.35 percent for the quarter. Its manager, Derek N. Rollingson, 32, uses what he calls a ''modified Benjamin Graham model to calculate the intrinsic value of each company'' in the 15 industries in the materials sector. Mr. Graham and David Dodd wrote ''Security Analysis,'' the 1934 classic text for value investors.
 Unlike traditional value investors, Mr. Rollingson does not focus on companies with low price-to-earnings or price-to-book multiples. 
 To pick industries in which to concentrate, he uses a valuation system, based on Mr. Graham's equation, taking into account historical earnings, projected five-year earnings, stock price volatility and bond yields. The model, run daily, creates a per-share intrinsic value for every company in each industry. 
 Right now, Mr. Rollingson sees significant value in the industries for commodity chemicals, steel, and metal and glass containers. One of the fund's winners was the Methanex Corporation, in Vancouver, British Columbia, which makes and markets methanol, a liquid commodity chemical. Its shares rose 18.4 percent in the quarter.
 The fund also made money in Owens-Illinois, in Toledo, Ohio, the maker of packaging products and glass containers. The company's shares rose 19.5 percent in the quarter.
 Another winner was Steel Dynamics Inc., based in Fort Wayne, Ind. Its shares rose 15.5 percent. ''Global demand for steel is rising,'' Mr. Rollingson said, ''and demand is particularly strong in China.''
 He says he is optimistic about the stock market, saying it is still 10 percent undervalued.
 ''We're in a good environment,'' he said, ''where we can have good G.D.P. growth with the threat of inflation stemmed by offsetting increases in productivity.''

HEADLINE: The Broadway Producer Baby

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
ARIELLE TEPPER, a buoyant young theater producer, has an office in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Times Square. She's not alone: the building has long been known as theater central, a hive of suites where ideas are hatched, partnerships forged, contracts signed, legends born. In 1991, just after her freshman year at Syracuse University, she was working as a summer intern for the Off Broadway producer Eric Krebs, who sent her, on her first day, to deliver a package to 1501. 
 ''It was when Times Square was still pretty scary,'' she said a month ago in her cluttered office, where she works with a staff of four. ''But when I got to 1501, I saw this beautiful gold entrance in the middle of this crummy, crummy area, and I walk inside and see all the marble and these old elevators. I mean, it's just the coolest building ever. And I look at the names on the directory and I think, 'Oh, my God, everybody is here, this is really, really cool!' And I go home that night and my father says, 'How was your first day?' I said, 'Dad, it was like the coolest thing, I was a messenger.' And he's thinking, like, 'Great, you were a messenger.' And I said: 'No, but I went to this building, 1501 Broadway, and it was so cool. Everyone's there.' And he starts laughing. And I said, 'I don't know why you're making fun of me.' And he said: 'No, no, no, Ari. You own 1501 Broadway.' ''
 Thirteen years later, Ms. Tepper is still armed with the romantic notions of a stage-door Annie, the energy of youth and, not incidentally, a considerable fortune derived from the real estate empire of her maternal grandfather, Philip Levin, who died in 1971, the year before Ms. Tepper was born. In 2001, Ms. Tepper inherited a third of the family real estate portfolio, which Crain's New York recently estimated at $1 billion. Ms. Tepper has used part of her share to make herself into an eager new player in the treacherous world of theatrical producing.
 For instance, a month ago, Ms. Tepper was just back from a weekend in Reykjavik. She had gone to see an acrobatic rendition of ''Romeo and Juliet'' by a young Icelandic company, Vesturport, and she had returned more effervescent, if that's possible, than usual. The weekend, she said, using one of her favorite superlatives yet again, was ''the coolest thing ever.''
 In fact, Ms. Tepper, who is 31 and whose Valley girl lingo and cheerleader spirit make her seem even younger, liked what she saw so much that she has decided to transfer the Reykjavik ''R&J'' to Off Broadway. With its gymnastic staging and rock 'n' roll aesthetic, it could, she hopes, inherit the audiences at the Daryl Roth theater off Union Square, where the chaotic novelty show she had a hand in producing, ''De La Guarda,'' will close in September after more than six years.
 She also had meetings later that week to discuss advertising and marketing of the Broadway revivals of ''Jumpers'' and ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' two plays whose current incarnations she (along with many other contributors) helped finance. (Both productions are closing next Sunday, ''Jumpers'' prematurely, at a loss, and ''Raisin'' having recouped its costs.)
 None of this, however, was at the center of Ms. Tepper's attention. Rather, she was consumed by frantic preparations for the Summer Play Festival, a showcase for 18 previously unstaged shows -- 16 plays and two musicals -- that opens tomorrow and runs through Aug. 1 at the five-theater complex at Theater Row Theaters on West 42nd Street. Ms. Tepper is producing and financing it herself at a cost of $1 million.
 Though a commercial venture, it's an unusual enterprise, an almost philanthropic gesture that only a do-gooder rich kid could even attempt. It also represents Ms. Tepper's biggest investment in the theater thus far, not only financially but also in terms of control; her previous projects have largely been in partnership with other, more experienced hands.
 But perhaps most significant for her, the festival is an emotional investment as well; Ms. Tepper had something of the sort in mind for years as a tribute to her mother, Susan, who died of cancer in 1991. Her mother, she said, was a painter who believed that young artists need and deserve the nourishment that the affluent can provide. Ms. Tepper said she hoped she had a long life of philanthropy ahead of her, but now she was spending her energy and money on the theater -- ''instead of, like, curing cancer'' -- because of the four years she watched her mother living with a death sentence. ''She knew she was going to die, and it was four years of trying to live happily when you knew it was coming to an end. She lived her life doing everything she wanted to do, and her big thing was helping younger artists. Theater is what I love. It's made me very happy in my life.''
 Unlike other festivals in New York this summer -- for example, the Midtown International Theater Festival this month and the New York International Fringe Festival in August -- which choose the productions, Ms. Tepper's festival is creating them. Each play has been allotted a budget of $10,000 and each musical $15,000, money for actors and scenery. The writers, for the most part, chose their own directors, but on that Monday afternoon a month ago, Ms. Tepper and her associate producer, Rachel Neuberger, were interviewing volunteer producers -- mostly young people who work in the offices of Broadway producers and want the experience -- to oversee the individual plays.
 The plays were selected from about 1,000 submissions, Ms. Tepper said, the 50 finalists narrowed down by a panel that included the librettist John Weidman and the directors Harold Prince and Mr. Prince's daughter, Daisy, all of whom Ms. Tepper has worked with as a producer and investor.
 The writers range in age from early 20's to mid-40's and they aren't exactly novices. Some, like Anne Garcia-Romero, whose play ''Earthquake Chica'' will be presented at the festival; Kelly Stuart, whose new play is called ''Mayhem''; and Octavio Solis (''El Paso Blue'') have had productions and commissions at regional theaters throughout the country. Elise Thoron, who wrote the book for one of the two musicals, ''Prozak & the Platypus'' (the music is by Jill Sobule, the singer and composer of the pop hits ''I Kissed a Girl'' and ''Supermodel''), is also the author of the 2001 musical play ''Charlotte: Life? Or Theater?,'' about the artist Charlotte Salomon, who died in Auschwitz. John Bucchino, whose revue, ''It's Only Life,'' is the other festival musical, was a contributor to ''3hree,'' the trio of mini-musicals directed by Mr. Prince at the Prince Music Theater in Philadelphia in 2000. Ten of the festival writers are members of the collective New Dramatists that offers grants and workspace to playwrights, and several teach at universities. (A list and synopsis of the plays is on the festival Web site, www.spfnyc.com.)
 Though Ms. Tepper acknowledges that, until last week when she began advertising, advance sales were slow, she is counting on word of mouth and television advertising -- WNBC television, as one of the sponsors, is providing air time -- to draw walk-up buyers for the single-price $10 tickets. Other corporate sponsors are Smart Car and Millennium Hotels. Ms. Tepper is gambling that the festival will garner enough attention this summer that corporations will be interested in covering its costs in the future. She is not taking a right of first refusal -- or any other rights -- to the plays; if she did, she said, why would other producers come to see them?
 ''Here's the deal,'' Ms. Tepper said a month ago. ''I'll pay for it this year. I never want to pay for it again. This year I don't want money. My goal is that these writers have a future.'' Last week, she amended that; she'll pay for it again if she has to.
 Ms. Tepper has been working in the theater since the summer she discovered 1501 Broadway, and even those who consider her a spoiled rich girl concede she has been paying her dues. In fact, she is the youngest and probably the perkiest example of an increasingly dominant species of theatrical life: the producer-slash-angel investor, a category that includes Chase Mishkin (''Dirty Blonde,'' ''Match,'' ''Urban Cowboy,'' ''Prymate'') and Daryl Roth (''The Goat,'' ''Anna in the Tropics,'' ''Bea Arthur on Broadway''), among many others. The theater has always relied, to some extent, on wealthy individuals willing to risk small fortunes on precarious theatrical projects. But in the past these investors tended to be content as near-silent partners, with limited influence on the creative development of the show.
 Producers were a separate category: they took responsibility for the creative and business aspects of a production, but they were not necessarily wealthy themselves. (Hence Max Bialystock's famous two producing tenets: never put your own money in a show and never put your own money in a show.)
 But today the two categories are merging. ''It used to be there were producers and there were angels,'' said Jack Tantleff, who heads (with Peter Franklin) the theater department at the William Morris Agency, referring to investors who gave their money to producers and got out of the way. ''Now the angels are the producers.''
 The reason is largely economic. These days the cost of any show, especially on Broadway, has made fund-raising an enormous burden. So a producing community has evolved that -- aside from Disney, with its huge corporate resources -- now often forges alliances to share the economic burden, which is one reason that more names -- 20 in the case of ''Caroline, or Change'' -- now appear above a show's title. Producers have also become less willing to help create by working with writers, composers and directors to develop material. Instead, they prefer to find shows that have been well-received elsewhere and transfer them, or to package well-known titles and stars, which is why Broadway is dominated by revivals.
 ''It's too facile to say that all the great producers are gone,'' said John Breglio, a leading theatrical lawyer with dozens of clients on and off Broadway. ''Having decades of experience still counts for something. But now the entry to producing seems to be a checkbook.''
 For many theater professionals, this is change for the worse. ''They want to come to ad meetings, they want to come to the auditions, they want to be able to give notes out of town,'' said John Barlow of Barlow-Hartman, who has been a Broadway publicist for the last 15 years. ''Most shows have one or two big investors like that. So any good idea is pureed down to a fare thee well, and a singular vision cannot persevere because of what needs to be done in the interest of compromise. In the end, there's an overall lack of inspiration, and it trickles down. Critics feel it. Audiences feel it.''
 This transformation has been taking place over the last two decades, at the same time that Arielle Tepper was finding in theater an escape from the unhappiness caused by her parents' divorce and her mother's battle with cancer.
 Ms. Tepper grew up in Manhattan and attended the Dalton School. Summers during college -- her degree is in lighting design -- she worked in theater offices in New York and in London, and after graduation she got a job at Alan Wasser Associates, the theatrical general managers who handled ''Miss Saigon,'' ''Cats,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''Les Miserables.'' Her first producing venture was a cabaret-style musical called ''Vices'' that she presented in Chicago.
 ''It cost $50,000, and I paid for it,'' she said. ''We got decent reviews and ran for five weeks and lost 100 percent of the money. But my father came to opening night and he said, 'You did that.' And I realized that I had. My confidence level was through the roof. I said, 'This is the coolest thing ever.' ''
 Since then, Ms. Tepper has shown a scattershot impulse in the shows she has invested in, works on Broadway as different as the widely reviled exercise in rock 'n' roll camp, ''Dance of the Vampires,'' and the widely praised literary musical ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' ''; and works Off Broadway as quiet and shrewd as Tristine Skyler's debut play ''The Moonlight Room,'' as ambitiously original as Jason Robert Brown's two-handed musical, ''The Last Five Years,'' and as raucous and in-your-face as the wordless youth-pleasing bungee-cord extravaganza, ''De La Guarda.''
 From a commercial standpoint, her choices have been dubious, but she acknowledges that she has the luxury of indulging her whims. Her first Broadway show, ''Freak,'' John Leguizamo's solo work, which she produced in 1998 with Gregory Mosher and Bill Haber, was a hit. But her investments in the musical ''A Class Act'' and in two productions directed by Mr. Prince, who recruited Ms. Tepper as a producer-investor -- Carol Burnett's play, ''Hollywood Arms,'' and Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical ''Bounce'' -- were lost.
 Asked how she chooses her shows, she gave an answer that testifies to an unformed aesthetic and the luxury of wealth. ''I think now I sort of do projects based on things I really love as well as people I want to work with,'' she said. 
 ''There have definitely been shows that have been huge mistakes,'' she added, ''that I did because I was young and inexperienced. But then there are shows like 'The Dead' and 'The Last Five Years,' which lost money but were great shows and I can't imagine not having produced them.''
 Ms. Tepper recognizes that she is still something of a novice producer. Her money has bought her a seat at the adult table, and though she has no shortage of confidence that she belongs there, she also knows she is on a learning curve.
 ''I have spent most of my time on my shows on the marketing and advertising side,'' she said. ''The creative people I've worked with -- Hal Prince, Stephen Sondheim, Carol Burnett -- these are not people where I believe I'm smarter about the directions the show should go than they are. In my conversations with them about difficulties with the show, I always, always, always present my thoughts as, 'As an audience member I feel,' as opposed to, 'As a producer I feel.' ''
 Which may make the Summer Play Festival a pivotal moment in her career, the first time that she is making a leap into creating something on her own.
 It is personal, too. What Ms. Tepper's fortune may have bought her most of all is relief from sadness. ''My mother made me promise I'd never give money to research organizations,'' she said, sitting in the temporary office of the Summer Play Festival at Theater Row Theaters. ''She didn't want to hear about a medicine that was going to be helpful in 10 years. She wanted to help people now.''

HEADLINE: A Friend Of the Parks Reappears

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

 BODY:
EVERY homeowner knows that when the budget is tight, it can be difficult to maintain a property, let alone to put in improvements that will make the place look really special.
 Taking care of Westchester County's more than 17,000 acres of public parkland poses a similar problem. The parks department does, of course, have money for basic maintenance like cutting the grass and picking up the trash. But little is available for extras like planting decorative trees, buying park benches or maintaining the gardens around memorials. 
 Hoping for more enhancements exactly like those, the Friends of Westchester County Parks, a nonprofit group, is trying to raise money from the people who use and enjoy the parks.
 ''We would love to have beautiful flowerbeds in our parks and see that they're maintained and manicured and watered,'' said Judy Matson, the chairwoman of the group. ''There are trees that need to be pruned and trails that need to be cleared and a host of various projects begging for support and attention. The group was formed to find a way to support the parks and provide the kind of enhancements that are not within the county parks' general upkeep programming.''
 The concept behind the Friends of Westchester County Parks, Ms. Matson said, is similar to that of the Central Park Conservancy, formed by New York City residents to support what in 1980 was a deteriorating park system. No one contends that the county's system is in the dire straits that inspired the beginning of the city conservancy, but the model of public support is similar, and the city and the county groups were formed around the same time. Westchester Friends, dormant for many years, became active again only recently.
 ''Our parks are over 70 years old,'' said Andrew J. Spano, the county executive. ''It forms what is considered by most to be a great park system, and just like Central Park it needs some advocacy on an ongoing basis.''
 Since the birth of Westchester's Parks Commission in 1922, the system has grown to include more than 50 parks, 6 golf courses, 5 swimming pools, 4 beaches, the Bronx River Parkway, the County Center and 3 boat-launching sites.
 It is a diverse system, ranging from Playland, the amusement park in Rye, to Muscoot, a working farm in Somers, to miles of hiking trails and acres of nature preserves. Park officials estimate that the system gets more than three million visitors a year. 
 ''Our county system is like most state park systems, in the breadth of what we have and manage,'' said Joseph A. Stout, the county parks commissioner. ''The facilities and the programs that we offer is not what you typically see on a countywide basis.''
 Mr. Stout says the park system is also atypical financially, receiving roughly 75 percent of its $42 million budget from revenue like golfing fees, concession rents and other business activities. The remaining 25 percent comes from tax dollars, which is the primary source for most municipal parks elsewhere. 
 Describing the park system as an economic force in Westchester, Mr. Stout pointed out that it is the county's largest employer of teenagers, and that it is used by tourists from outside the county who come to Playland, for example, or to the Bronx River Parkway to bicycle on Sunday. Those visitors spend money on food, gas and other local purchases. 
 Yet none of that means that the department and its staff of roughly 370 full-time employees have the resources to maintain the parks fully -- let alone improve them.
 As an example of how the Friends group could help, Mr. Stout suggested a donation earmarked for the perpetual care of a specific group of trees. Though his staff is supposed to care for millions of trees, he said, the tree crew has only three full-time members -- and they have time only for the ''bad emergency ones.'' With a Friends donation aimed at a specific site, he said, money could be used to hire a contractor to do the tree work.
 The new fund-raising effort includes radio public service announcements, as well as the distribution of brochures at park events.
 There is also the new Friends Web site, www.friendsofwestchesterparks.com,which offers membership and donation details. Donors can contribute to specific funds, like the Parks Tree Trust and Future Forests Funds, which raises money for the care and maintenance of the park system's trees.
 A donor can plant a seedling tree, or ''adopt'' a tree in memory of someone, with the use of a commemorative plaque. Memorial benches are also available. The actual tree work is done by park employees or contractors; the tree species, bench style and locations are determined with the help of the county forester.
 Donations can also be given to the Kensico Dam Plaza Enhancement Fund, to replace, as needed, the 80-year-old trees that now line the walkways.
 To involve schoolchildren in supporting the parks, the Friends group has begun a ''Pennies for Parks'' campaign, in which donation boxes and coin canisters are being placed at sites in parks and at other county locations. Third graders from the Columbus Elementary School in Thornwood were the first to take part in the program; the Friends group plans to rope in other schools in the fall.
 Saying she sought to raise $1 million over the next year, Ms. Matson said she hoped that Friends of the Park would ''help us be aware of the parks we take for granted on a daily basis.''
 ''They do need care and nurturing,'' she added, ''and we do need to keep them clean and green and growing, not just for today but for future generations.''

HEADLINE: The Brooklyn Nets

 BODY:
The idea of bringing a professional sports team to the city almost always sounds great -- and then the calculation of cost versus benefits begins. It seems a new team requires a new sports facility, and for some reason, owners of these lucrative franchises are seldom willing to build anything without enormous infusions of public money. That is one of the major concerns about the proposal to place the Jets football stadium on Manhattan's far West Side at a cost to taxpayers of $600 million. It is also an issue when it comes to the Nets and Brooklyn. While the plans to bring professional basketball to Atlantic Avenue are in many ways more attractive than the football proposal, the scale of public investment needs closer examination.
 The amount the city and state will be asked to contribute to help the developer Bruce Ratner build the arena as part of a $2.5 billion, mixed-use 21-acre complex over Brooklyn's Atlantic Yards and on adjacent land is still being negotiated. But the public may be asked to guarantee hundreds of millions of dollars in bonded debt if the government helps pay for the arena and for significant infrastructure improvements to allow construction -- including moving Long Island Rail Road tracks two blocks. The tab also could include some 3,000 new parking spaces, which will help, if only a little, to manage the influx of cars in an already-clogged corridor. 
 Both proposed sports facilities in Brooklyn and Manhattan would be built over rail yards owned by the cash-short and debt-ridden Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which should not be pressured to give away its assets. The state-run authority -- which lacks other new sources of revenue -- should demand and get a fair market price for any land and air rights the developers at either site need. 
 A study commissioned by Mr. Ratner (who is a partner of The Times in constructing its new headquarters building) shows that the government would more than get back its investment in the Brooklyn project, based on 30 years of projected new tax revenues from team salaries and new office and residential occupants, among other factors. Another study, endorsed by opponents of the development, maintains that taxpayers could lose half a billion dollars in the deal. We would like to see a third, truly independent examination.
 Local objections to the Atlantic Yards development need to be addressed, particularly concerning the thousands of additional cars and cabs that can be expected on game nights. While some residents will be dislocated and inevitably wind up feeling pushed around, the mere threat of change is not a reason to oppose the project. Neither is the use of the state powers of eminent domain, as long as the people involved are compensated fairly. Mr. Ratner seems to have been generous in buying out homeowners and moving renters. Community residents have also been promised that the development around the arena will include 4,500 housing units, half slated to go to low and moderate income earners and the elderly. To address another longstanding complaint about sports projects, Mr. Ratner says 3,000 of the 19,000 seats for Nets games at the new Frank Gehry-designed arena will be sold at levels many neighborhood residents could afford -- around $15. 
 A basketball arena near downtown Brooklyn is basically a more attractive proposition than a football stadium in Manhattan. The building is less overwhelming and more likely to see regular use. Both the proposed sites need economic development, but the most important need of the far West Side of Manhattan is a subway line, not a monstrous sports center. The proposed Brooklyn site, at Flatbush and Atlantic, is already perhaps the best transportation hub in the city, but the area clearly needs an additional jump-start if it is going to thrive, and Mr. Ratner's project might provide that.
 There is also, of course, the dream of giving back to Brooklyn some of the luster it lost when Robert Moses killed Walter O'Malley's vision of building a domed stadium for the Dodgers at the same site nearly 50 years ago. That dream, the housing, the cheap tickets and all the other good things are not worth risking hundreds of millions of dollars in public money and dooming Brooklyn to impassible streets on every game night. But if those issues can be properly addressed, the idea of the Brooklyn Nets is tantalizing.





CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in The Arts on Tuesday about Frank Gehry's design for the first phase of the Grand Avenue development project in Los Angeles misstated the location of the proposed Atlantic Yards project that Mr. Gehry is designing in Brooklyn. (The error also appeared in sports articles on Feb. 9 and April 11, in the City section on Jan. 15 and in several articles in 2003, 2004 and 2005.) It is on rail yards and other land in Prospect Heights and on a block in Park Slope; it is not in Downtown Brooklyn, although it is near that neighborhood

HEADLINE: Sudan Makes Pledge to Annan to Disarm Militias

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, July 3 

 BODY:
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, has won a promise from Sudan's government to send troops to stop militia violence that has forced one million people to flee in the Darfur region.
 In a joint statement issued before Mr. Annan's departure on Saturday, the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, committed to disarming the militias and investigating human rights violations. 
 Mr. Annan had visited several camps in a tour aimed at pressing the government to end the 16-month Darfur conflict and to honor its promises to disarm the Janjaweed. That is the Arab militia blamed for attacks on black Africans.
 ''My message is simple: violence must stop,'' Mr. Annan told reporters after meeting with Mr. Bashir on Friday in Khartoum's heavily guarded military headquarters. ''The Janjaweed must be stopped, and a cease-fire must be respected by all.''
 Sudan promised to ''immediately start to disarm the Janjaweed and other armed outlaw groups'' and also said it would deploy a ''strong, credible'' police force to protect camps of displaced persons and other areas susceptible to attacks, the communique said.
 Sudan's foreign minister, Mostafa Osman Ismail, told reporters on Friday that 6,000 soldiers and policemen would be deployed in Darfur, but he did not say when.
 Thousands of people have been killed; the million or so forced from their homes have mostly taken shelter in camps with little access to clean water or proper sanitation.
 United Nations officials have called the situation the worst human disaster in the world, and Mr. Annan has said it is ''bordering on ethnic cleansing.''
 Sudan's pledge came as the United States raised the possibility of more sanctions if the government failed to act quickly to end attacks by the militias and allow aid to reach displaced people.
 The joint statement said the United Nations recognized Sudan's improvements in allowing some access to Darfur, but it highlighted the urgency of the situation by pushing for the resumption of talks between the government and the rebel group.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, a Bond Manager's Life Is Tougher

BYLINE: By CARLA FRIED

 BODY:
THE primary obsession for some Americans this spring was whether Carrie would end up with Mr. Big on ''Sex and the City,'' but bond investors found higher drama in Fed watching. When, they asked, would Alan Greenspan & Company raise interest rates? 
 They finally got their answer last week, as the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent. 
 But unlike a television series finale, the Fed's move signals the beginning of a new season. 
 The small rate increase is expected to be the first of many Fed moves to keep the economy from overheating. And that is making bond fund managers and financial advisers scurry to protect their portfolios because, in the seesaw world of bonds, the prices of bonds fall when yields rise. 
 The second quarter was already tough. The yield on the bellwether 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.58 percent by June 30 from 3.86 percent three months earlier. That sent the total return -- yield plus the change in the securities' price -- to a 1.8 percent loss for the average taxable bond fund, according to Morningstar Inc. Municipal bond funds lost 2.1 percent, on average.
 ''Investing in stocks is tough, but bonds are tougher right now,'' said Lewis Altfest, a financial adviser based in New York who oversees more than $250 million. How tough? Earlier this year, William H. Gross, the Warren E. Buffett of bonds, became so bearish that he pulled some of his personal money from the $75 billion Pimco Total Return bond fund that he runs. He says he is now putting some of that money back in the fund, because prices in the Treasury market have become more reasonable, given sharply rising yields. But he remains cautious. ''I am neutral on bonds,'' Mr. Gross said. 
 Nor can you construe it as bullish when Robert L. Rodriguez has 38 percent of his $1.6 billion FPA New Income fund safely put away in cash and the fund's average duration -- a measure of its sensitivity to interest rate changes -- is a bearish 1.1 years. Mr. Rodriguez has guided the fund to 20 consecutive calendar years of positive returns; its annualized gain of about 7 percent over the past five years is about the same as that of Pimco Total Return.
 Mr. Rodriguez is still on a buyer's strike that began in June 2003, when the 10-year Treasury note yielded 3.14 percent. ''No one seems to realize how overvalued bonds got,'' he said. At current rates, he said, ''there's still significant downside risk.'' 
 Mr. Rodriguez said he would stay in cash until the 10-year Treasury note was yielding at least two to three percentage points more than the inflation rate. He expects inflation to run 2.5 to 3 percent over the next 12 months, which means that he is looking for a 10-year Treasury yield as high as 6 percent. ''Yes, rates are up, but not as far up as they should be or will be,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.
 The return to higher rates comes at an all-time peak for bond fund assets. In the market meltdown that started in 2000, chastened investors realized that bonds could help balance a stock-heavy diet. (In 2002, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 22 percent, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index gained 10.3 percent.) A record $140 billion poured into bond funds in 2002, and $31.4 billion more followed in 2003. More than $1.2 trillion was invested in bond funds at the end of May, according to the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association. But that is not to say that investors have suddenly lost the urge to time the markets. Net withdrawals from bond funds exceeded $7.7 billion in April, when rates began to rise, and an additional $16 billion exited in May. 
 The smartest move may be to sit tight. Sure, bond values decline as rates rise, but the higher yields eventually offset the principal losses, assuming that you reinvest your income payouts. Brian W. Matthews, managing principal at Payden & Rygel, which manages $52 billion in bond portfolios, including the $520 million Payden Core Bond fund, took a look at what could happen to the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index and to money market funds as rates rose. The Lehman index is an industry benchmark with an intermediate-term duration of about five years. Most fund advisers recommend sticking with intermediate-term funds; they provide most of the upside of a longer-term fund but with much less downside risk.
 To load the deck against the index, Mr. Matthews assumed an extreme situation -- which he does not expect to occur -- in which the federal funds rate kept rising from 1 percent all the way to 4 percent over 12 months. The index would lose 5.6 percent of its value with a rate climb of that magnitude; the money market yield would rise to 4 percent from 1 percent. 
 But after the first year, the index's higher income payout would push its total return back into positive territory, and in 2.5 years the index return would pull even with the money market; their cumulative gains would be 8 percent. From that point, the index would outperform the money market by 50 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, a quarter -- a significant amount in the bond world. ''You're paid to play in this game,'' Mr. Matthews said. Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors and manager of $540 million in client assets, noted that even in 1994 and 1995, when the Fed raised rates by three percentage points in six months, prompting a broad bond sell-off, bonds rebounded within a year. ''Market timing doesn't work, and it's not necessary,'' he said. ''Rather than bail out, it makes more sense to pull in your duration if you're worried.''
 That is exactly what many fund managers are doing, within allowable limits. A vast majority of bond funds now require the manager to stick closely to the parameters of a benchmark index, and Eric Jacobson, a bond fund analyst at Morningstar, says managers today are leaning to the short end of their allowable ranges.
 At Vanguard, where $160 billion is invested in bond funds, Robert Auwaerter, head of the fixed-income division, said the funds were ''bearish across the board.''
 ''To the extent we can insulate a portfolio against rising rates,'' Mr. Auwaerter added, ''we are doing it.''
 Still, he is not looking for a repeat of 1994 and 1995. A gradual rise to a federal funds rate of 2 percent or so would effectively ''tap the brakes'' to slow down the economy, he said. Even at that level, he said, the real federal funds rate -- adjusted for inflation -- would still be near zero. 
 ''With some tightening, the Fed is still going to be quite accommodative,'' he said. As managers shorten the average durations of their funds, financial advisers are becoming more creative in finding income plays. High-yield corporate bond funds and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, offered good value last year, but both areas are now considered to be played out. 
 With the easy money gone there, Louis P. Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh, is turning to bank loan funds like the Eaton Vance Floating-Rate fund. These portfolios own corporate loans that are tied to a short-term interest rate that resets every 90 days. The fund can benefit even if rates rise, because it is continually reinvesting at the higher rates without having to worry about a big loss of principal. The main risk is whether the companies will pay off their debt, but in an improving economy, Mr. Stanasolovich said, that should not be a big concern.
 FOR investors willing to ride out short-term speed bumps, Mr. Jacobson of Morningstar recommended the Harbor Bond fund, a no-load fund run by Mr. Gross of Pimco, and the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, which aims to mimic the return of the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index. On the conservative end of the risk spectrum, he likes the Fidelity Short-Term Bond fund.
 ''If you can't assume the volatility it takes to be an investor, you don't belong in bonds, period,'' Mr. Jacobson said. ''But if you assume a little volatility and stick with it, you will get higher returns than a money market over time.''

HEADLINE: In Times of Trouble, the Founding Fathers Sell Well

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IN 1998, Ron Chernow, who had written successful biographies of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, told his publisher he planned to write his next book on Alexander Hamilton. He got a chilly reception. 
 ''They said books on the founding fathers did not sell well,'' Mr. Chernow recalled in an interview last week. ''They said books on the Civil War and World War II were much more popular.'' 
 On this Independence Day, Mr. Chernow's book, ''Alexander Hamilton,'' is No.6 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list, and Cokie Roberts's ''Founding Mothers'' is No. 13. Eight other hard-cover books about the Revolution and the early days of the country are also on the ''new nonfiction'' display at the Borders on L Street in downtown Washington.
 Nor is this a short-term fad. Joseph J. Ellis's ''Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation'' and David McCullough's ''John Adams'' won Pulitzer Prizes in 2001 and 2002 and were among the biggest-selling history books of the last decade. 
 Many writers of history who once concentrated on different eras have switched their attention to the founding fathers. For example, Jay Winik, whose acclaimed book about the Civil War, ''April 1865: The Month That Saved America,'' came out in 2001, is now writing a book about the 1790's.
 ''It's not coincidental that this vogue arose now, in probably the most bitterly divided time since the Civil War,'' said H.W. Brands, a historian at Texas A&M University and the author of , ''The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,'' which was on best-seller lists in 2000.
 ''When the country is divided along cultural, economic and partisan grounds,'' Mr. Brands said, ''people look for a time when we were all together.''
 Mr. Winik agrees with that analysis. ''Americans are looking for an anchor,'' he said. ''What better anchor can you get than the founding fathers, who made something out of nothing. What is so critical to understand is that they really differed in a number of ways. They had tough, hard debates, jealousies and rivalries. But they came together, and the sum became greater than the individual parts.''
 As Mr. Ellis toured to promote his book, which is a series of essays about the relationships between and among the founding fathers, he said he realized that people were impressed with the civil, respectful correspondence that Adams and Jefferson, bitter political enemies, conducted for years after they left office. 
 ''It's difficult to comprehend Bill Clinton developing a correspondence with George W. Bush,'' Mr. Ellis said. 
 Over the years, views about the founding fathers have risen and fallen with the public mood. In the early 19th century, Americans ''spat on the graves of the founding fathers,'' blaming them for having saddled the country with seemingly irreconcilable problems, Mr. Brands said.
 Northerners ''called the Constitution a covenant with hell because it allowed slavery,'' Mr. Brands said. ''Southerners thought 'all men created equal' was a glittering generality that meant nothing in everyday life.''
 But during the Reconstruction period, which coincided with celebrations of the country's centennial, people began to look at the founders in a different light -- as great men of a golden age, beloved in the North and South alike.
 Disdain for the founders was expressed once again at the turn of the 20th century, when some scholars argued these men were guided more by personal financial motives than patriotic impulses. During the days of the civil rights movement, Washington, Jefferson and others were sometimes seen as hypocrites for having owned slaves.
 But in times of national crisis, like the two world wars, when Americans ''especially wanted to feel unified and good about themselves,'' Mr. Brands said, the prevailing view of the founders tended to be uniformly positive.
 The reputations of individual founders also fluctuate with the times, just as they do collectively. Mr. McCullough has said he started out researching a joint biography of Jefferson and Adams. But as he got into it, he decided Jefferson was overrated and Adams underrated and decided to stick to Adams.
 Edmund Morgan, whose latest book is a collection of essays called ''The Genuine Article: A Historian Looks at Early America,'' said new details of Jefferson's relationship with the slave Sally Hemmings was now tarnishing the name of the third president. For most of the 20th century, Mr. Morgan said, historians had disregarded the significance of that relationship.. 
 Another reason for the popularity of books about the founding fathers is that they themselves wrote so well. ''They expressed themselves at great length with exceptional depth and eloquence that would do credit to any politician or thinker,'' Mr. Chernow said. ''They are so quotable. We actually can know them better than we can know our own politicians.''
 Peter Osnos, publisher of PublicAffairs, said the books about the founding fathers were popular, and profitable, in large part because they are so readable. ''The writing of history has changed dramatically,'' he said. ''The old versions portrayed the founders as deities, which makes them dull. The new portraits are much richer and show them as people.''
 ''These writers are great storytellers telling great stories,'' Mr. Osnos said. 
 What today's historians have learned, Mr. Chernow said, is to ''take figures who once seemed dry and remote and bring them to life in narrative biographies.''
 Mr. McCullough especially is regarded by his peers as a master of narrative writing. ''My Benjamin Franklin book could never have done so well if the path had not been blazed by David McCullough,'' said Walter Isaacson, whose ''Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,'' was a best-seller last year. 
 And the first chapter of Mr. Ellis's book, ''The Founding Brothers,'' about the duel in which Aaron Burr killed Hamilton, is widely regarded as one of the finest pieces of narrative nonfiction in modern literature.
 Mr. Brands, who is now writing a biography of Andrew Jackson, said he was delighted books about the founding fathers were doing so well but was not sure fawning over these figures was healthy for the country.
 Writing last year in The Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Brands put it this way: ''In revering the founders, we undervaluing ourselves and sabotage our own efforts to make improvements -- necessary improvements -- in the republican experiment they began. Our love for the founders leads us to abandon, and even to betray, the very principles they fought for.''

HEADLINE: With Guns And Butter, Kerry Woos Rural Voters

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: HOLMEN, Wis., July 3 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry came to the Gunslick Trap Club here on Saturday to try to break a stereotype that is politically dangerous in rural America: that a northeastern Democrat running for president must be antigun.
 On Day 2 of his bus tour through Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, seeking the support of rural and small town America, Mr. Kerry stopped here to do some trapshooting with a 12-gauge shotgun. He used the event to underscore his message, considered crucial in this part of the country, that he respected the rights of hunters, enjoyed the sport himself, and supported reasonable restrictions for safety and law enforcement purposes. 
 He also hit 17 out of 25 targets, which Terry Herbst, a longtime member of the club, described as ''really good'' for shooting with an unfamiliar gun.
 Earlier in the day, in an interview with Radio Iowa, a statewide network, Mr. Kerry said, ''I am a gun owner and I am a hunter and I respect the Second Amendment.'' But, he added, ''I've never contemplated shooting a deer with an AK-47.'' 
 A ban on assault weapons is important, he said. ''Law enforcement supports these things, and I support law enforcement,'' he added.
 The National Rifle Association has given Mr. Kerry an F rating, which the Bush campaign has been citing this week. The gun issue is considered one of the main reasons that Vice President Al Gore, who supported major new licensing requirements, fared so poorly among rural and small-town voters four years ago.
 Mr. Kerry, wearing blue jeans and tan suede work boots, spent much of the day making a rousing populist appeal to family farmers, saying he understood the power of the land and their love for it. He decried the increasing consolidation of meat producers and processors, and promised a tougher stance to ensure trade agreements were fairly enforced and that ''the global economy works for America's family farmers.''
 He also defended his support of the Northeastern Dairy Compact, which guaranteed the region's producers a fixed price, a position that has drawn fire from the Bush campaign this week. 
 ''I plead guilty'' to representing his state, Mr. Kerry said. But he added that the 2002 farm bill created a new national system of pricing and that he would ensure, as president, that all dairy farmers were treated fairly.
 Mr. Kerry's heartland tour has unfolded as a series of traditional tableaus: children on front porches holding Kerry signs as the buses roar past; a group of aging veterans greeting the candidate along the highway in Superior, Wis.; a tour of a dairy farm in Independence, Wis.; and a fireworks display on the Mississippi.
 The larger events were put together with cinematic precision, reflecting a campaign flush with money, and were captured not only by local and national television news, but also by a film crew making commercials for the campaign.
 The imagery reached its high point on Friday night, in a broad cornfield in Bloomer, Wis., where a crowd of several thousand gathered for a rally against the backdrop of two huge silos decorated with flags and red-white-and-blue Kerry signs. The candidate, bathed in the golden light of a summer dusk, finished his speech just as the sun set behind the hills. When he was done, with the crowd still cheering, a band on another stage struck up the old populist anthem ''This Land Is Your Land,'' with Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, playing the harmonica.
 Mr. Kerry suddenly jumped off his stage, plunged into the crowd with the Secret Service anxiously in tow and joined the band to play the guitar. The crowd sang along to words altered by Mr. Obey to declare of the Democratic candidate, ''This man is your man, this man is my man.'' And then, the campaign cued the fireworks, and a huge display erupted across the cornfields.
 The only dissonant note was a Bush sign on a distant field.
 Mr. Kerry tried hard to make a personal connection. He told an audience in Independence, gathered in the machine shed of a 300-cow dairy farm, that he had fond memories of time spent on the farm as a boy. Mr. Kerry, the son of a foreign service officer who often lived abroad, noted that he lived for a time on a Massachusetts farm. ''I learned my first cuss words sitting on a tractor, from the guy who was driving it,'' he said.
 A spokeswoman said he was referring to time spent with his parents while a small child outside Boston, as well as with an aunt and uncle, the Winthrops, at their home on a dairy farm on Boston's North Shore.
 The Bush campaign instantly put out a mocking news release about the idea of Mr. Kerry growing up on a farm. ''He said it!'' was the headline -- and the battle to define Mr. Kerry to small-town America continued.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Watch With Wary Pride As Little Changes, and a Lot

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER and SOMINI SENGUPTA; John F. Burns contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 3 

 BODY:
Zeke Nouri Arif is a talkative old man who, like many Iraqis, seems unconcerned if others speak at the same time or volume as he. He does not mind a chorus. And out of a teahouse chorus of perplexed Iraqis on Saturday, Mr. Arif piped up that he was especially qualified, because of his age, 71, and 50 years moving around Iraq as a truck driver, to weigh in on a momentous week in which little here changed and everything did. 
 ''I have seen a lot,'' he said. ''But I have never seen anything like this. This is such a unique situation. It's very dangerous. People can do whatever they like.
 ''But we feel better,'' he added. ''We have a new government.'' 
 Unlike the earth-shaking changes forced by the American military 16 months ago, the transfer of formal sovereignty to an interim government of Iraqi leaders seems to be working on the national psyche in more subtle ways, which have brought a measure of hope not evident here in some time. 
 This glint of optimism may prove to be brief, especially if the insurgency rekindles its usual intensity. But while no one really believes Iraqis will be able to overrule America's will, some things are different: The nation has a new government led by Iraqis who are certainly acting as if they are in charge. Many Iraqis say there seem to be fewer American troops on the streets and more Iraqi soldiers and police officers. Iraq woke up this morning to huge color photographs of Saddam Hussein in chains, with a smile on his face. 
 It is disorienting, this mix of cosmetic and real. 
 ''I feel nothing,'' said Kamal Duleimi, 40, who sells used motor scooters to Iraqis who, under Mr. Hussein, could not have afforded them. ''I'm happy. I'm sad. I don't know.'' 
 As the new government takes its first steps, many Iraqis seem to have resorted to their age-old coping strategy: waiting. 
 In its first six days in office, the government, led by a tough-talking exiled doctor, Iyad Allawi, has moved in a few big ways and many small ones. The major symbolic step was to have Mr. Hussein arraigned for the crimes he is accused of committing against Iraqis over three decades, going so far as to allow television coverage that showed him in a way Iraqis had never quite imagined. 
 The government has decided to re-instate the death penalty. It has talked about cracking down on insurgents, but also of co-opting them into the new order. 
 Soon it is expected to impose a state of emergency, which could include curfews, more checkpoints and limits on public demonstrations. 
 But the government has also set about the humdrum tasks of any sovereign state. Now visitors must receive a visa -- with a new seal -- before entering Iraq, rather than being waved through by an American soldier. Some 40 new ambassadors have been chosen, and soon will be announced. Local officials are discussing disassembling parts of the obstacle course of barriers and detours that American troops have used to keep them safe. The culture minister wants to move Polish troops off the ruins of Babylon, which Iraqis often cite as their proud link to the earliest of civilizations. 
 In the spring of 2003, as American troops rumbled up from Iraq, Iraqis waited not with flowers but with stolid frowns to see whether Mr. Hussein was truly gone before celebrating the new American order. More recently, they have been waiting to see whether the insurgency that has killed hundreds of Iraqis and Americans will chase American troops home. 
 Now they seem to be waiting, with a wary sense of promise, for two things: whether the new government actually improves their lives, and whether it can do so more or less independently of America. 
 ''We have hope -- anybody is better than Saddam,'' said Sundus Tahar, 25, who came with her extended family from the slums of Sadr City to take over a two-story, six-room flat once held by a palace secretary. ''Now we are waiting to see the difference.''
 Squatters like her who a year ago settled into a row of riverside apartments once occupied by Hussein-era apparatchiks are waiting for something specific: whether their new government will try to throw them out as part of what may be sweeping changes to reorder the chaos of American military occupation. 
 Since claiming the apartment a year ago, the family has built doors where there were none. They have turned a balcony into a makeshift kitchen. They have hung curtains, moved in their furniture, adorned the wall of the back room with a glossy poster of flowers.
 But who knows how long they will be able to call this home, they say. Maybe their new government will order them to leave. Or maybe they will offer them this gift, as compensation for their suffering. Already, the Tahar sisters say, they have paid 1.5 million Iraqi dinars, about $1,000, to the owner.
 ''We are just holding our hearts, living in worry,'' said Ms. Tahar's sister, Jalila, 35.
 Not every Iraqi has welcomed the changes of this last week, seeing them as little more than a sly example of American manipulation. 
 ''New government?'' asked an angry Hazem Hamood, 42, an unemployed ex-army officer as he sat under the hot sun at the entrance to the Green Zone, the physical core of the American-led occupation. ''What new government are you talking about? The first thing they should have done is come to the people to see how we live.''
 He rattled off his grievances. Why put Mr. Hussein on trial as the first order of business? Why haven't government officials announced when they will fix the electricity shortage? When will people be given back the land they lost under Mr. Hussein? Why have food rations been cut?
 His most pressing concern, on this afternoon, with the sun pressing hard on his back, was having to stand in line, simply to go back home. 
 His house, inherited from his grandfather, lay smack inside the Green Zone, which swallowed parts of his neighborhoods as it expanded last year from headquarters to fortress. Most days, the wait at the checkpoint can last two hours. Today, he was supposed to take his 8-month-old baby to a doctor for immunizations. He skipped the appointment. He couldn't bear to keep his son in the car in the heat.
 For many Iraqis, the resumption of sovereignty carried little of the drama that was evident, 72 hours later, with the courtroom appearance of Mr. Hussein. Seeing him brought to account before an Iraqi judge struck similar emotional chords, only with greater power.
 A middle-aged man who was a colonel in the Republican Guard, the crack force in the old, dissolved Iraqi Army, and who knew Mr. Hussein personally, said he had waited years to hear the brief phrase that Mr. Hussein used in court.
 ''He said, 'Please, if you'll excuse me,' when he refused to sign the papers that the judge wanted him to sign,'' the colonel said. ''I don't think any Iraqi had heard Saddam say those words in 30 years, and they brought a tremendous joy to my heart.
 ''But then I looked at him again, so scruffy, and so humiliated, and I thought, 'This man was the president of Iraq, he was our nation's leader, and why are the Americans doing this to him now?' ''
 The hearing was arranged to emphasize that Iraqis were in charge. American soldiers were withdrawn from the area around the courtroom building 20 minutes before the arrival of first the armored convoy carrying Mr. Hussein, then the convoys carrying the 11 other defendants. They were replaced by Iraqi prison guards, who nonetheless wore American-style uniforms and baseball caps stenciled with the letters ICS, for Iraqi Correctional Service.
 In the Shiite neighborhood of Shaab, people say they feel safer after the events of this week.
 ''Nothing has changed except one important thing,'' said Col. Kamel Ashimari, chief of the main police station in Shaab, who quadrupled the number of Iraqi police officers on the streets during the transfer. ''Before, every single Iraqi was carrying a gun with himself or in his car. Now that we have sovereignty, no one has a weapon anymore. Seventy-five percent of Iraqis feel secure now.''
 The residents of Shaab have a special grievance against the presence of American troops. In October, a suicide bomber killed scores of Iraqi policemen and civilians at its police station. It was one of the first major coordinated attacks in which Iraqis were specifically targets, but American soldiers then, as now, worked out of the station.
 Mahmood Chasib, 21, said Saturday that he had seen 11 bodies that day, including a gas vendor, two house painters and a lawyer. Now, he said, insurgents are less likely to attack Americans and kill Iraqis in the process. 
 ''Now Iraqis have power,'' he said. ''And the Americans did nothing.''

HEADLINE: Court the Protest Economy

BYLINE: By BEN COHEN. 
Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's, is president of TrueMajorityACTION and author of ''50 Ways You Can Show George the Door in 2004.''

 BODY:
MAYOR BLOOMBERG clearly went to great lengths to lure the Republican National Convention to New York City, and now he's busy making sure the convention-goers have a great time once they arrive, offering them special performances of Broadway shows, fancy parties sponsored by Wall Street firms and more.
 Mr. Bloomberg justifies the effort and expense he's dedicated to the convention -- at least in part -- by saying that New York will reap major economic and public relations benefits by playing host to the Republicans. But what about the economic benefits that will accrue thanks to the one million protesters who are expected to visit New York City to demonstrate? 
 Even if you add the 15,000 journalists who will be swarming around the Republican convention to the 13,000 convention-goers -- and, for good measure, throw in 50,000 stray lobbyists and vendors selling talking Ann Coulter dolls -- the protesters will outnumber and may well outspend the Republicans and their entourage.
 Look at the numbers. Protest organizations are chartering buses and mobilizing people around the country to come to New York. If 500,000 out-of-staters visit for one night -- a reasonable number in light of past demonstrations -- they could easily drop a total of $150 million or more. 
 Wait a minute, you say, they are a ragtag bunch with no cash to pump into the local economy. Not so. Protesters increasingly fall into the aging boomer demographic. They have well-paying jobs, houses, 401(k)'s -- and credit cards.
 Even if half the protesters sleep on floors, that leaves more than 250,000 staying in area hotels, where they will spend more than $50 million. 
 And how do you thank someone if you stay on their floor? You take them out to dinner after a day of all-American protesting. And before dinner, why not a Broadway (or Off Broadway) show or a visit to the Met or even a poetry slam? Or, as a thank-you, you might buy a gift for your host and for loved ones back home. And you might buy a thing or two for yourself. The protesters -- poor and wealthy ones combined -- could spend $100 million on this stuff and other incidentals. Despite their spending potential, what do the protesters get in the way of wooing? They can't even get a permit to congregate in Central Park and exercise their First Amendment rights of free speech because City Hall is worried about the lawns! 
 Last month, Mr. Bloomberg made a good start by issuing some permits to protest groups. But if he truly had the interests of New Yorkers in mind, he would immediately start a major marketing campaign, encouraging protesters from across America to demonstrate at the Republican convention. This campaign would emphasize that protesters are welcome in New York -- and that they'll have a good time and be kept safe. As a sign of his commitment, Mr. Bloomberg should ensure that the demonstrators be given access to a prime venue, like Central Park, for their big event.
 If protesters were properly invited and assured of a safe place to protest, who knows how many would come? Two million? Three million? This could translate into a billion dollars or more for the city. 
 As a former businessman, the mayor should understand that cash-carrying people are cash-carrying people, even if they don't like President Bush. So, Mr. Bloomberg, roll out the red carpet to protesters.

HEADLINE: Because of Quiet Father's Vision, the Tennis World Sees a New Champion

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

DATELINE: WIMBLEDON, England 

 BODY:
AT 17, Maria Sharapova stepped out onto Center Court at Wimbledon yesterday and played her first Grand Slam final as though she already knew the result, as though meeting and defeating a two-time defending champion was all part of her father's grand plan.
 Someone who saves all his rubles, moves his daughter to a faraway continent, apart from her mother for two long years, is not a whimsical man. Clearly, Yuri Sharapov had a fantastic vision similar to the one Richard Williams saw for his girls Venus and Serena in Compton, Calif. -- and the entrepreneurial acumen to execute it. 
 Sharapov chooses not to explain how his daughter has made the spectacular run from Siberian youth to Wimbledon queen. 
 All tournament, and actually for as long as reporters have been asking, the parental architect has dispensed few nuggets of information. He referred all news media requests to Maria and kept walking.
 ''She's the champion,'' he said after her 6-1, 6-4 demolition of Serena ended the Williamses' four-year reign on these scarred and hallowed lawns. ''That's it. It's all about her.''
 Alas, he soon embraced a group of relatives and family friends outside the locker room and bellowed a pluralistic: ''We did it.'' Much sooner, Maria would say, than she ever expected, and against all socio-economic odds.
 For several years now, Venus and Serena Williams have been the deserving toast of the women's sports movement in the United States and elsewhere, in part because of their modest inner-city roots, and as African-Americans who rose to prominence in a sport overwhelmingly dominated by affluent whites.
 Don't be fooled by Maria Sharapova's blonde country-club looks, which will forevermore keep the telephone of her representatives at the International Management Group ringing. By all accounts, she was not a child of privilege in post-Communist Russia. Her family fled an area threatened by the nuclear-reactor disaster at Chernobyl.
 Somehow, she made it to the beautiful tennis people in the American Sun Belt, just as the Williamses eventually did.
 With talent, ingenuity and a little luck, hard roads from anywhere can lead to fame and fortune. Basketball players come to the N.B.A. from the most remote places, and most of them have more in common than people think with the black American stars who occasionally wonder what the foreign invasion is all about. 
 It's about hunger, and hope, and all those cliches born of truth, as Sharapova noted when asked for her postmatch reflections.
 ''All that has happened in my life, all the tough moments we've been through, all the good moments,'' she said.
 Not coincidentally, Serena said she saw familiar qualities in Sharapova, the strength of one who hasn't had it so easy. ''She's kind of like me,'' Serena said. ''She doesn't back off.''
 Sooner or later, every toughest kid on the block gets called out for a challenge, a street fight. 
 The fearless teenager who matched Serena power stroke for power stroke and ultimately outmatched her just came much sooner for the younger Williams sister, not yet 23, than she and most others expected.
 ''I don't know what happened,'' Serena said, perhaps disoriented by one blistering Sharapova backhand that deflected off her racket at the net and caught her in the face.
 Unlike other Russian players whose serves have failed them in big moments, Sharapova's held up remarkably. Her second serve averaged 97 miles an hour, 11 miles faster than Serena's. She played every point like Center Court was a neighborhood park, with no fear. 
 Numerous rallies that began with Serena dictating the point ended with her hitting on her heels or flailing at Sharapova's flat, deep returns.
 The new champion takes short meditative breaks behind the baseline between service points, fiddles with her racket strings, brushes away a loose strand of hair, bounces the ball once, twice, and goes to work, all business. 
 Serena and Richard Williams brushed off the need for a scouting report Friday, or even a game plan. 
 But here, suddenly, was a 6-foot opponent with the weaponry to dispel the belief that on any surface but clay, when healthy, only Serena can beat Serena.
 This must be said about the former champion: after netting a forehand on match point, she walked around the net post and embraced Sharapova in the service box. 
 It was gracious, classy and in contrast to Richard, who was long gone from the family box after being ubiquitous as rain these last two weeks. Meanwhile, Oracene Price, Serena's mother, left with less to say than Yuri Sharapov.
 The obsessions necessary to raise a tennis champion under any circumstances and certainly those who don't follow the conventional path aren't always pretty in public. 
 Maybe Yuri Sharapov has learned something from infamous tennis fathers like Jim Pierce and Damir Dokic, and from the way Richard Williams hasn't made life easier for his daughters on Tour.
 So in the family's finest hour, Yuri still wasn't talking. Yelena, the mom, was home in Florida, off limits even to Maria, as she fiddled with a capricious cellphone before the trophy ceremony. 
 Even in the most carefully constructed plans, there are occasional kinks. Sharapova felt a sore throat coming on Friday night and cried. Just as she and Serena were due on court, she had to make a bathroom run. 
 The rest of the day, like these last two weeks, went off just as Yuri Sharapov must have drawn it up in his wildest dream. 
 His daughter won Wimbledon. She is the champion. That's it. It's all about her.

HEADLINE: It's the Economy, Right? Guess Again

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
THROUGH months of campaigning, Senator John Kerry has presented himself as a centrist on economic policy, a New Democrat directly out of the Clinton mold. He has pledged to cut the deficit, move the country toward budget surpluses and recreate the booming economy of the Clinton years. As if to underscore the point, he has recruited most of his economic advisers from the former president's administration.
 But centrism is an easier position to maintain when the economy is in trouble, as it seemed to be in the early days of the campaign. Back then, Mr. Kerry could convincingly denounce President Bush as a miserable manager of the American economy. That argument is harder to make now that a stronger economy has been generating jobs, although at a slower rate in June. So Mr. Kerry is talking more boldly about policy.
 Of course, the centrism still comes through loud and clear in speeches and in interviews. But in the heat of the policy debate, deficit reduction appears to be taking a back seat to what is easily Mr. Kerry's most significant economic proposal: an expensive expansion of government-financed health insurance. 
 He says he would subsidize health insurance for millions of people not covered now. That is the jewel of his economic plan. An omnibus health insurance bill would be the first legislation sent to Congress in a Kerry presidency, he says. But while the centrist Kerry still advocates shrinking the budget deficit, a bolder Kerry, less noticeable so far in the campaign rhetoric, adds that if the deficit threatens to rise rather than fall, well, so be it -- he'll go ahead with his health plan anyway.
 ''Health care is sacrosanct,'' Mr. Kerry said in a telephone interview, offering the most explicit commitment to date to a program that he estimates would cost $650 billion. That is an amount greater than the cost of all his other economic proposals combined. 
 ''Listen,'' he said, ''if worse comes to worst, you make adjustments accordingly in other priorities.'' 
 And not in health care? Mr. Kerry says that he will not have to face that choice, and that in his overall economic plan there is leeway for deficit reduction and expanded, subsidized health insurance. But if a choice has to be made, deficit reduction will have less priority. ''Health care is too important,'' he said. 
 For Mr. Kerry, who has promised to cut the budget deficit in half in four years as president, sticking his neck out on subsidized health insurance seems a shrewd shift in tactics, if not a defensive one. That is because it is tougher to blame President Bush for a bad economy when the economy has improved. 
 Once he could charge that the president was presiding over more than two million lost jobs and would become the first president since Hoover to end his term with fewer Americans at work than when he took office. Now the odds are rising that the president may squeak through with as many jobs at the end of his term as at the start, or almost as many.
 JOB creation began to surge in February, just as Mr. Kerry was pushing the Hoover comparison in the early primaries. As of Friday, when the Labor Department announced employment numbers for June, the cumulative job loss since Mr. Bush took office in January 2001 was down to 1.1 million, less than half of the 2.6 million jobs that had disappeared as of last August, when employment finally began to turn up, slowly at first and then more rapidly. 
 In response, Mr. Kerry has switched his emphasis to job quality from jobs lost -- specifically, to the harder to demonstrate but apparently accurate claim that the new jobs pay less, on balance, than the ones that have been lost -- $9,000 a year less, on average, the Kerry camp proclaimed in a press release on Friday. His aides have also begun to split hairs. When government jobs are subtracted from the job creation, they say, the loss in the private sector remains high: 1.8 million through June.
 Economic growth is a similarly slippery issue. Presidential elections are won and lost on the strength of the economy, or lack of the same. The correlation in recent decades is uncanny, and on this count the Bush presidency seemed to be in trouble through two and a half years, thanks to a recession and a floundering recovery that held down economic expansion to an average annual rate of 1.63 percent. 
 Not anymore. Since last summer, growth has surged. Over the nine months from July 2003 through March this year, the annual growth rate of the gross domestic product averaged a robust 5.4 percent. The numbers for the most recent quarter, which ended last week, are not likely to pull down that average by very much when they are released late this month.
 ''The issue is whether the Kerry campaign can get people thinking about the Bush four-year record, not just the last year,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist who served as an economic adviser in the Clinton administration. ''You can legitimately attack the four-year record, charging that Bush compounded bad luck with bad policies, and extrapolate what he would do in the next four years.''
 Boiling down that complexity to a campaign slogan or a catchy phrase is tricky, however. Stumping for social change is an easier, perhaps more effective approach. And Mr. Kerry appears to be taking it -- cautiously but unmistakably.
 ''I believe the private sector has always been and is the dominant mover, shaker, creator of jobs and the mover of our economy,'' he said. That was the centrist side of Mr. Kerry speaking. The bolder, interventionist Kerry had this to say: There are some things beyond the scope of the private sector ''that you know will improve the quality of American life and make a difference over the long run.'' 
 Government programs are needed, he said. In the near term, most can be postponed or cut back if deficit reduction so requires. National service for young adults and universal preschool fall into that category. ''Health care, however, is not one of those,'' Mr. Kerry said. 
 Bill Clinton, in his 1992 campaign, also advocated government intervention, but more forcefully than Mr. Kerry. A $16 billion public spending program was high on Mr. Clinton's list, and subsidized health insurance got plenty of mention, too, although he had not yet developed a specific proposal, as Mr. Kerry has. 
 But for Mr. Clinton, the mantra was simple: ''It's the economy, stupid.'' He endlessly exploited its weak state. In the aftermath of a recession, employment did not turn up significantly until after the election, and the economy was expanding at a noticeably slower pace than it is today. 
 Lacking the economy as an overriding issue, Mr. Kerry is putting more stress on his specific proposals, which are radically different from his opponent's. While the Bush administration proclaims that markets, left alone, solve social problems, the Kerry camp holds that markets, by their nature, cannot satisfy a number of legitimate needs and that government must therefore step in.
 The Bush administration, for example, argues that its tax cuts strengthen markets. It says the cuts become an incentive for executives and workers who, in exchange for being allowed to keep more of their earnings, work harder, invest more and foster entrepreneurial activity. The results, the White House argues, are solid economic growth and rising income at the low as well as the high end of the work force. 
 The Kerry camp, by contrast, uses taxes as an incentive in a different, more specific way. It would cut them or raise them or offer credits or change tax law to alter corporate behavior. Through tax incentives, companies would be encouraged to behave in ways that are socially beneficial for Americans. But tax incentives are not enough, the Kerry camp says, arguing that government should intervene in other small ways to offset a market system's shortcomings. 
 Consider jobs. A President Kerry would not withhold federal contracts from companies that moved jobs overseas. ''We're living in a globalized economy and we're going to trade and some jobs are going to be outsourced,'' Mr. Kerry said in the interview. ''It would be phony for a president to stand up and say, 'I'm going to stop that from happening.''' 
 Several of his tax proposals, however, are intended as incentives to companies to keep jobs in the United States or to bring jobs back from abroad. They are not, he stresses, penalties. But he would insist that companies with federal contracts for the military and domestic security do the work in the United States. ''I will put a premium'' on that, he said. 
 He would also go a step further than President Clinton did in labor disputes, penalizing companies that use replacement workers in strikes. ''I would be willing to use federal contracts as leverage'' to prevent that, Mr. Kerry said, promising a penalty that the Clinton administration once announced but did not impose.
 IN addition, the senator would strengthen union bargaining power. Under current procedures, a company may insist that its workers vote in a secret-ballot election to determine whether they want to be represented by a union. Such elections can take weeks to arrange, and during that time it is relatively easy for management to intimidate or harass the workers. Another method, known as card check, is faster and more insulated from management. In card check, workers authorize union representation when a majority sign cards asking for it. Mr. Kerry said he favored the card check method. ''It is right and it is important,'' he said. 
 Trade is another area in which candidate Kerry parts company with the Bush administration. He would incorporate labor and environmental standards into future trade treaties, thus giving them teeth under the enforcement provisions of a standard trade agreement. President Clinton relegated environmental and labor standards to unenforceable side agreements to win Congressional approval of Nafta, although late in his presidency he had the side agreements incorporated into the treaty itself. 
 President Bush has put limits on the enforcement of Nafta and of the treaties that his administration has negotiated. Those include a Central American free trade agreement, which is not expected to go to Congress until next year. ''I have problems with the Central American agreement in its current form,'' Mr. Kerry said, indicating that he would renegotiate it to strengthen labor and environmental provisions.
 Asked in the interview about Social Security, he said it was essentially all right as it is. That is a more upbeat assessment than the Bush administration offers. The senator shuns partial privatization -- the Bush plan -- or raising the retirement age or shrinking the annual cost-of-living adjustment as a means of cutting benefit costs. 
 He said he would ask ''legitimate questions,'' however, about strengthening Social Security in other ways over the long run. He questions, for example, an income ceiling for applying the payroll tax -- currently $87,900 -- and asks why it cannot go considerably higher.
 But health insurance is a much bigger issue -- and more emblematic of how differently the two candidates think.
 President Bush, if re-elected, would encourage individuals to set up health care savings accounts. These would be tax deductible, and the account holders would use them to pay for health insurance or care. First, however, individuals would have to spend $1,000 or so from their own pockets in after-tax dollars. That would be the deductible. In addition, companies that now insure their workers would contribute to the individual accounts of their employees, if they wished. Or they could maintain their existing plans.
 The Republican approach recognizes that corporations are reducing health care coverage for employees and tries to offset that through the use of tax-deductible individual accounts, said Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign. ''By making individuals better consumers about health care,'' he added, ''they are more rational in the way they choose, and, in fact, that helps address the cost issue.''
 The poor are addressed through tax credits. For someone earning too little to finance a savings account -- $15,000 or less a year -- Mr. Bush would offer a tax credit, in effect mailing out $1,000 annually in 12 monthly installments. That money would be used to buy private health insurance.
 The Kerry proposal is aimed at the 40 million people without health insurance. For openers, two existing plans at the state level -- Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program -- would be expanded to enroll individuals and parents earning double or triple the poverty level.
 The federal government would pay the entire cost for these new enrollees, who account for 26 million of the 40 million people now uninsured, according to Kenneth E. Thorpe, a professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University and a chief architect of the Kerry plan. That would consume $503 billion of the $650 billion Mr. Kerry has earmarked for health care over four years, Mr. Thorpe said. 
 The second major aspect of the plan would expand coverage for companies with 50 or fewer employees; many of those companies now offer no insurance. A President Kerry would set up regional health insurance pools offering the same plan that now covers federal employees. An employer would pay, say, $5,000 a year per worker, but would get back half of that as a tax credit. 
 Finally, men and women between 55 and 64 -- early retirees, for example, too young for Medicare -- and younger people who are unemployed could join a regional health insurance pool. For the unemployed, the monthly cost would be 75 percent subsidized. For the others, even their unsubsidized monthly bills would be less than the average cost of private insurance, Mr. Thorpe said.
 THE cost of the Kerry plan, including special subsidies to reimburse companies for the extra cost of insuring employees with catastrophic illnesses, is $950 billion, a figure the Bush camp often cites. The Kerry campaign subtracts $300 billion in savings from efficiencies that Mr. Kerry would demand. People suffering from heart failure and diabetes, for example, would have to submit to managed care, with the goal of fewer hospitalizations.
 Either way, the program could endanger deficit cutting. Mr. Kerry's promise to repeal the Bush tax cuts on income above $200,000 may raise enough tax revenue to pay for expanded health insurance and his other programs. But that would not be enough to carry out his promise to cut the budget deficit in half in his first term, from its projected record level of more than $450 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends just before Election Day.
 President Bush has made the same pledge to cut the deficit in half. What goes unsaid in the stump speeches of both candidates, however, is that most of the deficit reduction they promise is dependent on the accuracy of a forecast from the Congressional Budget Office. That forecast says, in effect, that there will be enough economic growth and tax revenue by 2008 to cut the deficit in half automatically.
 But what if the forecast goes wrong? What if there is a nasty recession, or the outlays for the Iraq war exceed the $86 billion a year included in the four-year forecast -- or another terrorist attack drives up spending for domestic security? The senator bridles at such questions. 
 To begin with, he argues, the budget office forecast may turn out to underestimate the strength of the economy in a Kerry presidency. His projects for energy self-sufficiency and the like will pump public money into the private sector, lifting employment and economic growth. That would shrink the deficit by more than he now allows for, he says. 
 And if that does not happen, if the deficit does not come down as sharply as the budget office expects? Having declared health care sacrosanct, Mr. Kerry is reluctant to get into contingency planning if he cannot also achieve the desired deficit reduction. 
 ''I'm going to stick with my belief that my program is going to work,'' he said. ''And when it doesn't I'll deal in a way that keeps faith with my principles and my promises to the country. And I'll obviously have to deal with the realities of that.''

HEADLINE: Strange Bedfellows: 'Imperial America' Retreats From Iraq

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
IN the end, the American proconsul slipped out of Iraq with scarcely a word. L.Paul Bremer III pronounced the country a better place than the one once littered with Saddam Hussein's torture chambers, thanked the officials who had served with him on the now defunct Coalition Provisional Authority, bestowed power on the new Iraqi prime minister, Iyad Allawi, and was gone. 
 It was a low-key exit reflecting problems that Mr. Bremer, and perhaps any American, could not resolve. Iraqis, in their vast majority, were pleased to be freed of their dictator and were mesmerized by his first appearance in court last week, but they have no wish to be ruled by the United States. 
 The Age of Empire is passed, and governments throughout the world were uncomfortable with what they saw as the brazen exercise of American authority over a country reduced to vassal status through force of arms. Mr. Bremer, a Christian ruling a Muslim country, could not fail to be a lightning rod to Islamic extremists in Iraq and beyond. 
 Perhaps ''proconsul,'' with its echoes of imperial Rome, is a harsh word for the former administrator of Iraq. I met Mr. Bremer last December in his office in Mr. Hussein's bizarre Republican Palace, built in the despot's favored Mesopotamian Fascist style. He was businesslike, determined and self-effacing. But the setting, an ornate monument to a tyrant, seemed to capture all the irreconcilable contradictions of his role. 
 Mr. Bremer's mission was to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq. Yet he proposed rule ''of the people, by the people and for the people'' from a palace inside a sprawling fortress known as the Green Zone, where he was severed from contact with the life of average Iraqis. 
 ''We don't do empire,'' Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld declared memorably after the first phase of the war. But Mr. Bremer was obliged to do something that looked very much like it. He directed political affairs, doled out contracts, drafted regulations and discussed the next military move with American commanders at the palace -- all in a country where hostility could not be tamed and that was not and would never be his. 
 Here, perhaps, was the core of the problem: the United States seldom, if ever, looked more like an empire in a 19th-century British guise than over the 14 months of Mr. Bremer's rule. Indeed, the extent of America's wealth, firepower and cultural influence today gives it a dominance that almost certainly exceeds any achieved by Britain, even at the height of its power. 
 In Iraq, America's use of its power was blunt. This was not consensual hegemony, or empire by invitation, or rule through surrogates, but the direct hand of President Bush's proconsul placed on every significant lever of Iraqi power. That the rule had a goal declared noble by the United States scarcely seemed to matter. 
 Yes, the United States ruled over Cuba and the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, but it retreated from Cuba quickly enough and from the Philippines in 1946. Yes, the United States governed and remade Germany and Japan after 1945, but the consensus around that enterprise after World War II was overwhelming. Yes, the United States, during the cold war, was ready to show it would punish defectors from the Western camp, and did so in Chile and elsewhere. But there were two empires then. 
 ''When we had half the world and the other guys were really nasty, our imperial power was often seen as a good thing,'' said Charles S. Maier, a historian at Harvard. ''But when you are one of one, it looks less attractive and more conspicuous.'' 
 Certainly, American rule of Iraq has often looked heavy-handed. So it is not surprising that the United States' presence there, which endures in the form of more than 130,000 troops, has prompted a lively debate over whether the United States is today an empire. Views have ranged from an embrace of the label to outrage. 
 A lot of the latter has come from President Bush himself, who insists: ''We do not seek an empire. Our nation is committed to freedom for ourselves and for others.'' But some of his neoconservatives supporters have suggested the United States need not be shy about running the world. 
 Niall Ferguson, the British historian, has depicted an America in denial about its empire and as a result ineffective in bringing freedom and wealth to parts of the world where its influence might still be beneficent. Many members of the Bush administration, from the deputy defense secretary, Paul D. Wolfowitz, to Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, reject the word empire but do not hide their conviction that the United States must strive to bring its values to places like the Middle East, however bold or risky the undertaking. 
 The fact remains that most Americans harbor a deep, instinctive distrust of any suggestion of empire, perhaps because the country was founded in hostility to British imperialism and has had its own vast frontier to settle. 
 As for Europeans, they seem to have come to a view of Bush's America as imperialist, at the very least: a country, that is, prepared to flex its overwhelming ''hard'' and ''soft'' power -- military, economic, cultural -- to promote its own view of its security and get what it wants.
 What to make of all this? The invasion of two Muslim countries since Sept. 11, 2001, has amply demonstrated that the United States has the wherewithal of an empire and a military dominance that is extraordinary by any historical standard. 
 But the experience of Iraq has demonstrated, with equal clarity, that when America does not disguise its imperial force, when a proconsul leads an ''occupying power,'' it is liable to find itself in an untenable position quickly enough. 
 There are three reasons: the people being governed do not accept such a form of rule, the rest of the world does not accept it and Americans themselves do not accept it. Yet many people around the world, even now, view American leadership as essential for security, stability, prosperity and the spread of open societies. So the challenge for the United States lies in how best to find a balance between the inevitability of its dominance for the foreseeable future and the fact that too open or brusque an expression of this dominance alienates wide swaths of the world. 
 ''An empire imposes, but leadership creates support, and what America must strive for is leadership,'' said Karl Kaiser, the former head of the German Council on Foreign Relations and now a visiting scholar at Harvard. ''In the 21st century, the notion of empire is simply outmoded.'' 
 But an international consensus cannot always be forged, of course, and there may be times when the United States feels it has to act in isolation to defend its interests. What seems clear from the Iraqi experience is that, in this instance at least, America was unable to persuade the world that it had really exhausted the alternatives or faced an imminent threat to its national security. As a result, it looked imperious and, once Mr. Hussein was toppled, imperial. 
 America can lead and inspire a group of cooperative elites in Europe, Asia and Latin America that, openly or tacitly, accept its primacy. ''But it has to show that it is ready to adapt its ideas,'' Mr. Kaiser said. ''Empires do not do that.''

HEADLINE: 'The Apprentice' Without TV, Trump or a High-Salary Job

 BODY:
SIXTEEN people competed fiercely on national television for a chance to become Donald Trump's apprentice. After all, even the losers received national television exposure, and the winner was rewarded with a job paying $250,000 a year. 
 Less clear is why 27 unemployed people would spend nearly a month competing for a $40,000-a-year entry-level job as a junior programmer in the Jersey City offices of Maple Securities U.S.A. 
 During the contest, which was held in February, the candidates helped to set up their own training space; learned an arcane computer language called A.P.L. (A Programming Language); and performed a series of complex programming tasks on tight deadlines. 
 The competition was the brainchild of Brooke Allen, the head of the statistical arbitrage group at Maple Securities. 
 Mr. Allen is a devotee of A.P.L., which is considered a dead language by many programming enthusiasts, but is cherished by the ''geekiest of the geeks,'' according to one practitioner.
 Mr. Allen devised a behavioral finance game to simulate what he called ''common irrational'' behaviors of stock market participants, and he wanted to hire a junior programmer to maintain it. 
 ''People understood they were taking a risk and could drop out any time,'' he said. ''No one gave off a sense of desperation.'' 
 Some workplace experts said that hiring practices like Mr. Allen's were unusual, but that they resembled the ''try and buy'' approach that some employers use to test candidates before hiring them full time. 
 In many companies, including The New York Times, potential employees are given a tryout or a series of assignments to help determine the quality of their work and whether they fit into the office culture. Robert I. Sutton, a professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University and the author of ''Weird Ideas That Work: 11 1/2 Practices for Promoting, Managing and Sustaining Innovation'' (The Free Press, 2002), said he had seen far worse hiring practices than Mr. Allen's. 
 ''It's better than what you see in the average corporation,'' Dr. Sutton said. ''Everyone knew upfront about the risks when they signed on.'' 
 Other experts, however, described extended job tryouts as bordering on exploitive. ''Looking for a job is stressful and demanding work in a recovering economy,'' said Joanne Murray, a management consultant and the director of the Center for Work and Service at Wellesley College, ''and I question the advisability of devoting so much time to something like this. Not paying someone for that much time is also problematic.''
 Mr. Allen may not have been required to pay the Maple Securities job candidates because he was giving them an opportunity to learn A.P.L., according to Lawrence Z. Lorber, a lawyer specializing in labor and employment law at Proskauer Rose in Washington.
 Mr. Lorber said that in general, companies offering extended job tryouts were required to compensate participants, while those offering education were not. 
 Several other employers have recently experimented with their own ''try and buy'' hiring based on the tactics used on reality shows like ''The Apprentice'' and ''Survivor.'' 
 In May, the Stamford, Conn., office of the Regus Group, a provider of office space, began a three-month competition among eight paid interns for a chance at a full-time job. The company would not say how much that job would pay. 
 ''You'd have to be under a rock not to feel the buzz of 'The Apprentice,''' said Shari Aponte, a company spokeswoman. ''We thought this would be a clever way for attracting additional candidates to our program, and we've received great publicity. We don't want to criticize or demean anyone.''
 She said that the interns work on ''entrepreneurial'' projects involving sales analysis and creative design and that they are reviewed weekly by senior management.
 The Maple Securities recruiting effort began in January, when Mr. Allen ran a newspaper ad describing the kind of person he was looking for. He received 300 responses. He invited the 300 to download a 500-page computer manual on A.P.L. and an accompanying quiz. The 38 applicants who returned the quiz were given a chance to learn the language and take a chance at one or possibly more available positions. 
 By the end of the three-week training period, only 13 candidates remained. Mr. Allen ultimately hired two programmers from the tryout program, one for $40,000 and another for nearly twice that amount. 
 Mr. Allen decided to help the ''surplus'' programmers whom he could not hire. So he introduced the remaining applicants at a New York City A.P.L. conference in March, in the hope that other employers might hire them. At least two of those applicants found jobs related to their A.P.L. experience and the contacts they made at the March conference. 
 Mr. Allen described the program as an unconventional hiring strategy with benefits both for the employer, the employees who were ultimately hired and even those who were not. 
 Not every applicant was happy with the process. Tony Bozanich, 28, an unemployed programmer with a master's degree, attended several weeks of A.P.L. training before dropping out. He had been looking for a job for about four months before he saw Mr. Allen's cryptic ad and decided to take a chance. 
 ''Going to those sessions was like watching a train wreck in slow motion,'' Mr. Bozanich said. It was, he said, ''a testament to the bad economy that so many overqualified people would come in for one lousy programming trainee position.'' 
 Mr. Bozanich said he thought Mr. Allen was genuinely motivated to help the trainees find work, but he also considered the process inevitably exploitive. 
 Ben Dattner, an adjunct professor of organizational psychology at New York University, said that while employers using extended tryouts need to be candid with candidates about whatever methods and criteria they are using, some applicants might view these types of job competitions as more enjoyable than exploitive. 
 That was the case for Karine Ng, who was part of a job competition last September modeled on ''Survivor'' at DiMassimo Brand Advertising in New York. Ms. Ng was one of 10 people who participated in a weeklong competition for an entry-level advertising job. The group worked on making pitches and it devised a promotional campaign for Crunch Fitness. Every night, management voted two contestants out. 
 Ms. Ng survived four days before she was asked to leave. Though disappointed, she called the experience a win-win situation. DiMassimo, she said, gained more insight into candidates, and she received some on-the job training and made contacts. DiMassimo referred her to Jericho Public Relations, where she is now an account coordinator. 
 But Ms. Murray of Wellesley College warns that a job contest may be a sign that a cutthroat work culture awaits prospective employees. 
 ''It's a statement of culture and values and not to be taken lightly,'' she said. ''The job search process is something that should not be made cavalier.''

The Real World Of Conventions
 AS the nation's political class eagerly awaits the announcement of John Kerry's running mate, and nearly everyone else sits in beach traffic or waits in line at ''Spider-Man 2,'' word has begun dribbling out about who will be featured on stage at the Democratic and Republican conventions.
 For Republicans, an issue is whether anyone from Ronald Reagan's family will show up to support the Bush campaign's eager assertion that he is the late president's true political heir. For the Democrats, there is the Al Gore question.
 Formerly Mr. Bland America, the 2000 presidential nominee initially inserted himself into the 2004 race by endorsing former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont. More recently, he has picked up Dr. Dean's fiery baton as the party's leading Bush-basher. And now the question is whether this suddenly tempestuous former Dean supporter will be kept as far from prime time as possible.
 ''Big mistake,'' said Jonathan Murray, a veteran Hollywood producer. ''And they might announce Kerry's running mate in advance? Another huge mistake.''
 On television, summer is the season of reruns and second-tier reality shows. And a political convention has become, at heart, little more than a reality show. So who better to offer insight than Mr. Murray, one of the founding fathers of reality television, first with MTV's ''Real World'' and, more recently, with ''The Simple Life,'' starring Paris Hilton.
 ''It goes without saying that reality shows are better when you don't know the winner,'' Mr. Murray said. ''And the more drama and the more potential for surprises, the better. So this seems like a mistake to me, but whatever.''
 Democratic officials, who have not finished the convention schedule, insist that Mr. Gore will be given due respect, and that if he wants to go medieval on the president, that is fine with them. They also emphasize that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Gore are quite comfortable around each other, that Mr. Gore strongly supports Mr. Kerry's candidacy and that there are no hard feelings about all that Dean business.
 ''Reality shows are all about the casting, all about constructing some kind of a situation where the cast can be put through interesting tests,'' Mr. Murray said.
 The selection of a running mate would be a natural, he said. Barring that, he suggests showing some of the behind-the-scenes debate about whether to allow Mr. Gore to appear.
 ''Then, finally, Kerry steps in and makes the decision to let Al be Al,'' Mr. Murray said. ''Sure, Gore does feel a little like a loose cannon these days. But on television, that's good.''

The Lippmann Test
 AMONG those conspicuously absent from this year's political landscape -- indeed, missing for decades now -- is the philosopher-journalist, a once revered figure from the time before pundits. So, for a little refreshment, here is a sampling from the work of Walter Lippmann, who covered a dozen presidencies and became one of the 20th century's most celebrated political thinkers.
 Try to guess who he's talking about.
 ''In this tremendous time, the American people must look to their president for leadership. They are not getting leadership from the president. They are not being treated as they deserve to be treated and they have a right to be treated. They are not being treated as men and women, but rather as if they were inquisitive children.''
 An attack on the Bush administration's penchant for secrecy? No, this 1941 essay was directed at Franklin D. Roosevelt's lack of candor in the months leading up to World War II. Roosevelt is now praised by most historians for his pre-war conduct, deftly balancing American isolationist sentiment with his view that the country inevitably had to join the conflict.
 ''The president will have to find ways of communicating his own convictions to a working majority of the people. Is he not doing that? Not adequately, so it seems to me. There is a missing element in his press conferences, his speeches and his public appearances.''
 This is Lippmann's 1961 view of President John F. Kennedy, now almost universally praised as an eloquent communicator and a wizard at news conferences.
 The point here is not to show where Lippmann went astray, but to offer a cautionary note to presumptive Lippmanns. ''Feckless, that is what our politics is,'' he wrote in 1913. ''It is literally eccentric.''
 He wasn't always wrong, you know.

Down and Dirty In High Places
 WHAT is America to do with this recent outbreak of political pottymouth?
 The dust has settled a bit from Vice President Dick Cheney's outburst on the floor of the Senate, and months have elapsed since Mr. Kerry used the same four-letter expletive in an interview with Rolling Stone. Sadly, there seems to be no advice columnist or Web site devoted to the behavioral issues of politicians.
 But at ParentsPlace.com, counselors have tips for parents of preschoolers who suddenly let fly with profanity. First, they say, make sure the child knows what he is saying: ''Children use lots of words they only partially understand.'' And then, perhaps, ''give him some information which will help him learn both what the words mean and how people feel about their use.''
 And then, if all else fails, they advise giving him a little time. He'll probably grow out of it.
 But then again, this can be risky in some cases. A Web site called Ask the Expert, accessible at www.mhsource.com/expert, advises nurses that profanity among the elderly may well be a precursor to violent behavior. They advise adopting a soothing tone when speaking to profane older people. Are you listening, Senator Leahy?
 Harlan Cohen, a nationally syndicated columnist who specializes in advice for young adults, says he has come up with a shrewd trick.
 ''As I tell my readers, you can't take words back,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And that's why it's always helpful to have a hands-free cellphone chord connected to your ear at all times. Then you can always say what you're really thinking. And when the person you're swearing at gets offended, you can point to the phone and say, 'No, not you. I'm on the phone.'''

HEADLINE: Cheney Goes After Kerry, Calling Him 'Out of Touch'

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: WHEELING, W.Va., July 3 

 BODY:
Embarking on his first serious campaigning of the 2004 election, Vice President Dick Cheney laid into Senator John Kerry on Saturday for trying to portray himself as the candidate of conservative values despite a voting record that Mr. Cheney said argued otherwise.
 ''Sometimes I think John Kerry develops amnesia when he gets out on the campaign trail,'' Mr. Cheney said mockingly in front of a booming and loyal crowd at a Republican party rally here. Then he ticked off a list of Mr. Kerry's votes against bans on flag burning and late-term abortions, and in support of gun control. 
 ''On these and a whole host of values,'' the vice president told the crowd, ''John Kerry's votes and statements put him on the left and out of the mainstream and out of touch with the conservative values of the heartland.''
 Mr. Cheney played hard to patriotism and concerns about the economy on a Fourth of July weekend bus tour through the swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Mr. Kerry, the expected Democratic nominee, embarked on a similar bus tour this weekend as the two campaigns vied for rural votes.
 Resuming his position as the Bush campaign's attack dog, Mr. Cheney painted a Kerry presidency as one that would drag down the economy with higher taxes and tremble in the face of terrorism.
 ''These are not times for leaders who shift with the political winds, saying one thing one day and another the next,'' Mr. Cheney said here and at another rally in Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. ''We need a commander in chief with clear vision and steady determination, and that's just what we have in George W. Bush.''
 A day after the government reported that job growth had slowed in June after several strong months, Mr. Cheney argued that tax cuts had set the economy on a pattern of increasing employment. And after weeks of criticism that the administration led the nation into war based on unsubstantiated links between Iraq and the attacks of Sept. 11, he defended the American-led actions in Afghanistan and Iraq as fights against terrorism and tyranny.
 ''Terrorist attacks are not caused by the use of strength, they are invited by the perception of weakness,'' he declared, using a line that has become standard in his speeches over the past several weeks.
 The Kerry campaign responded to Mr. Cheney's attack by emphasizing Mr. Kerry's military service.
 ''Considering Dick Cheney got five deferments to avoid seeing combat, he's the last person who should be questioning a decorated Vietnam veteran on his allegiance to the flag,'' said Phil Singer, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign. Mr. Cheney, his wife, Lynne, and their 10-year-old granddaughter Kate boarded the bus at the Cleveland airport, then glided past about 60 protesters to a hall in Parma where the crowd had been assembled by local Republican officials. Then it was on through the rolling hills of Ohio and West Virginia, with stops at the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a rural Republican Party headquarters, to a rally in Wheeling at a remote high school set high above the hills and industrial plants.
 ''They're the only candidates that have morals and still have some leadership,'' said Daniel Stys, 67, the owner of a machine equipment company who had come to the rally in Parma because his daughter works for the Republican Party. ''I can't understand what Kerry's standing for. And as far as the economy, yes, it's improving.''
 But the crowds along the route reflected the toss-up nature of the state. At a McDonald's, people pointing thumbs down stood beside those cheering with thumbs up.
 Democrats were waiting, organizing protesters in Ohio and sending out news releases arguing that the Bush administration has hurt the steel industry with an end to steel tariffs and that tax cuts have been offset by increasing personal debt and lost manufacturing jobs.

HEADLINE: Swaying Unhappy Ohio Voters Could Be a Key to the Presidency

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: PORTSMOUTH, Ohio 

 BODY:
It is tempting to view Ohio politics as a bipolar clash: liberal Northeast versus conservative Southwest, industrial Cleveland against white-collar Cincinnati. But this year's presidential race may come down to people like Robert Burton in the gently rolling, easily overlooked hills of southeastern Ohio.
 Here, Appalachia meets the Midwest along the Ohio River, which carves a muddy border with Kentucky and West Virginia. The region is part New Deal Democrat, part Ronald Reagan Republican. The people are gimlet-eyed about politicians, fickle about political parties and adept at picking winners, from Jimmy Carter to George W. Bush.
 Mr. Burton captures the temperament. An electrician, his business has been hurt by textile and steel plant closings. He nearly spits in disgust that a Wal-Mart Super Center will soon replace a coke processing plant, exuding the kind of burning resentment Senator John Kerry's campaign hopes to exploit. 
 ''The best business around here is the U-Haul business,'' Mr. Burton, 36, said recently.
 Yet for all his frustration about Republican stewardship of the economy, Mr. Burton is equally dismayed by the Democrats' support for abortion rights, gun control and welfare programs. Asked whom he plans to vote for, he says he is leaning toward President Bush. 
 But he is far from sure.
 ''I'm a Republican until it comes to economic policy,'' he said. ''Then I'm in no man's land. And there are a lot more people like me.''
 Mr. Burton helps explain why the Kerry campaign has high hopes for Ohio -- and why it still faces high hurdles in trying to win it. Victory here could be pivotal: no Republican has won the presidency without carrying Ohio. No surprise, then, that Mr. Bush has visited the state 18 times since 2001.
 ''I don't see how the president wins without carrying Ohio,'' Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, said.
 But Democratic victory will also require convincing fence straddlers like Mr. Burton that Mr. Kerry has the right character, experience and message to run the country. So far, polls and interviews show, Mr. Kerry has yet to do that, despite having spent about $7 million in the state. (Labor unions and private groups opposing Mr. Bush have spent about $6 million more.)
 In dozens of conversations across the state, many voters asserted that they knew little about Mr. Kerry, or did not like what they had heard about him. Many support his economic policies but distrust him as a Northeastern liberal. Some expressed unease about changing leaders in a time of war and terrorism. 
 And others had clearly been influenced by the $9 million in advertising, much of it attacking Mr. Kerry's character, that the Bush campaign has already broadcast in the state. 
 ''I think Kerry's too negative,'' said Mark Allbaugh, 39, a fifth-grade teacher from Dennison in eastern Ohio. ''I haven't seen a whole lot in him that I like.''
 But Mr. Allbaugh remains undecided. He disapproves of the American military occupation of Iraq, dislikes President Bush's signature education program, No Child Left Behind, and believes the administration has mishandled the economy.
 ''I'm not really fond of either candidate,'' he said. ''I thought Bush was down to earth, told you what he thought, like a normal person. But once he got into office, he changed.''
 Such skepticism helps explain why Ohio has been a presidential bellwether for decades -- and is perhaps the most closely watched swing state this year.
 Sometimes called the state of presidents, having produced seven of them, Ohio has voted with the winner in every national election since 1960. In 2000, Mr. Bush won Ohio by less than 4 points, after Vice President Al Gore pulled his advertising just weeks before the election, believing he was trailing by 10 points.
 Recent polls indicate the race will be tight again. Several surveys earlier in the year showed Mr. Kerry with a slim margin. A more recent poll in The Cleveland Plain Dealer had Mr. Bush with a 47 percent to 41 percent lead. 
 Eric Rademacher, co-director of the Ohio Poll at the University of Cincinnati, said Ohio had closely reflected national attitudes and demographic trends for decades. The rural South, the agricultural Midwest and the industrial Great Lakes flow together here.
 Labor unions, though shrinking, remain influential. So do conservative Christian groups. The Republican Party, which has dominated the state for a decade, has a history of moderation, as embodied in its senators, George V. Voinovich and Mike DeWine. 
 But this year, Ohio could be different in one crucial way, Mr. Rademacher said: its economy was harder hit by the downturn than most states and has been slower to recover. 
 Since 2001, the state has lost 200,000 jobs. It is ranked among the bottom states in personal income growth and retaining college graduates. And though there are signs of new job growth, the 5.6 percent unemployment rate in May was still well above the 4 percent of December 2000.
 ''The real challenge for both Bush and Kerry is convincing Ohioans that they have an economic plan that will put the state back on track,'' Mr. Rademacher said. 
 The lagging economy has energized Democrats, who have maintained a laser-like focus on the issue. Mr. Kerry has been in the state eight times since wrapping up the nomination in March, usually to talk about the economy.
 ''It will all boil down to jobs,'' said Dennis L. White, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ''Try sending your kid to college working at a Taco Bell.''
 For months, union workers and canvassers from private liberal groups, like America Coming Together and MoveOn.org, have been going door to door across the state registering new voters and criticizing Mr. Bush's policies, like lifting tariffs on imported steel.
 Democrats are hoping their efforts will generate a huge turnout of angry and anxious voters determined to oust Mr. Bush. One of their targets has been Stark County, a swing county surrounding Canton in the northeast, which was rocked by the recent announcement that the Timken Company would be closing three plants and laying off 1,300 workers. The company, whose founding family are major contributors to the Republican Party, has been an economic mainstay in Stark County for nearly a century. 
 Dave Drummond, 48, is a line supervisor at a Timken bearing plant in Canton who expects to lose his job. He did not vote in 2000. But his union, the United Steelworkers of America, registered him this year and there is little doubt about how he will vote. 
 ''Bush is out the door,'' he said. ''Kerry, some of his views are good, some are bad. I just want him for the change.''
 Republicans argue that the economy is stabilizing and that voters will focus on national security and character issues. Both play to Mr. Bush's strengths, they contend. 
 ''He's had a horrible couple of months,'' said Mike Allen, the Hamilton County prosecutor and director of the Bush campaign in southwestern Ohio. ''But the numbers show he's weathered that storm. I think it's because people trust the guy.''
 Still, Republicans say they are taking no chances. They have mounted their largest get-out-the-vote operation in history, recruiting more than 40,000 volunteers and organizing registration drives in Republican-leaning suburbs and rural areas. Their goal, which they say they are close to exceeding, is to add more than 100,000 pro-Bush voters to the rolls. 
 ''The Democrats had a much better ground operation than us in 2000,'' said Robert T. Bennett, chairman of the state Republican Party. ''That's not going to happen this year.''
 The Bush-Cheney operation in Brown County, one of several rapidly growing exurban counties ringing Cincinnati, exemplifies the kind of well-oiled operation the Republicans hope to replicate in dozens of other counties.
 Almost weekly, Republican organizers gather in local businesses to call unregistered voters, recruit volunteers and put together lists of people who are likely to vote for President Bush among the upscale, mostly white and independent voters who have moved into their county. 
 ''We can't win if we just get out 3,000 Republicans to the polls,'' said Paul Hall, chairman of the Brown County Republican Party. ''We need to get 10,000 independents to counterbalance Cleveland.'' 
 In their bastions, the two parties are mostly focusing on the core issues of jobs, trade, national security, character and experience. But the race is a bit different in rural areas, like southeastern Ohio, where cultural issues are likely to play a larger role. 
 The National Rifle Association will be influential here, with its anti-Kerry message. But so will labor unions. Recently, the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America; and a host of other labor leaders rolled into Portsmouth to deliver the Democrats' central message.
 ''This fight is not about the right to bear arms, the right to pray in school, the right to choose,'' Mr. Jackson told a crowd of several hundred people gathered around a Civil War memorial to Union soldiers. ''This fight is about the right to have a job.''
 In the rear of the crowd, Edward Shouse, 61, listened intently. The pastor of a local African-American church, he has seen his congregation fall on hard times because of layoffs. It has affected him, too: he cannot afford health insurance for his wife. 
 Yet he remains undecided about the election. He admires Mr. Bush's character, though he is unhappy with administration policies on Iraq and the economy. But while he is open to Mr. Kerry, there is something about the Democrat he does not quite trust.
 ''I haven't heard either man say the right thing yet,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cutting Edge In the Arts Now Is Joining a PAC

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
IN a bygone era -- say, 18 months ago -- Laura Owens, a painter, might have seemed to be pioneering a new form of performance art. On Tuesday night, Ms. Owens, one of the most critically embraced young artists in America, whose dreamlike work hung at this year's Whitney Biennial, was standing among studiously scruffy art-world types in a Manhattan gallery, dressed in a trim khaki pantsuit of the sort popular inside the Beltway in summer.
 ''This generation has yet to find its Bobby Kennedy,'' Ms. Owens, 33, said with the earnest idealism one would expect from a Capitol Hill intern. She spoke of Ralph Nader, of John Kerry, of coming to grips at long last with your father's -- or at least her father's -- Democratic party. ''It's 'anyone but Bush' now,'' she said. ''There's a hunger.'' 
 This all sounded so unironic that it almost had to be ironic. But Ms. Owens's recent political awakening -- she had never felt so passionate about an election, she said -- is not unusual in the downtown creative world this year. Most certainly, it was not unusual in that room, Gavin Brown's Enterprise at Passerby gallery on West 15th Street. Ms. Owens had flown from Los Angeles to preside, along with other art stars like Cecily Brown and Elizabeth Peyton, over a Democratic fund-raising event, ''Art Works for Hard Money.'' The evening's silent auction benefited a political action committee, Downtown for Democracy, which is suddenly more sought after than a hole-in-the wall gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
 ''There's always been a lot of liberal rhetoric that you associate with any arts community, but it usually doesn't translate into action,'' said Dale Peck, 36, a novelist and critic, who helped organize a reading at Cooper Union to benefit Downtown for Democracy, which included Jonathan Safran Foer, Dave Eggers and Jhumpa Lahiri. ''But something about this presidency galvanizes a response.'' 
 ''The word 'cool' is probably appropriate,'' Mr. Peck said. ''It's 'fashionable' to hate George Bush right now.'' 
 At least it may be among a swath of the New York art, design and literary worlds. How fashionable? On Bleecker Street, Marc Jacobs has filled his store windows with stridently anti-Bush-administration posters and sells T-shirts (950 in one weekend), whose proceeds go to Downtown for Democracy. James Chance, an underground music legend, headlined a concert in Park Slope, Brooklyn, last month to benefit the group, which raises money for causes like winning senate seats in close races. This summer, benefit dinners will be given at the homes of the graphic designer Fabien Baron and the architect Annabelle Selldorf.
 Rarely have so many members of New York's younger artistic elite, who often affect an above-it-all air toward party politics, made such a mad dash to get involved. It is as if the cool kids at school are suddenly obsessed with student council. 
 It is even more striking to see such artists, particularly those under 40, coalesce for a political action committee -- an enterprise synonymous to many with politics at its most cynical. But among the artists and writers who have become involved, the burst of energy is almost palpable. ''By now, most people can name the swing states,'' Mr. Foer, 27, said. ''But do you know the swing districts within the swing states?''
 Mr. Foer was already planning a political benefit reading of his own when he heard of Downtown for Democracy. It has contributed to the congressional campaign of Jesse Jackson Jr., Democrat of Chicago; plans to buy get-out-the-vote advertisements in The Fader and other indie magazines; and will help finance America Coming Together, which organizes grass-roots campaigning in swing states. 
 In fact, not everyone in the arts finds it fashionable to hate George Bush. ''Some friends of mine actually listen to Rush Limbaugh while they paint,'' said Judith Pond Kudlow, who helped found the Harlem Studio of Art, an art school and studio complex. (She is also the wife of Lawrence Kudlow, a CNBC talk show host.) ''They just don't get involved politically because they're involved in their work.''
 Since November, Downtown for Democracy has raised about $350,000, largely through ticket sales to readings and concerts for $50 to $75 and auctions of artworks ranging from a few hundred dollars to $5,000. Those ''hard money'' funds can be given directly to candidates. The group hopes to raise $1 million by the election.
 ''Any PAC that is going to raise $1 million, that's a significant amount in politics,'' said Cecile Richards, daughter of the former Texas governor Ann Richards and president of America Votes, an organization based in Washington that coordinates strategy for left-leaning political action committees. 
 But Republican fund-raisers in New York are less impressed by the effort, including Tuesday's art auction, which raised $80,000. ''The reality is, that's not a lot of money, especially in a city like New York, where there's so much competition to get your message out,'' said Alexandra Preate, the chief executive of Political Capital LLC, a consulting company, which also organizes Republican fund-raisers. In a city filled with many quiet but well-compensated young Republicans, it is not impossible to keep pace with young McSweeney's readers shelling out $75 in a night. ''Young people in the city are raising $100,000 apiece for Bush-Cheney,'' Ms. Preate said. 
 Downtown for Democracy is not alone in politicizing creative people. In a sense, the group has become something of a punky younger sibling to ARTS PAC, founded by the gallery owner Ronald Feldman, which has raised millions of dollars for the Democratic Party. That low-profile, big-money organization was a co-sponsor, with America Coming Together, of a far more august silent auction (tickets were $1,000, not $75) on Tuesday right next door to Gavin Brown, at Phillips, de Pury & Company, raising $2.1 million. In addition to these two, to protest the Republican National Convention in New York Aug. 30 to Sept. 2, dozens of art groups, including Dance Theater Workshop and the Poetry Club, are planning four nights of political theater around town.
 Eli Pariser, the executive director of the left-wing MoveOn PAC, acknowledged that Downtown for Democracy's hoped-for $1 million war chest was not huge. ''But in an election where the vote margin may come down to a couple of hundred votes like last time, it matters a lot,'' he said. ''It's part of a TV-ad buy, or a number of staff working on the ground in key battleground states.'' 
 MoveOn is the grass-roots fund-raising organization whose guerrilla chic helped inspire Downtown for Democracy founders. Mr. Pariser attended the Cooper Union author reading, which attracted about 1,800 ticket buyers. ''One Dave Eggers story isn't going to swing a lot of swing voters,'' he said, ''but it's bigger than that. You know, voting hasn't been hip. Now, it might be.''
 Voting was not always so cool even among Downtown for Democracy's founders. Few of its 10 original organizers claim prior formal political involvement. The group, most of whose members are in their 30's, began to coalesce loosely in the winter of 2003 after the invasion of Iraq. Too young to have experienced the fierce partisan battles of the Nixon years, many found themselves inspired to see thousands take to the streets in antiwar protests. 
 ''It felt really weird to get involved,'' said Ariana Speyer, 32, another of the group's founders, who is the editorial director of Index Magazine, a barometer of countercultural chic that counts Thurston Moore, of Sonic Youth, as a contributor. ''We were magazine people. Politics wasn't usually at the top of our agenda.'' 
 The group formed a coordinating council of younger members, mostly in their mid-20's, who organized both of the group's rock shows. Meanwhile, some older, more established figures like Mr. Jacobs's business partner, Robert Duffy, aligned themselves with the group. Besides turning a Marc by Marc Jacobs shop into a virtual campaign storefront, Mr. Duffy plans to be the host of a party for Downtown for Democracy after the Marc Jacobs show during Fashion Week in September. ''It's not a corporate decision,'' he explained. ''It's just something I chose to do. I'm questioning what's going on with the war.''
 Erik Stowers, 31, the political action group's one full-time employee, who works at its headquarters on North 11th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that the group's research indicates about 85 percent of its contributors have never given to any candidate or party before. 
 ''It backs up our suspicions that you have this huge class of people who work in culture and information industries that are driving our economy, who are liberal culturally, but they really weren't doing very much,'' Mr. Stowers said. ''A lot of people have worked on the environment or gay rights, and those things are important. But unlike the Christian right, which tends to focus on winning elections, liberals have tended to place their energies into issue advocacy and have not directly engaged in elections. It's a famous quote that 'the left won the culture wars, the right won the elections.' ''

HEADLINE: Mexico's 'Tomato King' Seeks a New Title

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: JEREZ, Mexico, July 4 

 BODY:
For anyone in Milwaukee wondering why a south-side bar named Alex's Place suddenly closed for business two weeks ago, its Mexican owners rushed here to support a burgeoning movement aimed at giving this country's vast population of migrants real political power back home.
 Today, those owners, Alejandro ''Alex'' de la Torre and his wife, Carmen Ribota, fight for the mayor's office. Tomorrow: the presidency.
 The couple returned home to vote in a tiny election on Sunday that is considered a bellwether in the merging worlds of Mexican and American politics, a sleepy town on the arid plains of northern Mexico. They want to elect a trash-talking, kind-hearted millionaire migrant named Andres Bermudez as mayor. 
 With his thick gold chains, shiny satin suits, and black cowboy hats, Mr. Bermudez sometimes looks more like a small-time gangster than a serious candidate for public office. But 35 years after he hid in the trunk of a car and sneaked illegally into the United States, Mr. Bermudez, 53, has become a kind of folk hero in a nation desperate for leaders they can believe in, and a symbol to millions of Mexicans who earn their living north of the border but invest their hopes to the south.
 His fortune comes from growing tomatoes in central California. His down-to-earth -- some say down-and-dirty -- personal style drives his fame. Most people know him as ''the tomato king.''
 ''He is our hope for the future,'' said Ms. Ribota, a naturalized American who has lived in the United States for more than 35 years. ''Someday, I want to come home to Jerez. But first I want people like Andres to come and make things better.''
 The Sunday election is the tomato king's second attempt to become mayor of Jerez, a staunchly Catholic community that, like most of the state of Zacatecas, has seen its population depleted steadily during the past two decades by migration to the United States. An estimated 800,000 people from the state now live north of the border, leaving Zacatecas with a population of about 1.3 million. 
 Mr. Bermudez won the office by a wide margin three years ago. But electoral courts disqualified him from serving because he did not meet state residency requirements.
 Rodolfo Garcia Zamora, a political observer and a professor at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas, said government officials, who only halfheartedly supported Mr. Bermudez's campaign, believed that his popularity would fall as fast as it had risen. They were wrong.
 Mr. Garcia said that although Mr. Bermudez had joined the state's least popular party and endured scathing and mostly unfounded accusations by his opponents -- in an interview, the candidate Otilio Rivera described Mr. Bermudez as a drunk known to urinate in public -- he had a strong chance of winning the race for mayor on Sunday. Final results were not likely to be known until Monday.
 ''I come to open doors for all migrants,'' Mr. Bermudez said in an interview on the election eve. ''The same way we left and conquered another country, we are coming back to reclaim our own.''
 Migrants have dominated the national spotlight in Mexico since the election four years ago of President Vicente Fox. Mr. Fox, a native of Guanajuato, another high-migration state in northern Mexico, hails migrants as national heroes for sending home an estimated $14 billion a year. 
 Mr. Fox unsuccessfully pressed the United States to give legal status to an estimated three million undocumented Mexicans who work there. Last month, he sent a proposal to the Mexican Congress that would give Mexicans in the United States the power to vote in this country's presidential elections without returning home.
 The proposal does not provide details about the logistics and financing for such an enormous undertaking -- experts estimate that two million to six million Mexicans would cast ballots across the United States. It also remains unclear whether a divided Mexican Congress will support the proposal. 
 ''The bottom line is that not a single political party wants to include us because they do not know how we would vote,'' said Guadalupe Gomez, the former president of the influential Federation of Zacatecanos of Southern California who came here two weeks ago to support Mr. Bermudez. ''Since most of us were forced to leave Mexico because our government was not capable of supporting our families, the least they could do is give us our rights.''
 Last year, under pressure from migrants who send about $2 million a day to this state, Governor Ricardo Monreal signed a constitutional reform that ended the residency requirements, opened elected offices to Mexicans born in the United States whose parents are natives of this state, and set aside two seats in the legislature for migrants only.
 Four migrants are expected to test those reforms in state elections on Sunday. Among them is the political operative Manuel de la Cruz, who swam across the Rio Grande around the same time Mr. Bermudez was riding in the trunk of a car into California. Martin Carvajal, a furniture vendor and immigrant activist who lives in Fort Worth, is running for mayor in his native village of Apulco.
 None of the candidates, it seemed, have sparked as many imaginations as the tomato king. His campaign -- marked by promises to ''make Jerez more like America'' -- has brought back migrants of all ages who said they are fed up with decades of poverty, political corruption and impunity. Others saw the campaign as an opportunity to give back a little of all they have received.
 ''We have learned a lot in the United States,'' said Juan de la Torre, who builds docks along the coast of Southern California. ''Now we want to use what we have learned to make real changes in Mexico. And we need politicians, like Andres, who will listen to us, not shut the door.''
 The couple from Alex's Place said it was time Mexico gave something back for all it gets from its migrants.
 ''We help maintain the economy of this country with our hard work,'' Ms. Ribota said. ''We deserve to have a voice and a vote.''

HEADLINE: Pools Above Ground Help Keep a City Cool

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
This weekend, the rising temperatures drove many New York City dwellers to the shore, the mountains or the air-conditioning.
 In the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, the heat drove most people off Sackett Street. One homeowner there, Gloria Bonilla, 72, grimaced as she stepped out to dump the garbage. She was asked if she had a pool. 
 ''Do I got a pool?'' she snapped back. ''I got 11 grandchildren. I better have a pool.'' She took this reporter's hand and walked him through her ground-floor apartment to her back deck. There, behind the town houses and low-rise apartments, was Brooklyn's lake country: clusters of round, blue ponds separated by low fences.
 Adults and children reveled in chlorinated wetness in Mrs. Bonilla's pool and three others in adjacent backyards. Her grandson Stephen, 7, used a toy fishing pole to reel in a six-foot inflatable shark. In the next yard, a drowsy woman in a bikini floated around in circles on an inflatable raft, oblivious to the children and the neighbor in an adjacent yard using a chainsaw.
 ''We got at least 10, maybe 12 pools on this block,'' Mrs. Bonilla said. ''We just like pools. You don't think of private pools in the city, but you need them much more than in the suburbs. There's no relief.''
 The aboveground pool, a fixture of suburban yards in the 1970's and 1980's, is less prevalent there now. Economic booms and soaring real estate values have prompted many suburbanites to invest in elaborate in-ground pools or fancy hot tubs. 
 But aboveground pools remain popular in much of New York City -- not only on Staten Island and in more suburban sections of Queens and the Bronx, but also in urban sections behind brownstones, small apartment buildings and multifamily houses.
 Sunken pools are rare in the city because many people are renters, not owners, and there is less disposable income and little yard space. Also, it is often impossible to excavate for a sunken pool. But the aboveground pool is alive and well (albeit often hidden behind rows of attached homes), especially for urbanites who cannot easily get to nice beaches or shy away from public pools.
 Mrs. Bonilla said she recently bought her $2,500 aboveground pool, replacing a similar one she bought 30 years ago.
 ''Best investment I ever made,'' said Mrs. Bonilla. ''They wanted $7,000 to build me one of those fancy in-ground pools. Seven grand? Forget it.''
 Dean Salvane, 48, who for 30 years has managed Dizzy Dean's, a pool store in the Morris Park section of the Bronx, said sales of aboveground pools in the city have never been better.
 ''The aboveground pool mimics a more expensive product and is very affordable to the working class,'' Mr. Salvane said. ''This is New York City and people feel safe in their own yards, so they want to make their home their castle and build a little country club in their backyard.''
 Prices for aboveground pools start at about $1,500, he said, delivered and installed.
 ''It's something a struggling young family in the city can afford,'' he said. ''Compare it to trucking the kids to the beach. You got gas, tolls and food. Take a family of five to Disneyland, and guess what the little mouse is going to rip out of your pocket? About $6,000. You know what kind of pool you could get for that?''
 On Saturday morning, customers flooded the store, buying filters, chemicals and pool liners. Some asked if they could have a pool installed in time for a Fourth of July barbecue.
 One customer, Lori Masciarelli, 35, said she has the same figure-eight-shaped pool her parents bought her as a child. Thirty years and three pool liners later, her children, Dean and Juliana, now enjoy it.
 ''They're in it every day,'' she said. ''Look at the tans on them.''
 By noon, Muliner Avenue nearby had become an unforgiving stretch of sun-baked asphalt. But in the Citronellis' backyard, things were cool as can be.
 Their shallow 12-by-24-foot aboveground pool is not far from a four-story apartment building, and shouts and splashes echoed along the block-long courtyard formed by the buildings.
 The pool takes up virtually every square foot of the Citronellis' backyard. A similar pool next door in the Crastos' yard is about three feet away and the kids hop from one to the other, over a low fence and under a clothesline.
 Eddie Citronelli watched his three children doing cannonballs off a wooden deck into the pool.
 Mr. Citronelli, a bishop of a network of Pentecostal churches called The Bible Churches of Christ International Ministry, said he has used the pool to baptize churchgoers.
 ''One year, we baptized 15 people here at one time,'' he said.
 On DeGraw Street in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, there are three adjacent buildings with pools. The middle one belongs to the Gormans.
 Ginny Gorman said that she and her husband, Bill, bought the pool to help keep their four children, ages 10 through 18, spending summers in the backyard, rather than on the street.
 ''It helps keep the kids grounded,'' Mrs. Gorman said. ''It keeps them off the street and occupied, not looking for something else to do. The city is an ugly place to be sometimes. My 15-year-old daughter is little and blonde and cute, and I don't want her wandering the streets. Here, I know she's fine.''

HEADLINE: For Bantu Refugees, Hard-Won American Dreams

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
For Abkow Edow, a Bantu refugee from Somalia who now lives in Tucson, the Fourth of July was just another day. Though fireworks on the mountain and a reggae concert were scheduled, Mr. Edow was washing dishes at the Westin La Paloma Resort and Spa, wearing a baseball cap and thick rubber gloves that came up to his elbows. His wife, Madina Idle, was folding sheets and towels several corridors away in the vast underground complex below the desert views, the fountains and the valet golf carts.
 But work is good. If the Fourth was just another day, it was a day in an extraordinary year for the couple, their two children and a grandson.
 Mr. Edow, 57, and Ms. Idle, 42, have found themselves, after 12 years in refugee camps, at the end of the rainbow: America. 
 ''In Somalia, I dreamed of the United States, even though I didn't know anything about it,'' Mr. Edow said, speaking through a translator like the other Bantu adults interviewed. America represents opportunity, Bantu refugees say, which involves hard work, struggles with English, discarding cultural ways -- like the physical disciplining of children and arranged marriages -- and a wary assimilation with Americans and other refugee groups in Tucson.
 For them, independence is not a holiday but a daily engagement.
 Mr. Edow (pronounced EE-doh) and Ms. Idle (pronounced EE-dalay) are part of a continuing resettlement of 13,000 Bantu people from Somalia, descendants of people kidnapped from southern Africa by Arab slave traders two centuries ago. As part of one of the most ambitious relocations of political refugees by the United States in recent history, the Bantu couple arrived in Tucson in May 2003 from a Kenyan camp. They were uneducated, unemployed and unfamiliar with basic facts of American life like electrical appliances and indoor plumbing.
 Now Mr. Edow and Ms. Idle drive themselves to work in their own car, a Ford Escort they bought in September. They shop at 99-cent stores. They pay the $635 rent for their three-bedroom apartment. The children, a 15-year-old and two 8-year-olds, are in school, earning good grades and, like other Bantu children, school officials say, outperforming the general student population. Mr. Edow is saving money to buy a house. 
 ''Every month I pay rent,'' he said, sitting in his kitchen with a bare foot propped on his seat, a cellphone in his hand and a videotape of ''Shrek'' entertaining his children in the next room. ''It's good to own a house. It belongs to you.''
 Mr. Edow, who could not read numbers a year ago, knows what a down payment is. In May, he applied for a green card, celebrating his application with a red, white and blue cake.
 The availability of entry-level jobs in the hospitality industry has made Tucson a popular destination for the resettlement of Bosnians, Afghans and Liberians. There are 71 Bantu people, and more than 100 are expected by the end of the year.
 Mr. Edow and Ms. Idle escaped from Somalia to Kenya on foot, a 10-day walk without food. In Somalia, Mr. Edow said, he watched as his father was executed with a hammer and nails.
 Now, in life-skill classes that supplement daily English classes, Bantu parents learn that hitting their children is discouraged, though that was how they were disciplined in Africa. They make a wary peace with African-Americans at home and at school who consider them foreign. They learn that Fourth of July fireworks are exploded to entertain, not kill, and that being hit by a water balloon, as Bantu children were in one incident at school, is a game and not a hateful fight.
 At work, the Bantu refugees learn how to prepare hotel amenities, like placing courtesy soaps and folding the tips of the toilet tissue, though they used pit latrines in Kenya and Somalia and had never seen a toilet.
 But caseworkers, school officials and employers say the Bantus are making the most remarkable progress of the refugee groups in Tucson, given that they arrived with the most remarkable disadvantages: the trauma of tribal war in Somalia, where the Bantus were considered low-caste and denied opportunities for education and employment, and a rural ignorance of Western culture and modern life.
 The Bantu refugees had to be taught to tell time, an accomplishment that fills them with pride.
 Wall clocks and calendars decorate many Bantu homes in Mission Vista, an 80-unit apartment complex where many, including Mr. Edow and Ms. Idle, live.
 ''I adjusted to time,'' said Makai Osman, 38, a Bantu friend of Ms. Idle's who lives in Mission Vista with her husband, Mudey Libange, 36, and their five children. ''I was scared, but I'm punctual now.''
 Though job training required professional coaches, Karen Vallecillo, the director of human resources at the Westin La Paloma, gave the Bantu refugees high marks.
 ''They were a group that had been through pretty atrocious things, probably more than any other group,'' Ms. Vallecillo said. ''Learning to trust authority again probably took them a little longer.''
 Twelve languages, including four Somali dialects, are spoken at the hotel, which has 500 employees, 25 percent of whom are refugees.
 ''We'd be lost without our partnerships with refugee agencies,'' Ms. Vallecillo said. ''We don't seem to be able to raise American citizens to want to take these kinds of jobs.''
 The federal government organized the relocation effort but contracted with agencies, like the International Rescue Committee in Tucson, to provide financial support and social services to the refugees in each city. 
 At Mission Vista one Friday, Ms. Osman's son, Abdullahi Osman, 15, sat at home at the dining table, homework assignments and an English-Somali dictionary in his lap.
 Several Bantu friends have taken jobs when they turned 16 to help their parents. Older children like Abdullahi's sister, Halima Osman, who is 13, run the home while their parents work, taking care of younger brothers and sisters and the children of other families as well.
 ''Until I finish my education, I don't want to do anything else,'' said Abdullahi, who dreams of becoming a doctor. He said that books were his most valued possessions, though he checks them out of the public library. Abdullahi's girlfriend, a Bantu he met in Kenya, was relocated to Salt Lake City. They speak on the telephone. 
 ''If I stay for a long time and I have money, I want to go and meet, and see how she is,'' he said.
 As Abdullahi spoke, children from other families entered or left the apartment, or opened the door to peek. Each Bantu family has its own apartment, but as is most familiar to them as villagers and camp internees, they visit frequently and without formality.
 ''I know in American culture, if someone is going to visit you, he's going to call, 'What time are you going to visit?''' said Ms. Osman, sitting forward with determination, legs apart, elbows on her knees, her sandaled feet embellished by designs in henna. ''For us, it's not a big deal. People can visit us anytime.''
 Ms. Osman gave a brief tour of her apartment.
 ''I have a lot of stuff,'' she said, with a small laugh. ''I don't want to move it somewhere.''
 Ever present is the memory, still as strong as reality, of the long relocation route. With arrival in America has come miles and miles of documentation, regulation, offices and appointments. In speaking with the Bantu refugees, in the patient looks in their faces and in the acceptance in their attitudes toward caseworkers, teachers, employers and even strangers, there is a palpable sense that the stop in Tucson could be a stage in an unending journey if they do not acquiesce to the bewildering bureaucracy.
 ''With most refugees, until they've gotten their citizenship, there's always that feeling that it's just not real,'' said Karen Bailey, the community resource coordinator with the International Rescue Committee. 
 Ms. Osman, who became eligible for a green card in July, said forcefully: ''I want to be Tucsonian. I don't want to go back, no way. I don't dream at all of going back to Somalia.''
 But forgetting can be hard. 
 Outside, as the cool of the evening descended and the clouds above the desert blossomed in the sunset, four Bantu girls sat in a circle on the sidewalk playing shabko, a traditional game of tossing stones. Ms. Osman's daughter, Halima, who was shepherding the children, chased Mr. Abkow's son, Ahmed, 8, with a stick when he angered her by disobeying. Ahmed, crying, disappeared into the shadow of a building corridor, then returned silently to the group, like a shy dog, and sat behind a bush.
 ''In Somalia, we didn't know America,'' said Hamadi Musse, 16, whose best friend in Tucson is Hakim Rahimi, a 14-year-old Afghan boy.
 Hakim and his family lived in Pakistan before being resettled here six months ago. Hakim worked from 4 a.m. until 8 p.m. laying floors in Pakistan. 
 ''We saw on TV, the American people,'' he said. 
 Hamadi, who goes to school and helps his brother at his job at a Boston Market restaurant, said of his new life, ''I don't have time for watching TV.''

HEADLINE: China's Boom Brings Fear of an Electricity Breakdown

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 4 

 BODY:
With the hottest days of summer fast approaching, Shanghai is making preparations to seed clouds over the city to make it rain, in the hope that a couple of degrees of reduced temperatures will help ward off brownouts, or worse, here in China's commercial capital. 
 Even now, city inspection teams are visiting factories and ordering the least efficient energy consumers to be closed down, and thermostats are being raised in public offices. City officials say they are even contemplating shutting down the huge flashing advertising signs that made the Bund, or downtown riverfront in Shanghai, China's largest city, the neon equivalent of Times Square. 
 With China projecting a 20-million-kilowatt shortfall in electricity supplies this year, actions like these are anything but isolated. With severe power shortages predicted for the country's southern and eastern regions, Guangzhou, China's third largest city, an industrial powerhouse, has had rationing since January, six months earlier than the emergency measures put into effect last year. 
 Discussions about China these days are often dominated by economic terms like ''overheating,'' and ''hard versus soft landings.''
 What is described as being at issue, typically, is whether the country's leaders can continue to manage this huge and increasingly complex economy successfully at growth rates that are among the world's fastest. 
 The rush to find short-term, sometimes even fanciful-sounding, palliatives for the country's power shortage, however, reflects creeping doubts of a more profound order. Those concerns have recently been expressed even at the level of China's normally serene and confident-sounding senior officials. 
 The worry, put bluntly, is that the world simply may not have enough energy and other resources for China to continue developing along present lines, especially at its present rate. Furthermore, sharply increased environmental damage might make the country unlivable, even if such growth could be sustained. 
 China's predicament is reflected in a simple statistic: this country is already the world's second-largest consumer of energy, and yet on a per capita basis, the Chinese consume scarcely 10 percent of the energy used by Americans.
 In material terms, the contemporary Chinese dream is not so different from the traditional American dream, of spacious homes full of power-consuming appliances and a car or two in the driveway, and therein lies the source of concern for the country's leaders -- and indeed for the world. As urbanization gathers pace here, there is a growing sense that such dreams will collide with intractable limits. 
 ''If we use the patterns of today, China cannot double its economy,'' said Chen Jinhai, director of the Shanghai provincial government's Energy Commission and Environmental Protection Department. ''We would need the energy of Mars or other planets. Our consumption may still be less than the U.S. or Japan, but the key for our future will have to be greater efficiency.'' 
 Mr. Chen is far from a lone voice speaking about the severe environmental and resource limitations that will challenge this country's seemingly irresistible rise of late. Indeed, his perspective echoes that of senior policy makers in Beijing. 
 ''If we continue with the massive consumption of resources, shortages will only get worse, it will become very hard to maintain stable, high-speed growth, and the economy risks declining greatly,'' wrote Ma Kai, director of the State Development and Reform Commission, in a sobering recent article in People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. ''Now we are at a key point in the industrialization and urbanization process. If we don't transform our economic model, we could lose the ability to grow.'' 
 For some, statements like those represent the dawning of a new kind of awareness, not unlike what happened in Japan between the outbreak of a huge industrial poisoning disaster at Minamata, in the 1960's, and the oil shocks of the 1970's, when that country began to question its blind pursuit of growth in its gross domestic product. 
 They also represent an acknowledgment that whether measured in use of resources, or increasingly, in use of capital itself, the very economic model that has given China growth rates that are the envy of the world is wasteful in the extreme. 
 According to Zhang Jun, a prominent Chinese economist who has made a comparative study of China and India, China consumes 3 times the energy and 15 times the amount of steel as its neighbor, even though the Chinese economy is only roughly twice as large, and is growing only about 10 percent faster than India's. 
 Part of this picture comes from an intensive focus on manufacturing and exports, which many economists say has led to overindustrialization and empty growth. A lot of the responsibility for wastefulness can be laid to duplication, with each province -- and indeed many city governments -- simultaneously pushing for the same kind of growth, based on industrial parks and manufacturing zones. The municipalities that boast of becoming China's Silicon Valley, to take one common example of this trend, are almost too numerous to count. 
 ''China will definitely be facing a huge, huge challenge in a decade or so if the growth patterns don't change,'' said Dr. Zhang, who is the director of the China Center for Economic Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''Ours is an extreme case of the East Asian model, and we are coming quickly toward the limitations in terms of the way we use energy, in terms of the environment, and even in terms of labor.'' 
 Dr. Zhang said the government had invited him and other economists to tour the provinces and lecture local governments on these realities in the hope of readjusting priorities, to little avail. 
 ''What we are facing is decentralization and the birth of developmental government in China,'' Dr. Zhang said. ''The local officials all say they understand the new perspectives, but that it has nothing to do with them. They all say, 'My job is to look after local economic development.' '' 
 The toll on China's environment from this growth-at-any-cost strategy has been truly alarming. China's official development goal is to build what the government calls a well-off society by the year 2020, yet today the very growth that makes such dreams permissible has left China with 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities, according to the World Bank. 
 Using standards that are relatively lax when compared with those of the United Nations, the Chinese government itself reckons that fewer than half of the country's cities have acceptably breathable air. 
 The government also says that 90 percent of urban residents face serious water pollution problems. By another estimate, 700 million Chinese must make do with contaminated drinking water. Even the country's seas are increasingly under siege from industrial pollution and are regularly choked by red tide infestations. 
 If the country's galloping energy needs have caught people's attention throughout China, mobilizing resources to protect the environment has been far more difficult. 
 ''There is nothing about China's environmental situation that is not critical,'' said Jiang Jilian, a member of Friends of Nature, a private Chinese environmental group. ''The government may have a sense they should do more about this, but they still have another priority -- economic development.''

HEADLINE: Europeans Glued to Euro 2004, Even Those Whose Team Lost

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
France, Germany, Italy, England and Spain, Europe's traditional soccer powers -- and its biggest television markets -- all flopped out of the Euro 2004 championships. Nonetheless, the tournament appears to have been a rousing success for broadcasters. 
 Through the quarterfinals of Euro 2004, which began June 13, the average match was watched by 14 percent more people than during the last European championships in 2000, according to Initiative, a media strategy firm that compiled data from television ratings agencies in 52 markets. 
 Across the markets tracked by Initiative, 118 million people tuned in to the first-round France-England match, which was decided in the final minutes. That figure eclipses the United States live audience of 89 million for last year's Super Bowl, the biggest television event of 2003, and 90 million for this year's Super Bowl, according to figures from Nielsen Media Research. 
 ''At a time when it's getting more and more difficult for programming to reach a mass audience,'' Kevin Alavy, an analyst at Initiative, said, soccer ''still has this elusive quality.'' 
 The final match last night was expected to attract an audience of up to 150 million, Mr. Alavy said. (Full ratings for the semifinals and last night's final match were not yet available.) Over all, he said, Euro 2004 was expected to be the most-watched European soccer championship ever. 
 In fact, because the 2002 soccer World Cup was played in the Far East, where the time difference made it inconvenient for live television viewing in Europe, the 16-team Euro 2004 will probably have the highest average ratings of any international soccer tournament since the 1998 World Cup, which took place in France, he said. 
 Indeed, in many European markets, particularly those in which home teams were involved in tense matches, the Euro 2004 games will represent the largest television audiences of the year. In Britain, for instance, 24.7 million people, at the peak, watched England lose to Portugal on penalty kicks in one quarterfinal. By contrast, the top-rated episode of a popular soap opera typically draws an audience of 15 million to 20 million, Mr. Alavy said. 
 During the week of June 14-20, 8 of the 10 most-watched television programs in Germany were Euro 2004 matches, according to Mediametrie, a ratings agency. The other two shows were a soccer commentary and a Formula One auto racing broadcast. 
 To be sure, advertisers, particularly the eight official sponsors, might have preferred to see the big teams stay around a bit longer. According to Initiative's analysis, television audiences in a given area more than double when a home team is involved. 
 Over all, among the 16 countries that sent teams to Portugal, the Netherlands had the most avid viewers; an average of 22.4 percent of the population tuned in. Latvians were the least interested; 8.3 percent watched the average match. (Latvia lost in the group stage, while the Dutch team made the semifinals before losing to Portugal.) 
 Because soccer has fewer timeouts than American sports, and because many broadcasts in Europe are on commercial-free public channels, the opportunities for conventional television advertising are more limited. That put a premium on official sponsorships for Euro 2004. Eight companies paid more than $15 million each for the right to place their logos inside stadiums, for example, ensuring that they would get some exposure throughout the games. 
 That does not guarantee that consumers take notice. A survey by TNS PhoneBus, published in Marketing Week magazine, showed that two of the eight sponsors, Coca-Cola and McDonald's, were recognized as sponsors by 16 percent of British consumers. Only 3 percent of those surveyed identified T-Mobile as a sponsor.

HEADLINE: At a Grand Hotel, a Trove of Modern Indian Art Comes Out of Hiding

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: MUMBAI 

 BODY:
When Mortimer Chatterjee, an art specialist, began poking through the immense Taj Mahal Hotel here, he made some impressive discoveries: masterpieces of Indian contemporary art forgotten in a storeroom and tucked away unnoticed in guest rooms.
 The collection's emerging history is a story of love and race interwoven with threads of India's difficult transition, first from a British possession to a fiercely independent country and now into an increasingly cosmopolitan part of the global economy.
 At least two abstract paintings by prominent artists were found hanging upside down in the hotel's hallways. Another valuable painting had a coffee stain. Paintings by three of India's best-known 20th-century artists -- Vasudeo Gaitonde, Jamini Roy and M. F. Husain -- had wound up with 250 other paintings in racks in a fourth-floor guest room converted into a storeroom. 
 ''It was a strange day for me when I went in,'' said Mr. Chatterjee, who found the paintings in the storeroom in late 2002 when he appraised the hotel's collection. 
 Vickram Sethi, the managing director of the nonprofit Arts Trust here, said that among collections of modern Indian art, ''in the list of the 20 best, it would find a mention.''
 Prices of contemporary Indian art have soared in the last eight years. Auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have opened offices in India and begun holding sales of contemporary Indian art in London and New York.
 Emigrant Indians abroad, especially in the United States, have grown wealthy and begun pursuing art from their home country. Contemporary art has also become fashionable among Indian industrialists, who have profited from the country's brisk economic growth since 1991, when the government dismantled much of the bureaucracy that used to regulate investments and production here. 
 The Indian government has been enforcing with increasing strictness a ban on the export of any art more than 100 years old, so demand has shifted to newer pieces that can be traded in and out of India. Some works that sold for less than $200 two decades ago now command prices of $50,000 and up, art collectors, dealers and artists say.
 In New York in 2002 Christie's auctioned a large triptych by Tyeb Mehta for $317,500, a record for modern Indian art although far below what top Western contemporary artists can command, said Mallika Sagar, the 20th-century Indian paintings specialist at Christie's.
 But it was decades earlier, at the Taj Mahal Hotel, that Elizabeth Kerkar, a Swiss citizen, helped start the careers of modern Indian artists like Mr. Gaitonde, Mr. Husain and Anjolie Ela Menon. As the interior decorator of the Taj, Mrs. Kerkar was one of the biggest buyers of contemporary Indian art through the 1960's, 70's and 80's. Before then, there were fewer than a dozen serious collectors of such art, mostly state-owned enterprises like Air India. 
 ''She collected thousands of pieces of art for almost nothing,'' Mrs. Menon recalled. ''The Taj owns at least 9 or 10 paintings of mine.''
 Syed Haider Raza, another Indian artist, now famous, whose work also hangs at the Taj, recalled that most Indian hotels still favored paintings of colonial-era European hunt scenes back when the Taj Mahal Hotel began buying paintings from him and other abstract artists. ''At a time when contemporary art was not appreciated in India, they acquired it,'' he said, standing on the hotel's veranda and admiring one of his own works, which uses brown and red blocky shapes evocative of the Rajasthan desert to the northwest.
 The Taj Mahal Hotel opened in 1903, at a time when the British barred all Indians, even maharajahs, from entering many of the best hotels. Jamshed Tata, a founder of the Tata industrial empire, responded by erecting the grandest and most lavish hotel in all of British India, catering to Indian and British visitors alike.
 The Taj held little art until Mrs. Kerkar's arrival. As a young art student in London in the mid-50's, she met and married Ajit Kerkar, a chemistry student from a prosperous Indian family and a talented cricket player.
 When the Kerkars moved to Mumbai, then called Bombay, in the early 60's, they joined the city's best swimming club, then still dominated by English expatriates. But their young daughter, Ursula, was not allowed to swim because she was of mixed race.
 ''It was enforced by Indian people,'' Mrs. Kerkar said with audible bitterness. ''They were employees there.''
 Nonetheless she fell in love with India. When her husband began managing the Taj Mahal Hotel in 1964, she became the decorator. She soon started collecting Indian art, working at first with Rodabeh Sawhny, the sister of J. R. D. Tata, who was then the chairman of the Tata empire, which still owns the hotel today.
 Mrs. Kerkar decorated each of the hotel's 600 rooms with a different combination of furniture, fabrics and art. Whenever something broke or needed replacing, she checked her voluminous handwritten files to find an appropriate replacement.
 But in late 1997 Mr. Kerkar was abruptly forced to retire as chairman of what he had built into an international chain of hotels, and Mrs. Kerkar left soon after. New managers at the Taj Mahal tried to standardize the rooms and give the hotel's public areas a look more in keeping with India's increasingly international economy.
 Paintings were shuffled among rooms, and a tenth of the collection was put in storage. Decorators selected locations for some paintings, but the housekeeping staff, which did not include an art expert, also moved many. The hotel lost Mrs. Kerkar's handwritten files.
 While preparing to celebrate the hotel's centennial, the Taj hired Mr. Chatterjee to make an inventory of the art. He lived in the hotel for nearly five months and found it a daunting task, not least because lingering hostility between the hotel and Mrs. Kerkar prevented him from ever meeting her.
 Mrs. Kerkar's and Mrs. Sawhny's identifying notations on the frames referred to the original locations of the paintings, many of which had since been moved, sometimes several times.
 ''They would say something like, 'This goes above the bed in Room X,' and they would be in an entirely different room,'' Mr. Chatterjee said.
 After his research the Roy, Husain and Gaitonde paintings in the storeroom were moved to the walnut-paneled reception area of the old wing. Other valuable paintings were moved from hotel rooms to locations where they can be monitored to reduce the possibility of theft.
 On a hot afternoon last year Mr. Raza stood in the air-conditioned reception area admiring the Gaitonde painting, rich in shades of red and orange, that had been rescued from the storeroom. ''It's fabulous,'' he said, then added, ''When it went up to $75,000, they take a look.''

HEADLINE: In Courting West Virginians, Bush Speaks of Military's Might

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W. Va., July 4 

 BODY:
President Bush said at a boisterous Fourth of July celebration on the steps of the West Virginia Capitol on Sunday that ''the founders would be proud of America today,'' and that American military action in Afghanistan and Iraq has made terrorists ''desperate'' and ''furious.''
 Mr. Bush's visit here was the ninth one of his presidency, and while the White House categorized it as an official visit, it had the trappings of a campaign stop. The crowd waved American flags and yelled, ''Four more years.'' 
 It was a sign of how critical a role this state, with only five electoral votes, may play this year that both Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney came through this weekend, Mr. Cheney on a bus tour that also took him to Ohio and Pennsylvania. In the 2000 election, they won West Virginia by about 41,000 votes, a rare Republican victory in a state where voter registration is heavily Democratic.
 But Mr. Bush's aides say that the state's conservative leanings, and its high percentage of military volunteers, gives Mr. Bush an opportunity to win the state again. Polls show him running nearly tied with Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic nominee.
 Mr. Bush's victory here four years ago, some experts believe, was propelled in part by Mr. Cheney's hint in Weirton, one of the state's steel-producing centers, that Mr. Bush would be willing to block the import of foreign-made steel that was undercutting local producers. 
 ''We will never lie to you,'' Mr. Cheney said in an October 2000 visit. ''If our trading partners violate trade laws, we will respond swiftly and firmly.'' Mr. Bush did impose retaliatory tariffs for a bit more than a year, before lifting them under pressure from automakers and other steel users.
 But with the unemployment rate here dropping -- it is now 5.2 percent, down from 6.4 percent last summer -- the state's economic troubles were barely mentioned. Instead, Mr. Bush dwelled almost entirely on themes growing out of his use of the military around the world. 
 Noting that George Washington had owned land around Charleston -- ''I call him George W.,'' he said to laughter -- he argued that the founders would be happy to see ''a nation which stands strong in the face of violent men.'' 
 For Mr. Bush, it was a return to the theme of America as an enforcer of justice, a theme that he has used less often in recent months since the publication of photographs showing the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American troops. 
 But those images have faded in recent weeks, and Mr. Bush, who was accompanied Sunday by his chief political adviser, Karl Rove, apparently felt comfortable returning to the theme without referring to the prisoner abuse scandal.
 He quoted the Fourth of July speech of a Democratic predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who has often been cited in recent speeches by Mr. Bush. 
 Roosevelt told troops in 1942 during World War II that they were fighting ''because Americans believe in 'the right to liberty under God.'''
 ''Today a new generation of Americans is wearing the same uniform,'' he said. ''They are serving the same creed. They are showing the same courage, and they make us proud every single day.''
 Twice he reminded his audience that he ''made a decision'' to engage America's enemies ''around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.'' 
 The crowds cheered at every reference to fighting terrorists. ''I think he could win here,'' said Justin Samples, a whitewater rafting guide from nearby Cross Lanes. ''This is one of the most patriotic states, he's popular, and Kerry hasn't shown up here.''

HEADLINE: Cheney on the Hustings: The Reluctant Candidate

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: ALTOONA, Pa., July 4 

 BODY:
By the second rally of his weekend campaign swing, Vice President Dick Cheney seemed to be getting the hang of it, delivering an entire line of his standard stump speech looking at the audience instead of the podium as he usually does.
 Then the audience got a little too excited. Their cheers forced him to read the same line twice. The vice president is a man who likes to get on with things. 
 ''You guys want to hear this speech or not?'' he asked, not angrily but not quite kidding.
 The vice president has never been much of one for campaigning, by his own account preferring serious discussion to the glib give and take of the trail. He does not so much deliver campaign speeches as he does read them in a flat monotone. He is certainly not one to lunge at a crowd; a wave from a distance will do. In 2000, President Bush repeatedly explained that he was not worried about Mr. Cheney as a campaigner, he valued him as an experienced Washington manager. And this weekend, as Mr. Cheney emerged from Washington on a three-state bus tour that was his first serious campaign swing for 2004, he showed little sign that he has come to see campaigning as much more than a chore.
 Shaking hands outside the Republican Party headquarters in East Lisbon, Ohio, he moved along the rope line with the emotionless efficiency of a shopper loading groceries onto the checkout belt, cocking one side of his mouth only slightly into a smile.
 Stopping at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, he shook almost no hands and said little more on a tour than ''that's great'' -- when shown a touch-screen machine that allowed his granddaughter to call up information on Joe Gibbs, the Washington Redskins coach.
 And delivering his standard laugh line on John Kerry's raising taxes -- ''at least the folks back in Massachusetts knew he was on the job'' -- he looked down at the podium and laughed to himself. 
 The Independence Day weekend bus tour provided perfect American imagery as backdrop: Mr. Cheney visited a monument to sailors and soldiers in Pittsburgh, threw out the first pitch at an Altoona Curve game here, and visited a firehouse barbecue and a pretty red brick town where a gleaming green 1937 Lincoln stood waiting to be driven outside the Republican Party headquarters. 
 Occasional protesters along the 320-mile route tried to emphasize his use of an obscenity on the Senate floor -- ''dirty mouth, dirty politics'' read one handwritten sign -- but the campaign showcased the vice president as family man. His 10-year-old granddaughter, Kate, traveled with him and his wife, Lynne, marching cheerfully in her white tennis shoes in front of her grandparents. Mr. Cheney told crowds at almost every stop that their first grandson had been born on Friday. 
 And the crowds at the major rallies had been assembled by local Republican officials, providing enthusiastic and hungry audiences for the vice president's speeches. 
 But Mr. Cheney, in his black tassel loafers and tie, seemed to move through much of the weekend perfunctorily. When a Little League team asked him to pose behind it at the Curve game, he did, then walked off without a single handshake or pat on the back to a young player. 
 He ran through the lines of his speeches quickly, and stuck to a strict script. The throwaway laugh lines that seemed to be ad libbed were -- as is standard for stump speakers -- the same ones he has used in speeches in the last several weeks. As he begins to attack Mr. Kerry, the presumed Democratic nominee, and the audience cheers, Mr. Cheney says, ''This is the good part of the speech.'' As he ridicules Mr. Kerry for comparing the current economy to the Great Depression, ''I don't know what history books they have over on the shelves at the Kerry campaign.'' (Mr. Cheney did alter this ever so slightly toward the end of the trip, saying ''headquarters'' instead of ''campaign.'') 
 At the stop in East Lisbon, he was greeted with a whistling and cheering audience outside the two-story red brick party headquarters. He waved, then quickly ducked inside.
 ''Well, that wasn't what I expected,'' said a miffed cameraman for WKBN in Youngstown. ''I've been here an hour and a half.''
 When Mr. Cheney emerged a few minutes later, he showed little interest in the vintage car, climbing into it for brief remarks that began less than rousingly: ''It's the first time we've used the sound system on top of the bus.''
 To illustrate that he understood the sacrifices of the troops in Iraq, he told the audience he had met a woman inside whose son was serving with the First Cavalry Division in Baghdad. He quickly moved on: ''We've got a minute to shake some hands.'' 
 He spent slightly more than a minute doing so. Then, as the crowd yelled ''Cheney! Cheney!'' he turned to an aide and said, ''We all set?'' and got on the bus, turning to wave once before turning and fidgeting his thumb over fingertips as he waited to sit down again.
 Campaign officials explained that security risks had kept Mr. Cheney from mingling more with crowds. But they said they were pleased with the reception he received, noting a standing ovation at the Curve game. ''I think his style is very effective,'' said Steve Schmidt, a campaign spokesman. ''He was a tremendous asset in 2000 and he'll be a tremendous asset in 2004.''
 And indeed, people among the Republican crowds at the rallies seemed impressed, and occasionally charmed.
 ''He reminds me of my dad,'' said Maria Milito, 37, a makeup artist who had come to see Mr. Cheney at a rally at the Soldiers and Sailors National Military Museum and Memorial in Pittsburgh. ''He's one of those people who gives you the feeling of being one. You can tell when someone's being authentic. He is.''
 Howard Segal, a pathologist's assistant at the rally with his wife and two children, said the vice president came across as confident. ''He's very subdued, his manner of speaking,'' Mr. Segal said. ''His wife was a better speaker than he was.''

HEADLINE: Bill to Allow Slot Machines Is Passed in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Pennsylvania lawmakers enacted sweeping legislation yesterday that authorizes as many as 61,000 slot machines -- the most in any state east of Nevada -- for horse tracks, resorts and slot parlors across the state, and will generate $1 billion a year, officials say, for reducing taxes.
 The plan is the most expansive gambling measure to be enacted by a state in several years, coming one year after New York and Maine legalized slot machines at race tracks, known as ''racinos.'' The vote is likely to put pressure on the Maryland legislature to enact similar legislation, some analysts said.
 Passage of the measure was a major political victory for Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat who championed property tax relief during his 2002 campaign. The Republican-controlled legislature rebuffed Mr. Rendell's gambling proposal last year, but he cobbled together enough Republican votes to win solid majorities in both houses this time. 
 ''Tonight the people of Pennsylvania are true winners,'' Mr. Rendell said after the House passed the bill early Sunday morning. The Senate passed it on Friday. ''We are beginning to reverse the tide of unfairly burdening Pennsylvania homeowners.''
 Pennsylvania officials estimate that within three years, slot machines in 14 locations will pour $1 billion a year into the state budget for reducing local property taxes around the state and income taxes in Philadelphia. Some revenue will be used for economic development programs.
 State officials contend homeowners in communities that agree to participate in a new tax-relief program will see their property taxes, which finance public schools, fall by an average of about $330 a year.
 Mr. Rendell had to overcome stiff opposition from conservatives, religious groups and government watchdog organizations who argued that gambling would increase corruption, crime and social problems like gambling addiction and bankruptcy.
 Slot machines now account for about three-quarters of casino revenues nationwide. Critics argue the entrancing machines take advantage of older, less sophisticated and poorer people. But gambling proponents contend that studies show that many slot players are relatively well educated and middle class.
 ''Slots are the most addicting'' of all gambling machines, said Representative Paul Clymer, a Republican who had led opposition to the bill. ''We're going to take money from the disadvantaged, the poor and the uneducated. We're preying on human weakness. This is a sad day for Pennsylvania.''
 To win over balky lawmakers, Mr. Rendell and his bipartisan legislative allies included a plan to use some gambling revenues to help finance the kinds of development projects that are important to lawmakers' re-election campaigns, including sports arenas, convention centers and tourism programs. 
 The bill's authors had also included a provision that would have allowed legislators to own as much as 5 percent of gambling companies. But when The Philadelphia Inquirer revealed the provision last week, legislative leaders reduced the amount to 1 percent. Still, anti-corruption groups said lawmakers should not be allowed to own any part of a gambling operation.
 Casino companies weighed in with huge lobbying operations, fighting both for and against the measure. Officials and gambling firms in Delaware and West Virginia, which have racinos, as well as in Atlantic City argued that their areas would be hurt by gambling in Pennsylvania. 
 Atlantic City, just an hour from the Philadelphia area, which could get four or more slot sites, may be hardest hit, experts said. With that in mind, several firms, particularly Harrah's Entertainment, have begun acquiring interests in Pennsylvania racetracks and businesses that are eligible for gambling licenses. 
 Maryland is considering a plan advocated by Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, to legalize slot machines to help finance education. Democrats blocked the measure earlier this year. But Mr. Ehrlich has sought to use Pennsylvania's moves to pressure the legislature to relent, arguing that state residents already spend $309 million at racinos in Delaware and West Virginia, and will soon spend more in Pennsylvania.
 ''The question is not whether Marylanders will play slots,'' Mr. Ehrlich said in a recent statement. ''The question is where they will play and who will benefit.''
 But critics of gambling argued that racinos in West Virginia and Delaware were already convenient for Maryland residents. It is unlikely, they said, that there will be a new outflow of Maryland dollars to Pennsylvania.
 ''Anyone who wants to go play slots is already doing so,'' said Jeff Hooke, chairman of the Maryland Tax Education Foundation, who has been critical of Maryland's and Pennsylvania's gambling plans. ''Why should they drive another 30 to 50 miles?''
 The efforts by Mr. Rendell and Mr. Ehrlich are indicative of a broad trend among state officials in recent years to solve pressing budget problems through measures other than raising sales or income taxes.
 Two weeks ago, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California struck a deal that granted five American Indian tribes unlimited slot machines and is to bring the state an immediate cash infusion of $1 billion.
 ''It's certainly more palatable to push the gambling issue when it is presented as a choice between either raising taxes or expanding gambling,'' said Ian Pulsipher, a policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures. ''You hear a lot of legislators arguing: 'The budget's a mess. What else can we do?'''
 That is precisely how Mr. Rendell argued the issue in Pennsylvania. He initially advocated raising income taxes and legalizing slots to help shift the cost of schools away from property taxes. But when Republicans balked, he dropped the tax proposal. 
 ''Right now, there is no feasible way to get property tax relief other than gaming,'' Mr. Rendell said last week.
 Opponents of the gambling bill argued that the state would not earn enough revenue from the plan. The state will receive 34 percent of annual gambling revenues and about $600 million in one-time licensing fees. But some experts contended that the state could earn more than $2 billion in fees if it auctioned the licenses.
 The legislation authorizes seven racetracks and five slot parlors to get 3,000 video slot machines each, with the potential to increase to 5,000 machines after six months. Two resorts will be granted 500 machines each.
 Slots are likely to go to racetracks in or near Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Erie, Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre. A seven-member board appointed by the governor and legislature will license and regulate the gambling operations.
 Under the tax relief plan, school districts can receive state money from gambling provided they institute local income taxes or increase existing taxes. Those districts would have to submit future tax increases above the inflation rate to a referendum, except in certain emergency situations.

HEADLINE: Knowing Their Politics by Their Software

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In a campaign season of polarization, when Republicans and Democrats seem far apart on issues like Iraq, the economy and leadership style, it is perhaps not surprising that the parties find themselves on different sides in the politics of software as well.
 The Web sites of Senator John Kerry and the Democratic National Committee run mainly on the technology of the computing counterculture: open-source software that is distributed free, and improved and debugged by far-flung networks of programmers. 
 In the other corner, the Web sites of President Bush and the Republican National Committee run on software supplied by the corporate embodiment of big business -- Microsoft.
 The two sides are defined largely by their approach to intellectual property. Fans of open-source computing regard its software as a model for the future of business, saying that its underlying principle of collaboration will eventually be used in pharmaceuticals, entertainment and other industries whose products are tightly protected by patents or copyrights. 
 Many of them propose rewriting intellectual property laws worldwide to limit their scope and duration. The open-source path, they insist, should accelerate the pace of innovation and promote long-term economic growth. Theirs is an argument of efficiency, but also of a reshuffling of corporate wealth. 
 Microsoft and other American companies, by contrast, have long argued that intellectual property is responsible for any edge the United States has in an increasingly competitive global economy. Craig Mundie, chief technical officer and a senior strategist at Microsoft, observed, ''Whether copyrights, patents or trade secrets, it was this foundation in law that made it possible for companies to raise capital, take risks, focus on the long term and create sustainable business models.''
 The dispute can take on a political flavor at times. David Brunton, who is a founder of Plus Three, a technology and marketing consulting company that has done much of the work on the Democratic and Kerry Web sites, regards open-source software as a technological expression of his political beliefs. Mr. Brunton, 28, a Harvard graduate, describes himself as a ''very left-leaning Democrat.'' He met his wife, Lina, through politics; she is a staff member at the Democratic National Committee.
 His company's client list includes state Democratic parties in Ohio and Missouri, and union groups including the United Federation of Teachers and the parent A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''The ethic of open source has pervaded progressive organizations,'' Mr. Brunton said.
 The corporate proponents of strong intellectual property rights say, in essence, that what is good for Microsoft, Merck and Disney is good for America. But they argue as well that the laws that protect them also protect the ideas of upstart innovators. They have made their case forcefully in Washington and before international groups, notably the World Intellectual Property Organization, a United Nations specialized agency.
 ''This is a huge ideological debate and it goes way beyond software,'' said James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology, a nonprofit group affiliated with Ralph Nader that advocates less restrictive intellectual property rules.
 But the politics surrounding open-source software do not always fit neatly into party categories. The people who work on software like the Linux operating system, the Apache Web server and others are an eclectic bunch of technologists. ''You'll find gun nuts along with total lefties,'' Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, said in an e-mail message.
 Still, those who find the cooperative, open-source ethos appealing tend most often to be libertarians, populists and progressives. Not surprisingly, open-source software was well represented in Howard Dean's Democratic presidential primary campaign, which so effectively used the Internet and Web logs in grass-roots organizing.
 Those open-source advocates will presumably find Senator Kerry more appealing than President Bush, according to Daniel Weitzner, technology and society director at the World Wide Web Consortium, an Internet standards-setting organization.
 ''It may be that the populist-versus-establishment dynamic plays out as Democrat versus Republican in this election,'' Mr. Weitzner said. ''But the open-source movement is a populist phenomenon, enabled by the Internet, and not a partisan force in any traditional sense of politics.''
 The lone trait common to open-source supporters, according to Mr. Torvalds, is individualism. Politically, he said, that can manifest itself as independence from either political party. ''But it also shows up as a distrust of big companies,'' Mr. Torvalds wrote, ''so it's not like the individualism is just about politics.''
 Eric Raymond, a leading open-source advocate, writing in his online ''Jargon File,'' described the politics of the archetypal open-source programmer, whom he calls J. Random Hacker, as ''vaguely liberal-moderate, except for the strong libertarian contingent, which rejects conventional left-right politics entirely.''
 Mr. Raymond, for one, shoots pistols for relaxation (a favorite is ''the classic 1911 pattern .45 semiautomatic'') and he supported the invasion of Iraq.
 So was the software for the Republican and Democratic Web sites selected according to politics?
 Microsoft, to be sure, has fared far better under the Bush administration than under the administration of President Bill Clinton. The Clinton Justice Department filed a sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft, and asked that the big software company be broken up. The Bush administration later settled the case and left Microsoft intact.
 Referring to the software selection process, Steve Ellis, director of network and online services for the Republican National Committee, said: ''There was no pressure. We were free to use whatever software we thought worked best.''
 The principal consideration, Mr. Ellis said, was computer security and protecting the privacy of personal data on the Web site. The programming tools, procedures and the larger pool of workers skilled in using Microsoft software, he said, prompted the Republicans to opt for Microsoft's Web server, called Internet Information Services, running on the Windows 2000 operating system.
 Both the Microsoft Web site software and the open-source alternative, the Apache server running on Linux, have had security problems, said Richard M. Smith, a computer security expert. But the Microsoft software, he said, ''clearly is the least secure of the two Web serving solutions,'' given its susceptibility to infection by malicious computer worms like Code Red and Nimba. 
 For technology experts, like Mr. Brunton, software may have a political cast. But there is little evidence that it has become an issue for front-office political operatives. Told that the Democratic National Committee Web site runs on open-source software, Tony Welch, the national committee's press secretary, replied, ''Oh, thanks for telling me.'' Later, after checking with his technical staff, Mr. Welch called back to say that open-source software was ''the right technology at the right price.''
 Both the Democratic and Republican sites have done pretty well. Mr. Kerry has raised more than $56 million over the Internet this year, including $3 million last Wednesday, setting a single-day record for online fund-raising. The Republican Web site won an award in March from George Washington University's Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet for the best online campaign by a political party.
 ''The Web site is a great grass-roots organizing tool, and we've probably just scratched the surface,'' said Christine Iverson, press secretary for the Republican National Committee.

HEADLINE: FEARS OF ATTACK AT CONVENTIONS DRIVE NEW PLANS

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York for this article, and John Kifner from Boston.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4 

 BODY:
The federal authorities, concerned about a terror attack during this summer's national political conventions, have begun a new effort to identify potential extremists inside the United States, including conducting interviews in communities where terrorists might seek refuge, government officials said.
 The fears about an incident during the conventions or later in the year have also led state and local officials to impose extraordinary security precautions. Persistent if indistinct intelligence reports, based on electronic intercepts and live sources, indicate that Al Qaeda is determined to strike in the United States some time this year, the officials said in interviews last week. 
 Almost half the budgets in each convention city will be spent on security, local officials said. The Democratic National Convention will be held in Boston at the Fleet Center from July 26 to 29. The Republican National Convention will be held in New York at Madison Square Garden from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. 
 New York is regarded as a higher risk than Boston by counterterrorism officials because President Bush is a Republican and because of consistent intelligence.
 ''Al Qaeda has unambiguous plans to hit the homeland again,'' James L. Pavitt, the C.I.A.'s outgoing head of clandestine operations, said in a speech in New York last week, ''and New York City, I am certain, remains a prime target.''
 Pasquale J. D'Amuro, the head of the New York F.B.I. office, said in an interview that nearly all of the more than 1,100 agents in the office, the bureau's largest field division, will be involved in collecting intelligence and other security tasks before the convention.
 Convention planners expanded their security requirements, at the urging of federal officials, after the March 11 commuter train attacks in Madrid that killed 191 people. 
 While the intelligence is not yet clear or specific enough to justify increasing the country's color-coded alert level, the officials said, there are signs of rising concern in the government. On Friday, cabinet members were briefed on the latest intelligence, which, administration officials said, indicates Al Qaeda's intention to strike in the United States, but does not suggest when or where an attack might occur or who might be behind it.
 Recent intelligence reports have hinted that an attack might involve relatively crude materials in an uncomplicated operation, the officials said, suggesting the possibility of a car or truck bomb rather than a plot relying on sophisticated weapons or training like the commercial aviation studies undertaken by the hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 Some of the information has indicated that potential attackers might not be young Arab men, but religious extremists from other countries, possibly in Africa. For that reason investigators have begun to more closely examine visa holders already in the United States from countries like Somalia, Kenya and Nigeria. 
 Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation are also starting to conduct interviews in communities where potential terrorists might seek to blend in with local populations. The officials said that the interviews were based on intelligence about who might pose a threat, but would also be patterned on the informational interviews conducted in Arab-American neighborhoods after the Sept. 11 attacks and in Iraqi-American communities at the start of the American-led invasion in 2003.
 At the bureau's headquarters in Washington, officials have organized the '04 Task Force, a team of analysts and investigators at the bureau's strategic command center there who are seeking out investigative avenues that could reveal vulnerabilities or signs of preparation for an attack. The team was formed in response to criticism by the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks and from others that the bureau had failed to think imaginatively about how an attack might be carried out.
 In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, has called on a 10-state consortium of law enforcement agencies, from Maine to Delaware, to share intelligence about warning signs of terrorist planning.
 ''We think we know the targets that might have great economic impact or cause large loss of life,'' said James K. Kallstrom, a senior terrorism adviser to Mr. Pataki. ''But we know terrorists might not be in proximity to those targets, so we have put a series of tripwires in place throughout New England.''
 In New York, the cost of security is expected to exceed $75 million, of the total convention cost of about $166 million, as concerns have broadened to include not only the week of the convention, but also the weeks before and after it.
 The Police Department will increase uniformed and plainclothes patrols in many parts of the city, focusing on landmarks, tourist sites, sites related to the convention, bridges and tunnels, airports and simply places where people gather. Much of the focus will be on the subway system.
 For Boston, the security bill is now estimated to reach $50 million, twice the original estimate and more than half the roughly $95 million overall convention cost. 
 The Secret Service has ordered some 40 miles of roads closed around the Fleet Center, where the Democrats will meet, including Interstate 93, a section of which runs above ground just 40 feet from the arena. The shutdown of major roads near the convention site is the central and most controversial part of a complex security plan. The plan involves multiple police agencies and includes random checks of handbags and packages on buses and subways by police and bomb-sniffing dogs, as well as closed security zones.
 New York is considered to be a more likely target, but security planners in Boston said that area had many potential targets of its own, including a complex infrastructure, prestigious universities and, perhaps most of all, symbolic sites.
 ''This is the seat of liberty,'' said Carlo A. Boccia, the city's director of homeland security, gesturing from the window of his City Hall office toward Faneuil Hall and the Old State House. ''You attack that, it's the very heart of America.''
 The Boston Police Department estimated that the security measures ordered by the Secret Service added about $9.5 million in police, firefighter and medical worker overtime for a total of $32.5 million, the largest portion of the security cost.
 At first, the authorities seemed likely to order closings only during the evening hours of the convention. But it quickly became apparent that because of the complex nature of the roads that feed into downtown Boston, it would take hours to clear the backed-up traffic. So the ban has been extended from roughly 4 p.m. to midnight.
 Some 200,000 vehicles travel on I-93 on a weekday, and 24,000 people use the commuter rail line from the north. But because of congestion on alternate routes, the ban is likely to affect tens of thousands more.
 The traffic ban has outraged commuters as well as business owners who fear the city will be nearly deserted except for the 36,000 visitors expected for the convention. State employees have been encouraged to take the days of the convention off, and many businesses have told their employees to do the same.
 Mayor Thomas M. Menino bristles at criticism.
 ''This convention will be good for Boston,'' Mayor Menino said in an interview. He added, ''Since 9/11, our whole world has changed drastically. The Secret Service is really dictating the conditions. It's remarkable how many public safety agencies have been working together.''
 As in Boston, security concerns in New York will focus on a fairly broad time frame. Raymond W. Kelly, the city police commissioner, said the heightened measures would be in place weeks before Aug. 30, when the Republican National Convention opens, and will continue after the event ends Sept. 2. 
 ''The lead-up, the run-up to the convention is an area that certainly requires additional attention,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''because anything that happens in that period could be just as disruptive as something that happens during convention week.''
 The Madrid bombing has also led to stepped-up security plans in New York. About 10,000 officers will be deployed, up from 6,500, to provide security at Madison Square Garden, city hotels, bridges and tunnels, demonstration areas, landmarks and other sites, according to a previously undisclosed May 10 memorandum prepared by the city's Washington lobbying office in an effort to obtain more federal money for security. 
 Securing the city's transportation system is a complex task. About seven million people a day ride the subway system. The Long Island Rail Road carries about 270,000 riders each day on 730 trains, while the Metro-North Railroad carries about 250,000 people daily.
 In addition to increased subway patrols, the memorandum said, the department's efforts include deploying officers to Pennsylvania Station, beneath Madison Square Garden, as well as other transit, and an inspection plan for each commuter rail line that enters Penn Station.
 The security around Madison Square Garden will include shutting down major Midtown streets for several hours each day, ringing the arena with concrete barriers and allowing demonstrators to gather only at one corner of the site, measures that officials acknowledge will disrupt large swaths of Manhattan.
 But Madison Square Garden is not the only concern. Because any attack in the city would probably cause the disruption sought by extremists, Mr. Kelly said, the department will also focus on other events that week, including the U.S. Open tennis tournament and New York Yankees and Mets games.
 Mr. D'Amuro, of the F.B.I., also expressed concern about the periods before and after the convention.
 ''We know one of the things that Al Qaeda looks at is security measures in place and whether they think they could be successful in carrying out an attack,'' he said. ''And if they don't believe they will, they'll postpone it, they'll put it off to another time.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 5 about the potential for terrorist attacks at the political conventions this summer imprecisely described one reason that counterterrorism officials believe the Republican convention in New York City is a higher risk than the Democratic gathering in Boston. The Republican gathering is regarded as a higher risk because an incumbent from that party is in the White House.

Hussein's Family Is Aiding Iraqi Rebellion, U.S. Says
A network of Saddam Hussein's cousins, operating in part from Syria and Jordan, is actively involved in the smuggling of guns, people and money into Iraq to support the anti-American insurgency, say American government officials and a prominent Iraqi. The operations involve at least three cousins who now live in Syria and in Europe. A1

Mr. Hussein's appearance in an Iraqi courtroom has turned the tables there. Hundreds of thousands of people felt the scourge of his brutality, and a few of them now sit in the seats of power that once belonged to Mr. Hussein and the other 11 now under formal investigation. A8

Iraqi troops thwarted an attempted car bombing outside a regional headquarters northeast of Baghdad, killing an attacker before he could detonate his vehicle. Two bystanders also died when the shooting caused the car to explode. Meanwhile, the fate of an American marine, Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun, who was kidnapped by a militant Iraqi group, remains unclear.

Terrorism Warning in Bahrain
The United States has again warned Americans in Bahrain that terrorist attacks may be imminent. The State Department has now authorized what it called the voluntary departure of its employees' families as well as ''non-emergency'' personnel at the United States Embassy. A9

Qaeda Camp in Libyan Desert
A French newspaper has reported that Libyan forces discovered a terrorist camp with ties to Al Qaeda in the country's southern desert. The report did not say whether the camp was active or abandoned when it was found 10 days ago. A9

U.S. Query Into Afghan Death
The American military is beginning an investigation into the death of an Afghan man held in detention at an American military outpost in Afghanistan. The man's family charges that the Afghan commander of security there was responsible for his torture and death. A9

Israel Limits Nuclear Disclosure
Israel's Atomic Energy Commission posted a Web site about the country's nuclear program, which has always been highly secretive, though the new site is limited to the most basic information and a few long-distance photos. A3

Communist Party Weakened
Beset by internal strife and outmaneuvered by President Vladimir V. Putin, the Communists in Russia are at their weakest point since they returned in 1993 after a two-year ban. Analysts say much in the party's fall stems from Mr. Putin's climb, and the tactics he has used to appropriate the party's issues. A3

Electricity Shortage in China
The economy in China is growing at a rate that is among the world's fastest, leading to a shortfall in electricity. Many cities are taking action. Shanghai city officials are even contemplating shutting down the huge flashing advertising signs that made the downtown riverfront the neon equivalent of Times Square. A4

Terrorism Fears Spur New Plans for Conventions
The federal authorities, concerned about a terrorist attack during this summer's national political conventions, have begun a series of previously undisclosed counterterrorism measures, starting a new effort to identify potential extremists inside the United States along with a series of interviews in communities where terrorists might seek refuge, government officials said. A1

Supreme Court Reshaped
Although it has been 10 years since its membership last changed, the Supreme Court that concluded its term last week was a new court. It is possible that the 2003-04 term may go down in history as the one when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist lost his court. A1

Slot Machines Are Approved
Pennsylvania lawmakers enacted legislation that authorizes as many as 61,000 slot machines for horse tracks, resorts and slot parlors across the state, and will generate $1 billion a year, officials say, for reducing taxes. A10

Cheney's Doctor Is Dropped
Vice President Dick Cheney's personal doctor, who four years ago declared Mr. Cheney ''up to the task of the most sensitive public office'' despite a history of heart disease, was battling an addiction to prescription drugs at that time and has recently been dropped from the vice president's medical team, say officials at the hospital where he practiced. A10

Dick Cheney has by his own account preferred serious discussion to the glib give and take of the campaign trail. And as Mr. Cheney ventured outside Washington on a three-state bus tour that was his first serious campaign swing for 2004, he showed little sign that he had come to see campaigning as much more than a chore. A13

Kerry Defends Values
Senator John Kerry wound up his tour of the heartland with an attack on the Bush administration's definition of values and a defense of his own, including his position on abortion. A13

Campaigning in West Virginia
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney made separate stops in West Virginia, where voter registration is heavily Democratic, in a sign of how critical a role this state may play in the November election. A13

Mixing God, Rock and Youth
As Christian rock festivals and tours have multiplied, drawing younger evangelicals who express their faith through alternative music and tattoos, they have opened a market for products that do not fit into more decorous Christian bookstores. A10

HEADLINE: The Years After Tomorrow

BYLINE: By Stuart E. Eizenstat and David B. Sandalow. 
Stuart E. Eizenstat was the chief American negotiator for the Clinton administration at the Kyoto conference. David B. Sandalow is an environment scholar at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Vladimir Putin's recent announcement that Russia will move to ratify the Kyoto Protocol received little attention, but may signal that the agreement will finally become legally effective.
 That would be welcome, not because Kyoto is a perfect agreement, but because, even with its imperfections, the protocol has several elements that will contribute to a sensible long-term solution to global warming. Foremost among these is Kyoto's recognition that emissions trading -- an American invention now embraced by Europe -- can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions at low cost. 
 Still, the six and a half years that have passed since the Kyoto Protocol remind us that we have more to do. Progress in the international climate negotiations has been painfully slow. 
 Waiting to address global warming would be a reckless gamble. If present trends continue, greenhouse gas concentrations -- during the lifetimes of children born today -- will reach levels higher than in the last 50 million years. The Kyoto Protocol, alone, is not the answer. Its limits -- requiring industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions roughly 5 percent from 1990 levels -- will apply to less than half of the world's global emissions, because the United States is not participating and major developing countries are not covered. And these limits expire in 2012. 
 In the next few years it is essential that we shape a new strategy, one that should be based on, or informed by, the lessons we have learned so far about the difficulty of putting a climate change agreement in place. 
 One lesson is that finding a consensus among 180 nations is asking too much. The obvious fact that we all share one atmosphere led nations to try a single global accord, but the differences between nations are vast and their leadership shifts over time. 
 A second lesson is that, in the United States, domestic consensus comes first. International agreements require broad political support, which Kyoto has never had. The Bush administration has opposed ratification of the treaty, saying that it could hurt the nation's economy and noting that countries like China are not covered by it. Treaties rarely produce consensus on controversial topics.
 And in the absence of federal limits on emissions, a third lesson has surfaced: nature abhors a vacuum, even in the regulatory arena. 
 Dozens of states and localities have filled the void, starting their own programs to fight global warming, like the regional compact under development in the Northeast. In addition, the Republican governors of two of the nation's largest states -- New York and California -- support tough measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 The corporate sector is increasingly stepping forward as well. Under the Chicago Climate Exchange, for example, major companies are building a market for trading emissions allowances.
 So what next for global warming policy in the United States without ratifying Kyoto?
 Federal legislation must be enacted to require mandatory limits on heat-trapping gases, to ensure that businesses combat global warming in their capital investments and research spending.
 Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman have sponsored an important bill on this issue. If history is a guide, many businesses may come to prefer uniform federal legislation of this type to an uneasy patchwork of state regulatory regimes.
 The United States should also negotiate a trans-Atlantic climate trade agreement under which it and the European Union would accept binding limits on heat-trapping gases and establish an emissions trading program between the two continents. Other countries could then opt in to the agreement.
 As part of the accord, the United States and the European Union could agree to redirect agricultural subsidies likely to be reduced in World Trade Organization negotiations toward environmentally friendly biofuels.
 The United States should also seek opportunities for bilateral climate change agreements with major developing countries, including China, India and South Africa, to promote clean energy exports and transfer of environmentally friendly technologies. The agreements could provide a framework for these countries to participate in emissions trading, even at the local level. 
 None of these bilateral or regional agreements would replace the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by the first President Bush and ratified unanimously by the Senate in 1992, which provides an important forum for work on global warming. Instead, these agreements would supplement the pact, much as bilateral and regional trade agreements supplement the World Trade Organization today.
 Churchill is widely credited with writing: ''However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.'' There will be many opportunities to evaluate and adjust course in the fight against global warming during the decades ahead. Our success will depend on it.

In a Busy Holiday Weekend, 'Spider-Man 2' Is No. 1
America flocked to the movies this holiday weekend as ''Spider-Man 2,'' the sequel to the blockbuster movie of two summers ago, broke box-office records by taking in $180 million in its first six days in theaters, a rare, bona fide hit in a summer filled with pricey ''event'' pictures.
 The anti-Bush documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' continued to draw huge audiences across the country, taking in $21 million over the four-day weekend for a total of $60 million so far. The Arts, Section E.

States Postpone Welfare Changes
Welfare programs around the country are in limbo because of a stalemate in Congress that has prompted state officials to postpone new investments in child care, expansions of job training and most other initiatives for welfare recipients and low-wage workers. [A1.]

The Era of Wal-Mart in Chicago
In Chicago, plans to transform two industrial sites from another era into Wal-Mart stores reflect sweeping changes that are reshaping the economies of Chicago and much of urban America. It may also lead Wal-Mart to reassess some of the corporate practices that have earned it huge profits but have also drawn criticism from labor and community groups across the country. [A12.]

The Longest Nonstop Flight: A Test
Trying out the longest nonstop commercial flight in history, a Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to Newark. Joe Sharkey: On the Road. [C4.]

Oil Futures Climb After Disruptions
Crude oil futures rose to a one-month high after a ruptured pipeline cut Iraqi exports by almost half, the third day shipments from the Middle East's fifth-largest oil-producing nation have been disrupted. [C2.]

Lancome Changes Its Marketing
Lancome is planning to rely less on its signature rose and more on a bold handwritten signature to reach younger cosmetics users. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]

Flight Delays Are Worsening
Just as business travelers are getting accustomed to security lines, baggage restrictions and the other vexations of flying in an era of heightened security, the familiar old headache of flight delays is throbbing again. More than 400,000 flights have been delayed or canceled so far this year, more than one of every five that take off, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics. [C3.]

Stocks Mixed in Europe and Asia
Trading in European and Asian shares was mixed yesterday, with business slow on many exchanges. Investors were cautious about taking fresh positions with the United States market closed for Independence Day. [C5.]

HEADLINE: Immigrant Subway Virtuosos Keep Traditional Sounds Alive

BYLINE: By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
Zhisheng Zhang, the 10th-generation descendant of a Chinese court musician, descended into the Times Square subway station and unfolded his stool on a platform. He took out a Chinese mouth organ, called a sheng, wiped it carefully with a piece of clean cloth and closed his eyes. 
 As notes from the prelude of ''Carmen'' pierced the humid air, Mr. Zhang -- whose great-great-grandfathers played for Manchu emperors, whose father performed for Communist army generals and who was himself a member of China's best traditional music orchestra -- began another workday, playing for the subway riders of New York.
 There are many like Mr. Zhang, established musicians from China who perform daily in the city's bowels. Convinced that the best music, Western or Asian, is truly borderless and that their own talents are sufficient to make ends meet anywhere, these artists have converged on New York like the philosophers and poets who swarmed to Athens in classical times. They feel not just lured, but pushed; China, in their view, has turned its back on traditional music in favor of the pop dazzle of Britney Spears. 
 ''I want to try my luck in New York,'' Mr. Zhang, 42, said, speaking in Mandarin. ''In China serious artists like us aren't as respected as pop singers. That's not right. Maybe Americans can see the true appeal of Chinese music, and I can make my way to the grand concert halls in New York.''
 Though many of the underground musicians dream of fortune and homes in the suburbs, or at the least of bringing their children to the United States after gaining footholds themselves, for now most of them live in simple apartments in Chinatown or Flushing, Queens, and barely eke out a living. Before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, many of the musicians said, an eight-hour day of performing at a subway station fetched an average of $70. Since then their income has dropped by roughly a third because of the economic doldrums and, they speculate, increased suspicion of foreigners.
 Besides the subway, they often perform concerts at universities, community centers, parks and at the Asia Society in Manhattan.
 ''We have some very high-caliber Chinese artists here,'' said Rachel Cooper, director of performing arts and public programs at the society. ''We have a very discriminating audience here in New York, and there is a real hunger, openness and appreciation for fine music, including Chinese music. There is a real hunger to understand it.''
 Cultural organizations in Chinatown and Flushing also know many of the musicians and invite them to play. Occasionally New Yorkers who have met them at subway stations ask them to perform at weddings or birthday parties. Some of the musicians have tried to supplement their incomes by working in restaurants but have found the work too tedious for the small wages.
 Mr. Zhang lived in Beijing until January, when he was invited by the Wossing Center for Chinese Arts, Language and Culture in Chinatown to play in a concert tour at universities and public libraries in the northeastern United States. Soon after the tour he decided to stay in New York and apply for permanent residency. Many other Chinese musicians of similar rank have become legal residents and American citizens by proving their exceptional talents to the federal immigration agency.
 Unlike most professional musicians in China who studied in formal conservatories, Mr. Zhang learned as a child from his father how to play the sheng, a multipiped instrument invented at least two millennia ago. Mr. Zhang's family, originally from a village outside Beijing, has passed the secret knowledge, possessed only by top performers, from fathers to sons for 10 generations, he said.
 ''I love this stuff, playing the sheng,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''It's in my blood. I don't want to give it up. If traditional Chinese music gets fashionable in America, maybe it will become more popular in China, too.'' 
 Often, though, the musicians have a dim view of their art form's future in China, and they blame the flood of Western and Hong Kong pop music for its dwindling popularity.
 ''When a young child expresses some interest in studying music, the parents would say: 'You learn to do the pop stuff. That brings you money and fame,' '' said Hao Qian, a well-known performer on a two-string instrument, the erhu, who used to travel in the same musicians' circles in Beijing as Mr. Zhang.
 ''It's the music from our 5,000-year civilization that's now worthless,'' added Mr. Qian, who now also makes his living at Manhattan subway stations.
 The relentless destruction across China of temples, monasteries and nunneries under Mao Zedong's rule between 1949 and 1976 added to the musicians' woes. 
 ''Most of the old Chinese music is really meant to be played in temples,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''Without the temples, how can one perform true Chinese music?'' 
 Since the early 1980's government subsidies to music troupes have gradually dried up with China's embrace of a market economy, and private donations have not picked up the slack. While most pop music groups take in extra income by playing at clubs and parties, some traditional music ensembles, particularly those based outside major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, sit idle for months on end.
 Huadong Liu, who played yang qin, a dulcimerlike instrument, in a prestigious troupe in northeastern China, said he made just over $100 a month -- less than most urban residents -- before coming to the United States three years ago. Now he races to claim a choice spot in underground New York.
 ''Sometimes I spend two to three hours in the morning just to find the right platform,'' said Mr. Liu, who calls his wife and 17-year-old son in China twice a week as he saves money to send for them. ''If you get stuck at a platform with little foot traffic or lots of hurried people, you cannot even make $20 a day.'' 
 Julie Tay, director and founder of the Wossing Center, said such musicians can find the adjustment to the United States hard. ''Since their language is muted, their art tends to be muted, too,'' she said. ''The worst thing is to see them come here, get frustrated, start driving a limo two or three years down the road, and the traditional Chinese music goes down the drain.''
 Mr. Zhang is divorced and has a 15-year-old son back home. In China he performed mostly in grand concert halls like the People's Great Hall in Beijing. He was designated as a ''national first-class performer'' on the sheng by the Chinese government, the highest level available and an honor won by only 10 other performers. 
 At first he had a great deal of trepidation about playing his sheng at subway stops.
 ''The Chinese have always seen street musicians as beggars,'' he said. ''Where would I put my face if somebody from home -- or worse, somebody from the orchestra -- finds out?''
 He has overcome that anxiety now, he said, after running into other subway musicians he considers top-notch. ''It looks to me that many musicians from other countries come here to New York, and everybody starts from the subway station,'' he said. ''I figured out that it's a New York tradition.'' Mr. Zhang says he sends $200 home to his son and former wife whenever he can.
 For many of the transplanted musicians the day starts at 8:30 a.m. They hurry to their favorite subway platforms lugging their instruments, stools and sometimes amplifiers. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority allows musicians to perform at subway stations without permits so long as they do not interfere with traffic. ''It's a protection of their First Amendment rights,'' said Mercedes Padilla, an M.T.A. spokeswoman. 
 There is a pecking order of subway stations understood by almost everybody in the trade. The Columbus Circle stop and the station at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street top the list. The Times Square station and those close to New York University can also bring brisk business. Stops at Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal are all right on weekends. But whatever the location, the platforms are humid in summers and frigid in winters.
 Many musicians change locations from day to day so as not to bore commuters, most of whom, the artists say, have showed them proper respect.
 ''When I put my heart into the performance,'' said Xuanpei Ge, a player of the di, a one-pipe Chinese flute, ''I get really warm, prolonged applauses. I could see the audience's respect from their eyes, the attentiveness when they listen and the way they bow after you finish. Some even give me water and fruit in hot summers. It's just very moving.''
 Mr. Zhang speaks little English and is taking night lessons to catch up. Some subway riders have tried to speak with him, he said, and he could only speculate whether they have asked him about his instrument, invited him to perform at parties or said something else entirely.
 ''If I want to seize opportunities to advance my career,'' he said, ''I must learn to speak English.''
 Like many musicians, he has discovered that Western music adapted (often by him) for Chinese instruments draws the warmest response. Although the Chinese scale differs from the Western scale, lacking some half notes, the musicians have adapted pieces as different as Mozart's nocturnes and the soundtrack of ''The Godfather.'' 
 ''The subway riders seem to really like the tunes they are familiar with, particularly the fast, happy ones,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''Once I played a slow, sad Chinese song, and it made one old lady cry. She made a gesture to ask me to stop.''

HEADLINE: The Chilling of American Science

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS

 BODY:
Dr. Robert C. Richardson knows a lot about liquid helium.
 In the early 1970's, he and Dr. David M. Lee, both of Cornell, and Dr. Douglas D. Osheroff, now of Stanford and then a graduate student at Cornell, were experimenting with the isotope helium-3, chilling it to extremely cold temperatures, and examining its various properties. Through their investigations, they discovered a new state of matter and helped to revolutionize modern physics. In 1996, they received the Nobel Prize for this work. 
 Since then, Dr. Richardson, now 66 and a professor at Cornell, has used the prestige of his Nobel to campaign for improved science education. And he lives his beliefs; he is one of the few science laureates teaching undergraduate classes. 
 He has also been chairman of a panel of the National Science Board, which oversees the National Science Foundation. In May, the subcommittee issued its Science and Engineering Indicators Report, 2004. The report, which can be downloaded from www.nsf.gov, showed a decline in the number of young Americans seeking careers in science.
 On a recent morning in New York, Dr. Richardson spoke about the subcommittee's work.

Q. Why do so few native-born Americans want to study science?

A. Science and math need to be made more interesting to our students. When you ask young people what they don't like about science or math, they say it's boring and hard. And while math and science are hard, they don't have to be boring. Teachers often don't communicate the fun of science. If you discover something no one has known before, that's a fantastic experience. There is no high like it.
 A second problem is that science as a profession isn't particularly honored. When I graduated from high school in 1954, a much larger fraction of the population was interested in scientific careers and you didn't have all these television cartoons making fun of ''freaky'' scientists. 
 The other thing is money. The glamorous degree these days is the M.B.A. So that's what we hear: this is hard stuff to learn, it's geeky, and you're not likely to get rich doing it.

Q. Why does this bother you?

A. Because science and technology drive the economy. It's not people suing each other or making hamburgers. The wealth of the country, I believe, is based on the invention of new products. That can only come from a thriving scientific community. I worry that this manpower gap can compromise our standard of living.
 We have to face facts. We've got a serious scientific manpower problem, and it's been developing since the 1970's. We used to be third in the world, behind Japan and Finland, in the percentage of our students who became scientists and engineers. Now we're 23rd. For 30 years, we've made do by importing a large portion of our scientists. Smart, motivated people from places like China and India studied and settled in the United States. Today, about half of our graduating engineers are foreign-born.
 However, since 9/11 -- really before then -- policies were put into place discouraging these talented foreigners from coming. Thousands of students and visitors in technical fields have been delayed or prevented from entering the U.S. A lot of foreign scientists aren't applying for visas. Some are refusing to come here for professional meetings. They complain of demeaning interviews at our consulates. They feel they are being asked, ''Are you good enough to get into our country?'' In the year 2000, we gave almost 300,000 temporary visas to people working and studying in scientific and technical areas; it's down to half that today.

Q. Don't concerns about terrorism require more caution at our borders?

A. Absolutely. But I'm afraid that there's more to this than a concern about potential terrorists. A lot of those encountering visa problems don't hail from countries on the terrorist watch list. They often come from places people are worried about as potential economic competitors -- China, India.
 One can't help but think that some of the post-9/11 restrictions are not motivated by security concerns, but by a misguided, almost 19th-century protectionism on intellectual property. There are policy makers who believe, ''We've got to keep all these foreigners from stealing all our secrets and beating the pants off us.'' So now, these scientists, particularly those from Asia, are looking for opportunities in Australia and Europe.

Q. Are foreigners also not coming because after 9/11, American science has become more closed?

A. Let me give you an interesting example from Cornell. The Patriot Act, which was passed after 9/11, has a section in it to control who can work on ''select agents,'' pathogens that might be developed as bioweapons. At Cornell, we had something like 76 faculty members who had projects on lethal pathogens and something like 38 working specifically on select agents. There were stringent regulations for control of the pathogens -- certain categories of foreign nationals who were not allowed to handle them, be in a room with them or even be aware of research results.
 So what is the situation now? We went from 38 people who could work on select agents to 2. We've got a lot less people working on interventions to vaccinate the public against smallpox, West Nile virus, anthrax and any of 30 other scourges.

Q. What are the remedies?

A. The board has made a range of recommendations beginning with opening our doors again to foreign scientists, engineers and innovators. We must also take steps to bring more native-born Americans to scientific careers. There are groups who are underrepresented in science we could look to: women, blacks, Latinos.
 Bringing them in will take special efforts. Right now, young girls often find science unattractive because it seems like a really tough life, not very feminine, and only really weird people will admit they like playing computer games. To get more women, we probably need to restructure work environments in labs and universities so that they're more responsive to them in their childbearing years.
 For all Americans, we need to do a better job at science and math education. The input of teaching talent is not good. There are tests given each year for qualification as physics teachers; in one Northeastern state, between 60 to 70 percent fail. They can't be explaining things too well.
 Another thing, we know that experienced-based teaching works in science. When I teach undergraduates, one of the most popular things I do is take a $5 watch apart and show how it works. There's a billion dollars' worth of research in that watch, and the kids are fascinated.

Q. You spoke of how exciting it is to see something new in science. What did you feel when you described the new state of matter for helium-3?

A. We knew we had found something new: a superfluid, an isotope of helium. At extremely low temperatures, the liquid forms into a state that looks like superconductivity in metals; the electrons can flow through the metals without having any resistance. Astrophysicists later told us that they believe that the interior of neutron stars have the same physical properties of what we were able to replicate in a laboratory.
 As we were working on it, we had no theoretical guidance on what to expect. So there was a three-, four-month interval where I slept only a few hours each night. Eight or nine months later, we had a pretty complete picture of some of the important properties of this liquid. We saw the fabric of what we understand about the universe.

Q. Did you think you'd get the Nobel for the discovery?

A. No. Thinking that way is the road to grief. We knew what we'd done was really important. We knew it was significant and fun science. The joy we felt in that moment is what we are hoping to open up for more Americans -- with a prize, or even without it.

HEADLINE: Hearts, Minds and Hearings

BYLINE: By Steven A. Cook. 
Steven A. Cook is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
With the transfer of political authority to the Iraqi interim government now complete, the Bush administration should focus its attention on promoting democracy in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. One of the most effective ways in which the United States can pursue this goal is to transform Washington's Arab satellite news channel, Al Hurra, into a kind of C-Span for the Arab world.
 It would be difficult for the new channel to broadcast hearings and meetings of Arab and Middle Eastern governments, at least initially. It could begin, however, with programming that has already proved its attraction to Middle Eastern audiences: the workings of the United States government. 
 On May 7, after revelations about torture at Abu Ghraib prison, Al Hurra broadcast Donald Rumsfeld's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee to the Arab world. The spectacle of the secretary of defense of the United States answering questions from elected legislators about the conduct of American soldiers transfixed many Arabs.
 After all, many leaders in the Middle East are unelected and unaccountable, and most Arabs have never seen a senior government official called to account. If America's Arab satellite news channel broadcast Arabic translations of United States government hearings, as well as other aspects of the American political system, it would go a long way toward promoting democratic principles in the Middle East.
 Started in February with United States money, Al Hurra is an important component of Washington's effort to improve America's image in the Arab world and to counter misinformation about America that is routinely broadcast on Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and other satellite stations based in the Middle East. These goals are admirable, and Al Hurra's journalists are talented, but the channel still suffers from a credibility problem.
 Hostility toward the United States -- over its support for Israel, occupation of Iraq, abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib or for other reasons -- is endemic in the Arab world. As a result, Arabs routinely dismiss Al Hurra as propaganda. Although the evidence is thus far anecdotal, across the Middle East Al Hurra's programming is perceived as little better, though slicker, than the standard fare of state-owned Arab channels.
 Al Hurra should not be a simple retransmission of C-Span, though. Live coverage of House floor votes on scintillating topics like the reauthorization of the federal transportation bill would not translate very well in the Arab world. Over time, perhaps, the station could gain permission to broadcast important government proceedings in the Middle East. In the meantime, showing the American government at work would reap benefits in several ways.
 Televised debates over the budget, testimony by high-ranking government officials and candidate stump speeches would give Arabs a living-room view of the democratic process. For all the diplomatic, economic and military links between Washington and Arab capitals, the American political system remains a mystery to the vast majority of Arabs. 
 The new version of Al Hurra could also provide a vantage point for people from Morocco to the Persian Gulf to observe both the best and worst aspects of America's political process, helping to counter many of the prevailing myths and conspiracy theories about how American policy is developed and articulated.
 From an American standpoint, the unfiltered content would help insulate Washington against charges of peddling propaganda. And perhaps most important, the channel would provide a standard against which Arabs could measure their own political systems -- which are notable for their distinct lack of transparency and accountability.
 In its current form, Al Hurra simply cannot compete with Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. In format if not content, Al Hurra represents more of the same in an increasingly saturated Arab satellite news market. In contrast, a C-Span for the Arab world would be an effective way of improving America's image and promoting reform in the Middle East.
 The Bush administration's rhetorical emphasis on democratization in the Middle East is a welcome change in policy. Yet the administration's initiatives to encourage political liberalization is not new. Good governance programs and microfinance loans to the poor are important, but their collective effect on the authoritarian politics of the Middle East over the last decade has been limited.
 Change will come slowly, of course. But broadcasting the spectacle of American politics could help spread to the Arab world the principles, practices and spirit of American democracy.

HEADLINE: Spanish Seek Oil Off Cuba; Potential Shift In Gulf Output

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 5 

 BODY:
Recent announcements from Repsol YPF, the big Spanish oil and gas company, indicate an ambitious expansion program, with projects planned for countries like Libya and Equatorial Guinea that are not for the risk-averse. But none has attracted as much attention as its gamble on Cuba. 
 Last month, Repsol hired a Norwegian drilling platform, the Eirik Raude, at a cost around $200,000 a day to search for oil in Cuban waters, in a narrow sector of the Gulf of Mexico off the northwestern coast. The venture, established with Cubapetroleo, the government-owned oil company, is being watched about as closely in Houston's executive suites as any in the energy industry. 
 A significant find by Repsol would, of course, be a boon for Cuba, which imports most of its fuel, mainly from Venezuela, and often struggles to find the hard currency to pay the bills. More broadly, it could shake up the dynamics of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, dominated for decades by the United States and Mexico. 
 And a big oil discovery could change the political debate in the United States over the decades-old sanctions against Cuba, which now prohibit most commerce with the country. 
 The last thing that American energy companies want is to be trapped on the sidelines by sanctions while European, Canadian and Latin American rivals are free to develop new oil resources on the doorstep of the United States. 
 Halliburton, the nation's largest oil services company, is among the wary watchers. John Gibson, president of Halliburton's energy services group, recently said in a speech to employees that he favored lifting economic sanctions against Cuba, as well as Libya and Iran. 
 ''Sanctions are a very U.S.-centric thing, and I believe that free enterprise will establish better relationships,'' Mr. Gibson said, according to The Associated Press. ''There are foreign companies making money in those countries, and I think American companies should have a shot at those markets as well.'' 
 That sentiment runs counter to the Bush administration's Cuba policy, which has been to maintain and even strengthen sanctions in hopes of isolating and weakening the Communist country's economy. The administration has recently imposed new curbs on travel to Cuba and on the amount of money and goods Cubans can receive from relatives in the United States. 
 Cuba's former lifeline of oil collapsed when the Soviet Union did, and the severe fuel shortages that the country suffered have prompted officials in Havana to allow foreign companies to explore for oil in Cuban waters, starting in the mid-1990's.
 In the meantime, new technology to squeeze more oil from the small existing fields on the island's north coast has increased output to about 75,000 barrels a day from about 10,000 in the early 90's. 
 More than half of Cuba's oil is now produced by a Canadian company, Sherritt International, which has been active in Cuba for a decade. ''We had the advantage of getting in early and sticking with it,'' said Ernie Lalonde, Sherritt's director of investor relations. He said the company was considering an exploration project similar to Repsol's in the Cuban portion of the Gulf of Mexico, which covers some 43,000 square miles.
 Other foreign energy companies that have ventured into Cuba lately have not been as lucky as Sherritt. Brazil's national oil company, Petroleo Brasiliero, or Petrobras, one of the most experienced offshore producers, came up empty-handed after spending $17 million drilling in Cuban waters in 2001. 
 Senior executives at Repsol acknowledge that their Cuba venture is far from a sure thing. ''These are high-risk areas, but we are optimistic,'' said Alfonso Cortina, Repsol's chief executive, earlier this year. 
 Cuba still depends on imports for about half its oil, nearly all bought on preferential terms under an agreement with the leftist Venezuelan government of President Hugo Chavez. The cost strains Cuba's limited hard-currency earnings, and the country is striving to reduce its dependence on imports. 
 When more than 100 representatives of American agricultural companies attended a trade conference in Havana this spring, senior energy and finance officials in the Cuban government used the opportunity to suggest Cuba as a destination for energy investments. ''There is no reason U.S. companies shouldn't take advantage and compete so close to home,'' said Juan Fleites, a senior executive at Cubapetroleo. 
 No reason, that is, other than the American sanctions, which are not expected to be relaxed anytime soon. A significant hurdle to any plan to ease sanctions are the large claims outstanding against Cuba for assets and businesses seized when Fidel Castro came to power in the late 1950's and for debts run up since then. International creditors have been discussing the claims with the Castro government for a decade without making much headway. 
 An oil discovery large enough to yield exports as well as satisfy Cuba's own energy needs could change that, by significantly improving the economy and adding a major new source of hard currency to the modest amounts Cuba now earns primarily from tourism. With more resources to make payments, the Cubans would have an easier time settling the old claims. 
 ''Put simply, oil would lift Cuba's boat, especially if crude prices stay high,'' said Tim Lynch, an expert on the Cuban economy and director of the Center for Economic Analysis at Florida State University. ''Enough oil would also lessen Cuba's dependence on Venezuela, redrawing the political and economic map of the Caribbean.'' 
 Matthew Pickles, a senior manager in the Barbados office of Ernst & Young, recently told energy executives at a conference in Port of Spain, Trinidad, that an oil discovery in Cuba could also lead to the building of new refineries or the expansion of existing ones, potentially making Cuba a refining center for the eastern Caribbean, Mexico and Venezuela. 
 Such rosy predictions aside, geologists and industry analysts are eagerly waiting to see what Repsol's drill rig turns up, if only to learn more about one of the few stretches of the Gulf of Mexico that is still untested. 
 A significant find might catapult Cuba into a category of small countries that are emerging as risky but alluring new targets for oil development -- among them Mauritania, Senegal, Morocco and Guinea-Bissau, according to Robert W. Esser, director of global oil and gas resources at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. A dry hole, on the other hand, would reinforce the conventional wisdom that American and Mexican waters are the best parts of the gulf for oil.
 ''Cuba's way out on the frontier of present-day wildcatting,'' Mr. Esser said.

HEADLINE: European Environmental Rules Propel Change in U.S.

BYLINE: By OTTO POHL

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
When Darcy White of Raytown, Mo., chose to breast-feed her baby daughter two years ago, she had never heard of brominated flame retardants. But after randomly participating in a study, she learned that her breast milk carried unusually high levels of the chemicals. 
 Since then, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced an agreement with chemical manufacturers to phase out the worst of these toxic compounds, which are present in a wide variety of consumer goods like furniture and computer monitors, and Congress is considering legislation to make the ban permanent. 
 But it was only after the chemicals had been banned here in Europe that sufficient political pressure built for a phaseout in the United States. 
 That cycle was no accident. Globalization has often been condemned as encouraging a race to the bottom as multinationals seek the cheapest and least regulated place to do business. But increasingly, American environmental and public health advocates see globalization as a way to start a race to the top. They are taking their issues to the European Union, hoping to use regulations there as a lever for regulations in the United States. 
 ''We are putting more resources into Europe than we otherwise would have done,'' says Charlotte Brody, coordinator of Health Care Without Harm, a Washington-based group attempting to reduce harmful substances in hospital supplies. ''We desperately need the E.U. to be raising the bar and show what is possible.''
 Environmental groups, too, are working more closely with European lawmakers.
 ''We feel that Europe is a real opportuni ty,'' says Ned Helme, executive director for the Center for Clean Air Policy in Washington. Once Europe moves ahead on programs to curb the gases believed to cause global warming, Mr. Helme believes, it will promote change in the United States. ''We're pushing where the opportunity for innovation is greatest,'' he said. 
 The regulations affect a broad range of American chemical, energy and electronics companies, and industry groups say bureaucrats they did not elect are wielding unprecedented power over them, based on insufficient evidence of harm.
 ''The E.U. is going where no man has gone before,'' says James Lovegrove, managing director of the European division of the American Electronics Association, a United States industry lobby. ''The moment the ink hits the paper in Europe it becomes a global piece of legislation.''
 The generally stricter European laws reflect a different philosophical approach to regulation, says Dr. Indra Spiecker, a lawyer specialized in comparative law and assistant professor for American law at the University of Osnabruck in Germany. American lawmakers primarily look to cost-benefit analysis, which holds that the benefit of imposing regulation should outweigh its cost. European nations have more readily embraced what is called the precautionary principle. Essentially, Europeans emphasize the cost of inaction, while Americans tend to focus on the cost of action.
 ''Fifteen years ago consumer issues would start in the United States and sweep over to Europe,'' says Ursula Schliessner, a product safety lawyer at McKenna Long & Aldridge in Brussels. ''Now when there are consumer issues in the E.U. they trigger reactions in the United States.''
 In the case of the flame retardants, scientists from the Environmental Working Group, researching the prevalence of the chemicals in American mothers, discovered that Ms. White, an outwardly healthy 31-year-old practicing nurse, had some of the highest levels ever recorded. Studies have shown that, in laboratory animals, the chemicals can cause severe damage to the brain, especially in the first months of life. No one has proved that the substances are dangerous to humans, and Ms. White's daughter, Katelyn, is thriving.
 Although concerned, Ms. White does not warn expectant mothers who come to her maternity ward to be tested for the chemicals. ''You don't want to freak out mothers more than they already are,'' she says.
 But Dr. Linda Birnbaum, director of the experimental toxicology division at the E.P.A., says the risk identified in the European studies, which then triggered additional research in America, was high enough to warrant action.
 A co-author of the current legislation in Congress, Representative Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, also says the European action against the substance was important to raise the issue in the United States. ''The fact that the E.U. is taking steps really helps give us an argument'' to ban the substances, she said.
 European legislation can have an even more immediate impact in an area like consumer electronics. Because of the global nature of the electronics business, a multinational that redesigns its product to eliminate a substance banned in the E.U. often finds it cheaper to sell that product worldwide. 
 One such law that came into force last year limits or eliminates metals used in electronics considered particularly noxious when they leach into the environment. 
 The E.U. is now considering sweeping new regulation of its chemical industry that has unleashed what analysts here say is the biggest lobbying effort in Brussels ever mounted by American industry.
 The new law, known as Reach, would place the burden of proof of safety on the producers before its sale, rather than waiting for problems to spur regulation later. It would force American chemical companies to comply with the legislation in order to continue exporting to Europe -- and raises the fear of similar legislation in the United States.
 The chemical industry points out that few if any of the unregulated chemicals are causing obvious health crises and says the legislation is overly bureaucratic and expensive. The American Chemical Council has marshaled its members to alter or derail the legislation.
 But American environmental groups are eagerly supporting the law. ''This is the place where the action is,'' says Tony Long, director of the World Wildlife Fund European policy office. He sees the potential effects of Reach broader than its technical jurisdiction. ''This will have results around the world,'' he says.

U.S. Officials Say C.I.A. Held Back Arms Data
The Central Intelligence Agency was told by relatives of Iraqi scientists that Baghdad's programs to develop unconventional weapons had been abandoned, but the C.I.A. failed to give that information to President Bush, even as he publicly warned of the threat posed by Iraq's illicit weapons, officials said. The agency's failure -- among many others -- has been uncovered by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which plans to release a wide-ranging and scathing report this week. A1

Iraq's oil wealth is so crucial to any hope for a stable future that an armada of American, British and Australian warships circles the isolated and rusting oil depots 15 miles offshore where it ends up. An attack could be catastrophic to the environment as well as the Iraqi oil industry, American military and industry officials say. A1

An Iraqi militant group released a statement saying it had taken a United States marine it had earlier threatened with beheading to a ''place of safety'' after the marine promised to abandon the American forces. Also, the American military launched an airstrike in Falluja. Residents and hospital officials said at least 10 people had been killed, The Associated Press reported. A8

Milosevic's Trial Postponed
The poor health of Slobodan Milosevic, the former Yugoslav president and Serbian leader, prompted judges to postpone his defense case and question whether his war crimes trial could go on. The judges said they would rule on a demand to impose a defense counsel on Mr. Milosevic, who is defending himself. A4

Election in Indonesia
Scattered early results from polling stations in Indonesia's first direct presidential election showed that the frontrunner, Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was likely to win, election observers said. But it also seemed likely that he would not capture more than 50 percent of the vote and would have to face a run-off election in September. A6

Woman Elected in Mexico
Mexican voters have chosen a woman, Amalia Garcia of the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, to be governor of Zacatecas and elected two migrants running for mayoral posts -- including one popularly known as ''the tomato king'' -- while thumping President Vicente Fox's party in its northern Mexico heartland. A6

Right to Hit Children Upheld
The House of Lords -- the upper house of Parliament -- resolved to limit, but not forbid, the right of parents to hit their children, changing a 144-year-old law that gave parents the right to strike children as ''reasonable chastisement'' for misbehavior. The vote represented a victory for Prime Minister Tony Blair, who supported an alternative proposal for physical punishment. A4

NATIONAL A12-17

Standstill in Congress Affects Welfare Programs
Welfare programs around the country are in limbo because of a stalemate in Congress that has prompted state officials to postpone new investments in child care, expansions of job training and most other initiatives for welfare recipients and low-wage workers. A1

Kerry Set for Announcement
John Kerry's advisers said he was planning to announce his running mate this morning and was orchestrating a rollout of the Democratic ticket first on the Internet, then at a rally in Pittsburgh and in a multistate tour beginning in Ohio and ending later this week in the vice presidential candidate's hometown. A17

President Bush's campaign strategists say they are planning to attack Senator John Kerry's running mate as a second choice no matter who it turns out to be. They say Mr. Kerry has made clear that his first choice was a Republican who still stands at Mr. Bush's side, Senator John McCain. A17

Wal-Mart Seeks Factory Sites
Wal-Mart is trying to turn two former manufacturing plants in Chicago into stores, a transformation that would reflect changes that are reshaping the economies of Chicago and much of urban America. It may lead Wal-Mart to reassess some of the corporate practices that have earned it huge profits but also turned it into a target for labor groups. A12

Nuclear Cleanup on Hold
An effort to clean up a nuclear weapons plant near Cincinnati was set to enter its final phase this week, but the state of Ohio, after years of pushing for the cleanup, now wants the waste left alone. A12

Fire Threatens Observatory
Firefighters widened a defensive ring around a mountaintop observatory to try to hold back two wildfires and protect one of the world's most powerful telescopes, which is under construction there. A12

HEADLINE: Former General Wins Most Votes in Indonesia Election

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Tuesday, July 6 

 BODY:
A former general won the largest number of votes in the country's first direct presidential election on Monday, early results showed. But Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono failed to win a majority and will face a runoff election in September against the second-place candidate.
 A quick count of votes by the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs from 2,500 polling stations showed that General Yudhoyono, 54, received 33.9 percent of the votes. President Megawati Sukarnoputri had 24.9 percent of the votes and another former general, Wiranto, had 23.8 percent in a tight race for second place. Similarly, the national Election Commission's tally of 13 million votes, about 9 percent of those cast, gave General Yudhoyono 33.18 percent, Mrs. Megawati 26.64 and General Wiranto 23.34 percent. 
 The possibility of a head-to-head battle between two former military men, General Yudhoyono and General Wiranto, who has been indicted for war crimes in East Timor by a United Nations-supported tribunal, is considered one of the worst possibilities by Indonesian political reformers.
 Both men served during the three-decade iron rule of General Suharto, although General Yudhoyono, who was minister for security in President Megawati's civilian government, is seen as a better prospect for restoring confidence in the faltering Indonesian economy. He was perceived by many voters as an anticorruption politician, but he remained vague about how he would tackle the pervasive problem.
 Soon after General Yudhoyono's victory seemed assured, his campaign manager, Rahmat Witoelar, told a television interviewer: ''We thank God and the people for this. We will enter the second round with a vow to do better.''
 An element of uncertainty about the results arose when an unexpected number of completed ballots were declared invalid at polling stations. The national Election Commission ruled that ballots inadvertently marked with two punches -- but where the voter's intention was clear -- should be recounted as valid.
 Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country, and its unfolding democratic practices are being watched with interest in the West, particularly among those concerned with the debate over whether Islam and democracy are compatible. Of the five candidates, not one advocated establishing an Islamic state.
 Even if Mrs. Megawati qualifies for the second round, it appears that she would have difficulty overcoming the new appeal of General Yudhoyono, who left her cabinet several months ago to run against her.
 How well General Wiranto would fare in a runoff against General Yudhoyono remained in doubt. In Jakarta, General Wiranto, who had the backing of the old Suharto political machine, was defeated at his own polling station by General Yudhoyono.
 For Indonesian activists who pushed hard for democratic reforms since the collapse of General Suharto's authoritarian rule in 1998, the very fact that there was direct voting for president was a victory.
 ''This is a giant step,'' said Todung Mulya Lubis, the founder of the Center for Electoral Reform, as he toured polling places in the capital to monitor the voting. ''People are very happy that finally they have the opportunity to vote for the leader they want.'' 
 The presidents since Suharto's fall, including Mrs. Megawati, a daughter of the late Indonesia leader Sukarno, were chosen by the national legislature. 
 More than 153 million people were eligible to cast votes, and the turnout in some urban areas exceeded 70 percent just a few hours after the polls opened.
 International observers, including former President Jimmy Carter and 60 officials from his Carter Center and more than 100 monitors from the European Union, reported few problems during the voting. 
 In some polling places in Jakarta, General Yudhoyono had received more than 40 percent of the vote, according to Hank Valentino, a senior adviser to the International Foundation for Election Systems.
 There were also reports that he had taken 60 percent of the vote in some polling stations in West Papua, one of Indonesia's most remote provinces.
 In Bali, a traditional stronghold for Mrs. Megawati, General Yudhoyono had also come in first at some polling places, Mr. Valentino said. 
 The problem of the invalid ballots arose when election officials found that many ballots had been punched twice. That happened when voters failed to unfold the concertinalike ballot paper and punched the picture of their preferred candidate with the ballot still folded. The punch had then gone through to another part of the ballot paper. 
 But aside from that problem, lengthy preparations by the national Election Commission appeared to have paid off. Hundreds of thousands of polling place workers supervised the proceedings Monday, and a computerized tallying system was in place to count the final results. 
 In many places there were reports of an upbeat mood. Here in the capital, platters of cakes and sweets brought by volunteers for the election workers, and soft drinks to ward off the intense tropical heat, added an air of festivity. 
 In Tambora, a district of government-subsidized housing for the poor, polling stations were fashioned by pulling tarpaulins over open-air courtyards of the apartment blocks. 
 General Yudhoyono seemed to be a popular choice in the poorer neighborhood.
 ''We've already given Megawati a chance, and she can't prove anything,'' said Berlin, 27, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''Wiranto is too militaristic,'' he said, referring to the other former general in the race. ''S.B.Y. can reduce prices and make our country get better,'' he added, using General Yudhoyono's initials.

HEADLINE: 15 Miles Offshore, Safeguarding Iraq's Oil Lifeline

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: KHOR AL AMAYA OIL TERMINAL, Iraq, July 1 

 BODY:
The oil wealth that Iraq is counting on as its best hope for a stable future flows through rattling pipelines to lonely, rusting depots 15 miles offshore, so isolated that an armada of American, British and Australian warships is circling them to prevent the threat of waterborne suicide attackers.
 Even little fishing dhows that ply the waters of the Persian Gulf have been guarded against, since attackers in three boats sped toward Khor al Amaya and its larger sister terminal, Al Basra, and blew themselves up on April 24.
 The vulnerable site is crucial to Iraq's economic future, and an attack could be catastrophic to the environment as well as the Iraqi oil industry, American military and industry officials say.
 ''Every day I tell them -- I say, look, guys, in the grand scheme of things there may be no other place where our armed forces are deployed that has a greater strategic importance,'' said Capt. Kurt Tidd, commander of the Fifth Fleet task force that is protecting the terminals, as he bounced over the waves on a small rigid-hulled inflatable boat toward the Khor terminal's platform. 
 ''We can't win the war here, but we can lose it in a flash,'' Captain Tidd said.
 The April attacks cost the lives of two American sailors and a coast guardsman but did not cause extensive damage to the terminals. The coordinated attacks served notice that someone with deep knowledge of the Iraqi oil industry has cast a malignant eye on its jugular.
 Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said recently that sabotage attacks on pipelines crisscrossing Iraq's desert mainland had already cost the nation $200 million in lost revenue. 
 For a country with Iraq's profound social and political needs and devastated civil infrastructure, that cost is formidable. But a broken pipeline can be fixed in a few days -- quite unlike any severe damage to the giant, isolated oil terminals, which are already in a state of seedy disrepair.
 [Workers struggled Monday to repair a crucial pipeline shut down after sabotage over the weekend by looters, The Associated Press reported. Exports were cut nearly in half because of damage to the pipeline, which feeds the Basra and Khor al Amaya terminals.]
 Since the two terminals reopened in March 2003 after the American-led invasion, 287 tankers had been filled in the deep waters at the two terminals as of late June. That accounted for 65.6 million metric tons of crude oil and revenue of more than $12 billion, according to figures provided by the Fifth Fleet, which is operating in the Persian Gulf.
 This strangely disconnected place on the glittering waters of the gulf may in the end tell as much about the course of the war as the grim battles on the desert mainland.
 The scale of the security effort indicates the American commitment. Captain Tidd can call into play some 20 ships and 2,000 sailors and other personnel, not to mention helicopters, advanced surveillance equipment and weaponry aboard the platforms themselves.
 The task force tries to enforce ''exclusion zones'' of 2,000 meters, or more than a mile, around the terminals where traffic is no longer allowed.
 ''We kind of form a band of steel right around the exclusion zone,'' said Cmdr. Steven A. Mucklow of the Cushing, an American destroyer that is part of the task force.
 Yet vessels from swarms of a hundred or more fishing and cargo boats still intrude. About once a week, some boat ignores the klaxons and radioed warnings from the patrolling ships, which then fire flares and warning shots across the vessel's bow.
 Since April 24 no boat has motored directly at the platforms, and sailors say they are unsure whether the boats are testing the new defenses or just looking for a prime fishing spot.
 ''One of the challenges is to try to decide what is innocent behavior and what is potentially criminal or worse,'' said Capt. Adrian Cassar, commander of the Grafton, a British frigate in the task force.
 Hanging over the entire effort is uncertainty about the wishes of the new Iraqi government. No high-ranking officials have visited the area, and Captain Tidd said his main Iraqi contacts were the local managers of the platforms.
 ''Our direction from our bosses,'' he said, referring to the Fifth Fleet's commanders, was, 'Keep doing as you're doing until you're told otherwise.' ''
 A visit to the Khor al Amaya terminal begins with a 50-foot climb up from the water on an old rope ladder that is missing one of its wooden rungs.
 Up top is a scene that could have come from the movie ''Waterworld'': misshapen catwalks with pieces of scrap metal tossed over gaping holes, heaps of parts from broken pumps and cranes; bullet holes and shell damage from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and the 1991 Persian Gulf war; a row of big pressure gauges on a series of pipes that read dead zero. A humbled Manitowoc 3900 crane looks as if it has not been painted in 30 years. It was once red.
 The southern section of the platform is not used at all, because it was heavily damaged in one conflict or another. But elsewhere a black and red Indian tanker called the Gandhar is riding high in the water, taking on oil, patrolled by a lone man in a blue hard hat way up on the deck. 
 Amid the wrecked equipment and the welter of useless piping on the oil platform, it is hard to find the live pipeline that is feeding the tanker.
 But finally, there it is: a dirty gray pipe sporting a pressure gauge that reads 40 pounds per square inch rather than zero. An ear to the pipe turns up a groaning, knocking noise, as if this great artery of wealth were in need of an angioplasty. 
 Followed backward, the pipe arches downward and plunges into the water around the barnacle-choked underbelly of the platform with no more ceremony or protection than a big sewage conduit might have.
 ''This is the Iraqi future trying to get on its feet,'' Captain Tidd said hopefully.
 Nearby, one of just two Iraqi oil workers seen during the roughly two-hour visit was fishing off the side of one of the catwalks. But Iraqi security workers stopped two of the three boats involved in the April attack with a hail of gunfire and caused them to explode prematurely, and now there is plenty of American security visible here as well.
 Joel Miranda, a 19-year-old sailor from Orlando, Fla., with a fresh white toothbrush emerging from a pocket in his flak jacket, can see bits of wrecked ships poking up from Iranian territorial waters from where he stands at a gun emplacement on the northern edge of the platform.
 Just the week before, he said, he watched as a dhow crept inside the exclusion zone and did not turn back until a patrol boat fired 10 warning shots over its bow.
 ''To me it looked like someone testing us,'' he said, ''to see how far we'd let him go.''
 The boat never got close enough for him to be authorized to fire his gun. ''At 500 yards is where we take 'em out,'' he said.
 Elsewhere on the platform, in an air-conditioned room jammed with electronics, two technicians keep track of 40 to 50 nearby boats simultaneously with radar, optical imagery and other equipment.
 The sophistication and scale of the operation raises the question of when, or whether, the Iraqis can safely take over the job from the United States and its allies. A Fifth Fleet spokesman said the Iraqi navy effectively consisted of five Chinese-made patrol boats. 
 Two Iraqi officers were aboard the Cushing recently for training, and a fact sheet made available by United States Naval Forces Central Command said 200 Iraqis received training earlier this year for the newly formed Iraqi Coastal Defense Force.
 The Iraqis have ''an embryonic patrol capability,'' said Captain Cassar of the Grafton.
 For now, said Sgt. Fergy Gask of the Royal Marines, who leads one of the teams that carries out boarding operations, the maritime operation reminds him of nothing more than Britain's struggle with the Irish Republican Army.
 ''We were doing a very similar job in Northern Ireland before we came out here,'' Sergeant Gask said. ''Obviously it's going to be a very prolonged operation. But what isn't these days?''


CORRECTION-DATE: September 18, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page picture caption on Tuesday with an article about military protection of Iraq's Persian Gulf oil terminals gave an incorrect identification in some copies for the one shown. It was the Basra terminal; Khor al Amaya is a smaller one nearby.

A picture caption on July 6 with a front-page article about efforts to protect the Khor Al Amaya and Basra oil terminals, off Iraq, misidentified three of the four men from the destroyer Cushing on routine patrol in the area. The four were Gunner's Mate Brian W. Bressan, Technician Michael Sahlberg, Technician Clinton Comer (who was correctly identified) and Electrician David Benson. An e-mail message from Technician Sahlberg on Sept. 2 alerted The Times that the identifications were incorrect; this correction was delayed for verification of the correct identifications.

HEADLINE: Airlines That Are in It for the Long Haul

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey. 
On the Road appears each Tuesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
''You're doing what?'' my wife said a couple of weeks ago when I sprang it on her.
 ''I'm going around the world.''
 ''Why?'' she asked.
 I had no sensible reply for that, other than that I could. 
 And I did. On Monday, June 28, Singapore Airlines began flying the longest nonstop commercial flight in history, from Singapore to Newark. To ride on it, I had to get to Singapore, obviously. So four days earlier, I took a one-stop to Singapore -- 22 hours, counting a three-hour layover in Amsterdam. Then that Monday, I boarded the new nonstop and flew 10,300 miles -- and a little over 18 hours -- back to Newark. To catch prevailing tail winds, both flights flew eastward, so I literally went around the world. 
 Nonstops are increasingly important to business travelers. Travel to and from Asia is booming, and it is expected to continue expanding indefinitely, especially as China emerges as a major business destination. That means more business travelers will be facing longer flights, and major airlines are gearing up to grab the business.
 It's a high-end market, too. Business travelers important enough to be sent halfway around the world usually aren't expected to sit in the middle seat in coach, knees jammed against a tray table for 12 or 18 hours. ''Business class is where all the action is'' in long-haul markets for business travelers, said Eddie Ong, the director of in-flight services for Singapore Air.
 My outbound flight from Newark was on a Singapore Airlines 747, in business class. Like British Air, Virgin Atlantic and several other international carriers in the trans-Atlantic markets, Singapore offers great food and service, along with spacious seats that glide down into fully flat beds with the touch of a keypad. 
 Each seat has its own video screen with headphones. Among the 400 on-demand video and audio selections were 60 movies. I ate, dozed and read a good chunk of ''Stalin: The Court of the Red Star,'' by Simon Sebag Montefiore before the plane arrived for the stopover at Schiphol Airport. 
 Many regard that Dutch airport as one of the world's best, but you couldn't tell that from this experience. With a horde of fellow passengers, I stood in a stifling international holding pen for three hours until we all were allowed to reboard the 747 for the long stretch to Singapore.
 On that leg, I watched four movies. One of them was the inane, ribald and in my opinion quite amusing comedy ''Along Came Polly.'' A moment of surrealism occurred when, during this silly and distinctly American movie, I glanced over to my neighbor's video screen, which displayed the in-flight map that showed exactly where the plane was -- about seven miles above Kabul.
 Movies, good food and drink, flat-bed snoozing and dictator-biography reading aside, the flight seemed interminable, mostly because of the uncomfortable layover in the Amsterdam holding pen. Give me a nonstop, I thought upon arrival in Singapore at 6.30 a.m., to begin a long day of meetings and interviews.
 Specifically to provide nonstop service on superlong routes, Singapore Airlines acquired a fleet of ultra-long-haul four-engine Airbus A345 aircraft, and configured them in two classes, its Raffles business class and its Executive Economy class. These planes -- Singapore currently has five, with an option to buy five more from Airbus -- were introduced this year on a new nonstop route between Los Angeles and Singapore.
 In an era when domestic airlines, and many foreign carriers as well, are cramming as many people into tiny seats as is physically possible, Singapore configured the new A345's with 64 flat-bed seats in business and 117 seats in economy. The coach seats have a spacious 37-inch pitch -- the distance between your seat and the one ahead of you --and also have the same in-flight entertainment systems as the ones in business class.
 ''The A345 is not a wide airplane, but we designed it so you get a sense of space,'' said Yeoh Teng Kwong, Singapore's senior manager for product innovation. Though Singapore configured the planes with only 181 seats, ''you could put in 250 seats if you wanted to.'' Leaving out those seats left room to create a small self-service snack bar area where passengers can stretch their legs and congregate. 
 ''Years back, when we produced the Singapore-to-London nonstop, there were also some doubters as to whether passengers would get used to flying in a confined space for 13 hours,'' Mr. Yeoh said. ''Now, it has become almost unthinkable for anybody who wants to travel from Asia to Europe to fly via another transit point. Everybody's going for a nonstop. So that product has become accepted in the market, and the same will go for the ultra-long-haul flights.''
 The aircraft industry is betting on that. In 2006, Airbus will introduce its long-haul A380 aircraft, capable of carrying more than 800 passengers. There is intense speculation over how the various airlines who have ordered the superjumbos will configure them. Some will undoubtedly fly them as cattle cars, while others will put in far fewer seats and market the planes for their walk-about comfort.
 Boeing, meanwhile, is developing the 7E7 Dreamliner, which has a range of up to 9,800 miles. It is promoting it as a plane that provides ''comfortable, nonstop, point-to-point travel to more destinations around the world.''
 Oh, about my flight home, the nonstop one. Still exhausted from my trip over, I slept for a total of about 13 hours. It's the first time I've ever been able to work off jet lag on a jet.

HEADLINE: Stocks Abroad Close Mixed After Slow Day

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, July 5 

 BODY:
Trading in European and Asian shares was mixed Monday, with business slower on many exchanges. Investors were cautious about taking fresh positions with the United States market closed to observe Independence Day.
 The F.T.S.E. 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.09 percent lower, at 4,403.30, on the London Stock Exchange, as higher oil prices underpinned energy stocks, but restricted the upside for companies vulnerable to oil-related expenses. 
 The C.A.C. 40 index of French blue chips ended 0.08 percent higher, at 3,688.18, with strength in energy shares offset somewhat by weakness in the automotive sector. In Frankfurt, the DAX index of Germany's biggest companies slipped 0.08 percent, to 3,995.73, in quiet trading.
 ''It's been very dull; no Wall Street generally kills interest,'' said Graham Orton, a dealer at the London brokerage firm Marshall Securities.
 Elsewhere in Europe, markets finished up 0.12 percent in Milan, and up 0.32 percent in Madrid. Other exchanges ended in negative territory, with Amsterdam down 0.58 percent, Stockholm lower by 0.39 percent, and Zurich off by 0.33 percent.
 Asian stock markets closed generally mixed, with prices falling in Tokyo after last week's declines on Wall Street.
 The Nikkei stock average of 225 issues in Tokyo fell 179.78 points, or 1.53 percent, to 11,541.71. Traders said market players were increasingly nervous about prospects for United States stocks ahead of quarterly earnings reports this week. Tokyo closely tracks the United States market.
 In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng index edged up 31.98 points, or 0.26 percent, to 12,252.11. Prices opened lower as investors took their cue from last week's declines on Wall Street, but rose later in the session on selective bargain hunting, brokers said.
 Shares ended higher in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Singapore and Sydney but fell elsewhere. The market was closed in Indonesia for presidential elections.
 On Friday, United States stocks fell after the Labor Department said the economy created 112,000 jobs in June -- less than half the number economists had expected.

PERSON: Joseph Wasserman

HEADLINE: Joseph Wasserman, 73, Housing Architect

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Joseph Wasserman, an architect active in community planning and affordable housing, both urban and rural, died on June 25 at his home in Stockbridge, Mass. He was 73.
 His death was announced by the Finnerty & Stevens Funeral Home, which said the cause was a cancer diagnosed two year ago. 
 Mr. Wasserman, who continued to work on a project in Stockbridge until last month, formerly worked in New York in partnership with Norman Hoberman and, later, Jerome Kretchmer. He moved to the Berkshires in 1991, after which he worked part time on projects in Great Barrington and Stockbridge.
 Born in Philadelphia, he graduated from Harvard College and the Harvard Graduate School of Design before joining Mr. Hoberman on projects in New York City, Albany and New England. 
 Their firm worked on designs for the New York State Urban Development Corporation, some 2,000 units including buildings for the elderly in Coney Island and housing in Westchester and Rochester.
 In the 1980's, working with Mr. Kretchmer, he was a principal in designing and developing affordable housing in urban renewal zones. One of those initiatives on the Upper West Side in the 1980's produced the Columbus Townhouses, a row of condominiums on West 89th Street that won a citation from the City Club of New York in 1990.
 Mr. Wasserman was a former president of the New York City chapter of the American Institute of Architecture.
 He is survived by his second wife, Jane Ryan; three daughters, Lindsay Wasserman of La Honda, Calif., Andrea Wasserman of Vershire, Vt., and Marion Wasserman of Santa Fe., N.M.; six grandchildren; and his stepdaughters Nina and Laura Ryan. Also surviving are his former wife, Bay Wasserman of New York City; a sister, Marie Ridder of McLean, Va.; and a brother, William S. of Ipswich, Mass.

HEADLINE: Treading Carefully, Wal-Mart Enters Labor's Turf

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 3 

 BODY:
The rusting hulk of the former Ryerson Tull steel fabricating plant in South Chicago is a remnant of the days when tens of thousands of workers made this city a world center of steel manufacturing and other heavy industries. Several miles away, a shuttered factory that once produced Helene Curtis cosmetics is one of scores of light manufacturing plants that were the economic backbone of Chicago's once-thriving West Side.
 These two buildings are ghosts from a lost era, but they may represent the future of the United States economy. In May, the Chicago City Council approved Wal-Mart's application to open its first Chicago store, on the site of the Helene Curtis plant. This month, it is to consider the giant retailer's proposal to build a store on the site of the Ryerson Tull plant.
 The transformation of these industrial sites into Wal-Mart stores would reflect sweeping changes that are reshaping the economies of Chicago and much of urban America. It may also lead Wal-Mart to reassess some of the corporate practices that have earned it huge profits but also drawn criticism from labor and community groups across the country. 
 ''In Chicago, you have to be willing to step out of your so-called comfort zone and what you're used to doing,'' said John Bisio, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. ''We recognize that there are experiences there that are different from other places. Organized labor is very strong there. We know we're going to be subject to great scrutiny, and we really want to adhere or conform to the spirit of how things are done in Chicago.''
 Mr. Bisio said that in Chicago, Wal-Mart would work with local leaders in choosing some of its employees and buy products and services from local and minority-owned businesses. He said he doubted the company would soften its opposition to labor unions, ''but that's not to say there won't be times when criticism or scrutiny might make you better focus on what you really need to do for your own people.''
 For more than a century, giant South Chicago mills and thriving West Side factories absorbed waves of penniless immigrants, first from Europe and then from the Deep South, and gave them the steady income that allowed them to begin sharing the American dream.
 ''These factories played the pivotal role of giving people spending money, which was something many of them had never even imagined before,'' said Leslie F. Orear, president of the Illinois Labor History Society. ''After paying for food and rent, they had money left for a movie or an ice cream cone or better clothing, and after a while even for a car or a vacation or a little house. People also organized themselves, learned leadership skills, learned how to speak in public. They became more sophisticated, more comfortable with politics and with defending their interests. 
 ''This was how they entered the mainstream of American life.''
 Since 1980, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States has fallen by about 25 percent, to 14.4 million from 19.3 million. Some companies consolidated their operations in automated plants that require far fewer workers. Others moved their production lines overseas. 
 Among the workers who lost jobs in this process were about 1,000 Chicagoans who worked at the Helene Curtis and Ryerson Tull plants. The plants survived waves of corporate downsizing but finally succumbed in 2002.
 As these and dozens of other Chicago factories closed, communities collapsed with them. Huge areas of South Chicago, once home to plants like U.S. Steel's giant South Works, which included 100 buildings and employed 20,000 people, now stand eerily still. 
 West Side neighborhoods near the Helene Curtis plant, largely poor and African-American, are plagued by unemployment, drugs, gang violence and other forms of social decomposition. Wal-Mart's decision to open stores on the sites of the shuttered factories set off an intense debate. Aldermen who represent both neighborhoods were thrilled by the prospect of hundreds of new jobs.
 But other local leaders began a fierce campaign to block Wal-Mart, which they describe as a predatory company that pays low wages, offers minimal benefits, vigorously opposes efforts at unionization and crushes small businesses. 
 Mr. Bisio, the Wal-Mart spokesman, disputed that view. ''You hear people saying we pay minimal wages and give no benefits, but that's so not so,'' he said. ''People don't realize or recognize that our track record is a lot better than what our detractors say about us.'' 
 If manufacturing was once the bedrock of the American economy, globalized service and retail businesses have now assumed that role. Wal-Mart, which has dominated the market for many consumer products through its purchasing power, is now the largest private employer in the United States.
 ''It's no accident that Wal-Mart picked two neighborhoods that are desperate for economic development as the places to start their move into Chicago,'' said David Ranney, an economist who has worked as a consultant for labor unions and community groups here. ''They're taking the path of least resistance.''
 Supporters of Wal-Mart paint a very different picture. 
 ''It's not an end, but it's a beginning,'' said Alderwoman Emma Mitts, who represents the neighborhood where the West Side Wal-Mart is to be built. ''For a lot of people, this will be their first job of any kind. This is where they'll learn that in the world of work, you have to show up on time, you have to look good, you have to be helpful and courteous. Our young people are going to learn how to stock shelves, how to answer customers' questions, how to make change. 
 ''Don't underestimate what it will mean to our community to have a place where young people can learn skills like these.''
 Alderwoman Mitts and other supporters say that once the stores open, they will press the company to provide higher pay and more benefits to workers than it provides in the more than 3,500 stores it now operates across the United States.
 ''Wal-Mart is used to operating in the South and in rural areas, but they're going to find that Chicago is different,'' said Al Sams, manager of a filling station near the old Ryerson Tull plant. ''Maybe they'll have to do some things here that they never had to do in other places.''
 Around the corner from the former Helene Curtis plant, opinion about Wal-Mart is divided. Sharaf Ihmud, manager of a variety store that sells items as diverse as rugs and greeting cards, said he was certain that his store would be forced out of business soon after Wal-Mart opens. ''It's going to kill us,'' Mr. Ihmud said. ''It's bad for us and for all businesses around here.''
 Wal-Mart is entering Chicago at a time when it faces a number of unaccustomed challenges. In April, voters in Inglewood, Calif., rejected the company's effort to build a so-called supercenter there. Last month a federal judge admitted a class-action suit on behalf of 1.6 million of the company's past and present female employees who, according to the suit, were victims of systematic sex discrimination. Wal-Mart has denied discriminating against women and vowed to fight the lawsuit. 
 Some leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. are urging that the labor movement make Wal-Mart the target of an organizing campaign bigger than anything it has undertaken in a generation. ''They say you can't organize Wal-Mart because it's too big, but they also said that about U.S. Steel,'' Ed Sadlowski, a former leader of the United Steelworkers of America, said as he stood among the weeds that have sprouted through the asphalt at the Ryerson Tull plant. 
 If Wal-Mart and its opponents are to reach some kind of accommodation, that process could start in Chicago.
 ''The issues that Wal-Mart raises are just starting to come onto the political radar screen,'' said Nik Theodore, director of the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''Outsourcing is a big issue now. So is the question of how government policies encourage American companies to move overseas or buy from overseas suppliers.

HEADLINE: Bye-Bye, Bush Boom

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When does optimism -- the Bush campaign's favorite word these days -- become an inability to face facts? On Friday, President Bush insisted that a seriously disappointing jobs report, which fell far short of the pre-announcement hype, was good news: ''We're witnessing steady growth, steady growth. And that's important. We don't need boom-or-bust-type growth.''
 But Mr. Bush has already presided over a bust. For the first time since 1932, employment is lower in the summer of a presidential election year than it was on the previous Inauguration Day. Americans badly need a boom to make up the lost ground. And we're not getting it. 
 When March's numbers came in much better than expected, I cautioned readers not to make too much of one good month. Similarly, we shouldn't make too much of June's disappointment. The question is whether, taking a longer perspective, the economy is performing well. And the answer is no.
 If you want a single number that tells the story, it's the percentage of adults who have jobs. When Mr. Bush took office, that number stood at 64.4. By last August it had fallen to 62.2 percent. In June, the number was 62.3. That is, during Mr. Bush's first 30 months, the job situation deteriorated drastically. Last summer it stabilized, and since then it may have improved slightly. But jobs are still very scarce, with little relief in sight.
 Bush campaign ads boast that 1.5 million jobs were added in the last 10 months, as if that were a remarkable achievement. It isn't. During the Clinton years, the economy added 236,000 jobs in an average month. Those 1.5 million jobs were barely enough to keep up with a growing working-age population.
 In the spring, it seemed as if the pace of job growth was accelerating: in March and April, the economy added almost 700,000 jobs. But that now looks like a blip -- a one-time thing, not a break in the trend. May growth was slightly below the Clinton-era average, and June's numbers -- only 112,000 new jobs, and a decline in working hours -- were pretty poor.
 What about overall growth? After two and a half years of slow growth, real G.D.P. surged in the third quarter of 2003, growing at an annual rate of more than 8 percent. But that surge appears to have been another blip. In the first quarter of 2004, growth was down to 3.9 percent, only slightly above the Clinton-era average. Scattered signs of weakness -- rising new claims for unemployment insurance, sales warnings at Target and Wal-Mart, falling numbers for new durable goods orders -- have led many analysts to suspect that growth slowed further in the second quarter.
 And economic growth is passing working Americans by. The average weekly earnings of nonsupervisory workers rose only 1.7 percent over the past year, lagging behind inflation. The president of Aetna, one of the biggest health insurers, recently told investors, ''It's fair to say that a lot of the jobs being created may not be the jobs that come with benefits.'' Where is the growth going? No mystery: after-tax corporate profits as a share of G.D.P. have reached a level not seen since 1929.
 What should we be doing differently? For three years many economists have argued that the most effective job-creating policies would be increased aid to state and local governments, extended unemployment insurance and tax rebates for lower- and middle-income families. The Bush administration paid no attention -- it never even gave New York all the aid Mr. Bush promised after 9/11, and it allowed extended unemployment insurance to lapse. Instead, it focused on tax cuts for the affluent, ignoring warnings that these would do little to create jobs. 
 After good job growth in March and April, the administration declared its approach vindicated. That was premature, to say the least. Whatever boost the economy got from the tax cuts is now behind us, and given the size of the budget deficit, another big tax cut is out of the question. It's time to change the policy mix -- to rescind some of those upper-income cuts and pursue the policies we should have been following all along.
 One last point: government policies could do a lot about the failure of new jobs to come with health benefits, a huge source of anxiety for many American families. John Kerry is right to make health care a central plank of his platform. I'll analyze his proposals in a future column.

David Brooks is on vacation.

HEADLINE: Campaign Politics Seen as Bottleneck For Welfare Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5 

 BODY:
Welfare programs around the country are in limbo because of a stalemate in Congress that has prompted state officials to postpone new investments in child care, expansions of job training and most other initiatives for welfare recipients and low-wage workers.
 Congressional Republicans insist that stricter work requirements must be part of any effort to renew the 1996 welfare law. Democrats, including some who voted against that measure, now embrace it, saying only minor changes are needed.
 Major provisions of the law were scheduled to expire in September 2002. Since then, Congress has passed seven bills extending the program, typically for three months at a time. Lawmakers, who return to work on Tuesday, say they see little chance for approval of a long-term reauthorization this year. 
 If the stalemate persists, states could lose money. The House and the Senate have tentatively agreed to continue providing $16.5 billion a year for the main welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. But with large budget deficits looming, lawmakers say, Congress will be under intense pressure to cut this amount next year. 
 ''Our fear is that if you go past the elections, things will change -- things will change for the worse,'' said Marc S. Ryan, Connecticut's budget director.
 Representative Wally Herger, a California Republican who is chairman of a subcommittee that handles welfare legislation, agreed, saying, ''As time passes, budget pressures will squeeze tighter and tighter.''
 The impasse is remarkable because lawmakers of both parties describe the 1996 law as a success that moved millions of people from welfare to work and cut the welfare rolls by 60 percent, to 4.9 million people. A main goal of the law was to give more control over welfare policy to state and local officials, who now say their hands are tied because of Congress's inaction. 
 ''Welfare reform has become a hostage to the geopolitics of Washington, D.C.,'' said Kevin W. Concannon, director of the Iowa Department of Human Services. 
 Verna Eggleston, the commissioner of New York City's Human Resources Administration, said, ''The ambiguity is staggering.''
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said she sympathized with state and local officials but feared that some of the more conservative Republican proposals would place expensive new requirements on states.
 ''I would like to get it reauthorized because I am a strong supporter of what we did in 1996, and I think the results speak for themselves,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But I am not going to vote for something that would actually turn the clock back.''
 After a decade of innovation, federal and state officials now use words like ''stalled,'' ''stymied'' and ''paralyzed'' to describe the status of welfare legislation and policy. 
 The 1996 law eliminated the individual entitlement to cash assistance and gave each state a lump sum of money with vast discretion over how to use it. Now, uncertain about federal spending levels and the direction of federal policy, state officials have deferred major decisions.
 In many respects, the plight is illustrated in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which together account for nearly 10 percent of the nation's welfare recipients.
 Officials in those states are bracing for the likelihood that Congress will require welfare recipients to work longer hours. Such changes, they say, might force states to expand child care for welfare recipients, perhaps at the expense of child-care subsidies now paid to low-income workers who have left welfare.
 These officials also expressed concern that Congress might cut grants to the states under the main federal welfare program, given the sharp decline in welfare rolls. Additionally, the officials seek more freedom to tailor their programs to local needs. They want to expand the definition of work to include more vocational education and drug treatment, or to permit families on welfare to keep more of the child support that states collect on their behalf.
 Governors and state legislators of both parties are asking Congress to reauthorize the welfare program for five years. Such a package ''will provide states with the predictability needed for the continued success of welfare reform,'' the National Governors Association said in a letter by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, and Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota, a Republican. 
 In another letter, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, urged ''immediate action'' by the Senate so it could begin negotiations with the House, which has twice passed a five-year extension of the 1996 law, with significant revisions.
 Robin Arnold-Williams, executive director of the Utah Department of Human Services, said states were expecting major changes in federal policy, including stricter work requirements, but could not be sure of the details. ''It's hard to be very creative or to do long-term planning when the federal rules can change in 90 days,'' Ms. Arnold-Williams said. 
 Larry E. Temple, executive director of the Texas Workforce Commission, which runs the state's welfare program, said: ''We are extremely disappointed that Congress has failed to reauthorize this program. The lives and economic self-sufficiency of the most needy have become a political football.'' 
 West Virginia plans to cut cash assistance payments by 25 percent on Aug. 1, reducing the monthly allowance for a family of three to $340, from $453. The Senate version of the welfare bill includes a big increase in money for child care. Julie A. Pratt, co-chairwoman of the Coalition for West Virginia's Children, an advocacy group, said that with the extra money ''we could avoid cuts or have smaller cuts'' in welfare checks.
 Welfare debates are less partisan in state capitals than in Congress, where election-year politics have sharpened policy disagreements.
 ''Some Democrats don't want to give President Bush any legislative victories before the election,'' said Wade F. Horn, the assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of welfare policy.
 A little-noticed but key provision of the bills would allow more child support to go directly to children. Welfare recipients must now assign their child-support rights to the state, which must share any collections with the federal government, to help offset the cost of cash assistance. 
 The change is crucial to New York, where Governor Pataki has campaigned to force parents to pay child support. Mr. Pataki's aides said he wanted to get child-support payments to welfare families because the extra money, when combined with earnings from low-wage jobs, could lift them out of poverty.
 Sheri E. Steisel, an analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the shift ''could be tremendously beneficial for families and children.''
 ''Many states believe that a father is more likely to pay child support if he knows the money is going to his family, not the government,'' Ms. Steisel said.
 In Connecticut, the legislature recently approved the creation of 5,000 child care and early education slots, at an estimated cost of more than $20 million a year. But Mr. Ryan, the budget director, said state officials could not finance the initiative until they knew how much federal money they would receive. 
 ''We took a chance on expanding things like child care and early childhood education,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''It does make us worried that the reauthorization has been stalled.''
 In Michigan, Governor Granholm wants to establish a comprehensive system of child care for youngsters up to the age of 5, to ensure that they are ready for school. Marianne Udow, director of the Michigan Family Independence Agency, said: ''We are in limbo. We know that welfare will be reauthorized and we'll have to make some changes, but we're living in a time of such uncertainty that we cannot do long-term planning.''
 Oregon and Iowa are interested in adopting versions of a Maine program that permits low-income people to attend college full-time while receiving public assistance. Michael L. Buckley, the welfare director in Oregon, said the legislature authorized the program last year, with the hope that the federal government would let postsecondary education count as a work activity.
 ''We are ready to go,'' Mr. Buckley said. 
 The Senate version of the welfare bill allows such programs, but the House version does not.
 The House and Senate bills differ in many ways, but both stipulate that 70 percent of adult welfare recipients should be engaged in work activities by 2008, subject to certain adjustments. That proposal has caused confusion and alarm in New York City, where officials say slightly more than half the adults on welfare have disabilities that make it difficult for them to work.
 ''If the federal government comes out with a 70 percent work requirement at this juncture, with this population, New York City is in trouble,'' said Ms. Eggleston, the city's human resources commissioner.
 Mark H. Greenberg, a lawyer at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a research and advocacy group, said, ''Uncertainty is a problem, but a bad bill would be worse.''
 Dr. Horn, the top federal welfare official, said: ''We agree that a bad bill is worse than no bill. But we think we have good bills in both the House and the Senate.''

HEADLINE: Bush Campaign Sees an Opportunity for Attack in Kerry's Overtures to McCain

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 5 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign strategists say they are planning to attack Senator John Kerry's running mate as a second choice no matter who it turns out to be and are preparing a commercial asserting that Mr. Kerry has made clear that his first choice was a Republican who still stands at Mr. Bush's side, Senator John McCain.
 ''We think it's important that people understand that this is a ticket of John Kerry and his second choice,'' Nicolle Devenish, the Bush campaign's communications director, said.
 The effort to turn Mr. Kerry's flirtation with Mr. McCain against him is part of a multipronged strategy to offset what the Bush campaign assumes will be a sharp swing in the polls for Mr. Kerry. That, Mr. Bush's aides say, will come once Mr. Kerry announces a running mate, which could come as early as Tuesday morning, and presumably accepts the Democratic nomination in Boston at the end of this month. 
 Matthew Dowd, Mr. Bush's chief campaign strategist, said he expected the race to shift from dead even now to as much as a 15-point advantage in national polls for Mr. Kerry by the end of the Democratic convention.
 Though campaigns typically seek to set expectations as low as possible and Mr. Kerry's aides have said they do not expect any such lead, Mr. Dowd's public forecasts have tended to be relatively accurate. He said his prediction was based on the average upward bounce in the polls for challengers against incumbents over the last three decades at this stage in the race.
 ''We could easily be 14 or 15 points behind in the first week of August,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''How long that lasts and what happens after our convention, well, we'll have to wait and see.''
 To counter any surge by Mr. Kerry, Republicans who discuss campaign strategy with the White House said they expected Mr. Bush to begin a heavy wave of critical advertising against Mr. Kerry and his running mate come August. 
 ''The goal will be to limit Kerry's bounce,'' said one prominent Republican who has been briefed by the White House. ''They do that by softening him up before he goes in and being ready afterward with a barrage of newly minted criticism that Kerry lacks what it takes to be president in an era of change and challenges to national security.''
 Faced with a monthlong gap between the end of the Democratic convention and the start of the Republican convention in New York, Mr. Bush is also likely to minimize the amount of time he spends on vacation at his ranch in Texas during that period and instead keep to a heavy schedule of campaigning, they said.
 Once the Republicans convene at the end of August and Mr. Bush can again command the national stage after vacations and the Olympics have vied for the attention of voters, the White House hopes to have the president campaign more on a positive, forward-looking agenda focused on the improving economy, a show of how college can be made more affordable and other domestic issues, these Republicans said. 
 Crucial to that plan will be the situation in Iraq. Republicans inside and outside the campaign said the transfer of sovereignty to an interim government of Iraqis and Saddam Hussein's first appearance in an Iraqi court provided compelling evidence that Mr. Bush's strategy there was paying off. Improvement in conditions there, they said, could neutralize or turn to Mr. Bush's political advantage an issue that only weeks ago was eating away at his support.
 ''The sight of Saddam Hussein in a courtroom is good -- it reminds people of probably when they felt best about where this was going,'' said Thomas Rath, a Republican Party official in New Hampshire who is close to the White House. ''It puts a different face on the conflict, a better rationale for it.'' 
 Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said seeing Mr. Hussein in the dock would be ''especially powerful with women voters who have softened because of the war'' but might swing back to Mr. Bush if they came to believe that Iraq was about making the United States safer from terrorism.
 But the Bush campaign's first order of business this month will be countering any benefits Mr. Kerry gets from his vice-presidential choice. Republicans who have been briefed by the Bush campaign said the White House team had arguments prepared for all of Mr. Kerry's probable choices. The strategies include an attack on Senator John Edwards of North Carolina for his background as a trial lawyer and an effort to portray Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri as a tool of labor union bosses. Longer-shot possibilities like William S. Cohen, a defense secretary for President Bill Clinton, could be more difficult for the Bush campaign to criticize because he is a Republican and a friend of Mr. McCain. 
 Republicans appear ready to try to sting the new ticket from the start by showing images of Mr. Bush's recent appearances before troops in Reno, Nev., and at Fort Lewis, Wash., where Mr. Bush's filmmakers had a golden opportunity to capture images for a commercial: Mr. McCain praising Mr. Bush's ''moral clarity'' and ''firm resolve.'' Just weeks earlier, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, had been the subject of widespread reports that Mr. Kerry, a friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, had sounded him out about joining the ticket, reports that Mr. Kerry never publicly confirmed.
 Democratic officials said they were prepared for Mr. Bush to run a commercial featuring Mr. McCain alongside the president, perhaps even on the day Mr. Kerry announced his running mate. Mr. Bush's aides declined to address directly whether they would run advertising using the images. But they said they would work to highlight the fact that the person Mr. Kerry seemed most interested in having run with him would instead be campaigning for Mr. Bush.
 ''The most important decision Kerry will make as a candidate is who his V.P. will be,'' Mr. Dowd, the strategist, said. ''This is the biggest insight into who he is. One thing we know is that whoever they pick, it's their second choice.''
 Citing a report by ABC News last week that Mr. Kerry's camp had conducted polls to see how different running mates would play with voters, Ms. Devenish said the Bush campaign would also emphasize that even when it came to picking the person who could succeed him as president, Mr. Kerry was shaped not by conviction but by public opinion. Mr. Kerry's campaign has denied such polling.
 Mr. Kerry's aides say Mr. Bush will be able to make only so much of Mr. McCain's support, adding that Mr. McCain went out of his way to defend Mr. Kerry's national security credentials amid attacks by the Bush campaign during the spring.
 ''John McCain's been very forthright,'' Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Kerry, said Sunday on the ABC program ''This Week'' with George Stephanopoulos. ''He's discredited many of the attacks that the Bush campaign has made about John Kerry, particularly as it relates to national security and defense.'' 
 Stephanie Cutter, a Kerry campaign spokeswoman, predicted that the strategy to use Mr. McCain against Mr. Kerry would backfire, noting that while Mr. Kerry and Mr. McCain both served in Vietnam, which forms the basis of their bond, Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney never served in combat. Ms. Cutter also disputed Republican assertions that Mr. Bush was on newly solid ground after developments in Iraq last week.
 If the Republicans are comfortable with the president's job approval ratings and Mr. Kerry's close standing with the president in several polls, Ms. Cutter said, ''I've got a bridge to sell you.'' 
 Indeed, some Republicans who had been briefed about the Bush campaign's thinking said the White House was resigned to seeing Mr. Kerry benefit substantially from the next several weeks and would probably save much of its money for an advertising onslaught in August. Because presidential candidates are limited to $75 million in public matching money beginning the day they accept the nomination, Mr. Bush can continue to spend as much money throughout the summer as he can raise until the Republican convention at the end of August, while Mr. Kerry's spending will be constrained beginning with the nomination in late July. 
 ''They're plagued by having the early convention, so let them have their little day in the sun, let them spend a ton of money,'' one Republican who works with the Bush campaign said. 
 In August, this Republican added, the Bush campaign will ''do some big, wonderful stuff that takes the wind out of their sails.''
 Yet some Republicans, including some with ties to Mr. Bush, said in interviews that Mr. Bush was not doing enough to draw attention to the improving economy and claim credit for it, or to offer substantive proposals to make health care more affordable or to overhaul the tax code. 
 But while they do not rule out the possibility of Mr. Bush's making some splashy new proposals, Republicans who have been in touch with the White House about policy options said he was constrained by the budget deficit.

Allawi Signs New Law For Martial Power in Iraq
Prime Minister Iyad Allawi signed into law broad martial powers that allow him to impose curfews anywhere in the country, ban groups he considers seditious and order the detentions of people suspected of being security risks. It is one of the first official actions Mr. Allawi has taken against a tenacious insurgency and lays the groundwork for a forceful response to civil unrest. A1

Cpl. Wassef Ali Hassoun, a United States marine held captive in Iraq who was reported beheaded three days ago has been released, his family said. But they also said they had still not spoken with him directly. At least five people were killed when a suicide bomber drove into a funeral service near Baquba, about 50 miles north of Baghdad. A9

American officials seized about 1,000 sources of radioactivity and nearly two tons of low-enriched uranium from an Iraqi nuclear center, the Energy Department announced. The materials were not usable in a nuclear bomb, a spokesman said. A9

Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said the unconventional weapons cited as the justification for the war might never be found. It was the closest he has come to acknowledging that his central argument for the invasion last year may never be proved true or false. A8

The White House will nominate Francis J. Harvey, a defense industry engineer known for his business acumen, to be the new Secretary of the Army, Congressional officials said. The recommendation is a reflection of a desire to have stronger Army leadership in the midst of the prisoner-abuse scandal. A9

7 Killed in Mideast Clashes
The Israeli military shot dead six Palestinians, and an Israeli officer was also killed, during clashes in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The military acknowledged the deaths of ''two innocent Palestinians.'' A3

Relatives of Americans killed in terrorist attacks in Israel have sued Arab Bank, a leading bank in Jordan, asserting that the bank aided terrorism by paying life insurance to relatives of Palestinian suicide bombers. The civil complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, seeks $875 million in damages. A3

SCIENCE/HEALTH

Surprising H.I.V. Growth Rate
The proportion of the world's new H.I.V. infections occurring in Asia has risen sharply in the past two years as the epidemic has outstripped efforts to stop it, the United Nations said in a new report. One in four -- nearly 1.2 million -- of new infections in 2003 occurred in Asia, rising from one in five in 2001. A6

Avian Flu Returns to Asia
Thailand reported new outbreaks of avian influenza and China confirmed an outbreak of the virus -- signs of a return of a disease that experts fear could sicken humans. A6

Kerry Chooses Edwards For Vice Presidential Post
Senator John Kerry named John Edwards as his running mate, turning to the youthful North Carolina senator whose strong campaign skills, engaging personality and evident appeal across different regions of the country made him the top choice of many Democratic leaders. A1

President Bush's re-election campaign gave Mr. Edwards a different kind of introduction, defining him as an inexperienced, unaccomplished, liberal trial lawyer who was not even Mr. Kerry's first choice. A16

Air Force Pilot Found Guilty
A fighter pilot who mistakenly bombed and killed four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan two years ago was found guilty of dereliction of duty, issued a written reprimand and fined $5,672 in pay. A17

Health Officials Withheld Data
Medicare officials intentionally withheld data from Congress showing that Medicare drug benefits would probably cost more than the White House acknowledged, an internal investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services reported. A12

Diocese Files for Bankruptcy
The Archdiocese of Portland, Ore., filed for bankruptcy protection, becoming the first Roman Catholic diocese in the nation to seek such relief in response to claims by victims of sexually abusive priests. A12

Senate Confirms Bush Nominee
The Senate confirmed J. Leon Holmes to serve on a federal district court. The confirmation of Mr. Holmes, a Bush nominee who has argued that abortion is akin to the Holocaust and that the Bible requires women to be subservient to men, rekindled judicial nomination wars. A18

Panel Disputes Cheney Claim
The leaders of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks disputed Vice President Dick Cheney's suggestion that he probably had access to more intelligence than did the commission about possible ties between Al Qaeda and Iraq. A18

HEADLINE: Ex-General Is Expected to Face Tough Battle in Indonesia Runoff

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 6 

 BODY:
A former general, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who held a commanding lead in the first round of the Indonesian presidential elections, will face a tough fight in the runoff in September, political analysts said here on Tuesday.
 As counting after the Monday presidential voting progressed, the current president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and another former military man, General Wiranto, were in a tight race for second place.
 The difference between Mrs. Megawati and General Wiranto was ''too close to call,'' said Hank Valentino, the senior adviser to the Washington-based International Foundation for Election Systems. ''It will take several days to sort it out.'' 
 With just over a third of the votes counted, the national Election Commission reported that General Yudhoyono had 33.5 percent of the vote, with Mrs. Megawati at 26.7 percent and General Wiranto at 22.1 percent. Two other candidates were far behind.
 General Wiranto's advisers said they were optimistic that their candidate would prevail over Mrs. Megawati. Nasir Tamara, a senior adviser to General Wiranto, said, ''We believe it will be five days to one week before we get the results.'' General Wiranto's supporters were also preparing a legal challenge in case he finishes in third, his campaign advisers said.
 If General Yudhoyono had secured more than 50 percent of the votes, a runoff would not be necessary.
 The prospect of a runoff between two former military officers was the least appealing to the political reformers who worked for the constitutional amendment that called for direct presidential balloting after the fall of General Suharto in 1998.
 General Wiranto, who has been indicted by a United Nations-supported tribunal for crimes against humanity in East Timor, was the commander in chief at the end of the Suharto era. General Yudhoyono also served in senior positions in the Suharto military.
 But political reformers have been disappointed with the tenure of President Megawati, who failed to clamp down on the pervasive corruption that holds the country back from economic development.
 Mrs. Megawati and General Wiranto have substantial political machines behind them, and they would almost certainly be energized by the face-off in September, the analysts said. In contrast, General Yudhoyono has a new and fairly weak Democratic Party supporting him.
 ''Because the numbers of both Megawati and Wiranto were larger than predicted, and Yudhoyono's were less, it may mean the machines will make more of a difference than suspected,'' said Sidney Jones, the director of the Indonesian office of the International Crisis Group. She cautioned, however, ''Nothing is a sure thing in Indonesian politics.''
 In the closing days of the campaign, Mrs. Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle and the Golkar Party, which endorsed General Wiranto, succeeded in attracting numbers of undecided voters away from General Yudhoyono.
 General Yudhoyono, who emerged in the past few months from almost nowhere on the political landscape, built strong appeal on television appearances, voter surveys showed.
 But the vote counting shows he fared more poorly than expected, an indication, analysts said, of the strength of his opponents' political machinery and the relative weakness of his fledgling party.
 In a postelection appearance on Tuesday, General Yudhoyono, 54, who until a few months ago was the minister for security in Mrs. Megawati's cabinet, recognized some of his failings. 
 ''I have to conduct a more effective campaign, and communicate better with the camps who did not make it into the second round,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With a Fort's Death Toll Rising, Its Next-Door Neighbor Shares the Suffering

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: JUNCTION CITY, Kan. 

 BODY:
This town's central park, the front door to its brief downtown, looks more like a graveyard now.
 Thirty-eight white wooden crosses, knee-high, are planted between flowers and patches of grass, one for each soldier linked to Fort Riley who has died in Iraq. Some are pinned with farewell notes from a neighbor, a fellow soldier, a child; one cross is smudged with a red lipstick kiss.
 Junction City, the town, and Fort Riley, the Army base that sits beside it in northeast Kansas, are bound together so tightly that people here, as Mayor Mick Wunder says, often forget where one lets go and the other picks up. ''Like a love affair between the two,'' Mayor Wunder says. 
 A soldier at the base, Staff Sgt. Dwight Thompson, puts it less tenderly: ''Without us, Junction City would dry up and blow away.'' 
 As America's longest, deadliest sustained conflict since Vietnam has rolled on, Junction City and the other small towns tethered to military bases across the nation have felt the effects of war in a way most places cannot. While violence has escalated in Iraq through days of uncertainty, the mood here is edgy and watchful, and word of each soldier's death is met with an unspoken plea: let this one not be from Fort Riley.
 With more than 8,000 of the post's 11,000 soldiers deployed for some stretch since March 2003, some of Junction City's businesses say they have struggled to stay afloat, despite more upbeat assessments from city hall.
 ''A lot of the problem this year has been not knowing what's about to come next with this whole thing,'' Bob Cervera said as he looked out from the Radio Shack he has run for 20 years along Washington Street, the city's subdued strip of car dealerships, bars, a pawn shop, a comic book shop and a military uniform store. ''Will they be back soon? Will they not? Who will go next? No one knows.''
 But if war has brought an empty, funereal edge to Junction City's old limestone downtown, it has also
 brought something unexpected: dreams of a bigger future. Over a century and a half, this town of 18,886 has swelled and shrunk with the rhythms of the Army. Now, as the work of soldiers suddenly seems more critical than ever, business owners and city leaders here have quietly begun predicting that calls for a bigger Army might ultimately mean more soldiers at Fort Riley -- and with them, more prospects for this little town next door.
 Five new housing subdivisions are under construction, Mayor Wunder says, as is a hotel and convention center. 
 ''You get the sense that somebody knows something,'' Mr. Cervera said. ''With the Army, of course, you never really know anything until it happens. But people around here are pretty optimistic -- or maybe just really hopeful.''
 Some 130 miles west of Kansas City in the Flint Hills, Junction City grew up beside Fort Riley. The fort appeared in the early 1850's, a protection for travelers on the Oregon and Santa Fe Trails, and the town soon cropped up nearby, at the junction of the Republican River and the Smoky Hill River. 
 The base, which stretches over more than 100,000 acres, has always left its imprint on this working-class city, providing the bulk of its jobs and a reason for being. When the base was bigger, the city was too, and department stores like J.C. Penney and Montgomery Ward, now gone, thrived. When the base was home to the African American 9th and 10th Cavalry, the Buffalo Soldiers, Junction City grew diverse, particularly for a small Kansas town. Different wars, too, brought home wives of different nationalities: German, Korean, Vietnamese. Today, only 56 percent of the city's residents are white.
 Some soldiers live in Junction City. Their children go to high school here. Many retire here. 
 So, 15 months after war began, people proudly proclaim their support in banners and bunting, but some admit they are worn down a little, from baking tens of thousands of cookies for departing soldiers and from attending scores of deployment ceremonies, coming-home parties, memorial services and, now, redeployment ceremonies to send some soldiers back to Iraq. Even some of the city's fleet of American flags, left up all year in honor of the troops, have begun to fray.
 The intense relationship between the base and the city is also showing the strain. The line between catering to soldiers and exploiting them sometimes turns murky. Most shops in town posted a yellow sign from the Junction City Business Association: ''Welcome Home Troops.'' Some people saw it as a warm token of support, Mr. Cervera said, while others viewed it as a crass sales pitch.

'Junk Town' No Longer?
 To hear Mayor Wunder tell it, the war in Iraq has not threatened Junction City as much as some earlier conflicts had. 
 The city's sales tax revenue is up from a year ago, he said. This time around, encouraged to do so by the Army, more families of soldiers stayed in Junction City, instead of moving back to live with extended families far away. And this time, he said, more reservists and National Guard troops were called to serve. That has created hardship for some of them and their families, but benefited Junction City, because reservists and Guard members from around the Midwest have trained at Fort Riley on their way to Iraq. And that has meant many full nights in Junction City's roadside motels. 
 Mayor Wunder, 47, says the city has come a long way from his days growing up here, when the draft was on, gang and drug crime was rising and the nickname Junk Town somehow stuck. Junction City, he said, has become more than just an Army community, pointing out the town's meat processing plant and a plastics company soon to arrive from Northern Ireland. 
 ''In the past year, there have been peaks and valleys,'' said Mr. Wunder, whose full-time job is selling advertisements for the local radio station. ''But Junction is on an uphill climb, and I think we're going to get to the top.'' 
 Some local business owners tell a different story. 
 Surveying case after case of pawned DVD players, knives, guns and diamond engagement rings -- but no buyers in sight -- Jeff Lueker, the president of Jack & Dick's Jewelry and Loan, says he has been searching for ways to survive in a mostly empty town. He said he was considering adding new services to lure those who remain: check cashing or payday loans or perhaps phone services for those with bad credit.
 ''This is the worst it's been in 48 years in business,'' Mr. Lueker said of the enterprise founded by his wife's relatives shown in the grainy photo on the wall behind him: Jack and Dick. Mr. Lueker said he had cut his staff to one clerk from three and a half. Still, some days there are not enough sales to cover his basic overhead, which he puts at $1,500 a day. ''We'll survive,'' he said, ''but we sure could use some more troops.''
 Thomas Goudey, a Vietnam veteran who owns Tom's Mens Wear, wandered through vacant aisles of gentlemen's hats, alligator shoes and flashy suits on a recent morning. ''Been awfully quiet,'' Mr. Goudey said. 
 And Coach's, a sports bar, has had to cut cooks, said Adam Wilkey, a co-owner, as the lunch crowd has dipped dangerously low, to 50 some days from 250. The big uncertainty is what lies ahead -- more homecomings or more departures, or both, Mr. Wilkey said. ''It's hard to have any plans.''
 People point to shops that have closed, like Irma's Pets and Betty's Coffee House, and debate whether war or something else led to their demise. Special offers, meanwhile, are everywhere: free appetizers; half-price computer repairs for soldiers' wives desperate to get e-mail from Iraq; an $800 gift certificate contest for anyone who collects signatures from 24 Junction City businesses.

An Uncertain Future
 But the businesses of Junction City have been through lulls before. During Vietnam, nearly everyone left the post. During Desert Storm, many left, but came home sooner. And in 1996, the Army announced that the First Infantry Division, the Big Red One, would move its divisional headquarters to Germany, taking some 6,000 troops with it. 
 That was a giant blow, and fodder for the debate that rages year after year in Junction City: Could Fort Riley someday close entirely? And what would then become of Junction City?
 In 2005, the federal authorities are scheduled to conduct a new round of ''base realignment and closure,'' a move intended to eliminate excesses from the military and one that has fueled speculation, fretting and lobbying here.
 In a tiny office in the basement of Junction City's municipal building, Kenneth L. Burgoon, a retired colonel who is the city's official liaison with the fort, was staring at the calendar before him. 
 Several times a day Mr. Burgoon, talks to people at the post. He attends every ceremony, including enlistments, deployments and homecomings. He sends word to the mayor, the City Council and local business leaders to be sure Junction City shows up, too, even for the last-minute homecomings that often come in the middle of the night.
 ''I'm always there,'' Mr. Burgoon said. ''And the others go whenever they can, but I won't say they aren't getting worn down.''
 He is among many here who think Fort Riley may actually grow in these times. As the war has continued, as some political leaders have pressed for a bigger Army, and as administration officials have called for a temporary increase of 30,000 troops in the Army's overall size, hope has spread.
 John G. Montgomery, the longtime publisher of the local newspaper, The Daily Union, circulation 6,000, grins at the prospect and admits his own ''cautious optimism.'' Where else, Mr. Montgomery said, would troops being reassigned from Europe to the United States go? Where else, he said, would an expanded Army go?
 But nothing is official, as Sam Robinson, a spokeswoman at Fort Riley, notes. ''Right now, it's like an urban legend,'' Ms. Robinson said.

A Fresh Commitment
 Back in the city park, a group of Fort Riley soldiers, home recently from Iraq, gathered on a blustery afternoon. Along with the new bed of white crosses, Heritage Park is full of tributes to generations of Fort Riley soldiers: a grand arch for the Civil War, a monument for Vietnam, a memorial for soldiers killed in Desert Storm. 
 Specialist Robert Bahr, 25, propped himself against the Vietnam memorial as a supervisor passed him a stack of re-enlistment papers. He scanned each one and signed. 
 Specialist Bahr said he had planned to leave active duty to become a firefighter after his six-year commitment. But he changed his mind at the last minute, he said. He said he feared that he might get called back into active duty anyway, as have some soldiers who finished their active duty obligations, and be sent back to Iraq with reservists he has never met. 
 ''If I have to go back, I'd rather go with the guys I know and trust,'' Specialist Bahr said. ''They know what they're doing.'' 
 Standing before the 38 crosses, the spot he chose for his re-enlistment ceremony, Specialist Bahr gave his oath to serve three more years. Two of his colleagues, Pfc. Jordan Betbeze and Specialist Demond Varnado, stood at stern attention, holding up the flag. When it was over, they teased him for staying in. ''You crazy?'' Private Betbeze said, laughing. 
 The orders are not official yet, but the men said they had heard that their unit, assigned to drive trucks, would return to Iraq soon. ''Someone has to do this,'' Specialist Bahr said as he left the park. No one lingered at the crosses.

HEADLINE: Bush Accuses Vietnam And China of Dumping Shrimp on U.S. Market

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6 

 BODY:
The Bush administration made a preliminary ruling on Tuesday that China and Vietnam were dumping shrimp in the United States at below market prices and proposed duties as high as 112 percent.
 In the broadest trade complaint since the White House imposed tariffs on steel in 2002, the administration will issue its final decision in January. But the new duties will be levied at the end of the week and will probably lead to higher consumer prices in the long term, experts said.
 At the same time, the duties and wholesale price increases could help save jobs in the South, especially in major political battleground states like North Carolina, a trade-off that the administration seemed eager to make. 
 Shrimp from China and Vietnam has accounted for about 25 percent of the shrimp imported into the United States this year. But the case includes four other major exporters -- Brazil, Ecuador, India and Thailand. The six countries account for 75 percent of the shrimp imported into the United States, or $2.6 billion worth. Decisions on the other four countries will come later.
 With Asian nations investing heavily in fish and shrimp farms, the ruling could have a significant effect on the growing seafood industry and plans for using trade to improve these developing economies. Shrimp, the most popular seafood in the United States, is dominated by foreign imports, which account for 90 percent of the shrimp consumed in the United States.
 James J. Jochum, an assistant secretary of commerce, said in a telephone news conference that the ruling showed that the administration was ''very aggressive in enforcing trade laws.''
 With the United States' trade surplus growing with China and Chinese imports being cited for the loss of more and more domestic jobs, the administration is gearing up to defend its trade record in the presidential election. Earlier this year, the administration issued a preliminary finding that led to 198 percent duties on wooden bedroom furniture from China.
 The petitioners who filed the initial suit in the shrimp case last year argued that the lower-priced imports amounted to dumping and were driving down the price in the United States and undermining American producers.
 ''We're pleased, very pleased,'' said Bradford Ward, a partner at the law firm Dewey, Ballantine, who represents the Southern Shrimp Alliance. ''It's very important,'' he said, ''for coastal communities from Texas all around to North Carolina that the dumping ends and they can receive a fair price for their shrimp.''
 That will lead to higher prices for American consumers, said Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for International Economics.
 ''As a consumer I stand to lose on this because it's a simple issue of supply and demand,'' Mr. Schott said. 
 But the price increases will take some time to show up at chain restaurants or grocery stories, said Nao Matsukata, a former official at the office of the United States trade representative.
 ''In most cases,'' Mr. Matsukata said, ''these things are absorbed by the industry so you won't see an immediate increase in price.''
 The decision on the other four nations will be announced at the end of the month. They were considered separately because, with their Communist political systems, China and Vietnam are not considered official market economies.
 Thailand, the largest exporter to the United States, issued a statement earlier this year on behalf of the three other nations named in the suit warning that the domestic American shrimp industry would be unable to meet consumer demand.
 And in a repeat of the arguments during the steel tariff debate, the four countries argued that their shrimp imports had created 100,000 jobs in the United States.
 The preliminary investigation determined that Chinese and Vietnamese shrimp were selling at prices well below fair market value. The proposed duties vary widely, from as low as 7.6 percent to 112 percent for China and from 12.11 percent to 93.13 percent for Vietnam, depending on the difference between the fair-market price and the actual one.
 The decision covers frozen and canned warm water shrimp from China and Vietnam, most raised on farms rather than caught at sea.
 Fighting the duties were the Vietnamese and Chinese shrimp industry as well as a coalition of United States shrimp distributors, restaurants, grocers and food businesses.
 Matthew Nicely, a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher who represents the biggest Vietnamese shrimp companies, said the decision was unfair for the Vietnamese and would raise the price of shrimp for American consumers.
 ''The Vietnamese are not dumping; they are not selling below market price,'' he said in an interview.
 He argued that the Vietnamese were able to sell at prices far lower than American shrimpers because they had invested in modern technology for their shrimp farms and had lower labor costs.
 ''These shrimp-processing plants are an oasis in an otherwise economically depressed region,'' he said.
 Action Aid Vietnam, a nongovernment organization, issued a report last week warning that thousands of families in rural Vietnam would lose their livelihood and ''fall back into poverty'' if the Commerce Department imposed the tariffs. It added that the duties would lead to higher prices and less demand for Vietnamese shrimp.
 But officials at the Southern Shrimp Alliance, which initiated the complaint, argued that while the wholesale prices for shrimp have dropped 40 percent since 2000, the price for shrimp at restaurants has risen 18 percent, with the profit going to middlemen like shrimp distributors and chain restaurants.

HEADLINE: Europe Reluctantly Deciding It Has Less Time for Time Off

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 6 

 BODY:
For Michael Stahl, a technician at a cordless telephone factory in the town of Bocholt, summer is usually a carefree season of long evenings in his garden and even longer vacations. His toughest choice is where to take his wife and three children on their annual camping trip: Italy and Croatia are on this year's itinerary.
 Two weeks ago, however, Mr. Stahl got a rude jolt, when his union signed a contract with his employer, Siemens, to extend the workweek at the Bocholt plant to 40 hours from 35. Weekly pay remains the same. The new contract also scraps the annual bonuses every employee receives to help pay for vacations and Christmas expenses.
 ''I'll have to make do with less,'' Mr. Stahl said with a sigh. ''Of course, the family will come off the worst.'' 
 After nearly 27 years at Siemens, Mr. Stahl, 42, feels he has no choice but to put in the extra time. Like millions of his fellow citizens, he is struggling to accept the stark new reality of life in a global economy: Germans are having to work longer hours.
 And not just Germans. The French, who in 2000 trimmed their workweek to 35 hours in hopes of generating more jobs, are now talking about lengthening it again, worried that the shorter hours are hurting the economy. In Britain, more than a fifth of the labor force, according to a 2002 study, works longer than the European Union's mandated limit of 48 hours a week.
 Europe's long siesta, it seems, has finally reached its limit -- a victim of chronic economic stagnation, deteriorating public finances and competition from low-wage countries in the enlarged European Union and in Asia. Most important, many Europeans now believe that shorter hours, once seen as a way of spreading work among more people, have done little to ease unemployment. 
 ''We have created a leisure society, while the Americans have created a work society,'' said Klaus F. Zimmermann, the president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. ''But our model does not work anymore. We are in the process of rethinking it.''
 From the 1970's until recently, Europe followed a philosophy of less is more when it came to labor, with the result that Europeans work an average of 10 percent fewer hours a year than Americans. Germans, with the lightest schedule, work about 18 percent fewer hours.
 The job creation argument went hand in hand with the greater social premium that Europeans place on leisure. In the land of the four o'clock rush hour and the monthlong summer holiday, it does really seem, as the cliche goes, that Europeans work to live, while Americans live to work.
 Siemens, however, upset that conventional wisdom by threatening to move production of cordless and cellular phones to Hungary, where salaries are a fraction of those in Germany. That would have cost about 2,000 jobs in a country that, with a jobless rate of 10.3 percent, can ill afford it.
 ''It's about lowering labor costs,'' said Peter Gottal, a spokesman for Siemens, which is based in Munich. ''Where we are in a global competition, 35 hours are no longer feasible. We just need more hours.''
 Siemens and its union say that the contract is not a template for the rest of German industry, but it is being viewed that way. The company, one of Germany's largest employers, is negotiating wages at five other factories, and it may demand some of the same concessions, including different work hours, that it received at Bocholt.
 A longer workweek also looms for assembly line workers at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, in southwestern Germany. There, the company wants to curtail breaks during the workday.
 Mercedes has not threatened to abandon Germany. But auto workers shivered recently when Opel, which is owned by General Motors, announced that it would assemble a compact minivan at its plant in Gliwice, Poland, passing over its main factory outside Frankfurt, which had bid for the job.
 ''The firms are in a good position in these negotiations,'' said Eugen Spitznagel, a researcher at the Institute of Employment Research in Nuremberg. ''The unions recognize that the economic climate is bad.''
 A small majority of the German public also think that a long workweek may help preserve their jobs, according to a recent survey conducted for the business magazine WirtschaftsWoche.
 Even in Germany's public sector, the work is piling up. The state of Bavaria has extended the workweek to 42 hours from 40. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder wants to extend federal work hours to 40 from 38.5. And Deutsche Bahn, the state railway system, is demanding up to six more hours a week from its engineers and conductors.
 Flagging tax receipts and large budget deficits are the main cause of the state's newfound push for hours. In France, however, the government is making a broader case that the 35-hour week, which applies to public- and private-sector jobs, is throttling the country's growth.
 ''I've never been convinced of the positive effect of a 35-hour week,'' President Jacques Chirac declared recently. ''I feel it's been a brake on economic development and therefore a brake on overall employment.''
 Mr. Chirac is feeling pressure from his fiery finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has called for French employees to have the right to work more than 35 hours, if it fattens their paychecks.
 Mr. Sarkozy's free-market appeal, though hardly popular with French labor unions, suggests there may be a rebalancing in the basic trade-off Europeans have made between work and leisure.
 Since the 1970's, Europeans have been willing to accept somewhat slower growth in wages as a price for fewer work hours and longer vacations. The French have an average of 25 vacation days a year, while the Germans get 30 days. The average in Japan is 18 days and in the United States, 12 days.
 For a long time, the price for this was not very high, since Europe had high gains in labor productivity, which contributed to booming exports, briskly growing economies and steady wage growth.
 Nearly all of these trends turned negative in the 1990's, as productivity growth rates collapsed, especially in comparison with the United States. For a decade, Europe has been stuck in a period of chronic slow growth.
 ''We're seeing a change because the trade-off has changed,'' said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''Europeans are seeing that when times are lean, total incomes don't rise at all. So they are saying, 'Perhaps we better work longer hours.'''
 Mr. Gros disputes the notion that long hours are a panacea for Europe's enervated economies. He says the productivity of workers tends to decline as the number of hours increases. The answer, he says, is for European companies to invest more in workplace training and technology.
 To be sure, Europe's dogged pursuit of free time goes on. Sweden is undertaking a two-year study of the social effects of a 30-hour workweek -- proving that Thorstein Veblen and his theories about the leisure class still exert a bigger pull on the European imagination than Adam Smith does.
 The German government has denied a recent report that it plans to scrap a public holiday on Oct. 3 that celebrates the reunification of East and West Germany. The other 13 paid holidays also seem safe, since most are religious feasts, and the church here retains considerable political power.
 Nor have Europe's longer vacations come under the knife yet. The average number of vacation days in western Germany rose to 30 in the mid-1990's from 28 in 1985 and 20 in 1970, and has remained stable since.
 The new Siemens contract, however, is pioneering in another way: it replaces the extra payments for vacations and Christmas with a performance bonus, based on the profits of the portable phone division. The payments, once meant to enhance leisure, are now intended to fuel the work.
 Mr. Stahl said he would miss the extra money at Christmas, when he would use it to buy gifts and household goods, like a new TV set. The loss of the vacation money next summer will probably keep his family closer to home, perhaps in the nearby Netherlands, rather than in Croatia.
 Moreover, Mr. Stahl, who began as a toolmaker's apprentice as a teenager and is now a worker representative in his factory, is skeptical that the performance bonus will ever translate into good money. Siemens, he says, has not done enough to build its brand name overseas as a maker of portable phones, which has limited its profits.
 ''Shareholders, unfortunately, care only about profits,'' he said.
 Still, Mr. Stahl said he expected that few of his co-workers would walk away from the new contract. Siemens pays well, and jobs like those in the Bocholt plant are difficult to find in today's Germany, he says.
 That attitude is even more pronounced in eastern Germany, where auto workers refused to rally behind the once powerful metalworkers' union, IG Metall, when it called a strike in June 2003 to try to force about a dozen car factories to shorten the workweek to 35 hours from 38 hours, to bring it into line with western Germany.
 IG Metall was forced to abandon the strike, dealing the union and the entire German labor movement a blow from which it has not recovered. The message from the workers was: We will work more, if the alternative is watching our jobs move across the border to Hungary or Poland.
 Mr. Stahl reluctantly accepts that view as well, suggesting that the pressure of economic competition is being felt even in Europe's most comfortable quarters.

HEADLINE: Will the Draft Make a Comeback?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Military Draft? Official Denials Leave Skeptics'' (front page, July 3):
 Until the American invasion of Iraq, I agreed with those in Congress who saw no need to reinstitute the draft. Now that pre-emptive war appears to be part of our foreign policy, North Korea and Iran could certainly force our hand if their leadership adopts a more aggressive policy.
 If the United States economy recovers steadily without a corresponding increase in jobs, a draft would be a partial remedy, however unpleasant.
 A third scenario that could force our leaders to favor a draft would be another terrorist strike here at home. Homeland security would require immediate attention.

HEADLINE: Growth Slows in Services; Hiring Data Is Mixed

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Growth in the services sector slowed in June but remained strong, while jobs figures suggested that Americans were still having trouble finding work, reports released yesterday showed.
 The Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing data showed new orders and employment components gaining ground. But the overall index fell to 59.9 in June from 65.2 in May. Economists had forecast a reading of 63.0. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. 
 Some economists viewed the report as more evidence that growth, while still solid, is ebbing.
 The figures ''did decelerate to a still strong pace,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Banc of America Securities, ''but in line with last week's deceleration in jobs, car sales and consumption in general, so I have to believe that maybe it may be reflective of some moderation in the economy.''
 Services -- which includes workers in a range of industries including restaurants, hotels, banks and airlines -- account for a majority of the economy.
 New orders, an indicator of growth, edged up to 62.4 from 61.3. And more companies said that they intended to hire workers, with the institute's employment index rising to 57.4 in June from 56.3 in May. 
 But a separate report showed that while the number of planned layoffs fell in June, the level of planned hiring also declined.
 The placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said planned layoffs in the United States fell to 64,343 in June from 73,368 the month before. Hiring, though, fell to 38,377 workers, down sharply from 55,307 in May.
 ''The decline in June job cuts is good news,'' John Challenger, the chief executive, said, ''but it would not be surprising to see a rise in monthly job-cut announcements during the second half of the year.''
 On Friday, the Labor Department reported June growth of 112,000 jobs, less than half what economists had forecast. And job gains in April and May were revised lower.
 Like the services data, recent figures on consumption have shown signs of a slowdown. That has prompted many economists to revise down their growth forecasts for the second quarter to around 3.5 percent from earlier estimates of 4 percent to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Thomas Klestil, 71, Austrian Who Redeemed the Presidency

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: VIENNA, July 6 

 BODY:
President Thomas Klestil, who brought calm to an office frayed by controversy surrounding his predecessor's past in World War II, died Tuesday. He was 71.
 Mr. Klestil, whose second six-year term was to end Thursday, died shortly before midnight from multiple organ failure, officials at Vienna's General Hospital said. He had been taken to the hospital by air on Monday after suffering heart failure. 
 Heinz Fischer, who won in an election earlier this year, takes over the presidency on Thursday. Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel assumed the presidential duties when Mr. Klestil fell ill.
 Earlier in the day, Dr. Christoph Zielinski said the president's liver, lungs, kidneys and central nervous system had been damaged by the cardiac problem. When he was admitted, doctors said they could not rule out brain damage as a possible result of lack of oxygen before hospital staff members got his heart functioning again.
 The hospital's director, Reinhard Krepler, said Mr. Klestil was surrounded by his family when he died.
 Mr. Klestil was widely credited with restoring Austria's credibility after disclosures that his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim, served in Germany's Nazi military.
 Mr. Klestil distinguished himself by speaking out numerous times against Austria's Nazi complicity in World War II, expressing sympathy for Holocaust victims during a first-term visit to Israel.
 And though Austria's presidency is a largely ceremonial post, he strengthened the country's ties with emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and, in 1993, began convening a yearly meeting of the heads of state of Central European countries.
 But he later found himself roiled in political turmoil as he feuded with the right-wing Freedom Party, which gained popularity with its anti-immigrant, populist language. 
 Though nominated for the presidency by Austria's conservative People's Party, Mr. Klestil later clashed with its leader, Mr. Schussel, and was abandoned by the party. Political differences between the two included Mr. Klestil's opposition to letting the Freedom Party join the party in forming a coalition government in 2000. Mr. Klestil backed off. But photos of a stone-faced Mr. Klestil swearing in members of the Freedom Party to government posts spoke volumes about his opposition to letting those linked to anti-foreigner and past anti-Jewish sentiment share government responsibility.
 Critics occasionally accused Mr. Klestil of overstepping the ceremonial bounds of his office. But he proved an efficient president, and in 1995, during his first term, Austria joined the European Union.
 When the European Union punished Austria for allowing the Freedom Party to join the government, he put his diplomatic skills to work and lobbied heads of states to lift sanctions seven months after they were slapped on the nation.
 Born in Vienna, Mr. Klestil studied economics and business before earning a doctorate in 1957. In 1969, he established the Austrian General Consulate in Los Angeles, where he befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian bodybuilder who went on to become a movie star and is now the governor of California.
 In 1978, he was appointed Austria's ambassador to the United Nations. Four years later, he became his country's ambassador to the United States.
 He was elected president in 1992, succeeding Mr. Waldheim, the former secretary general of the United Nations, who was widely despised after revelations that he had concealed details about his service in the German Army during World War II.
 Mr. Klestil was re-elected but was barred by the Constitution from running for a third term.
 He is survived by his wife, and a daughter and two sons from a previous marriage.

HEADLINE: A Search for Pearls of Wisdom in the Matter of Swine

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., July 2 

 BODY:
The taut concentration on the face of C.M. Williams as he sifts through charts in his office at North Carolina State University makes it clear that he is acutely aware of the environmental and economic conundrum posed by the state's 10 million pigs. 
 In about two weeks, Dr. Williams, the director of the university's animal and poultry waste management center, is to present the first overall results of a four-year comprehensive study of 16 options for phasing out North Carolina's system for treating the tons of waste produced by its swine. 
 Two years after the original deadline, he must produce thousands of technical pages that could reshape one of his state's major industries. 
 The hope, soon to be tested, is that this report will provide a tool kit for farmers to reduce or eliminate the pollution caused by one of rural America's most noxious industrial archipelagos -- the farms in eastern North Carolina where hogs live, eat, defecate and are prepared for a honey-baked future in closely confined quarters. The hogs belong mostly to out-of-state companies; their waste belongs to the farmers who contracted to raise them. They go; the waste stays, to be digested gradually by bacteria in open-air lagoons. The system has repeatedly failed, occasionally fouling the water and infuriating people downwind. 
 Now North Carolina has become the laboratory for what is technically, economically and politically possible in regulating such farms. More and more, states are taking the lead in seeking solutions to environmental problems -- hogs in North Carolina, heat-trapping gases in New Jersey -- while the Environmental Protection Agency or other federal regulators debate the problems' scope.
 J. Randolph Carpenter, executive director of the North Carolina Pork Council, said the work of Dr. Williams was being watched as an important component of what the industry would look like in the future. ''Many eyes are focused on Mike Williams in terms of new technologies which we may -- and I emphasize may -- be looking at,'' Mr. Carpenter said.
 Mr. Carpenter is not ready to concede that anything could improve the current system of treating wastes. But he welcomes the attention Dr. Williams's work has brought North Carolina, the country's largest pork producer after Iowa. ''You don't have at the federal level a place where new technologies are getting as much scrutiny and as much advanced scientific research as they are in our state,'' he said.
 Barclay Rogers, a Sierra Club expert on concentrated feeding operations, had a slightly different perspective. ''It's an interesting trend,'' Mr. Rogers said, ''the forerunner perhaps of more stringent state regulations as the feds back away.'' 
 Alternative treatment prototypes are gearing up in Utah and Missouri, though neither effort matches North Carolina's range of technologies, said Joseph Rudek, a senior scientist with the advocacy group Environmental Defense. 
 In North Carolina, Mr. Rudek said, an agreement between pork producers and the state attorney general in 2000 mandated that the Williams report set the tone. ''It said: We've done talking about what the problems are. Now we are going to talk about solutions,'' he said. The report, he said, could be a building block for state or federal regulation.
 As the person assigned to assemble a tool kit, or proto-regulation, to help end what has been one of the most politically divisive debates in recent state history, Dr. Williams has been lobbied, flattered, criticized and deluged with information. 
 He believes that his report will be a road map for an industry conversion (''cleanup'' is a loaded term here), but he cannot be sure it will be used. ''Simply put,'' Dr. Williams said, ''within this state, and I think this will apply to other states and provinces, there will be a decision that all people will have to make: Do we continue with the past system or proceed with a new system?''
 Knowing that innovation can be expensive and that North Carolina would suffer if hogs, like tobacco and textiles, left town, he added, ''If we do proceed with a new system, there have to be reasonable incentives.'' 
 The past system's failings have been minutely chronicled. During the 1990's the number of hogs being grown for slaughter at any given time went from perhaps three million to more than nine million. The animals are concentrated in east-central North Carolina, where the ground is flat and the water table high. They are warehoused in barns with slatted floors, with 880 to 1,220 to a barn. 
 Water flushes their wastes into lagoons, where anaerobic bacteria break down pollutants biologically. Then the mixture, rich in phosphorus and nitrogen, the ingredients of fertilizer, is sprayed on the fields.
 But not all lagoons are well made; sometimes excess nutrients have flooded into neighboring rivers, causing at least one massive fish kill. The odors, which cling to clothes and hair, are fetid and overwhelming. In 1997, after a proposal for a farm near golf courses in a powerful assemblyman's home district, the assemblyman pushed through a legislative moratorium on new hog farms.
 After September 1999, when Hurricane Floyd swirled hog waste into waters throughout the eastern part of the state, pressure to solve the problems grew intense. The state attorney general, Michael F. Easley, now governor, brokered an agreement with Smithfield Farms, which controlled more than two-thirds of the hogs in the state. A second major hog producer, Premium Standard Farms, joined the agreement. 
 Together they agreed to contribute about $18 million ''to develop and implement environmentally superior technologies'' to eliminate the discharge of animal waste to surface water or groundwater and ''substantially eliminate'' atmospheric emissions of ammonia, odor and airborne pathogens and contamination of the soil by nutrients and heavy metals. 
 Academic experts, led by Dr. Williams, a native North Carolinian who grew up on a tobacco farm, were given the job of choosing technologies for evaluation, judging their technical merits and figuring their costs.
 Four years later, two years past the original deadline, Dr. Williams has enough results from his expert panels to predict that at least one of the trial technologies, perhaps several, will pass technical muster. 
 The early technical front-runner involves culling solids from the water flushed out of the barn with advanced chemical techniques and bacterially treating the remaining effluent, removing the majority of pollutants. The technique, which eliminates the lagoons, costs four to five times as much as the lagoon-and-spray practice and twice as much as its nearest competitor, Dr. Williams said. At that price, he said, mandating a technology as promising as the early leader ''would run the industry out of the state.'' A lower-cost version is now being tried. 
 Smithfield executives are not ready to give up lagoons and spray fields. Dennis Treacy, vice president for environmental, community and government affairs there, said in an e-mail response to questions: ''It is a common misunderstanding that new technologies will eliminate the use of lagoons and spray fields. In fact, the majority of the alternative technologies under consideration will continue to use lagoons and/or spray fields as a component of the overall treatment technology.'' 
 And the E.P.A? Dr. Viney P. Aneja, a professor of air quality at North Carolina State and an expert on air pollution from factory farms, says it ''has stayed on the sideline.'' 
 Sally Shaver, an air quality official for E.P.A. based in Raleigh, sees nothing wrong with the division of labor. Ms. Shaver defended the agency's gradual approach: last year, it put out a rule on water pollution at the farms and is completing a consent decree with the industry that would require monitoring air quality at concentrated swine, poultry and dairy operations. Given the concentration of hog farms, North Carolina's lead role makes sense, she said.

HEADLINE: Kerry's Blue-Collar Bet

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards is America's best natural politician since Bill Clinton, and he'll help with the Democrats' most crucial task: reconnecting the party to Middle American voters.
 When Republicans charge that Democrats are out of touch with the ''real America,'' they actually have a point. Democrats poll well on issues like the economy, but Republicans triumph on values -- and for wavering Missourians, values trump issues.
 Thomas Frank has written a fascinating new book about this distinction, ''What's the Matter With Kansas.'' His point is that working-class Americans have a strong economic interest in electing Democrats, but that cultural issues often drive them to vote Republican. 
 ''If you earn over $300,000 a year, you owe a great deal to this derangement,'' Mr. Frank writes. ''Raise a glass sometime to those indigent High Plains Republicans as you contemplate your good fortune: It is thanks to their self-denying votes that you are no longer burdened by the estate tax, or troublesome labor unions, or meddling bank regulators. . . . It is a working-class movement that has done incalculable, historic harm to working-class people.''
 While focused on Plains states like Kansas, Mr. Frank's analysis resonates with me because the situation is much the same in my rural hometown, Yamhill, Ore. Most Oregonians would benefit from Democratic health care and tax policies, but the national Democrats sometimes come across in Yamhill as the party of elitists who never go to church and know more about French grammar than about changing a tire.
 The oddity is that President Bush manages to come across as a real guy (a triumph of marketing), while John Kerry still has the whiff of an aloof Massachusetts liberal.
 This is where Mr. Edwards comes in. If you look at the Democratic ticket through the prism of places like Yamhill, Mr. Edwards, the son of a millworker and a postal worker, appears down-to-earth and trustworthy, a fellow who strikes a chord on values as well as issues. So the Democrats gain street credibility among blue-collar voters, and a leader who can help win back the Reagan Democrats.
 Exit polls in the primaries underscored that point. While Mr. Kerry won solidly among typical Democratic voters, Mr. Edwards had the edge among voters who described themselves as independents, as conservatives or as usually voting Republican. Young voters also disproportionately supported Mr. Edwards, perhaps because he looks as if he'll be carded if he walks into a bar.
 Is there a risk in choosing Mr. Edwards? Sure, Mr. Kerry might drop dead. Then we'd have a very inexperienced president -- again!
 Moreover, Mr. Edwards may continue to wave a protectionist cudgel at trade issues. That will win votes because manufacturing job losses are concentrated in swing states. But trade populism would mark a retreat from President Clinton's embrace of globalization. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards should remember that Mr. Clinton won the electorate without turning demagogic on trade.
 The most interesting tug of war will be over God. A Gallup poll last month found that 61 percent of Americans said that ''religion can answer all or most of today's problems,'' and millions of white churchgoing Protestants have fled the Democratic Party. On his own, Mr. Kerry, a Catholic, didn't have a prayer with those voters. With Mr. Edwards, a Methodist, tethering him to Middle America and beaming in a front pew each Sunday, the ticket is far stronger.
 Mr. Bush lost his first political battle, for Congress in 1978, when his opponent, Kent Hance, portrayed him as an overeducated elitist carpetbagger who didn't know Texas. Mr. Hance later told me that for Mr. Bush, the lesson was that ''he wasn't going to be out-Christianed or out-good-old-boyed again.''
 Just wait: Mr. Edwards has the same populist charm as Mr. Hance, and I'd bet that Mr. Bush is about to be out-good-old-boyed again.
 International attention is finally focusing on the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, but even with 10,000 people dying there each month, we haven't yet dared to call it genocide. To meet some of the people whose lives are at stake -- orphans, widows, rape victims -- see the slide show of my photos that I've put at the top of www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds. Look them in the eye and try to say this isn't genocide.

HEADLINE: What's Right and What's Left To Say on the Political Divide

REASON
Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America
By Robert B. Reich
257 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.

THE RIGHT NATION
Conservative Power in America
By John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge
Illustrated. 450 pages. Penguin. $25.95.
 God works in mysterious ways, and it seems fitting that a presidency given to apocalyptic predictions has witnessed the emergence of a literal plague of winged insects. What's next for the Bush administration -- sackcloth and ashes? To make matters worse, right behind the cicadas, a different kind of tree-eater is about to defoliate the landscape: the publishing industry, ready to release dozens of new political books explaining the choice we face this election year.
 Two books in particular are in position to jump out to an early lead, explaining each side of the gulf that separates the parties and, increasingly, the American people themselves, unwilling to speak past their profound political divisions. Robert B. Reich's ''Reason,'' the liberal offering, is more slender, perhaps because Democrats have had so little to brag about over the last three years.
 Mr. Reich is well known as the secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton and the author of many books on subjects ranging from the Clinton administration to what was once called the New Economy. His subject is liberalism, and he is poised to write knowledgeably on the subject, for he inhabits most of its stereotypes, including Cambridge and a double appointment at Brandeis and Berkeley. 
 Despite those qualifications -- reason enough for the red half of the country to ignore the book -- ''Reason'' is an appealing effort in many ways, modest in scope, engagingly written, earnest and hopeful. Mr. Reich worries about an America under attack from ''radcons'' (radical conservatives: the neologism is cribbed from Spiro T. Agnew's ''radiclibs''). 
 Mr. Reich explodes a number of fallacies on the left (that manufacturing jobs can be saved) and the right (that tax cuts and trickle-down economics reach poor people). Beyond his political acumen, he is a gifted moralist, and some of his best sections argue against the double standard of conservatives who voice exaggerated moral outrage over selective issues like gay marriage but never speak out on corporate corruption, insane C.E.O. salaries and the politics of personal destruction.
 One of the most pleasant things about ''Reason'' may also doom it to the remainder bin. Mr. Reich cares intensely about how a decent society conducts itself, how it integrates people through shared experiences and good jobs, how it provides for those who need help and how it engages in civilized debate. In other words, this book would be welcome indeed if it were, say, 1992. But in the noisy aftermath of 9/11 and Iraq, and the enraged polemics of Ann Coulter and Michael Moore, it is a bit of a time warp to hear these quieter debates (although, come to think of it, ''Building a Bridge to the 20th Century'' would not be the worst campaign slogan).
 All of Mr. Reich's recommendations, from reclaiming liberal patriotism to making the economy fairer, are eminently wise, but the cumulative effect is a bit like being urged by a high school guidance counselor to spend more time doing charity work. Instead of ''Reason,'' which the left already has too much of, the Democrats need a book titled ''Brass Knuckles.''
 ''The Right Nation'' is a very different project, and joins a growing bookshelf devoted to the conservative movement that has reshaped American politics over the last generation. John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge write for The Economist, the shrewdest foreign magazine examining America. (A disgruntled Southerner recoiled when these two Englishmen tried to interview him, thinking they worked for The Communist.) But like the Duke and Dauphin in ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' they are skilled at insinuating their way into the confidence of the locals, and the resulting study will go far to explain Americans to themselves. 
 The book is divided into four sections -- History, Anatomy, Prophecy and Exception -- that address the major pillars of the conservative worldview. With the first, the authors' British background comes as something of a bonus, for they have actually read the early conservative heroes that Americans like to cite (Burke, Disraeli) without looking too closely into the particulars. They pore over American arcana from the 1950's and 60's, and it is a revelation to see how different the political universe has become in a few short decades. They pay particular attention to the Bush dynasty, noting with wry detachment that George H. W. Bush was once known as Rubbers for his early support of family planning, and linking the family's reverse evolution with that of the nation as a whole. 
 Mr. Micklethwait and Mr. Wooldridge helpfully distinguish between the different kinds of conservatism that are joined through the Republican Party, but are not really the same as each other or the party. While they write from a historical perspective, they are reporters as well, and the story is enlivened by glimpses into places most Americans do not see: gated communities, conservative retirement homes, gun lobby office parks and educational institutions like Patrick Henry College, which teaches ''Christ and liberty'' to students from home-schooling backgrounds. The writing is consistently crisp and intelligent, the conclusions balanced.
 As with Mr. Reich, that may be as much a weakness as a strength. There are few indictments of a mindset that often contradicts itself (remember Newt Gingrich's solemn commitment to a balanced budget in the Contract With America?), or that often seems delusional to those who are not in its thrall. Mr. Micklethwait and Mr. Wooldridge sometimes hold up their evidence the way Darwin might examine a chinchilla, without too much emotional involvement of their own.
 Occasional Anglicisms also muddy the waters for readers on this side of the Atlantic. Yet these are minor points about a work of penetrating insight that should go far to help Americans see that their politics changed powerfully, perhaps irrevocably, over the last 40 years. 
 Which side now has the momentum? That is exceedingly hard to say, despite the certainty of both subtitles. Events are happening so quickly in Iraq that even the most opportunistic publishers have trouble keeping up. But until the next round of prognostication begins, ''Reason'' and ''The Right Nation'' will give readers much-needed perspective as we enter what promises to be a long, hot summer.

HEADLINE: U.S. Group Buys First Stake Of a Media Company in Brazil

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, July 7 

 BODY:
Grupo Abril, Brazil's largest publishing and printing company, said on Wednesday that it had agreed to sell a minority stake to the Capital Group for $50 million, the first such deal since the country's media law was revised two years ago to allow foreign investors to own up to 30 percent of Brazilian television, radio and print media businesses.
 In an interview, Abril's chairman and editor in chief, Roberto Civita, said the deal, which was signed Wednesday morning after a year of negotiations, should allow the company to resume growth after paying some of its roughly $300 million in debt. He said the deal also represented the first step in a restructuring that could culminate in an initial public stock offering, the first for a Brazilian media group.
 ''We needed to capitalize the company,'' said Mr. Civita, 67, who took over as the group's top executive in 1982. ''But the most important thing is that this is clearly the first big step in the direction of going public.'' 
 Under the terms of the deal, the Capital Group, based in Los Angeles, will acquire 13.8 percent of Abril through one of its investment management companies, Capital International. The Civita family would remain in control of Abril, including its editorial content.
 Jennifer Grigas, a spokeswoman for Capital International, which manages $294 billion in assets worldwide, declined comment.
 Abril, which had net revenue of 1.86 billion reais ($611 million) last year, is one of the largest and most influential media conglomerates in Latin America, publishing magazines, books, comic books, maps and travel guides. Seven of Brazil's 10 most popular magazines are published by the group, including the Brazilian edition of Playboy. Over all, Abril's publications sell almost 180 million copies a year and reach 26 million readers.
 The group's flagship publication, Veja, is the most widely read magazine in Brazil and one of the best-selling newsweeklies in the world, with a circulation of 1.12 million. The magazine was founded by Mr. Civita in 1968 just as Brazil's military dictatorship was stepping up censorship to silence its critics. The magazine managed to navigate the political perils to quickly became the country's most popular weekly.
 Like most media groups in Latin America, Abril has suffered in recent years, hit hard by an advertising slump and the vagaries of Brazil's economy, which shrank last year for the first time in more than a decade. The group is also seeking to lengthen the payment schedule on its debt, much of which was accumulated in the 1990's when the Brazilian currency was pegged to the dollar and which ballooned when the real was devalued in 1999. 
 There has been speculation for some time that Brazil's government-run development bank might bail out some of the country's struggling media companies, most of which are family-owned like Abril, which was founded by Mr. Civita's father in 1950. But the bank has so far been reluctant to do so because any financial help from the government could be construed as an attempt to buy favorable editorial coverage.
 Hoping to attract capital to the media sector, Brazil's Congress passed legislation in 2002 to allow corporations, not just individuals, and foreigners to own minority stakes in local media companies. But none entered until now, even though Brazil is Latin America's biggest market, partly because many of the families that control Brazil's media companies, while eager for a cash infusion, appear reluctant to surrender control or change the way they do business.
 That, analysts say, is one reason that large foreign media groups may steer clear of Brazil in the near term, letting financial investors like the Capital Group test the waters first.
 ''If you think in the logic of a private equity firm, you want to get in now,'' said one investment banker who is familiar with the deal but who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 ''And they're probably betting on two exits,'' he added. ''Either an I.P.O., meaning they want to work with the company to exit through an I.P.O. in say three, four years. Or the legal framework could change and they will be able to sell it later to another strategic partner that might be interested in Brazil.''
 Last year, Grupo Televisa of Mexico said it was considering buying a stake in Sistema Brasileiro de Televisao, Brazil's second-largest TV broadcaster, but a deal never materialized. Pearson, publisher of The Financial Times, was also briefly reported in late 2002 to be interested in investing in Gazeta Mercantil, a Brazilian business daily that is sinking in debt and mired in lawsuits with former employees over back pay.
 But lately, no strategic investors have been shopping around. 
 ''There has not been an invasion of Brazil as everyone expected,'' Mr. Civita said. ''In Congress they were saying, 'Ah, they're going to take over the media.' Well, we're still waiting. We haven't seen anyone.''
 Grupo Abril also owns the largest database marketing company in Brazil and recently raised its stake in MTV Brasil to 70 percent from 50 percent.
 Abril first branched into cable television in 1991, helping to create TVA, now Brazil's second-largest pay-TV service. Abril is seeking a strategic investor within the telecommunications sector that might be interested in using TVA's infrastructure to offer broadband Internet and data transmission services.

HEADLINE: Private Cash Dominating Conventions, Study Says

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and GLEN JUSTICE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
The host committees for the Republican and Democratic conventions this year will draw almost $104 million in private contributions, 12 times what they did a dozen years ago, according to a study released Wednesday.
 The report, compiled by the Campaign Finance Institute, argues that several decisions by the Federal Election Commission over the last decade have allowed private, unregulated money to dominate the financing of conventions.
 The study shows that the New York City Host Committee is collecting at least $64 million in unrestricted cash from private donors for the Republican National Convention, and that in 1992 the comparable figure was $2.2 million. 
 Boston 2004, the Democratic host committee, is collecting at least $39.5 million in such money from private donors for the Democratic National Convention, and in 1992 the comparable figure was $6.2 million, according to the report. 
 This huge infusion of unregulated cash suggests that donors are finding ways around the restrictions in the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, which was passed in 2002 and largely upheld by the Supreme Court last year, the report says. 
 That law banned political parties and candidates from collecting so-called soft money, the unrestricted donations from companies, labor unions and wealthy donors that had become a source of controversy during the 1990's.
 Many of the old soft-money donors to both parties are still here, said Steve Weissman, associate director for the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan group in Washington. ''This has become a political A.T.M. machine for the parties,'' he said. 
 The report attributes the increase of private, unregulated donations to changes that the Federal Election Commission made in 1994 and 2003 that loosened and eventually eliminated restrictions on who can make donations to such committees.
 Robert Biersack, an election commission spokesman, declined to comment on the report's findings.
 The report goes on to say that the commission allowed the host committees to veer away from their original purpose as booster organizations to promote business and civic participation in the host cities. 
 Once financed by local companies, labor unions and individuals, the conventions are now a magnet for major corporations and other large donors from across the nation capable of contributing millions, the report says.
 Officials representing the host committees in Boston and New York dismissed the contention that the committees had strayed from their original mission.
 Kevin Sheekey, president of the New York City committee, noted that the committees were barred from engaging in partisan activities because of their status as tax-exempt organizations.
 ''There is a clear civic purpose in what host committees do,'' Mr. Sheekey said. ''This convention is of great importance to New York City and is the anchor of our economic turnaround this summer.''
 After drawing information from various contracts the host committees signed with vendors, the report says the committees now spend much of their money to promote the political spectacle rather than the cities the conventions are held in.
 The report says, for example, that the New York committee is spending $33.8 million on designing and constructing the convention set, as well as on other production costs associated with the political convention itself.
 Mr. Weissman also noted that almost $10 million was set aside to pay for computer and telecommunication systems that he said were going to be operated by the Republican Party convention committee.
 ''The upsurging private contributions have been overwhelmingly devoted to financing convention expenses rather than to promote the host city,'' the report says.
 The report also makes it clear that the conventions remain one of the last avenues for corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to inject unlimited soft money contributions into the system. 
 The result is that private money has grown to represent about 61 cents of every dollar raised for the conventions this year, up from 14 cents in 1992, and the number of major contributors has grown substantially.

HEADLINE: New Face of Farming in Russia's Far East

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SERGEYEVKA, Russia 

 BODY:
Plastic sheets of a summer greenhouse rustled over endless rows of tomatoes and cabbages, growing from the thick black soil of Russia's Far East.
 ''There is too little land in China,'' Long Lihua, a suntanned, 48-year-old woman from Harbin, China, said, explaining in basic Russian why she comes here every spring to grow vegetables in a 50-50 sharecropping arrangement with a Russian landowner.
 With her engaging smile, her Chinese energy and her Russian nickname, Katya, Ms. Long is the new face of farming in Russia's vast lightly populated lands near the Chinese border.
 With Russian youths buying one-way bus tickets out of farm villages like this one, three out of every four people in the nation's Far East now live in a city. Abandoned collective farms litter the leafy rural landscape, which looks vaguely like a Slavic New England. 
 But now this rich, arable land is drawing a reverse migration. At last count here in Primorye, or the Maritime province, there were five South Korean commercial farms on leased land and 2,390 Chinese farm workers and sharecroppers.
 Russia is still a net food importer from China. But the trend is shifting fast.
 Last year, Russia's food exports to China, largely wheat from the Black Sea area, increased sevenfold, to 86,740 tons. During the first five months of this year, China imported, from all countries, 1.49 million tons of wheat, a ninefold increase over the first five months of last year. Even more dramatic, China's wheat supplies are shrinking, hitting about 30 million tons, a two-thirds drop from five years ago.
 According to a mid-June forecast by The Economist Intelligence Unit, China's wheat imports will grow steadily: from 2.5 million tons last year, to 7 million tons this year, to 10 million tons next year.
 With a young population and more money to spend, China's food consumption is expected to steadily expand. But, as its population moves to the cities and as some land turns into desert, China's cultivated land is shrinking by about 2 percent a year. In another blow to harvests, Chinese water tables are falling, as a more affluent, half urbanized population consumes more water.
 Across the border, the farm picture is brightening.
 A Russian land tenure law that went into effect last year allows foreigners to sign 49-year leases for farmland. Better crop varieties, better management and better fertilizers allowed Russia in 2001 to cross over from wheat importer to wheat exporter. During the twilight years of communism, the Soviet Union was buying as much as 18 percent of America's total wheat harvest. Today, Russia, with far cheaper production costs, is elbowing into traditional American markets. 
 This year, the United States Agriculture Department predicts that Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan will supply 11 percent of the world's internationally traded wheat. Over the next decade, Russia's wheat harvest could increase by as much as a third. As a sign of its coming of age as a world food power, Russia this week made its first donation of wheat to North Korea -- 35,000 tons from the Black Sea area. 
 On this end of Russia, at the same southerly latitudes as the Black Sea grain belt, the Chinese contribution is largely the manpower to revive domestic production of fruits and vegetables.
 ''The prices are good here, too low in China,'' Ms. Long said to explain why she trucks her cucumbers, cabbages and tomatoes one hour south to the seaport of Nakhodka, instead of driving four hours to the Chinese border.
 Ivan A. Aleschenko, director of the Maritime region's agricultural department, said in Vladivostok, ''They don't export produce to China due to high transportation costs and customs fees.''
 But some farms near the Chinese border are starting to export produce to China.
 For the moment, Chinese farmers are concentrated on the local domestic market, performing so successfully that some Russians accuse them of monopolizing the fruits and vegetable trade.
 ''All the wholesale markets are controlled by Chinese, there is no way for Russians to break in,'' complained Sergei I. Yurchenko, a 56-year-old Russian farmer who works 100 acres a few miles from Ms. Long's plastic wrapped greenhouses. 
 Although he considers Ms. Long a friend and introduced visitors to her, he announced at his farmhouse over bowls of freshly picked strawberries: ''I don't buy anything from the Chinese. I don't sell anything to the Chinese. The Chinese are trying to kill Russian farmers. They will sell their cabbages at a loss, at 50 kopecks, just to ruin the Russian.''
 Mr. Yurchenko, who said he sold his produce out of the back of his truck rather than deal with a Chinese middleman, added: ''Russian consumers want to buy from Russian producers. They will pay more for vegetables grown by Russians.''
 But around here, Russian farmers are a dwindling species. In Yastrebovka, his village of 10 houses, Mr. Yurchenko is the only farmer. Other residents are largely retirees, puttering around their vegetable gardens behind their dachas.
 ''The government produces lazy people, then lazy parents produce lazy children,'' fumed Mr. Yurchenko, noting the chronic difficulty of finding Russian farmhands.
 Indeed in this frontier area, where towns carry names like New Moscow and where Siberian tigers still roam, Russians have intermittently relied on Asians to do farm work ever since Russian settlement began in the 1850's. Today, ethnic Koreans are migrating back here from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, where they were sent into internal exile by Stalin just before World War II.
 ''Since there is a lot of abandoned land that used to belong to state farms, and the Koreans are good farmers, they are interested in coming here,'' Larisa Zabroskaya, a Korea expert at the Russian Academy of Science, said in Vladivostok.
 Many observers believe it is only a matter of time before China's food demands reach across the border and start creating agricultural colonies in the Maritime region, an area with the same population density of Maine, but twice the size.
 To bolster development, Zhanna Zainonchkovskaya proposed in a study a few years ago that Russia allow 10 million to 20 million immigrants from China by 2050. Without immigrants, Ms. Zainonchkovskaya, a geographer at the Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, argued that Russia's population would shrink by 13 percent, to 126 million by 2015.
 But with Russia's Far East concerned about retaining a European majority, migrant worker visas are to be issued this year to only 41,000 Asians, largely Chinese, North Koreans and Vietnamese.
 This region, however, is increasingly focused on catering to the Chinese economy. Last year, more than 300,000 Chinese tourists came to the region. In ports, cranes with electromagnets fill ships bound for China with Russian scrap metal. At the border, electric power grids are being connected to export Russian hydropower to Chinese factories. Upcountry, trucks carrying freshly cut raw logs for China steadily rumble through villages like this one.
 ''Maybe one day, I will be selling my cucumbers to China,'' mused Ms. Long, who increased her work crew this spring with the addition of two co-workers from Harbin, Yu Manbo and Zhang Xiaoliang, known here as Yura and Sasha.

HEADLINE: Set for a Super Bowl, and in a Rebuilding Year, Too

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 1 

 BODY:
At the very least, this city knows what it is not: Miami with its Cuban essence, Orlando with its theme parks or Palm Beach with its mansions. But what is Jacksonville, other than a blur outside your window en route to Disney? 
 Its leaders promise a beguiling answer by Feb. 6, when Super Bowl XXXIX is played here, bringing the kind of attention Jacksonville -- Florida's largest city proper, with about 760,000 residents -- has always craved. But for now, as the city feverishly prepares for what some call its coming-out party, they are easier put to explain what Jacksonville used to be. 
 ''We were known as the town of smells and odors,'' Mayor John Peyton said of the paper mills and chemical plants that perfumed the city for decades. Until the Jacksonville and Duval County governments merged in 1968, he said, ''the schools were failing, the river was polluted, the sewers overflowing, and all the politicians were getting indicted.''
 In a state that prides itself on showmanship and exotica, Jacksonville is workaday and dutiful, showcasing its corporate skyline (finance and insurance are big here) and low cost of living instead of azure water and subtropical vegetation. Its biggest natural attraction is its river, the St. Johns, which figures prominently in its Super Bowl promotion.
 ''It's not what I would call a sexy city,'' said Joel McEachin, a city planner. ''When you visit, there's nothing terribly exciting about it. But it's a nice place to live.'' 
 Jacksonville's last few mayors have surrendered to that simple sentiment and resolved to make the city nicer in a pragmatic way, bolstered by the arrival of a pro football team, the Jaguars, in 1995. Jax, as its residents call it, is undergoing its grandest physical transformation since 1901, when a fire ravaged the downtown and architects from around the country streamed in to rebuild it.
 The last mayor, John Delaney, persuaded voters in 2000 to raise the sales tax by half a cent for $2.25 billion in capital improvements. The extra revenue is helping finance a new county courthouse, a library, an equestrian center, baseball grounds and an arena, and a jaguar exhibit at the Jacksonville Zoo.
 Virtually every city street is being resurfaced; according to the mayor's office, enough asphalt has already been laid to build a street from City Hall to Montpelier, Vt. Some streets are also being widened in time for the Super Bowl, which the city is counting on to bring 100,000 visitors and up to $300 million in economic benefits.
 Though the overhaul was in the works before the National Football League picked Jacksonville for the 2005 game, the city is rushing to get many of the projects done in time. Orange construction fences are everywhere, as are scaffolding, men in hard hats, detours and lots of dust. Residential building is under way, too, with 2,000 downtown units in the works, including luxury town homes along the river that start at $500,000.
 ''Jacksonville is a blank canvas,'' said Mayor Peyton, a first-term Republican. ''We have an opportunity here to introduce the world to a place they've never heard of and don't really know where it is.''
 It will be one of the smallest markets ever to have the Super Bowl, and as Wayne Weaver, owner of the Jaguars, said of the city's role as host: ''The one thing we constantly have to remind ourselves is that we can't be what we're not. We can't compete with the Houstons and the New Orleanses.''
 That it cannot vie with Florida's tourist and retirement meccas may do the most for Jacksonville's image, helping it avoid the unmanageable growth that has plagued Orlando, South Florida and the Gulf Coast. Jacksonville's population is growing by about 2 percent a year, slowly enough to plan well ahead. 
 In part, that means correcting mistakes, like a downtown riverfront lined with drab government buildings and parking lots.''The river is something we haven't used very well, and we're trying to use it better,'' said Peter Rummell, co-chairman of the city's Super Bowl Host Committee. ''We are trying to force people to the edge.''
 Most of the Super Bowl revelry will take place along the river. Alltel Stadium, which recently got $40 million in renovations, sits near its banks, where an ''entertainment zone'' of bars and restaurants will ramble. Since Jacksonville does not have nearly enough hotel rooms to meet the Super Bowl's requirements, it has arranged for cruise ships to serve as hotels, anchoring on the river for the weekend. 
 To make the St. Johns more attractive, the city is demolishing old buildings along its banks, like the one housing Crawdaddy's, a restaurant designed to look like a rustic fish camp. Mr. Peyton also hopes the skeleton of the old Fuller Warren Bridge, one of several that span the river downtown, will be gone by January, though environmentalists are fighting a plan to dump the debris into the river.
 ''Some people want it as a fishing pier, but I want it down,'' Mr. Peyton said. ''It's unattractive.'' 
 The host committee has squired television producers around on introductory visits and distributed lists of ''Jax Facts.'' (Florida's least hurricane-prone coastal city! An average of 220 sunny days a year!)
 So far, though, the biggest Super Bowl story out of Jacksonville came courtesy of two homeless men who sued the city last month. They are challenging their recent arrest for public drinking, given that during game weekend, the city will allow it in the so-called entertainment zone, where their arrest occurred.
 Meanwhile, state legislators from Jacksonville have pushed through a new law requiring that anyone convicted of five misdemeanors in a year -- like loitering or disorderly conduct -- spend at least six months in jail or a residential treatment center. Critics say the bill was intended to sweep panhandlers and the homeless off the city's streets before the Super Bowl.
 In another piece of the tidying up, Jacksonville will spend $3 million to light all its bridges in time for the game. It is also spending nearly $100,000 to work with a public relations and marketing firm on remaking the city's image. Dozens of residents have suggested slogans, according to the local newspaper, including ''Florida's North Star,'' ''First Coast River City'' and -- drum roll, please -- ''It's Not That Bad.'' 
 Some here wistfully concede that Jacksonville cannot emulate Charleston or Savannah, which it resembles more in character than it does other Florida cities, because the 1901 fire destroyed its 19th-century buildings.
 But why shouldn't its waterfront have the cachet of Baltimore's or Seattle's, said Mr. Weaver, the Jaguars' owner. Though Charlotte, another Southern city with an N.F.L. team, draws more attention, Jacksonville has a leg up on it, he said.
 ''It'd be a fair comparison if you could add a beach and a beautiful river running through their downtown,'' Mr. Weaver said, adding, ''We are going to be one of the great middle-market cities.''

HEADLINE: Where Pagodas Draw Tourists, Concrete Is Unwelcome

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: LUANG PRABANG, Laos 

 BODY:
This former royal capital perches on the banks of the Mekong River, a gorgeous medley of gilded temples and pagodas, creaking wooden homes and some spruced-up vestiges of the French colonial era. Scarlet hibiscus and cream frangipani nestle beneath coconut palms. 
 To the newcomer, it is easy to imagine the impression left on Pierre Billotey, a French novelist, who traveled here to north central Laos in the 1920's to see his recently ensconced countrymen. He wrote of a tropical paradise where the French and the locals, including the Laotian king, Sisavang Vong, lived in harmony. Other visitors spoke enthusiastically about the easy opium and the not-too-discreet harems. 
 Now the foreigners are back, bringing with them a quickened pace and different demands. 
 Specifically, Unesco, the United Nations agency that fosters the preservation of important historic sites, wants the people here to maintain their houses in the style of those long ago times. 
 The town was named a world heritage site by Unesco in 1995, a designation that makes it eligible for United Nations preservation funds. Among other things, the residents are being offered traditional-style plaster instead of the big no-no -- concrete -- for refurbishment.
 But the requests are being met with the kind of disdain that Manhattan residents often show the New York City Landmarks Commission when it asks for restraint in replacing leaky period windows in Art Deco buildings. In short, there is resistance.
 ''When we explain that timber is part of the tradition, they don't understand, because to people here timber is the material of the poor,'' said Emmanuel Pouille, a French architect and historian, who is the chief technical adviser to the Unesco project. ''Here, concrete is a symbol of being rich. They say, 'Why can't we live like the people in the suburbs of Bangkok?'''
 The answer, Mr. Pouille says, is that there is a direct link between preservation and the rising tourism that is helping make them rich. 
 At last count, there were 129 guesthouses, some of them two rooms in search of a bathroom, and 14 hotels, a couple of them quite luxe, in a town of fewer than 20,000 residents.
 Intrepid travelers arrive by slow boat down the Mekong, or by bus over bone-jolting roads. Recently, flights into the newly expanded airport have started bringing tourists bored with neon Bangkok.
 Mr. Pouille says that without Luang Prabang's traditional look, even intrepid travelers will be less inclined to come. 
 ''But people don't see the connection,'' he said. ''Most want to make the money very quickly and run.'' 
 For many residents, the outsiders' passion for the old is misplaced, a cultural misunderstanding that refuses to respect their desire to spend a newfound wealth that has been a long time coming.
 Laos remains one of the world's poorest countries with few natural resources, a miserable education system and a Communist government that declines to liberalize the economy in any meaningful way. The hammer and sickle on a red field still flies from the flagpoles of official buildings. 
 But the government has permitted Luang Prabang to forge ahead as a tourist destination, and the evidence of new money is evident in tastes that go beyond concrete houses.
 At one restaurant frequented entirely by Laotians, male diners depleted bottles of Johnny Walker Black Label whiskey, followed by beer chasers. Outside, teenagers buzzed by on spanking new motorcycles, and a few of the really well-to-do cruised up and down the street in their S.U.V.'s searching for nocturnal fun.
 Visitors are drawn by more than two dozen Buddhist temples, which for the most part have been maintained in good condition. Monks in orange robes with yellow sashes seek alms at dawn. During the day they can be seen on the grounds of the monasteries doing manual labor or casually smoking cigarettes. 
 Another attraction is the royal palace, an unremarkable white colonial building that has been turned into a museum with the artifacts of the departed monarchy. Bizarrely, they include moon rocks from Apollo 11 sent by President Richard Nixon when the United States was pounding the Ho Chi Minh trail, which snaked through the eastern edge of Laos. 
 Luang Prabang's royalty did not leave voluntarily. Soon after the Communists took over in 1975, the last king, Savang Vatthana, a reportedly laconic character who liked tending orchids, and his wife and a son were taken to a labor camp. They died in terrible but never fully explained circumstances several years later. 
 To keep all this history in its context, Mr. Pouille and his team -- a Japanese architect, two French environmental experts and a passel of Lao architects -- want the authority to enforce their aesthetic standards.
 Last year they won a symbolic victory when Unesco stopped the construction of a concrete house that was being built behind a Buddhist temple. The juxtaposition was especially troubling, they say.
 Now they hope they can persuade the authorities to pull down the concrete shell. ''It is unacceptable,'' Mr. Pouille said. ''We will call the TV to show people we can demolish.''
 But Thong Parn Wattanacine, 24, a guesthouse manager who taught herself English with the help of an American boyfriend, said the outsiders were unrealistic. 
 ''People are getting richer,'' she said. ''They don't want the old things. If they own a wood house, they will move outside the town and build concrete houses.''
 Moreover, Ms. Thong Parn said, there was a practical reason why people preferred concrete in the tropics. ''A wood house is hot, concrete is cool.''

HEADLINE: How a Lax Eye on Money Pushed Legal Aid to the Brink

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
Late last summer, an executive at the Legal Aid Society's headquarters in Lower Manhattan answered an anonymous call from a pay phone somewhere in the city. The caller, a woman who seemed knowledgeable about the organization's internal affairs, claimed that the agency's top financial officer had gone on a personal spending spree, charging tens of thousands of dollars to a Legal Aid credit card.
 According to agency executives who recounted the events, the caller was referring to Theresa deLeon, the chief financial officer and a trusted veteran at Legal Aid, an organization that has represented indigent defendants in New York City for 128 years. The society opened an internal investigation and confirmed credit card charges that added up to more than $30,000, spent on things like pizza and shoes. Ms. deLeon later paid back the money and resigned.
 But in the course of investigating the credit card spree, agency executives and board members were shocked, they said, at the level of financial mismanagement they discovered, with negligence so far-reaching that it threatened the very existence of Legal Aid. Though no malfeasance was found, investigators discovered over the next few months that financial officers had been neglecting their duties for years, operating without supervision or accountability to anyone at the society or on its board of directors, which had assumed a passive role, focusing mainly on fund-raising. 
 Financial reporting at Legal Aid was almost nonexistent, according to minutes of board meetings and interviews with board members, agency executives and staff members, several of whom asked not to be identified because of the continuing turmoil at the agency. Accounting systems and controls were inadequate, and there was no accounts payable system at all. The position of internal auditor had been vacant for two years, and when one was finally hired to sift through the confusion, she quit after nine months. In distress, the agency, financed largely by public money, took the unusual step of borrowing $18 million from Merrill Lynch to help ease its cash flow problems. 
 According to a member of the Legal Aid Society's board who answered questions on the condition of anonymity, ''We had no management, no control, no projections, no knowledge of what was going on.'' He said the board learned of the problems for the first time in January. The board pressured several top officials to resign, including the chief executive, and has begun restructuring the agency's finances. ''We acknowledge that we do need tighter financial control and reporting,'' said Patricia M. Hynes, the board chairwoman. ''Some of that is in place, but we have more to do.'' 
 Legal Aid almost collapsed as a result of its mismanagement. It was saved from the brink of bankruptcy last month only by an $11 million infusion of cash from the city, and is now struggling out of financial distress by revamping its operations. But its financial crisis caused tremors throughout the courts, and it undercut Legal Aid's status as the nation's oldest and largest law firm for the poor.
 The agency's many missteps also brought down a nationally known advocate for legal representation of the poor, Daniel L. Greenberg, who had led the agency through years of cutbacks under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and had become the public face of Legal Aid, as well as its most resounding voice. He held the titles of president, chief executive and attorney in chief. Mr. Greenberg, 59, resigned under pressure on June 9.
 Reached by telephone last week, Mr. Greenberg declined to discuss the situation and his role in it. On Friday, he issued a written statement expressing hope that the cash infusion and new financial systems would help the agency. ''I believe that the organization is best served by new leadership during this time,'' he said. ''My commitment is, always has been, and always will be to the indigent people we serve.''
 According to the minutes of a Legal Aid board meeting in April at the Manhattan law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, Mr. Greenberg said that he took responsibility for the loss of financial control. 
 ''As he reflected on what has happened,'' a member of the executive committee wrote, ''he said he realized that he did not provide the kind of supervision he should have.''
 The Legal Aid Society was founded in 1876 to protect immigrants. At first it operated on philanthropic gifts, but after the 1963 Supreme Court ruling establishing the right to counsel for the poor, the city hired the agency to represent indigent defendants. Agency lawyers went on strike in 1994 for higher wages, but backed down when Mayor Giuliani threatened to terminate Legal Aid's contract and use private lawyers. Mr. Giuliani later reduced the agency's role in the city's courts and cut its budget. 
 Mr. Greenberg joined the agency just after the 1994 strike, and in the following years oversaw expansions of Legal Aid's civil services in such areas as employment, immigration, health and homelessness, while maintaining enormous criminal caseloads, even as public financing decreased.
 He also expanded the authority of his office, winning board approval to change the bylaws so that he could be president of the board and chief executive, in addition to attorney in chief. The assumption, officials said, was that he would be a hands-on liaison for the directors and the management and staff. 
 But the arrangement failed, according to agency staff members and executives, in part because Mr. Greenberg's attention was focused on litigation and the costly expansion of the agency, and in part because the board failed to notice that Mr. Greenberg's staff was not in control of the agency's books.
 ''The fiscal meltdown at the Legal Aid Society finally opened the board of directors' eyes, forced them to finally engage in the job of fiscal oversight, which was always their responsibility,'' said James Rogers, the president of the union representing Legal Aid lawyers. ''So Legal Aid is on firm financial footing now, but that doesn't change the board's responsibilities and liabilities. Their job is to oversee taxpayer assets that need great care because services to the needy are dependent on the care they bring to the organization.''
 Board members say they simply never received the bad news.
 ''The board basically was relying upon the reports management was giving them, and those reports were basically oral reports,'' said Ms. Hynes, the board chairwoman, in an interview last week. ''The board was not receiving detailed financial reports except at the end of the year.'' 
 Ms. Hynes, a lawyer at the firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad & Schulman, said she could not recall the board ever having had a discussion about deficits.
 In fact, the agency has run a deficit every year since 1996, according to its annual financial disclosure forms, ranging from $1.8 million in 1997 to $9.9 million in 2000.
 New York City, which provides nearly half of the society's annual budget through its $68 million contract for criminal defense representation, also exercised little financial oversight. City officials say that until recently they watched only how the city's dollars were being spent.
 John Feinblatt, the city's criminal justice coordinator, said the city's review of the criminal defense work in the past two years showed surpluses. But he said that with the city's agreement to give the society a one-time cash infusion of $11 million, the city will now more broadly audit and examine the society's books.
 ''We will look at the whole enterprise,'' he said. ''We will require much more than we did in the past.'' In the future, he said, city officials would meet with the society's financial staff on a quarterly basis and receive monthly cash flow statements. In addition, the city now has the right to bring in outside financial auditors if it suspects anything amiss.
 The New York attorney general's office, which oversees nonprofit organizations, has begun looking into what went wrong at the society. 
 ''We've had preliminary discussions with the Legal Aid Society regarding a number of issues at the organization,'' said Juanita Scarlett, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and did not elaborate.
 Legal Aid's bylaws insure board members, officers and staff members individually against lawsuits as permitted by the state's Not-for-Profit Corporation Law.
 One transaction that has raised the ire of the staff at Legal Aid concerns Mr. Greenberg's housing arrangement. Two years ago, the board allowed him to purchase, for $420,000, an 1,850-square-foot co-op apartment that Legal Aid owned in a Park Slope brownstone near Prospect Park. Many staff members believe the price was below the apartment's true market value, although an independent appraisal provided by the board shows that the price was at fair market value. As layoff notices circulated in recent weeks, the sale was cited often as an indication of how Legal Aid wasted money. 
 Legal Aid nearly ran out of money in the spring and feared it could not meet its regular payroll expenses. The city's bailout helped shrink a deficit that had been expected to reach $20 million this fiscal year. And, although some layoffs may still be necessary, it saved the jobs of 140 criminal defense lawyers.
 But in the weeks before the budget agreement, the sudden, largely unexplainable crisis left directors wondering what to report to their firms, among them the most highly recognized legal names in the country.
 ''It was suggested the directors should be given talking points they could use in explaining the situation at their firms,'' according to official notes from a February meeting at Davis Polk. The notes also mentioned that a ''strategic communications expert'' had been brought in to help. The main message, according to the Ms. Hynes, was to be this: ''Emphasize that the funds were used for client services.'' 
 Except for the $30,000 that Ms. deLeon spent on herself and later repaid in full, there is no evidence that malfeasance played a role in the crisis, according to interviews and a review of internal documents. Rather, the agency's woes seem to be the result of sloppy bookkeeping and a lack of accountability.
 Steven Banks, the group's associate chief attorney who has temporarily taken the agency's helm, suggested that Legal Aid had simply focused so intently on its courtroom work that it failed to notice what was happening to its books.
 ''It's clear that the quality of our infrastructure did not match the quality of our client services,'' said Mr. Banks, who assumed Mr. Greenberg's duties as chief attorney three weeks ago on an interim basis while a search committee looks for Mr. Greenberg's permanent successor. 
 It was Ms. deLeon's job to supervise the agency's finances while the lawyers handled the litigation. Agency executives say she had never managed the finances of a $150 million organization like Legal Aid before, and frequently found herself overwhelmed with the task. Ms. deLeon, an accountant, was previously chief of staff at the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development.
 In an interview, Ms. deLeon -- the Republican candidate for a New Jersey congressional seat in 1998 and 2000 -- did not deny that she had charged $30,000 in personal expenses to the company credit card, though she said she paid back any money she owed, when asked. Regarding the financial mismanagement, she said the agency had received ''clean audits'' during her tenure, although she could not remember who did the audits or how many there were.
 ''All I can say is, we tried to keep the services going for clients,'' she said. 
 The financial meltdown does not seem to have diminished the quality of criminal defense services Legal Aid has offered the poor over the past several years. Legal Aid's 880 lawyers handle 210,000 cases a year.
 ''There have been no reports of negative impact on services actually rendered to clients,'' said John H. Doyle III, a defense lawyer at the firm of Anderson, Kill & Olick, who is the chairman of the Council on Criminal Justice at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Mr. Doyle's assessment was shared by several lawyers and judges interviewed for this article.
 But the agency has not ruled out the possibility of diminished services for the poor in civil legal matters, which are financed by a patchwork of private contributions and grants from foundations and governments. Though this is a relatively small part of the agency's work, it often infuriates city officials when the agency sues the city on behalf of aggrieved clients. Legal Aid officials say they are making every effort to avoid such steps and maintain full legal services related to housing, immigration, employment and family law, but for years the society had fed deficits because it had underestimated the cost of many of those services.
 Along with the inability to predict its real costs, the agency also suffered from effects of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attack, executives said. The building that housed Legal Aid's Church Street headquarters suffered damage when the World Trade Center was attacked, and the agency was forced to move at a time when it was helping many attack victims and others who encountered hard economic times after the attack. 
 One of the first things Ms. Hynes did after becoming the board chairwoman in December was to appoint a task force to sort out the financial mess. The task force's first report was not reassuring: it discovered that ''no internal financial statements were prepared'' and that ''the financial forecast is grim,'' according to the minutes of the meeting where the report was discussed. It also found that Legal Aid would run out of money by April 1. A $9 million line of credit at Merrill Lynch had been exhausted; the board decided to borrow another $9 million. 
 Other committees and subcommittees were formed to investigate real estate deals and auditing practices, and to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing. Ms. Hynes said no malfeasance was found. 
 An outside management firm, Kiwi Partners, which has expertise in solving the financial problems of nonprofit groups, was retained to act as a temporary chief financial officer. Another management firm, Alvarez & Marsal, volunteered its services to help restructure the organization. From now on, Ms. Hynes said, lawyers will be keeping track of their hours, and the financial officer will report directly to the board.
 In addition to Mr. Greenberg and Ms. deLeon, two other employees -- the controller and a woman who had served as chief operating officer and development director -- resigned as the financial picture became clear.
 ''It is just not right, but there were people on staff who did not serve the society well, unfortunately,'' Pat Bath, the spokeswoman for Legal Aid, said last week. ''But we are moving forward, not backwards.'' 
 Ms. Hynes, a former federal prosecutor specializing in corruption and fraud, said despite the apparent gloom, she remained optimistic about the future of Legal Aid. 
 ''The silver lining of these problems,'' she said, ''has been our ability to really step back and overhaul the society to make it work better, to make it work more efficiently, and ultimately to be in a position to deliver, we hope, more services to clients.''

HEADLINE: Relying on Science, Not Serendipity, for a Quieter Ride in the Sky

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
ACCORDING to legend, at least, it all began with a screwdriver. 
 As Mohammad Samimy, a professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio State University, tells it, a NASA engineer was using a screwdriver to point out a feature of a prototype jet one day when the tip of the tool strayed into the exhaust and the noise from the engine changed. 
 Neither Dr. Samimy nor officials at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, where that event is said to have taken place (and where Dr. Samimy has conducted research), can confirm that it actually occurred. But however the discovery was made, the idea of reducing jet engine noise by altering its exhaust turbulence has become a focus of several researchers. 
 By far the most ambitious plan comes from Dr. Samimy's Ohio State lab, which is seeking to replace errant screwdrivers with carefully controlled bursts of electricity.
 ''Essentially this may allow you to turn noise reduction on and off with a switch,'' said Joseph E. Grady, the manager of NASA's engine noise reduction project at Glenn.
 Two factors have made reducing airplane noise more than an engineering curiosity. Propeller-driven commercial airplanes are increasingly being replaced by small jets on short-hop flights to smaller airports that often are near residential areas. At the other extreme, many overseas airports, particularly in Britain, are considering even more stringent noise limits for large airplanes. 
 Dr. Samimy first began looking at jet exhaust turbulence about 15 years ago, but for a reason unrelated to noise. He was one of many researchers studying the feasibility of getting a long-range passenger plane to reach a low Earth orbit during its flight. Calculations showed that the speeds that such an aircraft would need to reach would force air through their engines so quickly that it would not properly mix with fuel. Dr. Samimy hoped to use turbulence to improve air-fuel mixing.
 That long-range plane never left the drawing board, so he eventually turned his attention to noise. At first it was difficult to figure out exactly how to alter exhaust turbulence to make a quieter engine, Dr. Samimy said. ''When I started working with NASA, people did not know exactly what was happening,'' he said. The interaction between the jet noise and turbulence was too complex for even the most sophisticated computer to model.
 To study exhaust turbulence, Dr. Samimy and the researchers in his lab turned to high-speed digital photography. Essentially, they pulsed several beams of laser light across the exhaust nozzle of a model engine for nine-billionths of a second. The laser pulse was synchronized to trigger a special camera. The resulting snapshots capture particles in the air, particularly water droplets, as they blast through the sheet of light, much as a runner bursts through a paper banner at the finish line.
 In his work on noise control, Dr. Samimy had helped NASA engineers develop a simple method for taming the exhaust turbulence. They mounted V-shaped tabs around the exhaust nozzle to reshape the airflow to a quieter, more organized pattern.
 Those tabs, or chevrons, as they are known in the engine business, are able to reduce noise at ground level by three decibels. ''That's something you can definitely hear,'' Dr. Grady said.
 So far, only an engine made by General Electric for small aircraft has included the chevrons. That is largely because the simple chevron approach also introduces a problem: while the chevrons are only needed for a minute or less during takeoff, they remain in place all the time, reducing overall engine performance and efficiency. That might be acceptable for aircraft on short commuter flights, but it doesn't work economically for aircraft that spend hours cruising over oceans and continents.
 Some ideas for reducing noise without harming performance, like chevrons that could retract after takeoff with the use of motors, added excessive weight and complexity.
 But Igor V. Adamovich, a plasma expert at Ohio State, gave Dr. Samimy the idea of electronically controlling the exhaust flow. Instead of chevrons, Dr. Samimy ringed an exhaust nozzle with eight electrodes known as plasma actuators. Heat from the electrodes created a pressure pulse that mimicked the chevrons' effect. ''Unfortunately, it did not work consistently,'' he said.
 Eventually he and his group discovered that it was necessary to turn the electrodes on and off at a frequency that matched one found in the exhaust turbulence. In most cases that rate is 9,000 to 10,000 times a second.
 ''I feel these will be able to provide much more noise reduction than chevrons,'' Dr. Samimy said.
 Before he can prove his belief, he has some problems to sort out. So far, his demonstrations have only used airflows that simulate the exhaust from a commercial airliner engine or a military jet fighter. Now that they have proved at least his idea in concept, the system will be included on actual engines mounted into test rigs.
 Dr. Grady at NASA will be looking at two things in those test engines, other than their noise reduction. The power supply for the electrodes, he said, will have to be designed so that it does not sap engine output needed for flight. And he will want to ensure that the rapid heating of the electrodes will not physically damage the exhaust area of engines.
 The electrode approach also has some strong competition. Other researchers are developing chevrons made from special alloys. Heat from the exhaust would automatically cause those chevrons to bend out of the way after takeoff without any additional power or controls.
 ''But what has been accomplished at Ohio State is significant,'' Dr. Grady said. ''It would presumably be lighter and offer an instant response.''

HEADLINE: Europe to Alter Tariffs To Help Poor Countries

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 7 

 BODY:
The European Union will overhaul its tariffs, offering more benefits to the world's poorest countries while trimming trade discounts to wealthier nations, the union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, said on Wednesday.
 After a complaint by India about the way the union gave out discounts on import duties, the World Trade Organization ruled in April that the bloc's current system was not based on impartial and clear criteria. 
 ''We're trying to make it more objective, more transparent,'' Mr. Lamy said at a news conference. ''Instead of having a scattered benefit to all developing countries, we want to focus efforts on the most needy countries.'' 
 The European Union in 2002 imported 53 billion euros ($66 billion) in goods -- three times the level of the United States -- from poor countries like Angola, Bangladesh and Nigeria under a system of preferences.
 Mr. Lamy said the changes proposed on Wednesday would give bigger discounts to countries with small market shares in a specific industry.
 ''Some countries move up through the rungs and will benefit from fewer advantages,'' he said. ''When they have a pretty good market share, we deem that they no longer need these benefits and we allocate them to more needy countries.''
 The European Commission, the union's regulatory arm, plans to offer specifics before Nov. 1, and the overhaul will be in place by 2006, Mr. Lamy said. The changes are subject to approval by the European governments and the European Parliament. 
 Farm and industrial products from five groups of poor nations have duty-free access to the 25-nation union, which absorbs a fifth of developing-country exports. That number will be reduced to three under the proposed changes.
 China will continue to benefit under the system as the union has no plans to change its status as a developing country, Mr. Lamy said. Poor nations including Mauritius have said Chinese competition may undermine their commodity exports.
 China's share of global textile production surged to 65 percent in March from 9 percent in 2001, when it joined the W.T.O., according to an industry study released last month. The country accounts for a third of total union imports under the preference system, followed by India at 12 percent and Indonesia at 4.8 percent.
 Oxfam, a private charity concerned with fighting poverty, called Mr. Lamy's proposals ''only half-hearted.'' While the union ''promises duty-free access for goods from least-developed countries, in reality strict rules prevent the poorest countries in the world from taking advantage, particularly in textiles,'' said Jo Leadbeater, head of Oxfam's European Union advocacy office.
 Under the current system, the tariffs imposed on beneficiaries' imports are 3.5 percent lower than duties paid by other countries, Mr. Lamy said.

HEADLINE: Some new studies look at what to do about the troubled American health care system.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THERE are no easy answers in reforming health care, but some economists in the field increasingly believe there may indeed be viable solutions to at least some of the nation's health problems. 
 The seemingly intractable issues are well known. Americans spend some 14 percent of gross domestic product on health care, while other advanced nations spend an average of 8 percent. In the United States, the proportion may rise to 18 percent by 2013. 
 Yet in general, judging by life span and infant mortality, most developed nations are healthier than the United States. More detailed studies find similar results. For example, a study recently published by the Commonwealth Fund measured quality of care in specific areas of medicine in five nations. It showed that America was superior in only a few. For example, this country topped the list in survival rates for breast cancer but was at the bottom for kidney transplants. It was typically in the middle in most other areas measured. 
 What may surprise readers, and certainly surprised this writer, is that Americans, by paying so much more, do not have many more services. In fact, according to recent research, they typically have fewer. Consider the number of doctors. In 2001, the United States had 2.7 doctors per 1,000 people, compared with a median of 3.1 in the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. France, accused of having a doctor shortage in last summer's heat wave, had 3.3 per 1,000. 
 Also, consider the number of hospital beds. The United States has only 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared with the O.E.C.D. median of 3.9. Germany has 6.3. The United States is also behind in the actual days spent in a hospital and hospital admissions per capita. These are not necessarily bad in themselves, but the question is why we spend so much. 
 The reason for the high level of American spending, argue the researchers -- Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton and Peter S. Hussey and Gerard F. Anderson of Johns Hopkins -- is that American doctors and hospitals charge much more. Americans also usually pay significantly more for drugs, they say, and administration expenses are exorbitant. 
 The researchers argue that there is an imbalance in bargaining power between the providers of medical services, which are usually large hospitals and hospital chains, and the buyers, which are fragmented into thousands of insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. Thus, the providers can get away with unusually high prices. In some countries, insurers are sometimes allowed to bargain for better prices collectively. In others, the government itself does the bargaining. 
 Such research provides a stronger argument than in the past for tougher bargaining by government for services and drugs, Mr. Reinhardt said, adding that Medicare and the Veterans Administration could lead the way. 
 There is also renewed optimism in academia about how to improve the quality of care for every dollar spent. Economists like Joseph Newhouse of Harvard University argue that costs may be higher at American hospitals partly because they use so much high technology -- not only up-to-date machinery but also the latest fancy procedures and drugs. 
 The question is whether high tech is worth the higher price. Despite plenty of skepticism, a growing number of economists believe that a large part of it is.
 David M. Cutler, a health care economist at Harvard, summarizes what is becoming a standard conclusion among professional economists in a book, ''Your Money or Your Life'' (Oxford University Press, 2003). Mr. Cutler finds that new technologies and procedures in areas like heart disease and low-weight newborns have extended lives so greatly that their benefits far outweigh what America spends on them. In fact, he finds the benefits from just such procedures alone so large that they justify increased spending in all other areas. 
 Still, Mr. Cutler and others argue that reforms are needed because a lot of waste remains. One study concludes, for example, that Medicare spending could be cut by 20 percent without affecting care. 
 Also important, effective procedures are badly underused. A standout example are beta-blockers, drugs that can reduce by 25 percent the probability of a follow-up heart attack. Only half of patients who have a beta-blocker prescription now take the drug. 
 These economists want both the public and private sectors to adopt a market solution of sorts that calls for getting the financial incentives right. In the past, traditional fee-for-service insurance and managed care often provided reimbursement schedules that encouraged waste and ineffective care. 
 But recent advances in information technology are providing sophisticated ways to measure performance. These make it possible to tailor financial incentives to discourage unnecessary procedures, encourage procedures known to be useful, and reward doctors and hospitals financially for both saving lives and improving the quality of life of the unhealthy. 
 Several pay-for-performance programs have been adopted recently. Mr. Cutler, in particular, is optimistic about some of them. But there are also clearly obstacles. One is that paying for performance might encourage doctors and hospitals to treat only patients likely to do well. 
 Another is that any kind of standardization may limit doctors and hospitals too much, just as teachers complain that standardized tests limit them. ''We have been paying for results in education, but we haven't been successful,'' Mr. Newhouse of Harvard cautions. Still, even Mr. Newhouse is in favor of experimenting with paying for performance. 
 To give it a chance, however, many observers, like Mr. Reinhardt, say a strong nudge from government will again be required. A group of 15 researchers, for example, recently wrote an open letter calling for Medicare reimbursements to reward performance. These health care professionals are not calling for Medicare to supersede private care, but believe the private sector will follow suit only if Medicare paves the way. 
 Pay for performance may not bring down costs. Any savings that result from eliminating waste will probably be offset by more intensive use of neglected procedures. But at least with pay for performance, Americans will have a better chance of getting the best care for their money. Then, the United States can decide just how much more it wants to spend, and whether further reforms are necessary.

HEADLINE: Sibling Rivalry Foils the Obstacles

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
Keeth and Erinn Smart's brother-sister bond exists somewhere between telepathy and technology, from Russia to Bulgaria and back to Brooklyn.
 As testament, the cellphone calls and e-mail messages flashed in a flurry of support one weekend in March across Eastern Europe, where they were competing in separate fencing tournaments. From Bulgaria, Keeth, who had already qualified for his second Olympics, was cheering Erinn, his younger sister and best friend, to win the only spot on the Olympic women's foil team. 
 After she finished competing in St. Petersburg, Russia, Erinn, 24, had amassed enough points to overtake the 2000 Olympians Iris and Felicia Zimmerman. She secured her spot and ended the disappointment of four years ago, when she was an unused alternate in Sydney, Australia, rooting for her brother. 
 Erinn reached Keeth to tell him that they were going to Athens together, but neither sibling wanted to whoop and holler in the presence of their defeated friends. Each sensed what the other was feeling without even saying it.
 ''Words can't describe it,'' said Keeth, who turns 26 this month. ''I have known how much work she has put into it over the years to get there.'' 
 Their mother, Liz, had enough words and emotion to make up for her restrained children when she picked up the phone. ''At 2 o'clock in the morning I heard, 'Mom, I made it!''' Liz Smart said recently in a telephone interview from her home in Orlando, Fla. ''And I was screaming.''
 The three have formed an inspirational triangle, with the sport of fencing linking and uplifting them in times of crisis. 
 Liz Smart, 51, who emigrated from Jamaica when she was 18, raised her two children, born 18 months apart, on a Caribbean-influenced block of Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn. 
 Their father, Tom, was working for Sports Illustrated in the advertising production department when he saw an ad for the fencing foundation of the six-time Olympian Peter Westbrook, who was looking for minority children to join the sport.
 Erinn had flourished in ballet, ice skating, tennis and track, and at age 11, she discovered she could combine her grace and athleticism in fencing. Six months later, her brother, scrawny and often the last picked for baseball teams, joined her. 
 ''When I first saw Erinn, after a little bit, I could tell she was very, very athletic, very competitive, very driven,'' Westbrook said at the United States Grand Prix tournament at Hunter College last month. 
 When he first saw Keeth, ''I thought, 'Oh what a nice, goofy kid,''' Westbrook said.
 At first, Keeth struggled more than his sister as both competed in the same weapon, the foil. Two years later, he moved to the faster, more athletic saber. ''I switched because I wasn't good at it and I couldn't beat anyone,'' he said with a laugh.
 The two would take their weapons on the subway from Brooklyn to the New York Fencers Club on West 25th Street in Manhattan. They heard the usual comments in the neighborhood (''Hey, Zorro!''), but they heard more hurtful comments inside the club.
 Gradually, they said, they became used to being members of minorities in an elite sport in which most of the other competitors were white. And they received support from Westbrook, who is black and Asian. 
 But Tom Smart admitted that he took it personally when he would hear other adults in the fencing world ask, ''Who are these two black kids coming along?''
 The costs of competing -- travel, uniforms and equipment -- were high, and Liz Smart said there were years when she spent the maximum of $5,000 allowed on her credit card. 
 One year, the Smarts could not afford to send Keeth and Erinn to the junior nationals in Colorado, and fencers previously beaten by the Smarts won titles. Afterward, Liz Smart decided to take a second job. She augmented her teaching position with the Board of Education with afternoon tutoring in the projects. 
 The siblings competed for the Brooklyn Technical High School team, in a cavernous auditorium, usually in front of an audience of five or six people. One spectator was almost always Liz Smart. 
 The siblings remained in New York City for college, Keeth earning a scholarship at St. John's and winning two national collegiate championships. Erinn was an all-American at Columbia. 
 While preparing for Sydney, the siblings spent their free time in the hospital, where their mother was being treated for colon cancer. They came away both depressed and somehow amazed. 
 ''It was more like how she was able to carry herself all the time, the dignity she had,'' Keeth said. ''It didn't slow her drive and motivation to live.'' 
 Liz Smart was determined to be in Sydney, even though she was in the middle of chemotherapy treatments.
 In retrospect, Liz admitted, ''That was just a horrible experience.'' But in a way, she said, the most painful part of the trip was watching her daughter sidelined. ''I cried for her,'' she said. 
 Keeth was not expected to win a medal and finished 30th . 
 After the Games, Liz gradually recovered her strength and has not had a recurrence of the cancer. She has since separated from Tom, although they remain friends and he visits her in Orlando. 
 Were her mother's cancer to return, Erinn said she and her brother would be able to cope better than they did four years ago.
 ''In Sydney it was difficult and we were younger then,'' she said. ''It knocked us off guard, and we're a little bit stronger now.''
 Since graduating from college with a degree in finance, Keeth has worked for Verizon, which has given him a leave of absence to train for the Olympics. Erinn, who graduated with an economics history degree from Barnard, will work for the financial firm Lord Abbott after the Olympics. 
 In March in Athens, Keeth became the first United States fencer to achieve a No. 1 world ranking. That was not even accomplished by Westbrook, whose bronze medal in 1984 is still the only Olympic medal won by an American fencer.
 Keeth will compete in Athens in the men's saber. The United States team upset the Russian team in New York two weeks ago while winning the World Cup championship.
 ''Now with the years we've had, I feel like we know we're medal contenders,'' he said. 
 Two other fencers representing Westbrook's foundation -- Ivan Lee and Kamara James -- will go to Athens, along with Dan Kellner, Jed Dupree and Jon Tiomkin from the New York Fencers Club and Soren Thompson and Seth Kelsey from the New York Athletic Club. 
 The women's foil is contested only as an individual sport. Erinn defeated her teammates at the world championships last year and is ranked No. 23 in the world.
 In two World Cup events in the last two weeks, though, she has had two disappointing finishes, placing in the top 32.
 But Keeth continues to boost her confidence and she does the same for him. 
 ''This is how close they are,'' Liz said, recalling an incident after the 2000 Games. ''When the Olympians were invited to the White House, Keeth didn't go because his sister couldn't go. He didn't want things hung up in the house. We played it down as a family.'' 
 This year is different. Liz Smart, her sister, her sister-in-law and niece will all travel to Athens. Since Erinn's initial excitement in March, though, she has been concentrating on her training, admitting with a laugh, ''It won't fully set in until we're actually there.''
 Together.


CORRECTION-DATE: July 10, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A sports article on Thursday about Keeth and Erinn Smart, a brother and sister who have qualified for the United States Olympic fencing team, misstated the number of Americans who have been Olympic medalists in the sport. It is 8, accounting for a total of 13 individual medals. The article also referred incorrectly to a bronze medal won by the siblings' coach, Peter Westbrook, in the 1984 Games. It was not the only fencing medal won by an American: others were won in 1904, 1928, 1932 and 1960.

HEADLINE: A Cunning Opposition Turns Tables in Mongolia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 7 

 BODY:
Voters in this literate, sparsely populated country between China and Russia have handed their governing party of former Communists an uncommon lesson that indicates that a young democracy may have come of age. 
 In a boisterous election 10 days ago that pitted guile against might, the country's 1.5 million voters cut the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party numbers in the 76-seat Parliament from 72 to 36. On Wednesday, the General Election Commission confirmed that the opposition, the Motherland Democratic Coalition, known as the Democrats, won 34 seats. The Democrats claim to have won two more seats, and have taken their argument to an administrative court. They are also wooing three independents in the hope of forming a government.
 Although the court has three more weeks to govern, it is expected to announce its decision on the two contested seats by Friday, before most Mongolians disconnect from politics for Naadam, a four-day midsummer festival of horse races, archery contests and wrestling matches. 
 Now, with both sides claiming victory and the governing party fighting for the allegiance of the three independents as well, Mongolians are drawing up their chairs for a summer of political horse trading to see who will govern this grassy nation of nomads on China's northern border, which became a democracy only 14 years ago. Already they have experienced a political spectacle in which the governing party's advantages in money and power were neutralized by a tactical maneuver that American political operatives could only dream of. 
 Next Thursday, President Bush is expected to hail Mongolia's multiparty democracy when he receives President Natsagiyn Bagabandi in Washington.
 Meanwhile, China is viewing the development somewhat differently. Newspapers, magazines and television are largely keeping silent about the election carried out on June 27 by their less affluent neighbors. Although Western reporters have journeyed here to cover this revolution through the ballot box, editors in China have stayed away, as they commonly do when the news is not to the liking of the country's leaders.
 In Mongolia, with 2.5 million people, multiparty democracy has become so entrenched that its novelty days are over. In a survey of Mongolian adults conducted last month by the Sant Maral Foundation, an independent polling group, 90 percent of the 2,170 respondents described Mongolia's move in 1990 from a one-party Communist state to a multiparty democracy as a ''right step.'' A Soviet satellite for most of the 20th century, the country underwent a peaceful democratic revolution in the spring of 1990 and held its first multiparty elections that July.
 The People's Revolutionary Party was staunchly Communist for 69 years after its founding in 1921, but has moved to the center in the last decade, becoming a social democratic party that courts foreign investment and close ties with the United States. Except for a four-year Democratic Coalition interlude, marked by a series of prime ministers, it has governed the country for most of its 83 years. 
 The Democratic Coalition is a loose alliance of three parties that advocates more civil liberties, but roughly similar free-market economic policies. Unemployment, corruption and child care were the major issues in the race.
 Although the People's Revolutionary Party has governed Mongolia since 2000, it claims to be the victim of opposition fraud.
 ''There was massive election fraud,'' Y. Otgonbayar, secretary of the People's Revolutionary Party, said Tuesday, looking grayer and tenser than he did in an interview five weeks ago. He said the opposition stole seats.
 In the foyer of the party headquarters on Tuesday, about a dozen people, largely elderly, inspected a hastily mounted ''Museum of Election Fraud.''
 On display were gifts said to be handed out as bribes by opposition candidates: white porcelain soup bowls painted with the image of Genghis Khan, Mongolia's national hero; colorful silk Buddhist prayer scarves; packs of playing cards marked with names of Democratic candidates; a half-empty vodka bottle labeled ''Strong Stuff from the Strong Party''; and wall clocks, their battery-powered second hands sweeping relentlessly around equally relentlessly smiling faces of opposition candidates.
 Despite this display of ''fraud,'' the evidence seems to tilt strongly in the opposite direction -- that it was the governing party that most heavily abused the rules.
 Mongolians for Open Society, a group financed by the American billionaire George Soros, found that the ruling party used government halls without paying 31 times, compared with 3 times by the opposition. The survey found 384 cases of government cars used by the ruling party in campaign work, compared with 3 cases by the opposition. It also determined that state employees spent 2,873 days when they were supposed to be toiling for the government campaigning for the governing party instead, compared with 111 days for the opposition. 
 All this came on top of an advertising blitz by the governing party, which outspent the opposition by 10 to 1 for television, radio and newspaper advertisements.
 ''Everything was in the hands of the government -- just look at the millions of tugriks spent on billboards and on pop star concerts in Ulan Bator,'' Oyun Sanjaasuren, a popular opposition member of Parliament, said, referring to the national currency, which trades at about 1,180 to the dollar. 
 But a good dose of political ingenuity proved to be the tugriks' match. In the 2000 election, the vote difference nationwide was only a few percentage points. The opposition lost dozens of seats by tight margins. So this time around, the opposition carried out a homemade election-day redistricting program.
 With voters scattered over an area twice the size of Texas, Mongolian law generously allows voting out of one's home district with minimum paperwork and advance notice. On election day, it quickly dawned on the governing party that the opposition was employing fleets of minibuses to shuttle voters from opposition strongholds to swing districts.
 But even as the governing party scrambled to deploy its own fleets of minibuses, it watched in disbelief as safe seat after safe seat fell to bused-in voters.
 For the government, one of the most painful losses was that of Gurragchaa, a member of Parliament who in the Soviet era became the only Mongolian astronaut to go into space.
 Mr. Gurragchaa, who also serves as Mongolia's defense minister, was running in a presumably safe district, an eastern Ulan Bator precinct with a large army base. But he lost by about 250 votes. On Monday, pro-government protesters marched on downtown Freedom Square, demanding repeat balloting in the minister's district.
 In addition to crying fraud, the government has cried terrorism, citing what appears to have been a bomb hoax near the offices of the prime minister, Nambaryn Enkhbayar.
 On July 1, the Democrats got wind that the government planned to broadcast conspiracy theories against the opposition. Largely cut out of television coverage, opposition demonstrators stormed the National Radio and Television Building, breaking a few windows and some furniture on their way in.
 After a standoff of several hours, the government agreed to allow the opposition 20 minutes of free air time every evening, which it has used to rebut what it says are bogus smears.
 In a rambling Saturday night speech, Mr. Enkhbayar appeared clearly depressed by his party's electoral misfortune.
 Various parliamentary scenarios arise for this summer: a national unity coalition between the parties; a government by one side with a razor thin, often ad hoc majority; or, if no cabinet is formed by the end of August, new elections.
 But no one talks of an authoritarian option.
 Mr. Otgonbayar, the governing party secretary, said, ''I don't think this election has put a question mark on the democracy in Mongolia.'' 
 Ms. Oyun, the opposition deputy, said: ''We had 14 years of democracy, freedom of speech. These 14 years have changed the mentality of the people.''

HEADLINE: Open Season In the South

BYLINE: By Jack Bass. 
Jack Bass, professor of humanities and social sciences at the College of Charleston, is the co-author of ''The Transformation of Southern Politics.''

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Some question John Kerry's selection of John Edwards as his running mate, calling the decision a wasted choice. They accept the received wisdom that the South now belongs to the Republicans and that not even a native son will be able to change electoral and demographic destiny. They ask whether Mr. Kerry would have been wiser to choose Richard A. Gephardt -- someone with a shot at delivering his home region.
 But Mr. Kerry made the right choice. The view that the South has become an entrenched Republican stronghold is a myth. Despite substantial Democratic electoral losses in the region in 2002, Democrats have made net gains here since 1998. In the 11 states that formed the Confederacy, the number of Democratic governors and senators has risen (from three to four and from seven to nine, respectively). 
 In fact, the choice of Mr. Edwards means that President Bush can no longer take the South for granted. North Carolina, South Carolina and Louisiana now all join Florida as battleground states. Republican resources might have to be spent in solidly G.O.P. states, like Virginia and Tennessee, both with Democratic governors. And Democratic candidates running for contested open Senate seats across the region will probably get a boost with Mr. Edwards on the ticket.
 Despite a slight Republican tilt in state politics, genuine two-party competition has emerged in the South, with political independents holding the balance of power. A South Carolina survey last fall, for example, found that 31 percent of registered voters identified themselves as independents; many of them are suburban dwellers who can identify with Mr. Edwards's upward mobility. In addition, Mr. Edwards's ''two Americas'' speech resonates both with blacks and working-class whites, especially the tens of thousands in the Carolinas who have lost jobs as textile and apparel plants have moved overseas.
 Even in South Carolina, with a Republican governor and Legislature, having Mr. Edwards on the ticket puts the state in play. For starters, there is pride in having a native son on a major-party ticket for the first time in more than 150 years. What's more, Mr. Edwards won South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary, earning 45 percent of the vote in a record turnout. The presence of Mr. Edwards, who ran especially well among independents, also means that Inez Tenenbaum, the state education superintendent who is trying to keep Ernest F. Hollings's Senate seat for the Democrats, can comfortably associate herself with the national ticket, rather than run away from it. 
 The ticket is similarly strong in North Carolina, where Mr. Edwards lives. There, too, his candidacy is bound to have wider effects, helping Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of staff, who is hoping to keep Mr. Edwards's seat for the Democrats. 
 The Kerry-Edwards combination could put Louisiana in play, as well. Mr. Kerry's religious background will help him in the heavily Catholic southern half of the state, while Mr. Edwards will appeal to voters in the north, where the culture reflects more of the deep South. Mr. Edwards should also complement the ticket in northern Florida, where his economic message and Southern identity will resonate with the many transplants from adjoining Alabama and Georgia. (Mr. Kerry, on the other hand, should do well with Florida's retirees and Jewish voters.)
 In Tennessee, with the presence of a popular Democratic governor and a twinge of remorse about the loss of Tennessean Al Gore in 2000, the selection of Mr. Edwards means that Mr. Bush can't count on the state. Same for Virginia, which elected a Democrat, Mark Warner, governor in 2001, and Arkansas, which has five Democrats among its six members of Congress. 
 There are limits to all this, of course. Mr. Edwards is unlikely to make much difference in Georgia, where Democrats are in disarray and Republicans are almost certain to win the seat being vacated by Senator Zell Miller, whose party allegiance has switched in all but name only. Alabama, Mississippi and Texas all remain beyond Democratic reach, too.
 This is not to say that Mr. Bush might not face further complications down the road. A few days ago, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, criticized the Bush campaign, saying he was ''appalled'' at its effort to use church rosters to reach voters. ''The bottom line is, when a church does it, it's nonpartisan and appropriate,'' he said. ''When a campaign does it, it's partisan and inappropriate.''
 If Mr. Edwards can play on these growing tensions and begin to assure Southern voters that the Democrats can be trusted, he just might turn a few red states to blue.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Edwards's State, Declares His Confidence In Carrying It Once More

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., July 7 

 BODY:
President Bush's trip here Wednesday to the home state of Senator John Edwards was planned weeks ago, well before Mr. Edwards was chosen by Senator John Kerry to join the Democratic ticket.
 But finding himself on the turf of a new rival, Mr. Bush wasted little time in cheerfully tearing into his opponents and declaring that he was confident he would carry North Carolina just as he did four years ago. 
 While some analysts said Mr. Kerry's selection of Mr. Edwards might force the president to campaign more aggressively here than he had planned, he said he had no worries. 
 Unprompted by a direct question on the issue, he told reporters: ''I did well here in 2000 because the North Carolinian voter understood we shared values. I'm going to do well again in 2004.'' 
 ''The economy is strong here in North Carolina,'' Mr. Bush added. ''I also know that when they go to the polls to vote for president that they'll understand that the senator from Massachusetts doesn't share their values.''
 In the last presidential election, Mr. Bush trounced Vice President Al Gore in North Carolina, winning 56 percent of the vote to Mr. Gore's 43 percent. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried the state since Jimmy Carter in 1976. And a poll taken last month for The News & Observer of Raleigh and two broadcast stations showed Mr. Kerry trailing the president in North Carolina by 47 percent to 42.
 Mr. Bush came here Wednesday for a pair of political fund-raisers and to lay into Senate Democrats for what he portrayed as their obstructing several of his judicial nominees who are from the state. His next stop was a Republican fund-raiser in Michigan, another state where Democrats are blocking some of his nominees to the bench.
 The president said here that Senators Kerry and Edwards were typical of the Democrats who ''apparently don't want judges who strictly interpret and apply the law.''
 ''Evidently,'' he added, ''they want activist judges who will rewrite the law from the bench.''
 A spokesman for the Kerry campaign, Phil Singer, said:
 ''John Kerry and John Edwards are laying out their vision to make America stronger at home and more respected in the world, and the president is playing politics in stumping for judicial nominees who would roll back the freedoms that make America great.''
 Underlying the exchange was a nasty, three-year-old battle between Mr. Bush and Senate Democrats over judicial confirmations. 
 While the Democrats have allowed the overwhelming majority of Mr. Bush's nominees to be confirmed, they have complained that he is trying to pack the courts, especially at the appeals level, with conservative ideologues. They have taken the extraordinary step of blocking a handful of the nominees by filibuster.
 The issue of judicial nominations, at least at the levels below the Supreme Court, has never proved important in presidential elections. But it matters greatly to many in Mr. Bush's conservative base, and his comments Wednesday are certain to solidify his support there. 
 Mr. Bush complained that Mr. Edwards was personally responsible for holding up confirmation of two North Carolina nominees, one of them a candidate for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. He said this nominee, Terrence W. Boyle, now a federal district judge in Elizabeth City, N.C., and formerly an aide to Senator Jesse Helms, was highly qualified.
 The senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said Republicans were now trying to fill seats they had kept open by blocking nominees of Mr. Bush's predecessor, President Bill Clinton.
 ''During Republican control of the Senate, no nominee from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit was allowed to be confirmed during the entire Clinton administration,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''It is ironic that Republicans now claim that Judge Boyle must be confirmed because the seat is considered a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, when the North Carolina vacancies on the Fourth Circuit were considered judicial emergencies years ago when Republicans blocked Clinton nominee after Clinton nominee.''
 In Michigan, the tug of war is similar. With some Clinton nominees' having been blocked, the state's two senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, both Democrats, have held up several of Mr. Bush's nominations, including four to the federal appeals court in Cincinnati.
 Senator Stabenow said she and Mr. Levin had sought a compromise with the White House but had been rebuffed.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Seek to Mend Their Fractured Image

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
With drug prices skyrocketing, the pharmaceutical industry has long had plenty of critics. And in a measure of just how badly tarnished the industry's image has become, even some of its most prominent defenders are turning against it.
 That could spell trouble, which is why the drug industry is about to begin a charm offensive to try to win back the nation's affection.
 Roy Vagelos, the well-known former chairman of Merck & Company and one of the industry's most prominent boosters, now condemns drug makers for the ''exorbitant'' prices of new medicines and ''galloping'' annual increases of old ones. Government price controls, he predicts, are almost inevitable. 
 ''This industry delivered miracles, and now they're throwing it all away,'' Dr. Vagelos said. ''They just don't get it.''
 No industry has fallen as far or as fast in public esteem in recent years as the pharmaceutical industry, according to the Harris Poll. 
 Acknowledging its dismal public standing, Pfizer, the nation's largest drug company, held a news conference on Wednesday to announce an effort to provide discounted drugs to the working poor and anyone without health insurance.
 It was the first of what is expected to be a blitz of similar announcements this summer from drug companies worried that their unpopularity could lead Congress to pass legislation that might legalize drug imports or allow government officials to bargain for discounts -- either of which could put a big dent in the industry's profits and investments.
 Pat Kelly, president of Pfizer's American drug division, said that he was painfully aware of polls showing that Americans view drug and cigarette makers similarly. ''We find it quite incredible,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''that we could be equated with an industry that kills people as opposed to cures them.'' 
 In a series of presentations, executives at Pfizer, which is based in New York, said yesterday that they were starting the discount program -- whose cost will not significantly affect the company's profits, they said -- because it was the right thing to do. The company played videotaped addresses from Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, both Democrats, applauding its efforts.
 Whether the new program and yesterday's fanfare will halt the slide in the company's standing with the public or slow legislation on Capitol Hill that the industry opposes is uncertain. Two years ago, Pfizer and most other major drug makers announced programs to provide free or nominally priced drugs to the poor.
 The clutter of disparate efforts led to confusion. The industry's poll numbers continued to decline.
 The main reason for the industry's unpopularity, pollsters say, is that Americans, increasingly aware that drugs are much cheaper elsewhere, are tired of digging ever deeper to pay for prescription medicine.
 The cost of the drugs needed to treat colon cancer, for instance, has soared to $250,000 from $500 for the regimen of 1999. Prices for the most commonly used branded drugs rose 28 percent from 2000 to 2003, nearly three times the rate of inflation, according to AARP.
 During that time, Bristol-Myers Squibb raised its prices for Plavix and Pravachol, popular heart medicines, by 35 percent. Prices this year are rising even faster, AARP found.
 Patients say they fear that they may soon face a stark choice -- their money or their lives.
 ''I see no silver lining to the dark cloud of the drug industry,'' said Gary Schmidgall, a 59-year-old English professor interviewed recently while he shopped in an Upper West Side supermarket.
 Robert Wittes, a former Bristol-Myers Squibb researcher who is now physician in chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said that the industry's skyrocketing prices ''invite government price controls'' and leave needy patients stranded.
 ''They are daring the politicians to act, daring the payers to act,'' Dr. Wittes said. ''They are making life very difficult for patients and institutions who want to act responsibly.'' 
 The industry had expected critics to be mollified by last year's passage of the Medicare drug bill, which provides for tens of billions of dollars from the government to pay drug costs for the elderly who are not poor. That has not happened.
 So executives undertook what some hoped would be an extreme makeover. A committee of top executives chaired by Karen Katen, president of Pfizer's pharmaceutical group, are meeting regularly to discuss how to improve the industry's image.
 The committee is focused on ''improving access and affordability of drugs,'' Ms. Katen said. She said they would soon announce the conclusions and declined to discuss it further. But a participant said to expect initiatives similar to Pfizer's, aimed at providing drugs for the uninsured and increasing awareness of the industry's free drug programs.
 If yesterday is any guide, the reception for the efforts will be mixed.
 Within hours of Pfizer's announcement, the Medicare Rights Center released a statement saying Pfizer's program ''will help only a small fraction of those in need.''
 The pharmaceutical industry earns nearly two-thirds of its profits in the United States since drug prices in the rest of the industrialized world are largely government controlled. Those profits rely almost entirely on laws that protect the industry from cheap imports, delay home-grown knockoffs, give away government medical discoveries, allow steep tax breaks for research expenditures and forbid government officials from demanding discounts while requiring them to buy certain drugs. 
 But Congress, prodded by unhappy constituents, is becoming restive. To begin with, proposals to legalize drug imports and to allow government health officials to negotiate discounts are proliferating.
 In the past, lawmakers, typically from the Republican Party, led the effort to protect the industry from such proposals. But now, some conservative Republicans are among the most vocal backers of the bills.
 Representative Gil Gutknecht, a conservative Republican from Minnesota, has called the drug industry greedy and has been pushing to legalize imports.
 ''The pharmaceutical companies are living in a fool's paradise,'' Mr. Gutknecht said recently. ''They cannot continue to expect to enjoy free market pricing in what is, in reality, a captive market.''
 While nothing is expected to emerge from Congress anytime soon, executives say that they have reason to worry.
 To forestall government intervention, said Raymond V. Gilmartin, Dr. Vagelos's successor as Merck's chief executive, the industry must do more to prove the value of its medicines. ''We also have to become more efficient,'' he said, ''and drive down our cost structure.'' 
 The industry's growing unpopularity has caught many executives off guard.
 Most say they see themselves as dedicated to the public good and committed to finding cures, an image increasingly at odds with those held by the rest of the country. 
 John Landis, senior vice president for pharmaceutical sciences at Schering-Plough, said he attended a cocktail party at a college last year that was filled with scientists.
 ''You would think that a party with scientists and their wives would be a friendly, safe gathering,'' Dr. Landis said. ''But the conversation quickly got around to why the costs of medicine are so high, why does the drug industry spend so much on marketing and why is there greater access to medicines outside of the United States.''
 Dr. Landis explained that drugs were difficult to discover and expensive to research. His audience was not convinced. ''I finally had to say, 'Soooo, how about that football game?''' 
 The share of Harris Poll respondents who say they have a positive attitude about the pharmaceutical industry has fallen 35 points since 1997, more than for any other industry. Drug makers now share the bottom of the rankings with oil, managed care and tobacco companies. 
 Just 13 percent of poll respondents described pharmaceutical companies as ''generally honest and trustworthy.'' Some 57 percent said that drug prices are ''unreasonably high'' and an equal share said that the drug industry should be more regulated by the federal government, even though 7 percent said that they found it ''very difficult'' to pay for drugs. 
 Marcia Donen, who lives on the Upper East Side, said that the price of her 16-year-old daughter's asthma inhaler went from $80.59 in December 2002, to $177.99 last June, to $203.99 a few days ago. The inhaler, called Maxair, is made by 3M.
 ''I couldn't believe it,'' Ms. Donen said. ''You need this to live. This is why people are going to Canada for drugs.''
 John Cornwell, a spokesman for 3M, said that the company increased Maxair's price by almost 10 percent in each of the last three years, because the increases ''were important in order for 3M to continue to make this product.'' 
 Pharmacies or wholesalers may have accounted for any increases beyond that, Mr. Cornwell said.
 Stories of large price increases tend to crystallize negative sentiment against the industry. When Abbott Laboratories decided late last year to quintuple the price of its H.I.V. drug, Norvir, AIDS activists mobilized. 
 The price increase led to a hearing by the National Institutes of Health on whether to allow generic versions of the drug on the market years before its patent expires. 
 Erbitux, a cancer drug from Bristol-Myers and ImClone Systems, costs up to $30,240 a patient. Treatment with Avastin, another drug for cancer from Genentech, costs $46,640.
 Bristol-Myers and Genentech explained that the prices take into account costly research and manufacturing expenses. But Dr. Vagelos and Dr. Wittes said that the prices of the two medicines are inexcusable.
 In the short-term, most patients who need Erbitux or Avastin and are insured will be able to get them by paying relatively modest co-payments, said Joseph Raduazzo, medical director of pharmacy programs at Tufts Health Plan. 
 But as more such drugs are introduced, something is going to give, he said. ''We're going to have to find a way of rewarding the pharmaceutical companies for developing these drugs in a more rational way,'' Dr. Raduazzo said.
 But for now the industry remains so unpopular that Andrew Sandler, a cancer researcher for Berlex Laboratories, cannot persuade even his 68-year-old mother that drug prices are reasonable.
 ''I tell her that we need that money to invest in research,'' Dr. Sandler said of his frequent phone conversations. ''She listens, but I'm sure she's rolling her eyes.''

HEADLINE: Revived Focus on Anxiety Over Economic Conditions

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7 

 BODY:
In picking Senator John Edwards as his running mate, Senator John Kerry signaled that he would renew emphasis on economic anxieties and try to refute President Bush's assertion that good times have returned.
 Although Mr. Kerry's attack was blunted by a surge in job creation from March through May, his theme of a ''middle-class squeeze'' and Mr. Edwards's theme of ''two Americas'' may resonate with underlying economic conditions. 
 Unemployment, the gravest single threat to Mr. Bush's re-election prospects, has been declining for the last several months, and the nation has added 1.3 million jobs since January. 
 Other indicators suggest that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards have ample opportunities to tap into popular discouragement and insecurity.
 Adjusted for inflation, hourly wages have slightly declined in the last year, and corporate profits have surged. Job creation, which slowed markedly last month, has been more anemic than in any previous recovery, a phenomenon that economists said may well reflect a permanent change in the operation of the economy. Of the 2.7 million manufacturing jobs that have disappeared since 2001, about 100,000 have been recovered. The dislocation in many industrial states, including crucial swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, remains high, even as manufacturers ramp up production. The median length of unemployment last month was 10.8 weeks, higher than at any time in the ''jobless recovery'' of the early 90's.
 A particularly ominous indicator for Mr. Bush is the apparently high number of people who have stopped looking for work and dropped out of the labor force. The level of workforce participation peaked at 64.4 percent in April 2000, in the waning months of the economic boom, and plunged to 62 percent when the recession took hold in 2001.
 In sharp contrast to most other recoveries, when workers surged back to the job market, participation has barely increased, at 62.3 percent. That translates to 2.2 million people who have essentially dropped out of the force.
 ''People are feeling squeezed, not because they are confused or because they haven't read the business section of the newspaper enough,'' said Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to Mr. Kerry. ''They are feeling squeezed because their real wages are down, because many have relatives who are out of the labor force and because they have spiraling costs for health care and tuition.''
 Bush campaign officials adamantly dispute that portrait, noting that economic growth has been strong since last summer, that the nation has added 1.5 million jobs since last August and that most forecasters expect strong growth for at least the rest of this year.
 R. Glenn Hubbard, a former top economic adviser to President Bush who is an adviser to his campaign, said the job market had been slow to recover in part because employment peaked at unusually high levels in the heat of the stock market boom. The stage, Mr. Hubbard said, was set for sustained growth.
 ''If you look at the productivity, that's what drives real wage growth in the long term, and that has just been extraordinary,'' he said, repeating the administration's assertion that the economy has weathered a recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals and the conflict in Iraq. ''It's really quite amazing how well the economy has recovered.'' 
 But even if Mr. Kerry does tap into a vein of widespread underlying anxiety, he still has to convince voters that his policies will make a difference. 
 That could prove difficult. For all their frustration, many voters know that the ups and downs of an economy are at most indirectly related to what a president does in office. 
 ''We're involved with what looks like a textbook cyclical upturn in the United States economy and in the global economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economic strategist at Decision Economics, an economic forecasting firm in New York. ''What is different is the nature of how the U.S. creates jobs. The jobs machine doesn't create as many jobs as before, but it has certainly created a lot more jobs at a relatively low unemployment rate than it did in past economic cycles.''
 Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards are trying to broaden the debate beyond the absolute number of jobs. 
 In discussing a ''middle-class squeeze,'' Mr. Kerry has tried to highlight the pressures caused by sharp increases in heath costs and college tuition, as well as rising debt levels nationally.
 Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards have drawn on the arguments of Elizabeth Warren, a professor at the Harvard Law School and the author of ''Two-Income Trap,'' who argues that two-income families are in many ways more impoverished than the single-income families of the 50's and 60's. 
 ''The middle class has undergone a powerful transformation in the last generation,'' Professor Warren said in an interview. ''And the slide in the last three and a half years has been staggering. 
 ''Housing prices are up 17.8 percent in the last three and a half years. Health insurance is up more than 40 percent. College tuition is up 26 percent. Child care is up 18 percent.''
 Mr. Kerry has made ''middle class squeeze'' a focal point of his campaign for more than a month.
 Mr. Edwards articulated economic anxieties in the primaries. As a senator from North Carolina, which suffered acute job losses in textile and furniture industries, he generated enormous support with his stump speech about ''two Americas,'' one rich and one poor. 
 Not coincidentally, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry began their barnstorming tour on Wednesday in Cleveland, a city that has lost tens of thousands of jobs in the last few years, and they will campaign on Friday in hard-hit West Virginia.
 Bush administration officials and the Bush-Cheney campaign have been barnstorming with their campaign of optimism. Mr. Bush and top officials led by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans have been crisscrossing the country to talk about the economy's sharp improvement since last summer.
 Through much of June, the campaign ran a 30-second advertisement that attacked Mr. Kerry for what it called his ''pessimism.''
 ''After recession, 9/11 and war, now our economy has been growing for 10 straight months,'' a voice in the advertisement declares. ''John Kerry's response? He's talking about the Great Depression. One thing's sure pessimism never created a job.''
 Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal group in Washington, said Mr. Bush could not be faulted for all the job losses but had left himself vulnerable to criticism. 
 ''Bush had an ambitious economic agenda in terms of his tax cuts,'' Mr. Baker said. ''You can't blame all the problems on tax cuts. But you can say it was not the correct medicine.''

HEADLINE: New Team Blends Messages for a United Vision

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, July 7 

 BODY:
The Democratic ticket of two senators named John skipped across this swing state on Wednesday, with the presidential contender openly embracing his running mate's message about the economic squeeze on the middle class and reveling in the two young children he brings to their collective family portrait.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and his vice-presidential pick, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, borrowed phrases from each other's stump speeches to heap praise on each other as they promised to help hard-pressed Americans and promote the values of ''faith, family, opportunity and responsibility.'' 
 They and their wives, Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards, hugged and held hands, whispered stage directions and squeezed shoulders, thrust fists and upped thumbs, experimenting with the choreography of a suddenly shared spotlight. Mr. Kerry's adult daughters and stepsons coddled Mr. Edwards's 6- and 4-year-old blond children for the cameras. 
 And, under a huge banner boasting ''A New Team for a New America,'' the two former rivals tried out some new lines, serious and not, before the newly apt anthem, ''Johnny B. Goode'' blared across a drizzly Cleveland park overlooking Lake Erie. ''We've got better vision, we've got better ideas, we've got real plans, we've got a better sense of what's happening to America -- and we've got better hair,'' said Mr. Kerry, his party's presumed presidential nominee, reaching back to muss Mr. Edwards's coif, only to have his hand playfully swatted back. Describing himself and his partner as ''a dream ticket,'' Mr. Kerry noted that in 1879 Cleveland was the first city to get electric street lights, and said, ''Today you are the first city in America to get a different kind of electricity -- called John Edwards.''
 By the rally's end, Mr. Kerry was sounding themes somewhat reminiscent of Mr. Edwards's paean in the primaries to those ''living from paycheck to paycheck.'' 
 ''John and I are fighting together now to restore truth to the discussion between Americans, to restore hope to families who are struggling to make ends meet,'' Mr. Kerry said.
 Mr. Edwards, 51, whose boyish good looks and Southern-accented charm threaten to overshadow his staid running mate, gave a slightly shorter speech than Mr. Kerry, who is 60, devoting nearly every sentence to the top man on the ticket and invoking his own up-from-bootstraps success story only to argue Mr. Kerry's case.
 ''What this campaign and this election is about, at its core, is to make sure every single American gets exactly the same chance, the same opportunities, that I had and to build one America that works for everybody,'' Mr. Edwards said, reprising the upbeat themes than won him plaudits during the primaries. ''The real reason that John Kerry and I are here together is that we share the same values. I'm talking about the values that I grew up with in that small town in North Carolina -- faith, family, opportunity, responsibility, trying to make sure that everybody gets a chance to do what they're capable of doing.''
 While the candidates embarked on a four-day, two-family trip across five states considered crucial in November's election, the campaign unveiled seven new advertisements, expanding its television time into Mr. Edwards's Republican-leaning home state. The $18 million blitz in 18 states is set to run through July 22. 
 President Bush wasted no time welcoming Mr. Edwards into the race, visiting his hometown, Raleigh, for a previously scheduled event blaming Democrats for blocking his judicial nominees. Asked what differentiates Mr. Edwards from Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush declared flatly, ''Dick Cheney could be president. Next?''
 In a twist on the typical role of the vice-presidential nominee as defender in chief, Mr. Kerry quickly seized on the comment, upon arriving here for the second rally of the day.
 ''He thought it was important enough for the president of the United States to attack the not-yet-even-fully-nominated-vice-president-to-be-of-the-United States,'' Mr. Kerry said of Mr. Bush, as the crowd of several thousand erupted in boos and hisses. ''Let me tell you something, he was right and he was wrong.''
 ''He was wrong in suggesting John Edwards, who has more experience than George Bush and better judgment than he did when he became president,'' Mr. Kerry added, failing to finish the thought. ''But I'll tell you what he was right about. He was right that Dick Cheney was ready to take over on Day 1, and he did, and he has been ever since, and that's what we've got to change, folks.''
 Republicans seized on voting record ratings by the left-leaning Americans for Democratic Action to declare the Kerry-Edwards ticket more liberal than the 1984 nominees, Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro, and circulated quotations by the liberal stalwart Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts saying he ''couldn't be happier'' with the choice.
 ''John Kerry's choice of John Edwards as his running mate cements their position as the most out of the mainstream ticket in the history of the Democrat Party,'' Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's re-election team, said in a statement. ''The most liberal senator and the fourth most liberal senator are out of step on the kitchen-table issues that matter to Americans.''
 Mr. Bush's campaign is also planning to begin a renewed advertising drive starting Friday. It will include North Carolina.
 For the Democrats, Wednesday was the first day of the rest of their campaign, part of a meticulously planned media rollout of the vice-presidential pick they hope to extend at least through the two men's Sunday evening appearance on the CBS program ''60 Minutes.'' 
 The day began with a carefully stage-managed family photo session at Mrs. Kerry's 88-acre farm in Fox Chapel, Penn., the large main house shielded from view, where Mr. Kerry joked that 4-year-old Jack Edwards, looking like an American flag in blue shorts and a red and white striped jersey, was taking over as campaign manager.
 Mr. Kerry told and retold the tale of how Jack rushed to the pool within five minutes of arriving at the farm and did a fierce cannonball jump into the water. And how after 6-year-old Emma Claire Edwards told her mother the good news by telephone on Tuesday morning that Mr. Edwards had been tapped, Jack hopped on the line to say, ''Mommy, mommy, I can swim with my head out of the water.''
 On the tarmac in Pittsburgh, Mr. Kerry squatted low and ran toward Jack with his arms out. Jack, unsurprisingly, ran past the presidential candidate into his father's arms.
 He and Emma Claire, with pink and blue backpacks strapped on their shoulders, held Mr. Edwards's hands as he worked the receiving line of veterans' meeting the plane in Cleveland. Mr. Kerry's daughter Vanessa, 27, knelt low to chat privately with Emma Claire, while Mr. Kerry's stepson Andre Heinz, 34, cradled Jack in his arms for much of the Cleveland rally.
 ''Thank all of you for being here for this celebration, our first public celebration of families together for America,'' Mrs. Heinz Kerry told the crowd, like a proud matriarch. Mrs. Edwards, spoke warmly of their overnight visit to the farm, saying, ''It's obvious to me we are forming a bond that will create a team that with your help can change this country.''
 The youngsters, along with Chris Heinz, 31, and Cate Edwards, 22, left the trail after the first rally, leaving Andre, Vanessa, and 30-year-old Alexandra Kerry to wave and smile.
 At the two outdoor rallies here in the state many believe will decide the election, the Democrats sprayed red, white and blue confetti over the large crowds as their two standard-bearers began to meld their messages. 
 They were scheduled to wrap up the day with a late-night fete in Tampa, Fla., heading for a fund-raising concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York on Thursday.
 Once again, Mr. Edwards used lines made familiar from the primaries, saying, ''This is personal,'' but this time, he was talking about Mr. Kerry's commitment to soldiers and veterans, not his own experience with racism. This time it was Mr. Kerry describing how Mr. Edwards grew up watching his father go to work in a mill. And it was Mr. Edwards talking about restoring America's respect around the world, mentioning the men Mr. Kerry served with 30 years ago in Vietnam.
 ''The American people are going to reject the tired, old, hateful, negative politics of the past -- they are going to embrace the politics of hope, the politics of what's possible, because this is America, where everything's possible,'' Mr. Edwards told the crowd in Cleveland. ''That's what John Kerry means for this country.'' Here at Dayton's downtown Riverside Park, with soaring water fountains exploding behind them, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards spent several minutes strolling the stage side by side to the tune ''Simply the Best.'' They wore similar Navy blue suits with contrasting shirts and ties, and, upon arriving at the airport here Wednesday evening, they had shed their suit jackets for the line of handshakes. They do, indeed, have strikingly thick heads of hair, but Mr. Edwards, whose wavy locks were so commented upon that his aides handed out tiny bottles of Breck shampoo when his presidential bid began, has a top of chocolate brown, while Mr. Kerry's helmet is decidedly salt and pepper.
 As his plane departed Dayton, Mr. Kerry told reporters traveling with him that his wife had been ribbing him all day about the hair joke. ''You just lost the bald vote,'' Mr. Kerry quoted her as saying.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Kerry Chooses Edwards, Citing Former Rival's Political Skill'' (front page, July 7):
 I welcome the selection of John Edwards as John Kerry's running mate. To me, his choice is not so much about charisma or geographical balance, as important as those are, but that Mr. Edwards brings into focus an important and historical dimension in American politics that has been missing in recent years. 
 John Edwards will highlight his progressive populism against the privileged plutocracy that is the heart of the Bush administration and that has been central to the Republican Party. 
 This is the most important presidential election in the 40 years that I've been voting. We have reached a major tipping point in both our domestic and foreign affairs where an economic elite has arrogated total political power to and for itself, and it is critical that the public has a clear philosophical choice in our governance in November. 
 John Edwards will not only make that choice available, but he will also be able to communicate it effectively to all the voters who listen.

HEADLINE: Loans and Income Rise; Jobless Claims Fall

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer borrowing rose for a sixth consecutive month in May, as personal incomes increased and shoppers bought new cars at the fastest pace since December, a Federal Reserve report indicated yesterday. 
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell last week to 310,000, the lowest level since October 2000. But it also said that the total might be too low because fewer auto factories than predicted shut down to retool. 
 The four-week moving average of claims, which tends to smooth out weekly fluctuations, fell to 336,000, the lowest since May 22. Economists said they expected continued job growth.
 According to the Fed's report, nonmortgage debt rose in May by $8.2 billion, or 4.9 percent at an annual pace. In April, borrowing rose by a revised $5.3 billion, or 3.1 percent annually. Consumer credit in May had been forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists to increase $7.5 billion.
 Total consumer debt was $2.03 trillion in May, the Fed reported.
 ''The trend in borrowing has remained stronger than expected,'' said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. Borrowing from banks and credit cards increased in part because consumers knew that home-equity loan rates would be rising, he said.
 Consumer spending increased 1 percent in May, the most since October 2001, the Commerce Department said last month. But yesterday, some retailers including Wal-Mart reported disappointing sales for June, raising doubts about whether the pace of spending would continue. 
 For May, nonrevolving debt -- which includes borrowing for purposes like car purchases and college costs -- increased $6.6 billion after rising $8.4 billion in April. Revolving credit, which includes credit cards, rose $1.6 billion in May after falling $3.1 billion in April.
 Light-vehicle sales in the United States increased to an annual pace of 17.8 million in May from 16.4 million in April.
 Credit card debt written off as uncollectible rose in May to an annualized 7 percent of receivables backed by securities from 6.8 percent in April, according to Standard & Poor's.
 Balances on loans with payments 30 days or more past due fell to 4.4 percent of receivables from 4.5 percent.

At either end of New York's vast economic spectrum, there are few surprises: surgeons, chief executives and stockbrokers make piles of money; burger-flippers, home health care aides and supermarket cashiers make a pittance. 
 But a study released yesterday by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics detailing the average salaries of New Yorkers, from the Park Avenue plastic surgeon to the nanny who watches her children, finds plenty of surprises in the great gulf between the guy who wears the Savile Row suit and the man who presses it. In the vast majority of jobs between the richest and poorest, the study yields some fascinating insights into New Yorkers' passions, priorities and foibles.
 Professions that attend to New Yorkers' vanity and seemingly endless desire for pampering, for example, do relatively well. Fitness trainers and aerobic instructors make $50,170 a year toning abs and firming buns, nearly $20,000 more than preschool teachers, who make $31,750. Massage therapists do better still, raking in $58,260. New Yorkers love their teeth: dental hygienists make $64,320 a year, according to the study, doing almost as well as registered nurses, who make almost $2,000 more a year. 
 But appealing to vanity does not always mean a fat paycheck. Manicurists and pedicurists are fifth from the bottom of the list, making just $16,640, or $8 an hour. Your hairstylist probably needs your tip -- the mean salary is $22,680 -- but the person who shampoos your hair needs it even more, making just $16,370 a year. Better leave hair alone and specialize in skin. ''Skin care specialists,'' not including dermatologists, make $35,880. 
 Using data collected twice a year by state and federal agencies, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the hourly and annual wages in 22 occupational groups and 770 jobs, collecting information for the entire country as well as individual metropolitan areas.
 The study, which covers New York City as well as Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, found that the New York area had an average hourly wage of $23.10, 32 percent higher than the national average. People doing almost any job made more money doing it in New York than they would anywhere else, the study found, with the exception of production jobs, including many kinds of factory workers. 
 Predictably, management and legal professions are in the top tier, the study says. Surgeons are the region's highest earners, with a mean annual wage of $186,350. Chief executives, stockbrokers and internists also made the top five.
 In last place are fast-food cooks, who make $14,700 a year. Not too far ahead are service station attendants ($16,020), cashiers ($17,180) and home health aides: there are more than 55,000 of them in the New York City region, and they pocket just $18,650 a year.
 New Yorkers are obsessed with real estate, and the list reflects that. The broker who sold that charming prewar apartment makes $90,880 a year, and the construction manager who updated its not-so-charming avocado-and-mustard kitchen with a Sub-Zero fridge and Viking range took home $71,230 a year. 
 New York is filled with fine restaurants and people who love to eat, but food service ranks dead last in average wages. Chefs make $42,080, below the city average pay of $48,050, while bartenders make do with a bit more than $10 an hour, and waiters and waitresses, $11. 
 Of course, a bartender who has seen one too many drunks across the bar could become a substance abuse counselor, and double her salary to $41,170. But a career in public service would be much less remunerative than the one that preoccupies much of the food-service industry in New York: show business. Actors lucky enough to work full time, for example, take in an average of $57,190.
 New York likes to think of itself as the news media capital of the world, and news media jobs pay a little better than the average New York job. Reporters and correspondents do pretty well, taking in $60,500, while somehow their editors make a bit less, $58,720. Writers and authors do even worse, making $53,620. 
 New Yorkers also love to shop. There are 104,000 retail sales clerks in the city, but they make just $23,000 a year, according to the study. 
 New Yorkers may love their children enough to buy them $700 Bugaboo Frog strollers, but they are stingy when it comes to the baby sitters. They make just $22,030, less than half the average wage. 
 But why change diapers when you can scrub toilets? Given the choice, the toilets offer more bang for the buck. Maids make $14.03 an hour, while child care workers scrape by on $10.59 an hour, the study found. 
 Butchers do ever so slightly better than bakers (the survey does not include an entry for candlestick makers). The region's 430 cobblers make just $21,590, but they do better than the 18,050 sewing machine operators, who make $17,940. Apparently it pays more to fix watches ($43,990) than to install locks ($34,940). 
 The survey, which mainly culls data collected last year, offers fewer details about high-wage jobs than about low-wage ones because employers surveyed were asked to classify workers in 12 intervals from the lowest, $6.75 an hour, to the highest, which includes anybody who makes $70 an hour and up. And the report does not include the self-employed, or partners in unincorporated firms.
 Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner in the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the study's author, said the findings reflect the diversity of the city's work force. 
 ''What it shows me is the tremendous range of different jobs in New York City,'' Mr. Dolfman said. ''In New York, everyone thinks of finance and things like that. But people make respectable livings in a lot of areas you might not think of.''

HEADLINE: Lawn Mowers vs. the Gas Pump

BYLINE: By LISA KALIS

 BODY:
IN June, Barbara Moss noticed a new item on her monthly $260 lawn-care bill: a $6 gas surcharge. She has used the same service for 14 years and does not remember its ever raising rates, so the charge caught her eye. ''When you see something like that, you know gas prices are affecting everyone,'' said Ms. Moss, an interior designer from Katonah, N.Y. 
 This summer, the former sanctuary known as the yard has become an economic indicator. With the season's first bills coming due, homeowners -- especially weekenders, who are less likely to tackle the chores themselves -- are discovering that they're paying more for everything from getting the pool cleaned to getting groceries delivered, and, especially, for getting their lawns mowed, since lawn-care companies rely on gas for most of the equipment they use. And while the surcharges are fairly small, they're still an annoying intrusion of the real world into homeowners' summertime idyll. 
 Of course, the lawn services' assorted whackers and trimmers eat up fuel -- some even require higher octane gasoline. But, it turns out, the equipment isn't the biggest problem. ''Our machines hold 12 gallons of gas, and can mow over eight hours,'' said Ken Raney, a manager at Hustler Turf Equipment in Hesston, Kan. For the average residential lawn, ''that's not a whole lot of extra cost,'' he said. ''We're just talking a few pennies.'' 
 The real problem: the trucks used to haul everything around. Lawn companies generally need heavy-duty trucks of the 10-miles-per-gallon variety, able to pull trailers and hold hundreds of pounds of tools. Don Burton, president of the New York State Lawn Care Association, estimates that fuel amounts to 4.8 percent to 6.9 percent of business costs for lawn-care companies. 
 Jim Lewis, owner of Lewis Landscape Services in Tigard, Ore., says he is thinking about buying some new trucks. He currently spends $200 a day on gas for his 170 residential customers -- almost $7 more per customer each month than last year. In the next few weeks, he said, he plans to raise his rates by $10 a month, the first uptick in two years. ''The problem with a fuel surcharge is if I knock everyone up, then later knock them down, it's probably time to increase prices anyway,'' he said. 
 Bigger companies can often handle the increase more easily, but it still has an impact. Cagwin & Dorward, a landscaper in Novato, Calif., with 12 offices and 200 trucks, hasn't added a surcharge yet. But the company is buying 30 new trucks this year, and with gas still hovering around $2 a gallon for regular, ''fuel economy becomes the main criteria,'' said Wayne Richards, the company's chief operating officer. 
 Lawn equipment has become more fuel efficient over the years, which has some companies shopping. Envirogreen Lawn Care in Fort Collins, Colo., plans to spend $14,000 next year for a new Walker mower that uses less gas. In the meantime, the company just started a $2-per-mow surcharge and has given up some customers who live too far away.
 One manufacturer, Bad Boy Mowers in Batesville, Ark., will introduce a commercial diesel mower next year. ''Usually lawn-care services go to diesel if they're too concerned over gas,'' said Phil Pulley, who owns Bad Boy. ''Diesel is considerably cheaper.'' It's currently about $1.77 a gallon -- and, if the fuel is being used for lawn equipment, buyers can avoid almost 25 cents a gallon in federal taxes or apply for refunds. (Smaller refunds are also available when gasoline is used for machines other than vehicles.)
 Deere & Company in Moline, Ill., even makes a hybrid electric-gas mower. But don't expect the Prius of mowers at the local garden center anytime soon; its real advantages are how cleanly and quietly it runs, and at $26,000 to $30,000 is is marketed just for golf courses. For other types of lawns, ''we have some prototypes, but it's not something we're moving fast on,'' said Ken Golden, a Deere spokesman.
 Most mowers sold in the United States run on gasoline, but some shops are seeing a change. At Lexington Ace Hardware in Lexington, Mass., sales of electric mowers went from about 5 percent last year to 15 percent this year. It sells about 14 lawnmowers a week. Gas prices are ''making a difference,'' said Barbara Geary, a saleswoman at the store. ''Normally, people won't buy electric because it costs a lot to run.'' The shop's models, all quieter and cleaner than gas, are $160 to $200, less expensive than many gasoline mowers.
 The surcharges have some lawn-service customers fed up. Bob Andrews, owner of the Greenskeeper in Indianapolis, spends about $200 a day on gasoline and recently started billing an extra 50 cents per mow. Despite the small size of the jump, one customer complained and another canceled service entirely. ''He thought higher costs were something a business should absorb,'' Mr. Andrews said. ''I can tell you one thing, he's never owned a business.'' 
OTHERS aren't sure they're being charged fairly. Leslie Shigaki, a New York lawyer, found a $5 surcharge on the June lawn bill for her weekend house in Clinton, N.Y., usually $100 a month for two visits. She's not opposed to the idea. But the mower lives a mile away, and her lawn is less than an acre. She estimated the charge would cover the increase for five gallons of gas. ''I don't believe he uses five gallons of gas to get to my house and mow the lawn,'' she said. ''I think he just picked a number and stuck it on.'' She wrote him a note asking him to ''be a little realistic,'' but hasn't heard back yet. 
 For each of his accounts, Scott Edwards of SHM Landscape Contractors in Norwalk, Conn., calculated the gallons used in travel time and service. Two months ago, he added a fee for the increased cost of gas -- $2 or $3 a week for each of his 56 customers. ''That adds up,'' he said. ''It's tough to raise prices. There's so much competition.'' 
 And though many services say they will remove the fee once prices go down, at least one customer has some doubts. ''The snowplow service did the same thing two years ago,'' Ms. Shigaki said. ''It never came off.''

HEADLINE: Mongolia's Shifting Ties: More China, Less Russia

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 8 

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, China's largest copper company signed a letter of intent to study investing in Mongolia's largest mining project. This week, Mongolia's president, on a state visit to Beijing, invited China to drill for oil. Next month, zinc production is to start at a new $50 million Chinese mine in eastern Mongolia.
 To link it all together, Chinese aid is paying for Chinese crews this summer to pave major roads across Mongolia's grassy steppes. More may come from a $300 million loan offered by China's president when he stopped here last year.
 Only 15 years ago, Mongolia, then a Soviet satellite, kept its land borders with China largely closed. Today, in a turnaround that reflects the rapid reorientation of the 13 other countries that have land borders with China, Mongolia now values China as its largest foreign investor and largest trading partner. 
 ''We are opening permanent border posts here, here and here,'' Wong Fu Kang, charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy here, said Tuesday tapping his forefinger on crossing points along his country's long border with Mongolia.
 At Mongolia's western end, he traced the path of a proposed road to connect Western China with the Russian city of Novosibirsk. In central Mongolia, there is a railroad project that will link copper and coal mines. In Eastern Mongolia, China has proposed building a bridge. To J. Peter Morrow, chief executive of the private Agricultural Bank of Mongolia here and Mongolia's most prominent American businessman, the Chinese ''are pushing on all fronts: a road here, a bridge here, a coal mine here.''
 Many Mongolians share that uneasiness about the potential threat from a neighbor with a population more than 520 times that of the 2.5 million in Mongolia. Last month, in a poll of 2,170 adults, the Sant Maral polling group asked people to choose two countries that could be considered best partners for Mongolia. Russia came in first, receiving twice as many votes as the United States, which came in second. China came in fourth, after Japan.
 To improve its image, China sent $7 million for a new lighting system for this capital's showcase Sukhbaatar Square, named after a nationalist who, in 1921, declared Mongolia's independence, ending more than two centuries of Chinese colonial rule. In April, the Chinese government sponsored Chinese Cultural Days, a celebration of Chinese music, art and circus talent that was suspended in the early 1960's because of Russian-Chinese tensions.
 Today, many Mongolians credit China's economic locomotive as the reason for Mongolia's economy expanding at an expected rate of 5.5 percent.
 ''We are very grateful that the Chinese economy is so active,'' Mongolia's prime minister, Nambaryn Enkhbayar, said. Noting that China is running short of coal, he said that a Chinese company planned to start mining coal in eastern Mongolia this year.
 Dozens of cranes puncture the summer sky here as Chinese construction crews build new apartment and office buildings, softening the old Soviet image of the city. Shedding 75 years of Russian economic domination in a decade, Mongolia is rapidly becoming China's Canada, a northern resource.
 ''This is my vision of this country: Mongolia as a Canada,'' Sedbazar Otgonbat, vice chairman of Mongolia's foreign investment and foreign trade agency, said in an interview. ''China and Mongolia must work hand in hand, as Canada and the U.S.A.''
 Historically marginalized by its landlocked location, Mongolia now finds that the rise of China is giving it a front-row seat for the biggest economic story in the world today.
 ''Some people say Mongolia's landlocked economy is a disadvantage; I say that, with China, it is an advantage,'' said D. Jargalsaikhan, chairman of the Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia, a state agency. ''What makes Mongolia unique is that it has China as a neighbor. The Chinese market is just like a black hole where everything disappears -- copper, iron, zinc.''
 With China the new point of reference, over 30 Chinese- language schools have opened here in recent years.
 ''China is the big brother, you cannot avoid China,'' said L. Sumati, director of the Sant Maral polling group. Trained in Moscow, Mr. Sumati now has his two children, both in their 20's, studying in Beijing.
 Last March, 400 Mongolian students competed for 10 scholarships offered by Beijing to study in China.
 ''A decade ago, if you wanted to study Chinese, you would have had to go Moscow,'' Mr. Wong, the Chinese diplomat, said. ''More and more Mongolians are studying Chinese. Before, Russian was the dominant foreign language here.''
 With Russian visas rules strict, many Mongolians and foreigners based here say they have stopped traveling north.
 ''This bureaucracy, this old-time thinking is strangling our economic relations with Russia,'' said Ganbold, a local journalist.
 As China pours money into developing its own western regions, Mongolia suddenly finds that modern cities and highways are taking shape only a few hundred miles away.
 ''The Chinese government is adopting big plans to develop the West,'' Mr. Wong said. ''This will be beneficial to Mongolia.''
 With most Mongolians allowed to visit China without visas, a snowbird phenomenon has evolved, with about 400,000 Mongolians visiting China last year, compared with 182,000 Chinese who visited here. 
 But many of the Chinese who came were investors. According to the Chinese Embassy, there are 1,100 Chinese companies in Mongolia.
 ''We probably have 100 Chinese restaurants now,'' said Stephen D. Vance, executive director of Mongolians for Open Society, a group that received donations from the Soros Foundation. ''The textile industry is pretty much 50 percent Chinese. The leather industry is dominated by Chinese. Cashmere is more than owned by Chinese.''
 To some the Chinese economic draw can be destructive.
 ''Mongolia used to have four million deer; there are almost none now,'' said Mr. Otgonbat, the vice chairman of the Mongolian government's foreign investment and foreign trade agency. ''Why? The Chinese buy deer antlers. By shooting them one by one, the whole population has been killed.''
 But mining is the big economic attraction for China.
 ''Every day I meet a new Chinese company,'' said Mr. Jargalsaikhan, the chairman of Mineral Resources Authority, an investment office.
 Oyun Sanjaasuren, an opposition congresswoman, said of her old constituency in northeast Mongolia, ''In my constituency, I saw last spring Chinese companies driving around northeast Mongolia looking at a lead mine, a zinc mine, a uranium mine and a low-quality coal mine.''
 This week, the big news was that Jiangxi Copper signed a preliminary agreement to study buying a major share in development of Oyu Tolgoi, or Turquoise Hill, one of the three largest copper and gold deposits in the world. Ivanhoe Mines, the owner of the mine, in the Gobi, is preparing to start work within months on what could be a $1 billion mine.
 World copper prices are running about 60 percent higher than this time last year. China is the world's largest consumer of copper.
 However, one foreign businessman warned about the possibility of a nationalist backlash if a Chinese company wrests control of the huge mine. ''Everyone from the cabinet level to the herders would protest, out of fear of being consumed by China,'' he said.
 To diversify economic ties away from China, Otgonbayar Yondon, secretary of the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said that the government wanted to renegotiate free trade treaties with the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.
 Down in the Gobi desert recently, Buyantogtokh Delgerjav, a local governor, said that economic diversification was the best policy to follow. ''In Mongolia, we say we are a little piece of kidney squeezed between two pieces of fat,'' he said. ''We can't afford to have bad relations with China or Russia.''

HEADLINE: Sightseeing in Oman? You Mustn't Miss the Smugglers

BYLINE: By OTTO POHL

DATELINE: KHASAB, Oman 

 BODY:
The Iranians come at daybreak, buzzing across the green water in small boats packed with goats. They deliver their livestock to Omani traders, idle away the hot midday hours and, as darkness sets in, return to Iran, this time loaded with cigarettes, tea and clothing. 
 Aside from the starkly beautiful rocky fjords, tourist attractions are scarce on this remote tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Watching the Iranian smugglers come and go is about the best local travel operators can muster. 
 ''We do it as part of the city tour,'' said Abdul Khalique Ahmed, the managing director of Khasab Travel and Tours. ''People like to see the smugglers.''
 The boats speed across the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow shipping lane that connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and beyond. About 15 percent of the world's oil passes through this vitally strategic sea lane, closely guarded by the United States military. 
 But the goat and cigarette trade, running perpendicular to the oil tankers, is the only commerce the locals care about. It is said to represent over half of the economy here on the Musandam peninsula, a small outpost of Oman north of the United Arab Emirates. The trade is illegal in Iran but legal in Oman, which means that the Omani government collects taxes and grants de facto visas to the Iranians, as long as they do not stray far from the port or stay overnight. 
 The smuggling started after Iran closed its borders after the 1979 revolution, and exploded after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Trade grew further after completion of the first paved road from Khasab to the United Arab Emirates in 1997. 
 These days, however, traders like Abdullah Sadani, a 33-year-old Iranian, complain that reform in Iran is ruining business. An import deal that Iran signed with international cigarette companies in 2002 has decimated that trade, which was by far the largest and most lucrative. Between 50 and 80 boats currently make the crossing each day, perhaps a quarter of the number two years ago, merchants say. Mr. Sadani earns only a few dollars a day, while a large load of cigarettes could have made him up to $30 a few years ago. 
 Sitting in a cafe near the port, Mr. Sadani, grizzled by sun, cigarettes and several days of beard growth, explained that despite the lower pay, this was the only way he could support his wife and four children back in the Iranian port of Bandar-e Kong. 
 Over the years, he said, he has been robbed by pirates, shot at by the police and occasionally forced to dump his cargo overboard to avoid arrest. Once, when his outboard motor broke down, he drifted for five days without food or water amid the cargo ships, oil tankers and naval vessels that ply the Persian Gulf. 
 Problems with the Iranian authorities are solved in time-honored fashion. ''Baksheesh,'' Mr. Sadani said emphatically, using the Persian word for tip or bribe while making a circular motion with his hand over his head. 
 A translator interpreted the gesture. ''Baksheesh makes the world go round.'' 
 Like other traders, Mr. Sadani carries a cellphone with two SIM card phone chips, one for Iran and one for Oman. He switches chips halfway through the journey, so spotters on the Iranian side can easily reach him on his return trip to warn him of police activity. 
 Cigarettes are still smuggled to avoid the taxes the Iranians levy on the newly legal trade, but other products, including tea, clothing, soft drinks and even electronics, have gained importance. Goods worth $250,000 to $500,000 cross the strait each day, in the estimation of Munavvar Shuaib, a manager at Abdul Fatah Mohamad Noor Trading in the center of Khasab's small marketplace. At the height of trade, two or three years ago, volumes were up to five times that. 
 Even at that reduced level, it is an enormous amount of business to the roughly 30,000 Omanis who live in the region. And for young men like Hassan al-Kumzari, 22, smuggling is clearly the option of choice. Dressed in the traditional flowing white gown and white cap, he oversees a fleet of 10 trucks that shuttle his goats from the dusty port to Ras Al Khaimah, the northernmost city in the United Arab Emirates, and then returns with goods destined for Iran. 
 He used to help his father, a fisherman, until he learned about the traders in the port of Khasab. He says his father is proud of his new line of work. 
 ''My son is doing something better than just smelling of fish,'' Mr. Kumzari said, summarizing his father's reasoning. 
 He buys about 300 goats a day, paying 10 Omani rials, about $26, for each one, and reselling them at a 50 percent markup in the United Arab Emirates. He then ships back whatever his business partners in Iran need that afternoon. He estimates that for a good month he can clear as much as $10,000.
 Mr. Kumzari said he still longed for the stability of a government job, but they were not hiring. As he described his workday, which consists largely of supervising others for a few hours and making a few phone calls, he stopped, as if suddenly struck by a revelation. 
 ''It is already like a government job,'' he said, ''but with goats.''

HEADLINE: Twin Beams to Return to Skies, but Costs Are Daunting

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Intended originally as an ephemeral memorial, the twin-beam ''Tribute in Light,'' which simultaneously marks the presence and absence of the World Trade Center, has been guaranteed a place in the night sky every Sept. 11 for at least the next five years.
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation board voted yesterday to give $3.5 million to the Municipal Art Society, which helps produce the memorial. The society will buy and maintain the 88 searchlights needed for the display, two square columns of light whose proportions and placement echo the twin towers -- colossally yet ethereally.
 ''The public's enthusiasm for the lights is evident,'' Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris said yesterday. ''And bringing them back one day a year, on 9/11, is beautiful and respectful.'' 
 ''Tribute in Light'' was first illuminated March 11, 2002, six months after the attack. By design, it ran only until April 14, though popular sentiment seemed to favor extending it in some way. 
 Last August, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki said the tribute would be brought back each year. It returned for one night on Sept. 11, 2003. But the logistics behind the display were becoming increasingly complex and expensive.
 The rental costs were going up. It was difficult to find suppliers who could furnish 88 lights at once. And donors who would underwrite the $700,000 cost of a one-evening event were few and far between.
 ''No matter who's paying for the lights,'' said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation, ''it makes sense to buy them.''
 Mr. Rampe added that ''Tribute in Light'' might be incorporated some way into the permanent memorial that is being designed for the trade center site, so the fixtures, which can cost up to $20,000 each, ''are going to have value in the long run.''
 Board members supported the project but expressed concern about the dwindling amount of money available for rebuilding Lower Manhattan. Though the federal Housing and Urban Development Department has given the development corporation $2.783 billion in grants, there is now less than $900 million to allocate.
 ''There's no fat remaining,'' said Roland W. Betts, a member of the development corporation board. Money is needed for the memorial and the infrastructure at the trade center site, he said. Other board members, Paul A. Crotty and Thomas S. Johnson, said the authorization for ''Tribute in Light'' of ''an amount not to exceed $3.5 million'' meant just that and that they expected the Municipal Art Society to contain costs below $3.5 million if possible.
 But the spending was then approved unanimously. ''To know now that there's the opportunity for it to continue for the next five years is very gratifying,'' said Frank E. Sanchis III, senior vice president of the Municipal Art Society. 
 The searchlights have a 40-year lifespan, said Anita Contini, a development corporation vice president. They would probably be stored at Gateway National Park on the 364 days a year that they are not needed in Lower Manhattan.
 One daunting challenge that has yet to be resolved is finding a staging area for the searchlights after this year. Almost three-quarters of an acre is needed to create two 50-by-50-foot arrays that are related to one another and the surrounding street grid as the twin towers were. And the site has to be as close as possible to ground zero.
 The current spot set aside for the searchlights is in Battery Park City, at West and Vesey Streets. But this is where Goldman Sachs is planning its new headquarters.
 In other actions yesterday, the board approved spending up to $6.5 million for the planning and preliminary design of the cultural center and performing arts center on the trade center site. Last month, the corporation offered space in these buildings to the Joyce Theater Foundation, the Signature Theater Company, the Drawing Center and the Freedom Center. The initial planning should be completed early next year.
 Also yesterday, Robert P. Balachandran took his seat on the corporation board, replacing Christy Ferrer. He is a managing director at Bear Stearns and the former president and chief executive of the Hudson River Park Trust.

HEADLINE: Down Day Leaves S.&P. 500 With a Loss for the Year

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell after disappointing reports from technology companies and retailers, erasing the final few points of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's gains for the year.
 A 3.2 percent rise in oil prices renewed concern that higher energy prices would stem spending by companies and consumers alike. Crude oil for August delivery rose $1.25 to settle at $40.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The S.&P. 500 fell 9.22 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,109.11, leaving it with a loss of 0.3 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 68.73 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,171.56. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 30.76 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,935.32. All three benchmarks dropped for the fourth time in five days. 
 The Dow has dropped 2.7 percent this year, while the Nasdaq has declined 3.4 percent amid speculation that earnings growth will slow more than forecast.
 ''This quarter, expectations were building that we would have 20 percent growth in earnings,'' said Brett Mitstifer, a money manager at Value Line Securities, which has $3.5 billion in assets in New York. Recent profit reports ''indicate that that momentum, that upside in earnings surprises, is not going to take place.''
 Nearly two stocks fell today for each one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.4 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 4.3 percent less than the daily average this year.
 Yahoo, the owner of the most-visited group of Internet sites, slid $2.52, to $30.08, after second-quarter profit failed to beat estimates. Net income more than doubled to 8 cents a share, matching the average analyst estimate in a Thomson survey. Yahoo shares have risen 71 percent in the last year, and they trade at 120 times earnings.
 Other Web stocks also declined. EBay shed $3.22, to $83.65, while Amazon.com fell $1.50, to $49.50. Info-Space lost $2.96, to $32.24.
 BMC Software, a maker of mainframe and server programs, lost $2.51, or 15.1 percent, to $14.16, for one of the largest percentage declines in the S.&P. 500. Late Wednesday, the company said that first-quarter sales would be $318 million to $328 million, missing its forecast of $345 million to $355 million.
 Siebel Systems, one of the world's largest makers of customer service software, sank $1.23, or 13.4 percent, to $7.98, another one of the steepest declines in the S.&P. 500. The company said second-quarter sales fell to $301 million from $333.3 million a year earlier. Siebel had predicted that revenue would rise to $340 million to $365 million.
 The S.&P. 500's software and services index dropped 2.3 percent, with 27 of the 29 companies in the index declining. 
 Many retailers reported disappointing sales for June. Shares of Big Lots, the nation's largest retailer of discontinued and overstocked goods, dropped $1.42, to $12.52. The company said it would post a loss in the second and third quarters because of declining sales. 
 Talbots, the clothing retailer, shed $5.91, to $33.28. The company predicted it would earn 33 cents to 35 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, less than the 38-cent average estimate in a Thomson poll. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.9 percent in June, short of forecasts.
 Treasury prices were little changed yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note was 102 6/32, up 1/32. The yield was unchanged at 4.47 percent.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of inflation-indexed Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Outsourcing Comes to Summer Camp

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

DATELINE: WINSLOW, Me. 

 BODY:
ONE by one, the young men streamed through the gates at Logan International Airport in Boston and scanned the crowd with bleary eyes. A man held up a red pennant that read ''Camp Wigwam.'' Right church, wrong pew. Farther down the receiving line was a yellow plastic sled with ''Camp Caribou'' written across it. This was it.
 Soon, the Camp Caribou vans, filled with their roughly two dozen passengers, were cruising up Route 95. The evening traffic thinned out, the pine trees thickened and the questions began. How big was Maine anyway, wondered Richard Cotter, 20, a volleyball instructor from New Zealand. ''Say you get a night off, how hard is it to get anywhere in Maine?''
 Forget it, said Lynton Dawson, a soccer coach from England and the only nonrookie in the van. ''Maine is massive. It takes like an hour to drive to any other town.'' 
 Andrew Bourne, an 18-year-old wakeboarding champion from South Africa, asked about the fauna. Were there alligators? They had stared across the lake at him the other time he had been to the United States, at a competition in Tampa, Fla. Bill Lerman, behind the wheel of the lead van, told him not to worry. ''We have some good-sized snapping turtles, but they don't want anything to do with you,'' said Mr. Lerman, the camp director.
 Summer sleep-away camp is still a quintessentially, even peculiarly American institution. Color wars are seldom fought on foreign soil, and in most countries, scions of the middle and upper classes do not associate summer with name tags sewn on underwear and enforced dips in freezing lakes.
 But in a shift reminiscent of the outsourcing trend in corporate America, the fresh-faced role model teaching your child to paddle a canoe is increasingly likely to be from overseas these days. According to the American Camping Association, international counselors, as the visiting workers are known, now number 25,000 and make up one-fifth of all counselors. (The number rose as high as 35,000 in recent years, but has fallen since visa rules were tightened after Sept. 11.)
 Over the 36 years that his family has run Caribou, a boys' sports camp three and a half hours northeast of Boston, Mr. Lerman has had to become an expert in cultural translation: this year, more than half of his 80 counselors have been recruited from other countries. Many are in the United States for the first time.
 The notion of Mr. Lerman being the first American someone from another country gets to know is an interesting one. A hyperactive 52-year-old with a lion-colored mane of shoulder-length hair and a thick mustache, Mr. Lerman resembles a cross between the rocker Joe Walsh and the rocker-outdoorsman-television personality Ted Nugent, spends most of the summer tearing around the grounds on a mountain bike, an A.T.V. or a golf cart, and speaks in a working-class Boston accent thicker than the sludge at the bottom of a can of baked beans. (His two favorite words are ''dude'' and ''sweet,'' the latter of which he pronounces ''swaaate.'') 
 While there are no long-term statistics tracking the change across the industry, two of the largest agencies that match foreign workers with American camps, Camp Counselors USA, of Sausalito, Calif., and Camp America, of Stamford, Conn., each place about 8,000 international counselors a year now. Camp America placed 1,100 counselors in 1975, and Camp Counselors placed 120 in 1986, its first year.
 For a generation of young Americans, camp work seems to have lost much of its appeal, mostly for economic and professional reasons. ''A lot of Americans who'd like to work at a summer camp can't afford to work at a summer camp,'' said Martha Lerman, 45, Mr. Lerman's wife and Caribou's co-director. Often, they need to pay off college loans or get on a career track by obtaining resume-building internships at law firms and investment banks.
 The good part, Mr. Lerman said, is that the international counselors are often more mature than their American counterparts. ''It's much easier to find a 25-year-old qualified Australian or New Zealander who can come to the U.S. and work,'' he said. ''At 25 in the U.S., unless you're a teacher or a guidance counselor, or a bum, you don't have the summer off to work at camps.'' Many of the Caribou counselors are accomplished or even professional athletes -- tennis players from Mexico, baseball instructors from Australia, hockey teachers from, of course, Canada.
 And the campers, who range in age from 8 to 15, don't seem to mind the accents, even when it means being taught how to field grounders by a coach who hails from a place where ''short hop'' is something baby kangaroos do. Andy Qualmann, the camp's baseball director and a former member of the Australian national baseball team (yes, there is one), said his credentials were occasionally challenged at first, but added, ''It only takes one time where you fix one little thing in his swing and it really works, and they go, 'Oh, he knows what he's talking about.' ''
 Outside Kennebunkport that first evening, June 17, the caravan stopped at a rest area. Over a veggie patty at Burger King -- the only seemingly safe entree on the menu for someone who follows halal practices -- Tahir Rakmatullah, a riflery teacher from South Africa, confessed concerns that his charges, due to arrive in another week, might lack discipline. ''I've heard they're rich and spoiled,'' Mr. Rakmatullah, 22, a former police officer who runs a security company in Johannesburg, said of American youngsters. But he was confident he could keep them in line. ''I have my ways,'' he said.
 (Spoiled, perhaps. Rich, definitely, at least some of them. Caribou charges $7,150 for a full seven-week session and $4,450 for a half session.)
 Finally the vans turned down a long dirt road and pulled up beside some lodge-y wooden buildings surrounded by 200 acres of freshly groomed playing fields, forests and a lake.
 The two dozen counselors checked out their quarters -- long bunkhouses with particle-board floors, fluorescent lights and a line of skinny beds on either side of an aisle. Matthew Cockcroft, a baseball instructor from South Africa, was in heaven. ''It's beautiful,'' said Mr. Cockcroft, 19. He wasn't kidding. ''I can tell it's going to be a great summer.''
 ORIENTATION did not officially begin until the next morning. Unofficially, it began that night with a trip to Pete & Larry's, the bar in the Holiday Inn in Waterville, where it was ladies' night and the counselors found that life in the backwoods was not quite so isolated after all.
 There are three camps in and around Waterville, a town of about 15,000 (Caribou is actually in a neighboring town, Winslow). Two are boys' camps and one is a girls' camp, and the bar was pretty much taken over by young, fit, good-looking people of many nations (though the girls' camp counselors were mostly, but not entirely, American). Julie Seltzer, a counselor at Camp Matoaka and a sociology student at Northeastern University, said she found the summer camp scene in Waterville so fascinating she was writing a paper on it.
 ''What is more sociological than 50,000 societies crammed into one square mile for two months?'' Ms. Seltzer yelled over the pounding dance music. ''You become part of each other's culture.''
 Outside on the smokers' sidewalk, the sociology was getting even more complex. Chrissy Gamage, a local woman, was fixated on Damien Sanders, a Caribou counselor and former diver for the British Navy with biceps and cheekbones to die for.
 ''Damien,'' Ms. Gamage, 27, cooed, ''you're my friend now.'' Their bodies collided in an awkward tipsy cross between a hug and a handshake.
 ''How do you . . .,'' Mr. Sanders began.
 ''How do we do it in Maine?'' Ms. Gamage asked. ''We actually have sex in Maine.'' Mr. Sanders, 21, managed a wince that passed for an adorable smile.
 Ms. Gamage, a recently divorced social worker, explained that the annual arrival of the male counselors is a much-anticipated event in the calendars of Waterville's single women.
 ''We check our watches,'' she said. ''In summer, it's the counselors. In fall, it's the hunters.'' With that, she beckoned Mr. Sanders behind a pole for a private word.
 The next morning, the counselors were summoned to the ''chapel,'' a clearing under some hemlock trees by the lake, to talk about themselves and what mattered to them. They had come from at least eight countries, including Mexico and the Netherlands. About 20 of the international counselors were first-timers.
 Mr. Lerman urged the counselors to heed the example of a climbing instructor, Chris Davidson, 19, a red-crew-cutted bruiser whose all-New Zealand soccer hooligan looks were enhanced by nine stitches above his left eye, a souvenir of a recent run-in with some locals outside Bootlegger's tavern in Waterville. ''He's also into barroom brawling,'' Mr. Lerman said, ''not necessarily winning.''
 Mr. Dawson, the soccer coach from the outskirts of Liverpool, said he missed the comforts of home -- ''a meat pie on a tea cake'' and a bone-smashing game of rugby. His goal for the summer, he said, was finally to win color war.
 Ernesto Medina, 37, a petrochemical engineer from Mexico turned college professor who was at Caribou to teach swimming, said: ''You reach a time in your life when you have to decide how you want to live. I wanted to find out about myself, and I thought, 'What do you hate?' and I thought, 'I hate teaching; it's boring.' So I have spent the past six years of my life doing that. And I love it.''
 At the evening barbecue, Mr. Medina said that to be an effective teacher, he had to set his ego aside completely. 
 He offered an illustration. ''Who do you thank for your dinner?'' he asked a visitor. The fish for giving its life, the farmer for growing the vegetables, it was suggested. 
 ''What about the fork?''
 The fork?, the visitor responded, holding up the plastic utensil. Never thought of it.
 Mr. Medina leaned forward slightly. ''I am the fork,'' he said.
 The next morning, the counselors got a taste of their director's high-octane leadership style. Mr. Lerman had brought in a motivational speaker to address the theme of ''Achieving Excellence.'' But the counselors, tired and maybe a bit hung over, were barely achieving consciousness. Mr. Lerman, uncharacteristically dressed in a suit (he was on his way to a funeral), stopped the show.
 ''You're all kind of flat-lined right now,'' he said. ''We need to do something about it.'' He then led the counselors through a set of calisthenics, topped off with a quick lesson in the basics of the peekaboo boxing style made famous by Floyd Patterson: three left jabs, a right cross and a left hook. The counselors paid considerably closer attention for the rest of the morning.
 Basic training for counselors is mostly pretty basic. ''All campers should shower at least once daily,'' reads one rule in the Caribou manual. ''This process should include the use of soap, shampoo and warm water.''
 But some international counselors also need to be instructed on the finer points of the American way of surrogate parenting.
 ''I used to have to sit down with the Aussies particularly,'' Martha Lerman said. ''Most of them had stern, distant fathers who wouldn't think twice about smacking them. One time I had this guy from Australia -- a camper in his bunk loved him, just worshiped this guy. And one day the camper jumped on his back, and the counselor threw him to the ground and grabbed him by his neck and said 'Don't ever, ever do that to me again.' The same counselor threw away a kid's baby blanket.''
 Needless to say, he was not invited back. (Ms. Lerman said that the current crop of Australians seems a lot more sensitive.)
 Every January for the last few years, the Lermans have gone barnstorming through the Southern Hemisphere to job fairs, set up by the placement agencies, in Sydney, Brisbane, Johannesburg and elsewhere. Mr. Lerman peppers the candidates with probing questions: ''How were you disciplined as a child? What would you fire someone for if you were director of the camp? How do you handle no privacy?''
 The counselors do not get rich working for the camps. For about 10 weeks' work, they receive $800 to $1,800 -- usually just about enough to cover their airfare. They also get 30-day travel visas to use after camp ends, which for many counselors is the best part of the deal.
 The process of getting cleared to work in the United States has gotten more cumbersome since 9/11 and has discouraged some applicants.
 But the director of Camp Counselors USA, Ruthie Develle, said that there has been a positive side effect: the American government has given her the power to cancel the visas of the small percentage of counselors who would play the system by disappearing after arriving in the country. ''People would bolt before they got to camp, after they got to camp -- we got everything,'' Ms. Develle said. ''In the past, we'd tell them their visa would get canceled, but we didn't really know if it did.''
 The United States' recent geopolitical adventures have also hurt recruiting, but only a little. ''In certain countries,'' said Dennis Regan, the senior vice president of Camp America, ''the Iraqi war had some impact -- countries like France and Germany, as you might expect. But the U.S. remains a huge draw.''
 BY the end of orientation, most of the counselors were anxious for the campers to arrive; the rest were just anxious. In any case, June 26 rolled around, another bunch of vans drove up the dirt road, and Camp Caribou rang with the shouts of 225 little and not-so-little voices.
 Just a few days later, the place was in midseason form. At morning announcements by the flagpole, three distracted boys watched an earthworm writhe at the end of a stick. Three more clustered around the rabbit cage, poking their fingers in. Mr. Davidson walked up. ''I shoot bunnies at home,'' he told them. ''Come on guys, got to sit down.''
 Over breakfast, the counselors said things were going well. Mr. Davidson, a repo man and police cadet back home in New Zealand, said he was winning the battle to behave himself. ''Last year I was wedgy-ing a lot of the kids,'' he said. So far this year, he had lapsed just once.
 After breakfast each day, the campers must spend 45 minutes cleaning their bunks, most of which they spend proving how little work you can do if you set your mind to it. As the 11-year-olds of Bunk 7 listlessly pushed dirt around on the floor, Mr. Medina lifted up the bed of a boy named Jake to inspect. ''What's this here?'' he asked, pulling a pair of shorts from underneath the mattress. ''I have no idea how that got there,'' Jake said.
 On the shooting range, Mr. Rakmatullah tried to be patient. ''Don't argue,'' he said to a boy named Sam who was resisting wearing his shooting sling in the prescribed way. Sam finished and gave his target sheet to Mr. Rakmatullah, who scored it a 30 out of 100. ''You messed up,'' he said. ''But don't worry, you'll get it.''
 Down by the lake, first-period swim class was almost over. Mr. Medina took three of the slower learners over to the corrugated-concrete boat launch, faced them away from the class so they would not notice their fellow campers getting out of the water, got down on his kickboard and demonstrated the breast stroke, s-l-o-w-l-y.
 After 10 minutes, the boys began coordinating their arm sweeps with their kicks. The period ended. ''Ernesto,'' the waterfront director, Corky Brandt, called over. ''We've got to send them out.''
 ''O.K,'' Mr. Medina said, but told his students, ''Twenty kicks before you go.'' Mr. Brandt pulled Mr. Medina aside and pointed out some students from the next class who needed a hand. ''I use Ernesto as a troubleshooter,'' Mr. Brandt said. ''I got a counselor that's not too strong in teaching butterfly, so I use Ernesto to help out.''
 Mr. Medina said the secret of teaching is asking the boys how they wanted to be taught. ''If you listen to them, you will have all the answers, and you apply them,'' he said. ''O.K., guys.'' He blew his whistle and waded into the lake to begin another class.

HEADLINE: Former Official in Nassau Is Charged With Misconduct

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, July 8 

 BODY:
A former deputy executive of Nassau County was arrested on Thursday on charges of official misconduct in billing personal expenses to the county, engaging in sexual abuse in his county car and forcing a county aide into political activity. 
 The former deputy, Peter T. Sylver, pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer accused prosecutors of conducting a political witch hunt. The lawyer, Stephen Worth, is a longtime political ally of the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, who befriended Mr. Sylver and appointed him the deputy for economic development. 
 Mr. Sylver resigned under fire last November. Earlier this year the County Legislature conducted investigative hearings into his conduct and irregularities at the agencies under his domain. Separately, a United States Department of Housing and Urban Development audit ordered Nassau to refund nearly $1.2 million in aid that his agencies had spent in violation of federal rules; the county is disputing the findings and the order. There have also been three multimillion-dollar lawsuits filed in connection with the scandal.
 Despite the federal audit findings and critics' accusations of wrongdoing by Mr. Sylver ranging from nepotism to pressuring a contractor, the criminal charges were limited to three misdemeanors and one felony. The Nassau district attorney, Denis Dillon, said, ''There were other possible charges,'' but the evidence for them was not as strong.
 The whole episode proved a major political embarrassment for Mr. Suozzi, a Democrat who ended decades of Republican rule in 2001 when he won election as a reformer vowing to clean up mismanagement and corruption. If he runs for re-election next year, the Republicans say, they will hammer away at these scandals.
 Mr. Suozzi called the Sylver case an aberration and has imposed tighter controls to prevent a recurrence. ''It's a very sad day for the people of Nassau County,'' he said on Thursday. The arrest ''brings this to a close,'' and ''now we need to move forward,'' he said.
 But the official who first questioned Mr. Sylver's actions, the Legislature's Republican minority leader, Peter J. Schmitt, is not about to let the issue die. ''These people, Suozzi and his administration, handled this with denial, obstruction, stonewalling and lying,'' he said.
 Mr. Sylver, 35, of Westbury, a former dean at Hofstra Law School, was a rising star in the Suozzi administration. Now he is studying for the ministry, his lawyer said.
 Announcing the charges, Mr. Dillon accused Mr. Sylver of filing false documents for reimbursement of a $3,462 trip to London for himself and his wife in 2002, and billing $772 in personal expenses to an unauthorized county credit card.
 Mr. Dillon also charged that Mr. Sylver coerced a county aide to join him on a tour of polling places on Election Day last year. 
 Mr. Sylver was also charged with touching a woman sexually without her consent in his county car outside his office at 400 County Seat Drive here last August.
 Citing privacy concerns, Mr. Dillon declined to identify the woman. Other officials previously disclosed that Mr. Sylver's assistant had accused him of firing her after she refused his advances. She then dropped her complaint in return for being promoted to a higher-paying job in another agency. Mr. Schmitt called that deal a cover-up.
 That woman has since sued Mr. Sylver and Mr. Suozzi over the way she was treated and Mr. Schmitt for publicizing her case. In another suit, two former county officials claim they were fired for being whistle-blowers after complaining that grants were used improperly to pay some of Mr. Sylver's workers. And the Crowe Deegan law firm of Glen Cove, where Mr. Suozzi was mayor, is suing Mr. Schmitt for defamation after he said the firm had back-billed for legal work. The firm received $750,000 in fees from the county for legal work -- some of which was done before Mr. Suozzi took office -- that was not put out to bid, a violation cited in the federal audit.
 Mr. Worth said, ''It's all about politics.'' He said that after months of investigation, ''the charges are at most $5,000, which of course we maintain was properly spent.''

HEADLINE: Weekender Sag Harbor, N.Y.

BYLINE: By ELLEN MAGUIRE

 BODY:
WITH its narrow, salt-swept streets, centuries-old homes, and bustling wharf, Sag Harbor at first glance looks more like a New England fishing village than part of the tony Hamptons. Indeed, if the Hamptons could be described as wealthy sisters, each more beautiful than the next, Sag Harbor would be the brainy one with glasses. Sure, quaint cottages go for $1 million-plus, but residents include E. L. Doctorow, Betty Friedan, the playwright Joe Pintauro and a slew of weekenders who would rather work on their latest books-in-progress than their tans. 
 In 1789, this two-square-mile village nestled by a bay on the south fork of eastern Long Island was one of the busiest whaling ports in the nation. A rowdy and culturally diverse community sprang up (a fact that current full- and part-time residents mention frequently and with pride) and evolved into a haven for writers: James Fenimore Cooper arrived in 1818 in search of whales and left with notes for his first novel, and when John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, he lived in a modest house by the water on Bluff Point, where he spent the last 15 years of his life. 
 Today that literary legacy is kept alive by novelists, playwrights, at least six writers groups and a phalanx of journalists -- many of whom participate in a weekly softball game presided over by John Leo, a columnist for US News & World Report. 
 A passion for old houses and buildings unites residents, no matter their professions. Ninety percent of Sag Harbor is on the National Register of Historic Places, including Azurest, a vacation enclave created in 1947 for middle and upper-class black families, and exterior changes to buildings in the historic district must be approved by the local Board of Historic Preservation and Architectural Review.
 The biggest controversy this spring involved the vintage sign for the Sag Harbor Cinema, which the owner, Gerald Mallow, had taken down and planned to replace. Without Mr. Mallow's permission, Brenda Siemer, a Sagaponack resident, moved the sign to the back lawn of the Sag Harbor Whaling Museum for safekeeping (the sign ''documented the heartbeat of the town,'' she said), and Mr. Mallow reported it missing. The two have since resolved their differences and Ms. Siemer, a documentary filmmaker who is married to the actor Roy Scheider, has raised $20,000 for the sign's restoration.
 ''It's all about the history,'' said Chris Connor, 38, a banker-turned-contractor from the West Village who lives part-time in Sag Harbor with his partner, Steven Gambrel, 34, a designer, and their brown Labradoodle, Dash. Four years ago, they bought a 2,500-square-foot Methodist church built in 1810 that had been turned into a residence and spent a year and a half restoring the original siding, mantelpieces, and fireplaces. ''We're just the custodians,'' Mr. Connor said. 

The Scene
 While the pace of life is lively (without the 20-something party houses found in some Hamptons communities), many annual events have a charming, small-town appeal.
 Each July the Eastville Historical Society, which is devoted to the early African American and Native American settlements, holds a fish fry. Every August the volunteer fire department sponsors a fund-raising carnival. HarborFest Weekend in September celebrates the village's maritime history with a clam chowder cook-off and a beard-growing contest.
 Those who want to join the softball game, on Saturday mornings, should bring patience along with their mitts; participation is based on regular attendance and an unpredictable attrition rate. Players frequently include Ken Auletta of The New Yorker and Mike Lupica of The Daily News -- but they have been showing up for decades.
 On weekends, restaurants like B. Smith's (a 600-seat seafood place on the water) and the sleek New Paradise Cafe are packed with people eating Prince Edward Island mussels and roast Long Island duck. Patrons at the American Hotel bar can get the local gossip as they study the extensive wine list. More casual spots include La Superica, where surfers fresh from Sagg Main Beach in Sagaponack pick up Mexican food, and the Dockside Bar & Grill in the American Legion building, which has a patio with harbor views and where diners can listen to the Sag Harbor Community Band perform on Tuesday nights in July and August. 
 In winter, when many restaurants close, social life centers on dinner parties. ''If you live in New York, your weekend house may have the first great kitchen of your life,'' Mr. Connor said. ''Twelve people over, two fireplaces going, that's a pretty good Saturday night for me.''

Pros
 Weekenders enjoy big-city amenities in a picture-postcard setting. Canio's Books, the oldest of four independent bookstores, holds weekend readings, and the Bay Street Theater produces four plays each summer. The Sag Harbor Cinema draws independent and foreign film buffs from across the Hamptons. Antiques hunters browse a topnotch selection of shops, including Youngblood on Madison Street. 
 Despite skyrocketing land values, the village atmosphere remains mostly down to earth. ''Nobody's putting on a show when they go to pick up a cup of coffee or a newspaper,'' said Olaf Olafsson, 41, a novelist and an executive vice president of Time Warner, who has a weekend home in town. ''That's why we like it.''
 ''There is a heart in this town,'' said Priscilla Dunhill, 74, a part-time resident and a writer of gardening books who bought an 1840 Greek Revival house in 1991. ''When I took my bicycle in for repairs, the clerk refused to take my money. So I pulled a pineapple out of my bag and paid him with that.'' 
 The village is buffered by two nature preserves with good hiking: Barcelona Neck to the east and Long Pond Greenbelt to the south. With about five miles of coastline, two bay beaches and eight marinas, it's easy to get on the water. ''I step out my front door and into my kayak,'' said Joan Schmitz, 61, a retired television commercial producer who lives on the Upper East Side. Twenty-two years ago she bought a 1930's two-bedroom bungalow on Morris Cove with sunset views. ''There's original flamingo wallpaper,'' she said. ''I keep thinking I'll renovate, but it's kind of wonderful the way it is.''
 Sag Harbor residents east of Division Street pay taxes to the Town of East Hampton, which entitles them to a free permit for East Hampton town beaches. Village residents west of Division pay taxes to the Town of Southampton, which allows all Sag Harbor residents (regardless of where they pay taxes) to use Southampton town beaches.

Cons
 Getting to and from Sag Harbor on the crowded Long Island Expressway can undo the relaxation the weekend affords. And once you're in the village, beware: parking is not for sissies. In summer, the population can swell to 9,000, and the free spaces on Main Street fill up by 9 a.m. ''I saw two women in fancy cars headed for the same spot,'' Ms. Dunhill said. ''They got out and shoved each other. Right in the village in the middle of the day.''
 Rushing traffic on Route 114 (which cuts through the village to East Hampton in one direction and to the Shelter Island ferry in the other), is ''a disaster waiting to happen,'' said Bette Lynch, a Brooklyn resident who has been a weekender since she was 16. To escape the crowds, she and her husband, both retired state government administrators, leave their Sag Harbor house and head to the marina where they sleep on Dreamcatcher, their 36-foot powerboat. 
 Weekenders seeking seclusion should keep on looking: homes here are cheek-by-jowl, with most lots less than a quarter of an acre. ''My neighbor is 20 feet away,'' Mr. Connor said. ''Some people get that, others are dumbfounded.''
 The high cost of real estate threatens to destroy the economic diversity that Sag Harborites say they prize. Many village workers can no longer afford to live there. 

The Real Estate Market
 ''Three years ago, an entry-level home was in the $300,000-to-$400,000 range,'' said Ted Seiter an agent with Harbor Cove Realty in Sag Harbor. ''Now it's upward of $500,000.'' Low interest rates and a steady stream of buyers from New York City have created a boom, he said.
 Earlier this week, there were 48 homes on the market, ranging from a four-bedroom cottage on less than half an acre for $575,000 to a four-bedroom farmhouse on an acre and a half with a beach for $5.6 million.
 ''When a property becomes available, if the price is within the realm of reality, it goes,'' said Cee Brown, a broker with Allan M. Schneider Associates, which has offices throughout the Hamptons. ''Sometimes within days of being listed.'' In May, a 1,600-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bathroom 1895 home on a tiny lot with a cottage sold for $695,000 after one day on the market. 
 This week, Schneider Associates was offering a five-bedroom, 1790's house on almost half an acre with a pool and three fireplaces for $1.7 million and a 1950's three-bedroom waterfront cottage on a third of an acre for $1,395,000.
 Listings at Harbor Cove Realty this week included a four-bedroom house on just over a half acre with a pool for $895,000 and a four-bedroom waterfront house on a half acre with a dock for $2.5 million.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Expendable Women'' (editorial, July 5):
 As a Catholic, I value social justice, and I believe that access to affordable contraception is necessary to help disadvantaged families lift themselves from poverty and to prevent devastating diseases like H.I.V.-AIDS. 
 Denying family-planning services to any family, let alone families in developing countries, is to deny them social and economic equality and basic dignity. These services are not denied to our own citizens (because it is not politically feasible), but only to the world's most vulnerable families, because they are assigned a lower value in terms of political consequence to this administration. 
 The United States has a moral obligation to renew financing to the United Nations Population Fund and to stop denying vulnerable women essential information and services they need.

HEADLINE: At the Helm and Ignorant of Company Troubles

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Ignorance is Kenneth L. Lay's defense.
 The man who founded the Enron Corporation, even choosing its name, pleaded not guilty to fraud charges yesterday and insisted that he had not known of the fraud that brought the company down.
 The Justice Department, which sought his indictment, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a related civil suit, appear to accept a large part of Mr. Lay's defense. He is not charged with organizing the fraud, or even with knowing about it while it was flourishing in 1999 and 2000. 
 Instead, the government says he took part in covering up fraud and misleading investors in 2001, starting early in the year but with most of the actions coming in the months before the company collapsed in December of that year, as Mr. Lay -- by his account -- was trying to save it.
 The only crimes that Mr. Lay is charged with before 2001 concern a failure to tell banks that money he was borrowing would go for the purchase of Enron shares.
 In the civil suit filed simultaneously by the S.E.C., Mr. Lay is accused of violating insider-trading laws by selling stock when he knew of the fraud. But that suit makes clear that the S.E.C. does not think it has evidence that he knew of the fraud until early 2001.
 The Justice Department filed criminal insider-trading charges against Jeffrey K. Skilling, who briefly succeeded Mr. Lay as Enron's chief executive, and against Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer, contending that they sold shares while knowing of the fraud. But it did not file such charges against Mr. Lay.
 For the Justice Department, getting any indictment of Mr. Lay may have been the goal. From the beginning, he was the symbol of Enron, the man who was close to President Bush -- who called him ''Kenny Boy'' -- and had influence during the early days of the Bush administration.
 At the peak of his fame, he wowed fellow chief executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. To many, it seemed outrageous that the man at the helm would walk away while underlings went to prison.
 ''We can go to the top,'' said Linda Chatman Thomsen, deputy director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, ''and the fact that we do, I hope, deters others from engaging in illegal behavior. It is our sincere hope that others who might be tempted to dissemble to the investing public will be deterred.''
 Mr. Lay asserted his innocence yesterday and blamed Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron -- who has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for the prosecution -- for all his problems. He said he wanted a trial as soon as possible.
 Mr. Lay answered questions from reporters, a highly unusual thing for a defendant to do. He had only praise for President Bush, although he said he had been closer to Mr. Bush's father, the former president. He said his net worth, once hundreds of millions of dollars, was down to around $20 million, after setting aside reserves for legal fees and court settlements, and that his liquid assets were less than $1 million. 
 What may have gotten Mr. Lay to this point in the legal process was the disclosure that as he was trying to reassure Enron employees that the company would be saved, he was secretly selling his own shares. To accomplish that, he used what came to be known as the ''Lay loophole'' in federal securities laws.
 This provided that stock transactions between an executive and the company itself did not have to be disclosed until the following year. What Mr. Lay did was to repeatedly borrow $4 million from the company and then satisfy the loan by tendering stock to the company. Then he borrowed more money and tendered more stock.
 In the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Congress closed that loophole with a vengeance. First, it required that all insider transactions had to be disclosed within days. Then it barred corporations' loans to executives.
 Mr. Lay's defense against that charge will be that he was not a willing seller.
 He had borrowed heavily against his stock, and needed the cash to meet margin calls as Enron's share price fell. Indeed, his transactions indicate that he believed the stock was cheap and that he was doing all he could to hold on until the price recovered -- something that it never did.
 Mr. Lay could have disclosed what was going on and explained that his sales were forced, showing how he was putting in all his available cash to minimize the number of shares sold. But it may be understandable that he thought such disclosures would only make the situation worse.
 Since Enron went under, Mr. Lay has had to give up defending much of the image that he worked hard to create. He was seen as a brilliant executive -- he has a Ph.D. in economics -- who was both skilled at corporate infighting and had a visionary ability to see business trends before others did.
 As the chief executive of Houston Natural Gas, he warded off one hostile acquirer in 1984 by paying greenmail -- buying back the stock owned by the raider at an above-market price -- but concluded that consolidation in the gas pipeline business was inevitable. In the spring of 1985, he agreed to have his company acquired by InterNorth, with the merged company to be based in InterNorth's hometown, Omaha, and known as HNG/InterNorth.
 Mr. Lay was not supposed to become the top executive until considerably later, but he moved up well before the schedule as other executives quit. He moved the company to Houston and announced that it would be renamed Enteron. It turned out that name was already established in medical circles -- having to do with intestines -- so the company name was shortened to Enron.
 In the 1990's, even as energy businesses bored investors, Enron became a Wall Street darling. It did that by pioneering in energy trading and then expanding into trading access to broadband communications. By then, it was considered a leading ''new economy'' company.
 In February 2001, Mr. Lay handed over the chief executive reins to Mr. Skilling, and settled into the role of nonexecutive chairman. But then, Mr. Skilling quit in August -- it is still not clear just why -- and the board that Mr. Lay had largely chosen rewarded him with a $10 million bonus for again becoming chief executive.
 This money wound up going to the banks to pay margin calls -- something Mr. Lay now cites as proof that he did not know the company was going under. But the government contends that he also misled investors in discussing Enron's financial prospects.
 In late August 2001, before it was clear that the company was in serious danger, he brushed off a reporter's question about the partnerships that turned out to be at the heart of the fraud. ''You're getting way over my head,'' he said.
 That statement turns out to be the basis of Mr. Lay's defense -- that the visionary corporate leader with the doctorate in economics simply did not understand what was happening at the company he created and ran.
 It is a humiliating way to end a business career, but may also be his best hope of staying out of prison.

HEADLINE: Satisfaction and Sadness at the Sight of Handcuffs

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jayna Desai contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 8 

 BODY:
Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of the Enron Corporation, called Thursday a ''tragic day'' after he was handcuffed and led to a courthouse here where he pleaded not guilty to charges that he had deceived Enron's investors and employees. 
 Tragedy, however, was not the first word on the lips of many Houstonians on Thursday as they absorbed the news of the indictment of Mr. Lay, who was once considered the city's most influential business executive and power broker. Other words spilled forth, not all of them printable. Some of the words were: vindication, amazement, sorrow and schadenfreude. 
 Many of Enron's former workers were especially vocal. John Sides, a longtime Enron employee who said he lost $700,000 in retirement savings after the company collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings in December 2001, said he watched television broadcasts of Mr. Lay's surrender to authorities on Thursday with quiet, almost subdued, satisfaction. 
 ''The money's not coming back,'' said Mr. Sides, a former budget analyst at Enron who now makes ends meet with two jobs, one planning budgets for public schools and another operating a private photography business. ''But he made a bundle at the top and should pay for what he did.''
 Houston has a reputation as a city that prides itself on forgiving and forgetting the misdeeds of its residents, with a determined emphasis on economic advancement.
 Those in the city's energy industry, for instance, revel in tales of wildcatters who built and lost several fortunes, sometimes crookedly, but nonetheless contributed to Houston's prosperity and influence. Not many were willing to go that far for Mr. Lay, but some were more understanding than others.
 ''Personally, I think Ken Lay was not an active participant,'' said Darlene Kilburn, an administrative assistant who works in an office building in downtown Houston, not far from the futuristic towers -- now mostly empty -- that once represented Enron's stated ambitions to become the biggest company in the world. 
 ''It was sad to see him in handcuffs,'' Ms. Kilburn said. ''But I didn't lose money in Enron, so I'm sure people who were involved with Enron have different opinions.''
 Enron's collapse and Mr. Lay's stewardship of the company shook Houston to its core, according to Stephen L. Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University. Mr. Lay went from being an admired father figure of the city's elite to an ostracized symbol of corporate excess.
 ''There's a fascinating and bittersweet mixture of emotion that has accompanied Ken Lay's indictment,'' Mr. Klineberg said. ''There's a feeling of just deserts, even as Houston evolves into a place where corporate stardom has been exchanged for institutionally shared responsibility.'' 
 Many former Enron employees spent much of Thursday talking on the phone and sending e-mail messages or instant-messages to each other after watching Mr. Lay speak in a televised news conference.
 Karl Klicker, a former intelligence officer in the Marines who lost his job as a training manager at Enron, said, with intentional irony, that he ''felt pretty bad for Kenny Boy.'' 
 ''I'd rather be living in poverty than heading off to jail,'' said Mr. Klicker, who has started his own consulting company and has been painting murals, baby-sitting and training for marathons since losing his job at Enron. ''It's amazing that it took two and a half years to indict him. It took way too long.''
 Mimi Swartz, a prominent local journalist who wrote a book on Enron with Sherron S. Watkins, the former Enron executive who warned Mr. Lay about the company's accounting problems, said that Houston remained divided over Mr. Lay.
 ''It's sort of a class thing, with the wealthy friends of Ken Lay ambivalent about it and the ordinary man on the street who wants to see him strung up,'' Ms. Swartz said. ''Houston's a place with a very short memory. And it will work hard to forget about this, but that hasn't happened yet.''
 Mr. Lay is not the first Enron executive to be indicted for involvement in the company's fall. He is the 31st person to face charges over the corporate debacle that resulted in more than 6,000 people in Houston losing their jobs. Mr. Lay's indictment follows those of the former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, who faces multiple charges of conspiracy, fraud and insider trading, and Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer. Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, faces up to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to two conspiracy counts. 
 ''These people need to go to jail for 20 or 30 years,'' said Jorge Ospina, a waiter at a restaurant that once catered to many Enron employees, as he left a public library downtown. ''This whole case is a joke because Fastow will probably be out of jail in a couple of years. Justice needs to be served.'' 
 But some of those hurt the most by Enron's downfall were more saddened by Mr. Lay's indictment than vengeful. 
 ''He was not a bad man,'' said Rod Jordan, who runs a group representing more than 1,100 former employees, ''just a weak man.'' 
 ''We know seeing Ken Lay in handcuffs won't return what we lost,'' he said. ''At least it's a milestone in terms of putting this chapter of our lives behind us.''

HEADLINE: Coalition Job in Iraq

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re Paul Krugman's June 29 column criticizing the Coalition Provisional Authority: 
 I was in Iraq for seven months as director of private-sector development. My biggest challenges were restarting state-owned and private businesses, restoring credit and investment, and reforming outdated laws and policies -- not privatization. These required management and problem-solving skills and financial expertise, not a narrow privatization background. 
 My M.B.A. from Harvard, years of experience at McKinsey and Citigroup, and 15 years owning and managing businesses were ideal for this role. One of my first hires was Jacek Kwasniewski, the former deputy minister of privatization in Poland, to oversee the privatization effort.
 Mr. Krugman includes my appointment in his charge of ''cronyism.'' If the administration wanted to reward a friend, it would have come up with something better than seven months of 16-hour days and seven-day workweeks dodging rockets and mortars and living in a trailer. 
 Economic growth and the promise of better lives will in time secure Iraq's stability and the adoption of a modern representative government. Tyrants and terrorists can delay this historical trend, but they can't stop it.

 BODY:

IMPERIAL HUBRIS
Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror
By Anonymous
309 pages. Brassey's Inc. $27.50.
 ''Imperial Hubris,'' the scalding new book by a current Central Intelligence Agency officer -- who was able to publish the book on the condition that his real name not be revealed -- is an assessment of America's war on terror that is bound to provoke large heapings of controversy, on both the right and the left, among hardliners on Iraq and critics of the administration alike. Readers will doubtless contest some or many of the things Anonymous has to say, but he pulls few punches in this book and gives us a fascinating window on America's war with Al Qaeda -- at least as framed by one senior analyst, who seems to have put all bureaucratic niceties aside.
 It is a book that not only slings all manner of arrows at America's political, military and intelligence establishment (going back to the mid-70's, with the qualified exception of President Ronald Reagan and his C.I.A. director, William J. Casey), but a book that also calls for a complete re-evaluation of the nation's foreign policy toward Muslims and the Middle East.
 In its pages, prescient analyses of recent developments in the Persian Gulf and Middle East (informed by the author's experience in the mid-1990's as head of a C.I.A. unit assigned to tracking Osama bin Laden) jostle for space with incendiary calls for a Shermanesque exercise of American military power in a potential war with the Muslim world; maverick assessments of Islamic attitudes toward the United States, with shrill exhortations for America to adopt a neo-isolationist stance based on narrowly defined self-interest.
 If the country's foreign policy remains status quo, Anonymous warns, ''America's military confrontation with Islam'' will broaden ''with escalating human and economic expense.'' He predicts that Al Qaeda ''will attack the continental United States again, that its next strike will be more damaging than that of 11 September 2001, and could include use of weapons of mass destruction.''
 In addition, Anonymous accuses United States leaders, elites and media of being in denial about the nature of the Qaeda threat and the balance sheet on the war on terror: he argues that America must stop using the terrorist paradigm for Al Qaeda and accept ''the fact'' that the group is ''leading a popular, worldwide, and increasingly powerful Islamic insurgency,'' and he asserts that United States victories against Al Qaeda have thus far been tactical ones that have failed to slow ''the shift in strategic advantage toward al Qaeda.'' 
 In the course of this book, Anonymous excoriates American leaders for not having had an immediate military response planned for an event like 9/11: ''None had been planned in the eleven months since the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, or in the five-plus years since bin Laden declared war'' on the United States.
 And he assails American generals for passively accepting their civilian leaders' directives for waging light, fast operations (of the sort favored by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld). ''Fight and win quickly; do not kill many of the enemy, destroy much of his property, or kill many of his civilians; and, above all, lose the barest minimum of U.S. soldiers because the soft American public will not tolerate high casualties'' -- this sort of cautious, fastidious war-making, Anonymous contends, is ''a recipe for disaster,'' invariably leaving behind ''half-finished or, more accurately, half-started wars that will be refought later.'' 
 Anonymous argues that the ''high-profile role'' of the F.B.I. in America's counter-bin Laden campaign lends it ''too much law-enforcement color,'' promoting an ''international version of the saga of the American West, where U.S. intelligence officers and soldiers are sent out, like the storied Texas Rangers'' to get their man. This approach, Anonymous says, will never work ''against a large and talented insurgent organization like al Qaeda'' because ''the procedure neither kills nor captures fast enough to outpace al Qaeda's astounding ability to replicate.'' 
 When it comes to his own organization, the C.I.A., Anonymous accuses its leaders of ''moral cowardice'' for ''falsely assuring policymakers and congressional overseers that cooperation'' with the F.B.I. was ''seamless.'' He also describes the overall intelligence community (the I.C.) as being ''risk-averse'': senior officers, who are clear, concise and unbiased among staff, he says, become ''more selective when deciding what to tell policymakers, including the president.'' 
 Although Anonymous does not explicitly deal with intelligence about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction (which some C.I.A. analysts questioned, but which the agency's chief, George Tenet, termed a ''slam dunk'' in Bob Woodward's book ''Plan of Attack''), he adds this biting aside: ''Substantive selectivity can exclude subjects in which policy makers are uninterested or those that will stir anger, such as intelligence showing a specific U.S. policy is cocked up. This process also yields the deselection of data that would spur policymaker requests for action that, if taken, might yield an IC failure -- and so criticism from Congress, policymakers, or the media -- or expose the IC's unaddressed systemic failures.'' 
 Anonymous has little to say about the performance of the bin Laden unit he headed from 1996 to 1999 -- a unit that the veteran intelligence writer James Bamford criticized in a recent book (''A Pretext for War'') for failing to penetrate Al Qaeda's leadership. According to a staff report by the Sept. 11 commission, leaders of the bin Laden station were frustrated when a plan to capture the Qaeda chief in 1998 was not recommended by C.I.A. leadership for approval by the Clinton White House; the following year, Anonymous was transferred to another C.I.A. position.
 Drawing upon nearly two decades of experience in national security issues related to Afghanistan and South Asia, Anonymous draws a bleak picture of America's post-9/11 engagements abroad. As he sees it, Afghanistan has become ''a classic lose-lose situation'' in which an American pullout means that the Taliban and Al Qaeda ''will resume control of much of the country,'' and a decision by America to stay means that ''the Islamist insurgency will intensify'' and ''ultimately triumph whether or not the United States massively increases its occupying force and takes the war to the enemy as did the Russians.'' 
 ''None of this had to be,'' Anonymous writes, citing what he sees as a series of crucial missteps, including a failure to attack immediately after 9/11 (before Al Qaeda had a chance to disperse); a failure to close the country's borders; a failure to draw lessons from the British and Soviet experiences in Afghanistan; and a failure to understand the difficulties of trying to transplant an American-style democracy to such a culturally alien land.
 Although Anonymous regards Afghanistan as a necessary war, he sees the American invasion of Iraq as ''an avaricious, premeditated, unprovoked war against a foe who posed no immediate threat but whose defeat did offer economic advantages.'' For Osama bin Laden, Anonymous argues, the American invasion and occupation of Iraq were like ''a Christmas present you long for but never expected to receive'' -- a gift from Washington that ''will haunt, hurt, and hound Americans for years to come.'' He sees Iraq becoming another breeding ground for Al Qaeda, and the postwar insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan as magnets for anti-American fighters. 
 ''U.S. forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the Islamic world, something Osama bin Laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990's,'' he writes. ''As a result, I think it fair to conclude that the United States of America remains bin Laden's only indispensable ally.'' 
 In this volume, Anonymous tries -- as he did in his last book, ''Through Our Enemies' Eyes'' -- to show how Muslims regard Osama bin Laden. He argues that the Qaeda leader should not be dismissed as an irrational terrorist or an avatar of an Islamic lunatic fringe. Rather, he describes Mr. bin Laden as ''the most respected, loved, romantic, charismatic, and perhaps able figure in the last 150 years of Islamic history'' -- someone seen by many Muslims as waging a heartfelt defense of their faith, ''a practical warrior, not an apocalyptic terrorist in search of Armageddon.'' 
 Anonymous contests the argument put out by members of the Bush administration that Mr. bin Laden wants to destroy America because he hates our values, freedoms and ideas. In Anonymous's view, the Qaeda leader hates us ''because of our policies and actions in the Muslim world'' and Al Qaeda's attacks are meant to advance a set of clear, focused and limited foreign policy goals: namely, an end to American aid to Israel: the removal of American forces from the Arabian Peninsula; an end to the American occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq; an end to American support for repressive, apostate Muslim regimes like Saudi Arabia; an end to Amerian support for Russia, India and China against their Muslim militants; and an end to American pressure on Arab energy producers to keep oil prices low. 
 If current American policies toward the Muslim world are not changed, Anonymous writes near the end of this harrowing and often deliberately provocative volume, America will be left with only a military option for defending itself -- an option he says that should be used not ''daintily,'' as it has been in recent years, but with the sort of bloody-minded ferocity used ''in France and on Pacific islands, and from skies over Tokyo and Dresden'' during World War II. 
 The war on terror, he warns, ''has the potential to last beyond our children's lifetimes and to be fought mostly on U.S. soil.''

HEADLINE: China Agrees to Phase Out Tax on Imported Chips

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
The United States said on Thursday that it was dropping its first case against China at the World Trade Organization after settling a dispute with the country over its tax on imported semiconductors.
 Under the settlement, China agreed to a gradual elimination of the tax advantage given to its domestic semiconductor industry, which has increased the price of United States imports by 14 percent.
 ''This is another step toward real results,'' Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said at a news conference here. ''China is a voracious consumer of semiconductor chips and this will give us a level playing field.'' 
 With the record trade deficit and the outsourcing of American jobs to China growing as significant election-year issues, the administration is casting its trade policy as a success built on practical negotiations and settlements of disagreements.
 ''With the help of our Chinese colleagues, this problem-solving approach often works,'' Mr. Zoellick said.
 Behind him was a banner with the phrase ''real results'' repeated again and again in rows, a rebuttal to accusations by Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate for president, and his running mate, John Edwards, that the administration's trade policies favor multinational corporations and fail to protect American workers.
 Roger Altman, an investment banker and former deputy Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton who is advising the Kerry campaign, said that the Bush administration's real results were a record trade deficit and the loss of 1.9 million jobs despite the opening of more global markets.
 ''President Bush's record on trade is dismal,'' Mr. Altman said. ''He is on track to be the first since President Hoover to see net exports go down during his term.''
 The Chinese agreed to phase out the tax advantage over the next nine months, ending it in April 2005. The United States filed a complaint with the W.T.O. in March, contending that China's value-added tax on imported semiconductors violated international trade rules prohibiting tax policies that favor domestic manufacturers. 
 The $70 billion semiconductor industry in the United States hailed the settlement, saying it was critical if the United States was to continue to lead the field.
 ''We're very pleased with these results, absolutely,'' said George M. Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, who attended the news conference along with other industry representatives.
 The American semiconductor industry sells $2 billion in chips to China every year, making it the largest foreign supplier. But that is still a small share of the $25 billion Chinese market. Mr. Scalise said he hoped the settlement would mean that foreign competitors would be more competitive and increase their sales in the coming years.
 Some Democratic lawmakers said the settlement was vindication of their demands over the last two years that the administration take stronger action against the Chinese on trade issues.
 Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said the agreement was a ''step forward, but much, much more needs to be done.''
 ''We've got a $120 billion trade deficit with China -- a 50 percent increase since 2001 when the administration came into office -- and it is growing,'' he said. 
 Mr. Zoellick said at the news conference that the United States trade deficit was a sign of a dynamic economy, not of poor policy.
 ''The overall trade deficit, it reflects that the United States is buying more than others do,'' he said. ''The solution is a combination of opening more markets and enforcing trade laws.''
 As an example of the administration's approach, Mr. Zoellick cited China's agreement in April to abandon a plan to impose its own standard for wireless technology, essentially agreeing to join the rest of the world rather than dividing it up.
 The Semiconductor Industry Association applauded that decision as well, which gives it even greater access to China, the world's third-largest semiconductor market.
 Several contentious issues remain with China like textile exports, currency controls and labor rights. The administration rejected calls by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to punish China for the commercial advantage that the group said the country gained by violating workers' rights.
 The representatives of the American semiconductor industry said the resolution would help the United States economy. The chip industry employs 255,000 Americans, according to the association, and United States companies have a 50 percent share of the world market. B. Anne Craib, the association's director of international trade, said that a majority of semiconductors were manufactured in the United States, but she could not be more precise.
 But like other industrial products, semiconductor chips are increasingly being manufactured overseas, especially for the export market. Eamonn Fingleton, a trade expert based in Tokyo, said that factories in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Korea would profit as much from this settlement as those in the United States.
 Most trade experts had said that China would be unable to defend the tax before the W.T.O. Indeed, the settlement was reached just days before the United States was prepared to ask the W.T.O. to form a panel to adjudicate the dispute.
 Frank Vargo, spokesman for the National Association of Manufacturers, said ending the tax was crucial to ensure that China did not discriminate against other American industries through its tax system.

HEADLINE: The Two Sides of Kabul

BYLINE: By Christina Lamb. 
Christina Lamb is the author of ''The Sewing Circles of Herat: A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan.''

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
''Look, the swimming pool is in the shape of a martini glass,'' boasts Alex, as he shows several visitors around his soon-to-be-opened hotel-cum-blackjack lounge. Alex, an Afghan-American who used to be a mortgage broker in Las Vegas, is really named Omar Zamadi, but he thinks that is too complicated for foreigners -- and foreigners are his market. 
 Mr. Zamadi, who returned to his homeland a year ago, says he has invested $200,000 in his hotel, the Peacock Lounge. A pink-and-gold colonnaded extravaganza, which he describes as ''Roman style'' but probably owes more to Caesars Palace, the Peacock Lounge sticks out on a street in which families sleep in bombed-out houses with no roofs or windows and dusty-faced children walk to a well to collect water. 
 ''Expats need a place where they can wear thongs, eat hot dogs and drink beers,'' Mr. Zamadi says. ''You can make a lot of money here.'' 
 On the other side of the city, two Britons have set up Afghanistan's first cocktail bar, serving margaritas and Tora Bora specials to Westerners at $10 a drink. Their bar, the Elbow Room, is packed every night. So is a restaurant called Lal Thai where Lalita Thongngamkam's green chicken curry is served up by slinky waitresses from Bangkok in slit-to-the-thigh silk skirts with pistols in their garters.
 These are just a few of the many establishments for Westerners that have sprung up in postliberation Kabul, capital of the land cited by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a model and described by President Bush last month as the ''first victory in the war on terror.'' Not only would the Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, have a fit, but many who supported the war to oust the Taliban regime need wonder if an invasion of bars and restaurants for Westerners is really what it was for.
 Although aid workers, contractors and security consultants have every right to enjoy themselves, there is mounting resentment among ordinary Afghans, who feel the West has been busier opening drinking holes than rebuilding their nation.
 For some time, Afghanistan has been two countries: Kabul, which is relatively peaceful, and the rest, so riven by warlords and resurgent Taliban that the United Nations has declared a third of the country off limits to its employees.
 But more recently, Kabul has become a city with two sides. With as many as a 1,000 nongovernmental organizations in residence, rents are higher here than in much of Manhattan. In Kabul's most affluent area, Wazir Akbar Khan, once favored by Osama bin Laden's Arabs and now a Western enclave, $5,000 a month gets only a small, uncared-for house. Most of the owners are rich Afghans living abroad, and, according to real estate agents, many are Taliban commanders living in Pakistan and using the rent to finance madrassas and militia training.
 An agent from the Marco Polo agency who drove me around last month told me his company leases 10 houses to the World Food Program at rents of $9,000 to $15,000 a month per house. The total comes to more than $1.5 million a year. ''Most Afghans feel angry that this is our money, money meant for the Afghan people, which aid agencies are spending on beautiful houses, carpets and drinking,'' while schools and hospitals still need to be built, the agent said.
 There may not yet be a Starbucks or McDonalds in Kabul but other fruits of liberation include Afghanistan's first boutique hotel, opened by a British woman, and a commercial radio station sponsored by Number One (a brand, which has become the local term for condoms). You can even take a putt at the Kabul golf club, where the landmines have apparently been cleared.
 At the same time, the vast majority of Afghan women still wear burqas, seen by many in the West as a symbol of Taliban oppression. The girls' soccer team at Zarghoona High School has to practice secretly and the days of Millies, the mini-skirted female drivers of Kabul's electric buses, remain a distant memory.
 Instead of creating industry or regenerating agriculture under Western supervision, Afghanistan is producing record opium crops and is now responsible for a whopping 75 percent of the world supply.
 Last week, the West finally had a chance to match words and deeds at the NATO summit meeting in Istanbul, where Afghanistan was high on the agenda. This was supposed to be an opportunity for the alliance to trumpet the success of its first peacekeeping operation outside its historic area of operations. Unlike the Iraqis, the Afghans generally welcome foreign forces. Yet the shameful failure of member nations to provide troops and equipment means that NATO has conspicuously failed to meet the pledge it made last year to expand outside Kabul. The NATO secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, described himself as feeling ''like a beggar.''
 The alliance still has only 6,500 peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, compared with 40,000 in Kosovo. Last week's announcement that it would send up to 3,500 more to provide security for the elections due to take place in September is laughable in a nation with an estimated 10.5 million voters. Elections will now almost certainly be delayed. The need for a nationwide peacekeeping force if polls are to go ahead at all was highlighted two weeks ago when more than a dozen men were killed in Uruzgan Province after registering to vote and a minibus carrying female election workers was blown up in Jalalabad.
 The gap between the claims of Mr. Rumsfeld and others and the reality on the ground was vividly illustrated by a British patrol last month that stopped to talk to the malik, or village chief, of a mud-walled settlement on the edge of Kabul. After complaining about the shortage of wells, the malik assured the patrol's commander that ''life is much better than it was under the Taliban.'' When asked how, the malik had to think hard. ''We can watch videos,'' he said finally. Then he added: ''at least we could if we had television. Or electricity.'' Keen to please his visitors, he thought again. ''Our girls can go to school,'' he said, then once more frowned. ''Only there is no school.''

HEADLINE: KERRY CAMP SEES EDWARDS HELPING WITH RURAL VOTE

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry's political advisers plan to dispatch his new running mate, Senator John Edwards, to rural areas in critical states across the Midwest and the West, in the belief that Mr. Edwards could be an unusually powerful advocate for the ticket in regions viewed as President Bush's stronghold.
 For all the attention to Mr. Edwards's Southern roots, Mr. Kerry's aides said that his strongest appeal was likely to be among rural and independent voters, two of the most vital segments of the electorate this year, because of his upbringing in a small North Carolina town and his political identity as a Southern Democrat. Mr. Kerry's aides and some outside analysts said he could be a strong presence in a dozen battleground states outside the South, from Ohio to Oregon.
 ''From looking at how he performed in the primaries, it is clear he did well with the rural vote,'' Steve Elmendorf, Mr. Kerry's deputy campaign manager, said. ''We're going to send Edwards into rural states and Southern states because we think he can help us close the gap there.'' 
 The Democrats' emerging plan for Mr. Edwards comes at a time when Democratic and even some Republican officials suggest that Mr. Kerry's vice-presidential selection has the potential of being the most politically significant choice since another Massachusetts Democrat, John F. Kennedy, turned to another Southerner, Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960. Many experts say the choice of Johnson pushed Texas into the Democrats' column and ensured Kennedy's victory.
 Although Mr. Edwards is likely to sway a relatively small number of votes, Democrats and Republicans noted that the contest was likely to be determined by a sliver of voters in a handful of states, and said that Mr. Edwards appeared particularly strong among those voters the White House and Mr. Kerry's campaign had seen as pivotal to the outcome in November.
 ''I think it's going to help him,'' Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said of Mr. Kerry's choice of Mr. Edwards. ''The picture of him and all the kids and the rest of it.
 ''He appeals to the Southern moderates, who in the past may have voted for the Republicans,'' Mr. Fabrizio added. ''He's got a populist message, so it can go to union members; a sizable number of union members might have voted for George Bush. I think Edwards is appealing to female voters.''
 Mr. Bush's aides said they did not believe Mr. Edwards would make a significant difference, arguing that voters end up making their decisions in presidential elections based on the top of the ticket.
 ''People vote on the basis of the president, and they vote also, very importantly, on the basis of what a vice-presidential choice says about someone,'' Ken Mehlman, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, said.
 But as Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry rode a wave of highly favorable publicity this week, there were signs of concern among Republicans. Led by Mr. Bush himself, the White House moved immediately to try to undercut Mr. Edwards by noting his lack of experience in government and challenging his ability to serve as president should something happen to Mr. Kerry. Even Mr. Kerry's advisers acknowledged the potential effectiveness of that line of attack.
 National Review, one of the leading magazines of the conservative movement, posted an editorial on its Web site Thursday that served as something of a validation of Mr. Kerry's political judgment in picking Mr. Edwards.
 ''Edwards brings real strengths to the Democratic ticket,'' the editorial said. ''He is an attractive figure. Voters seem to respond to youth, energy, and good looks. Edwards may also help Kerry appeal to centrist voters: Americans outside the South have a dated perception of how conservative Southern Democrats are. Edwards's campaign speech, though centered on the idea that Americans who are not rich have little hope of making it on their own, somehow comes across as optimistic.''
 Details of Mr. Edwards's schedule have not been worked out, campaign officials said. But Mr. Kerry's aides argued that Mr. Edwards -- who at Mr. Kerry's side these past two days regularly introduced himself as someone who ''grew up in a small town in North Carolina'' -- would be a compelling figure in rural areas of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, West Virginia, Iowa and New Mexico.
 Mr. Kerry's advisers said his appeal to independent voters was displayed in another critical state when he was competing with Mr. Kerry in the Wisconsin primary. (At the time, the advisers had played down Mr. Edwards's showing among independent voters in Wisconsin.)
 They also said Mr. Edwards would be a valuable asset in battleground states where he ran aggressively and built up name recognition in the primaries. Those include Iowa, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Missouri and New Mexico.
 This is not to say that Mr. Edwards, who was born in South Carolina and grew up in North Carolina, will ignore the South. In one early sign of how the selection of Edwards has affected the strategies of both sides, Mr. Kerry's campaign this week purchased its first television time in North Carolina to broadcast an advertisement featuring Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards together. 
 Tad Devine, one of Mr. Kerry's senior advisers, said the advertisements in North Carolina reflected the campaign's calculation that the presence of Mr. Edwards on the ticket would allow Mr. Kerry to compete in Southern states like North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana.
 Republicans dismissed the Kerry advertising purchase as a political stunt, noting that Mr. Kerry was not currently running advertisements in Louisiana or Arkansas. At the same time, Mr. Bush's campaign announced on Thursday that it was also advertising on television in North Carolina, and was prepared to respond to moves by Mr. Kerry in the other states. 
 Mr. Edwards's position on the ticket was described by Republicans and Democrats as a clear boost for Mr. Kerry in one obviously critical Southern state: Florida. Mr. Edwards's wife, Elizabeth, made a point of noting where she was from as the Democrats campaigned in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Wednesday night
 ''I'm actually a native Floridian,'' Ms. Edwards said. ''I was born in Jacksonville. My parents married in Pensacola -- they now live in Sarasota.'' As the crowd erupted in cheers, she warned, ''I'm not done yet,'' explaining that her sister lives in Bradenton and she has aunts and uncles ''all over this state.''
 Beyond Florida, Democrats said that Mr. Kerry's hopes in the South were not particularly strong, even with Mr. Edwards on the ticket. Still, with Mr. Edwards at his side, his campaign appears to be at the very least attempting to force Mr. Bush to expend resources on a part of the country that his campaign had wanted to take for granted.
 ''We've got to make them defend territory on the electoral map,'' Mr. Devine said. ''And there's a lot of red out there for us to do that.''
 Beyond the South, a poll conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's National Annenberg Election Survey conducted earlier this week underscored the potential value of Mr. Edwards's appeal among rural voters.
 The poll found that just 19 percent of rural voters had an unfavorable view of Mr. Edwards, compared with 37 percent with a favorable view. By contrast, Mr. Kerry was viewed unfavorably by 43 percent of rural voters, compared with 36 percent who viewed him favorably.
 ''He was so effective in talking to and reaching the economically pressured voters; he seems like he could talk their language. And it resonated with them far better than they resonate with Kerry,'' said Peter F. Nardulli, a political scientist at the University of Illinois in Urbana. 
 Mr. Edwards's potential appeal to independent voters was displayed in the Wisconsin primary. Mr. Kerry defeated Mr. Edwards there on Feb. 17, but Mr. Edwards defeated him among independent voters by a margin of 40 percent to 28 percent, according to a survey of voters leaving the polls.
 Mr. Bush's advisers said they were skeptical that Mr. Edwards's presence on the ticket would make a difference in the end.
 Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush political strategist, disputed the idea that the electoral strength exhibited by Mr. Edwards during the Democratic primaries was a measure of how he might help Mr. Kerry.
 ''The only people he appealed to is a minority of Democratic voters,'' Mr. Dowd said. He said there was no evidence that Mr. Edwards could draw in any voters that Mr. Kerry did not already have, adding, ''You're not going to have the answer to this question in a while, and in the end it's about the president, not the vice president.''
 Beyond that, Mr. Fabrizio, the Republican pollster, said, the image of a youthful Mr. Edwards frolicking with his wife and two young children could help him with young voters and among moderate women, who have proven to be of concern for Republicans. And the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson argued that Mr. Edwards, as a Southerner, could help drive up turnout among black voters, as well as blue-collar voters across the country.
 ''The fact is, if he excites labor and civil rights and working-class whites across the country, it changes the dynamics of the race,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Edwards will move comfortably in Appalachia. He'll move comfortably in the Carolinas and in Georgia.''

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Urge Kerry to Forgo Public Campaign Financing

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and GLEN JUSTICE; Jodi Wilgoren contributed reporting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8 

 BODY:
At first glance, the notion seems far-fetched. Why would Senator John Kerry's campaign give up $75 million in public money for the general election? 
 Such a thing has never happened, and the campaign insists it will not happen this year. 
 But Mr. Kerry raised a surprising $180 million in campaign contributions after opting out of public financing in the primaries. That success is making some Democratic fund-raisers and strategists brazen enough to consider what once seemed unthinkable. They are calling on Mr. Kerry's campaign to forgo public money and to continue to rely on private donations in the general election. 
 While acknowledging that such a move would enrage advocates of campaign finance reform, those Democrats say the potential benefits of freedom from spending restrictions, and the potential of having far more than $75 million for the fall, would outweigh the likely protest. 
 Collecting much more money, the advocates say, will not pose a great challenge, especially with all the excitement surrounding Mr. Kerry's naming Senator John Edwards as his running mate and doubly because Mr. Edwards could tap into his vast network of generous fellow trial lawyers.
 ''With Kerry and Edwards, I think there's not going to be a problem raising money,'' said Manuel Ortiz, a Washington lobbyist who has helped Mr. Kerry's campaign raise more than $500,000. ''I think they should consider it; I know they probably will consider it.''
 Another prominent fund-raiser for Mr. Kerry's campaign said: ''I think they ought to opt out. I don't think it makes sense to stay in the system. I think you could raise $30 million a month based on current trends.''
 Three people close to the campaign said the subject had arisen. A spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry, Stephanie Cutter, said he would not abandon public financing. 
 ''We are not going to opt out of the system,'' Ms. Cutter said. 
 She added that she did not know whether the finance team or Mr. Kerry had seriously considered rejecting public financing as they had in the primaries, but that she was sure it was not an alternative. 
 People like Mr. Ortiz indicated they would not let it go so easily. Aside from a level of confidence that comes with Mr. Kerry's fund-raising prowess, two concerns motivate the calls to forgo public financing. One is that with public financing Mr. Kerry is limited to spending the $75 million over three months while Mr. Bush can spend the same amount over two months. The clock starts with each candidate's official nomination. Mr. Bush is accepting on Sept. 2, and Mr. Kerry on July 29. 
 Another fear is that Mr. Kerry will accept public financing only to watch Mr. Bush, whose fund-raising topped his, later opt out of the program. 
 ''Bush can decide that he ain't going to do federal funding,'' said Tony Coelho, who for a time managed Al Gore's campaign in 2000 and is now urging Mr. Kerry to consider forgoing public money. ''He can go and spend $200 million, which he could raise. And Kerry would be stuck at $75 million.''
 Mr. Coelho said Mr. Bush should be asked for a formal promise to use public financing. Officials at Mr. Bush's campaign said they would not address such a hypothetical situation. A spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, Nicolle Devenish, said, ''We have no plans of opting out of public financing.'' 
 One campaign official said that stance could conceivably change if Mr. Kerry dropped out of the system. But even then it might not.
 Mr. Bush has less reason to opt out than Mr. Kerry, beyond the fact that he can use the public money in a shorter period. 
 Mr. Bush depends far more on face-to-face fund-raising, which requires candidates' time and travel, than Mr. Kerry, whose campaign has been more effective at raising money by telephone, the Internet and mailings. 
 According to finance records, Mr. Bush has averaged $13.5 million a month through electronic and regular mail and telephone banks. Mr. Kerry has averaged $25 million a month using those methods. 
 Mr. Kerry's fund-raisers said they believed that pace could continue.
 Others said Mr. Kerry would be taking a huge risk if he turned down public financing. As of May 31, the Kerry campaign has $27.7 million on hand compared with $63 million for Mr. Bush, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. Campaign officials said raising $100 million would take significant effort, whereas with public financing, the campaign would receive $75 million with no effort. 
 Although the Internet has had an important role, fund-raising always requires some time from a candidate.
 ''There's probably an economy of scale that comes into play in the fall,'' a senior aide to the Kerry campaign said. ''You don't want to set your schedule based on fund-raisers.'' 
 The aide noted that the donor-rich states like New York and California tended not to intersect with the electoral swing states like Ohio and West Virginia. 
 ''Taking time off the trail for that, there's a cost-benefit analysis,'' he said.
 Other people close to the campaign said one consideration would have to be a possibility of terrorists striking in the United States before the election, which could slow cash flow at a critical time. A large-scale attack, those people said, could close the postal system, knock out the Internet or cause financial gridlock in other ways. Public financing could free the campaign from such worries.
 Some of Mr. Kerry's fund-raisers seemed less than excited about raising more money. 
 ''It just means you've got to raise another $75 million into the funnel,'' said Mitchell W. Berger, a former campaign lawyer for Mr. Gore and a top fund-raiser for Mr. Kerry. 
 Mr. Berger said he equated forgoing public financing with throwing away free money, an especially unwise move when the Democratic National Committee is free to raise and spend money to forward the aims of Mr. Kerry's campaign after the convention. Still, the party is allowed to spend $16 million in coordination with the campaign. That means its cash would not be at the direct disposal of the campaign, and party leaders would try to determine the needs of the campaign. 
 A prominent fund-raiser who is pushing Mr. Kerry to opt out of public financing said donors were eager to keep the money flowing.
 ''We have people calling us,'' the fund-raiser said, ''and literally saying, 'How do I give before your deadline is up?' I've never seen anything like this before.''

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Charisma

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT. 
E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
At some point, if we're sane, we'll get past the explosion of superficiality that has accompanied John Kerry's selection of John Edwards as his running mate.
 Right now we're consumed with who has charisma and who doesn't, and such compelling matters as whether the candidates' wives get along.
 ''Do they really like each other?'' asked a breathless, straight-faced TV reporter, referring to Teresa Heinz Kerry and Elizabeth Edwards. Mr. Kerry himself contributed immeasurably to the foolishness by happily proclaiming that in addition to his team's grand vision and bold ideas, ''We've got better hair.'' 
 One of the more disturbing things about our presidential elections is the extent to which they can turn on criteria more suitable to high school campaigns. He's cute. Would you look at the way she dresses?
 Abe Lincoln, who was decidedly not cute, and F.D.R., with his wheelchair and Eleanor, wouldn't stand a chance in the current atmosphere.
 When we finally get serious, we'll see that we're facing one of the most important elections in American history. The nation is locked in a war in Iraq that we don't know how to win and don't know how to end. And the White House sent another tremor of fear through the country yesterday when it announced, with its usual absence of details, that Al Qaeda may try to disrupt the election.
 Domestically there are two very divergent paths looming on such issues as the economy and jobs, taxes, health care, Social Security and government support for education. It is in this area that the differences between the two major parties are starkest, and as the campaign unfolds it's likely that the clearest evidence of the divide will come not from the top of the respective tickets, but from John Edwards and Dick Cheney.
 This could be the most interesting fight of the campaign.
 Dick Cheney believes, and has acknowledged (which is rare), that one of the main reasons for cutting taxes is to starve the government of resources. In an interview published in The New Yorker in May 2001, the vice president said, ''If we collect those taxes, government'll spend 'em.''
 ''So to some extent,'' he added, ''by preventing government from collecting taxes that it currently has no use for, we avoid a situation in which we collect them and spend them and put them into the baseline to become a permanent part of the government.''
 That's a statement of values from a man who is proud of his hard-right political credentials. According to Time magazine, ''The Washington Post once referred to Cheney the congressman as a 'moderate,' prompting him to order an aide to call the paper's editors and 'suggest they look at my voting record.' ''
 As we've learned, there was nothing moderate about the Bush-Cheney tax cuts. They've transformed the Clinton-Gore surpluses into staggering budget deficits. And there was very little that was moderate about Mr. Cheney's voting record as a congressman from Wyoming. He opposed federal funding for abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. He voted against funding for Head Start, against subsidizing school lunches for poor children, against aid to college students and against the Older Americans Act, which offered nutrition and other services to the elderly.
 ''Cheney's voting record was slightly more conservative than mine,'' said Newt Gingrich a few years ago, ''but his style was not as confrontational.''
 Mr. Cheney's positions on some issues have no doubt evolved since the 1980's, but he has not undergone any transformation of values and still considers himself a ''hard-liner.'' In some ways he is more of an embodiment of the Bush administration than the president himself.
 Senator Edwards is as straightforward as the vice president about his own views and values, which can fairly be called populist. Mr. Edwards objects to what he calls the ''two Americas,'' and believes government has an obligation to try to maximize opportunities for everyone. ''We will say no,'' he says, ''to kids going hungry, to the kids who don't have the clothes to keep them warm, and no forever to any American working full time and living in poverty.''
 This will not be an election between tweedledum and tweedledee. Charisma and hairstyles aside, by November it should be apparent that voters will have a clear and unambiguous choice about the direction this nation is to travel over the next several years.

HEADLINE: US Airways Seeks New Cuts From Workers

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The financial problems at US Airways are putting the company at risk of losing its federal loan guarantees, its chief executive warned yesterday in a message to employees, pleading with them to accept a third round of cuts in wages and benefits.
 The warning by Bruce R. Lakefield came as the airline held discussions with the government about once again relaxing the terms of its $900 million guaranteed-loan package to stave off default, at least for a while, people who have been briefed on the negotiations said. 
 The Air Transportation Stabilization Board, set up by Congress after the Sept. 11 terror attacks to assist the airline industry, approved the loan guarantees to help US Airways, the nation's seventh-largest airline, emerge from bankruptcy in April 2003. 
 But since then, the airline has been buffeted by stiff competition from low-fare carriers, particularly Southwest Airlines, and by sharp increases in jet fuel prices. 
 The stabilization board has already agreed to modify the loan covenants of US Airways once, three months ago. Had it not done so, the airline would technically have been in default, and lenders could have called in its loans immediately, in all likelihood shutting the airline.
 The airline has also gone back to its workers for new concessions on top of the old. In May, as part of a $1.5 billion plan to restore its competitiveness, it began pushing its unions to agree to $800 million in new wage and benefit reductions. It won two rounds of cuts from its workers while in bankruptcy.
 In his recorded audio message to employees yesterday, Mr. Lakefield said US Airways might break even for the second quarter, a development he called ''a glimmer of good news.'' But the second quarter is traditionally US Airways' best, he noted, ''and we counted on it to carry us through the year.'' 
 Unless it can cut costs, Mr. Lakefield said, US Airways is in danger of posting losses in the third and fourth quarters in the range of its first-quarter loss of $177 million. With a break-even second quarter, that would leave the airline about $530 million in the red for the year. 
 A result like that would violate US Airways' pledge to post a sharply smaller loss in 2004 than the $655 million it lost in 2003, one condition of its revised loan package.
 ''We must stay in compliance of the conditions of our loan guarantee,'' Mr. Lakefield said, ''or we run the real risk of losing the cash from the loans.'' 
 Emphasizing the need to act quickly, Mr. Lakefield added, ''Without a lower cost structure, US Airways could just run out of steam sometime next year.'' He gave no specifics about what that meant.
 But the airline will face financial crises long before then. People briefed on the talks with the stabilization board said that they centered on the airline's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of cash flow from operations. The board's staff is concerned that US Airways did not do well enough in the second quarter to meet its target for that figure. 
 Final figures for the quarter are due to be reported on July 27, and that is when any modifications to the loan guarantee package would most likely be announced. The airline reported the first set of revisions along with its first-quarter results in April. 
 To obtain relief that time around, US Airways agreed to make an early loan payment of $250 million and promised to lose less money in 2004 than in 2003, to post an operating profit in 2005, and to keep $700 million in cash on hand at the end of each month, among other requirements.
 This time, people briefed on the talks said, the stabilization board may charge US Airways additional fees in exchange for new changes in the loan covenants. The government holds warrants good for a 10 percent stake in the airline.
 David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways, declined to discuss the latest negotiations. ''We have regular discussions and reviews with the A.T.S.B., but the details are proprietary,'' Mr. Castelveter said.
 The next date circled in red on US Airways' calendar comes at the end of September, when the airline must meet several financial goals -- a major reason that Mr. Lakefield has stressed wrapping up negotiations with its unions by then. So far, though, the airline has held talks only with its pilots' union, which has offered to accept a 12.5 percent pay cut and add five more hours a month to each pilot's regular work schedule.
 Representatives of the airline's flight attendants have said they will meet with the company, but the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing mechanics, has steadfastly refused to reopen its contract. 
 Phillip A. Baggaley, an airline analyst with Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, said the next two months were critical for US Airways. After Labor Day, air traffic tends to fall off significantly, and does not generally pick up again until Thanksgiving, making autumn a much harder time financially for the airlines than summer. 
 Complicating the situation, Southwest, which in May began flying to Philadelphia, one of US Airways' three hubs, has announced a broad autumn fare sale with low prices that take effect in August, much earlier in the year than usual. Mr. Baggaley said that move would put even more pressure on US Airways to cut its fares.
 ''This quarter is it for US Airways,'' he said. ''They've got to pull off their labor restructuring plan, or they are in trouble.'' 
 Mr. Lakefield expressed some optimism in his message to employees. ''We will get this done, and we will put US Airways back on the path to profitability,'' he said. ''There's too much at stake to simply cross our fingers and hope that things get better.''

HEADLINE: When It Positively Has to Be There Fast, J.F.K. Loses Ground

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
Kennedy Airport was once the gateway to the world: in the golden age of air travel it was the shining portal through which the endless tide of people and goods from across the globe entered or left the United States.
 The air cargo industry, feeding an insatiable demand for products from abroad, from semiconductors to sushi-grade tuna, has long been a mainstay of the city economy, employing 60,000 workers and sustaining 1,000 businesses at and near Kennedy, which for years was the top cargo airport in the world. 
 But in the past decade Kennedy's status as a cargo hub has steadily eroded. Choked off by a narrow, perpetually clogged highway -- the Van Wyck Expressway -- and facing stiff competition from newer airports across the country, Kennedy has slipped to fifth in the nation in air cargo tonnage. Fifteen years ago, it was the busiest cargo airport in the world. 
 The decline of the cargo industry in New York could be written off as inevitable, akin to the steady loss of manufacturing jobs, the blue-collar lifeblood of generations of New Yorkers. 
 But while manufacturing is in decline across the nation, the air cargo industry is growing rapidly. The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent forecast, released in March, predicted that the industry will grow by about 4.5 percent a year for the next decade, which could mean many new jobs at the airport. 
 Over the last 30 years, the number of jobs in New York has remained basically flat, but wages have risen sharply, reflecting the growth of salaries in fields like finance, law, insurance and real estate that have come to define New York as the hometown of global capitalism. 
 But industries that employed thousands of working-class New Yorkers, like manufacturing, have slowly disappeared. The city's unemployment rate remains well above the national average, and jobs for new arrivals with few skills and little education, like the immigrants who kept New York from losing population in the last census, are in short supply. 
 ''New York doesn't have a whole bunch of industries that have potential for significant growth,'' said Jonathan Bowles, research director of the Center for an Urban Future, who has written two studies outlining the decline of the air cargo industry at Kennedy. ''It is one of the industries that provides decent-paying blue-collar jobs. At a time when manufacturing jobs are in decline, we need to do what we can to support other sources of these kinds of jobs.''
 The struggle to keep air cargo aloft at Kennedy reflects many of the challenges facing dowdy, old-economy businesses that lack the pizzazz and high salaries that contributed to the 1990's boom. Attracting and keeping more air cargo business does not involve building shimmering new office towers, like the ones planned for Lower Manhattan and the far West Side, or the whiz-bang ingenuity that spurred the dot-com boom. Instead it requires some very mundane and potentially unpopular efforts, like expanding roads to make room for more trucks to get goods from the airport to their destinations in the city and beyond. 
 Yet the economic impact is profound. According to the Port Authority figures from 2003, the air cargo industry at Kennedy employs nearly 60,000 people at and around the airport, paying more than $2.6 billion in wages and generating $7.7 billion in economic activity. Based on these figures, the average wage for air cargo workers in 2003 was more than $43,000, which was higher than the Queens average of $37,719. 
 The number of jobs will doubtless increase as the industry grows. So far Kennedy is not keeping up with its competitors across the country, though government officials are now beginning to focus on the issue. According to the F.A.A.'s annual forecast, air cargo tonnage nationwide increased 7.2 percent in 2003 and will grow another 6.8 percent this year, but Kennedy grew by just 2.7 percent in 2003, according to Port Authority data, and has grown by an anemic 0.3 percent in the first four months of this year. Now that every state seems to have its own international airport, it is no longer a given that Kennedy will keep its share of the market. 
 Longtime cargo operators at Kennedy say that while the airport remains one of the best cargo hubs in the world, with some of the most sophisticated and extensive cargo-handling facilities and the ability to move incredibly delicate and precious items -- like diamonds, electronics and highly perishable food -- it has lost its competitive edge as the infrastructure surrounding the airport has crumbled and traffic has become a major headache. 
 The vast majority of cargo unloaded from planes is loaded onto trucks for distribution around the country. With just one road, the Van Wyck Expressway, available for trucks traveling from Kennedy, what should be a 30-minute drive into Manhattan can take hours. 
 ''The access issue is one of the major deterrents to growth at J.F.K.,'' said Peter Diefenbach, senior adviser to Nippon Cargo Airlines, a major shipper at Kennedy.
 The traffic, along with the overall high cost of doing business at Kennedy, prompted Nippon Cargo Airlines to shift a significant chunk of its business to O'Hare Airport in Chicago several years ago, Mr. Diefenbach said. 
 But solving the access problem is not easy. The opening of the Air Train is getting some cars off the Van Wyck, and Port Authority officials are optimistic that the number of train riders will continue to increase. But that alone will not solve the problem, and expanding the Van Wyck by a lane on each side or opening up the Grand Central Parkway to commercial vans, two other possible solutions, are likely to face huge public opposition. 
 ''This is a different world we live in than when Robert Moses was around,'' said Jim Larsen, president of the Air Cargo Association. ''Nobody can say we are going to rip down 60,000 homes and extend the Clearview Expressway to J.F.K. It just won't happen.'' 
 But speed is of the essence in the air cargo industry, said Lorena Murray, account manager for Alliance Airlines at Kennedy. 
 On a recent morning, a 9:30 a.m. flight from Santiago, Chile, arrived, its belly full of precious and perishable cargo -- stacks of gleaming gold bars headed for a bank vault, sea urchins caught in South American waters destined for Japan, waxy boxes of chrysanthemums and roses on their way to flower markets. 
 Ms. Murray's job is to get all of it out of her warehouse, a high-tech, low-slung building tucked off a runway at Kennedy, in an hour or less. 
 ''It is all about speed,'' she explained, as workers stacked coffin-size crates containing headless, gutted swordfish.
 But once that fresh fish leaves her warehouse on a refrigerated truck, it is anyone's guess when it will get to the Fulton Fish Market, or wherever else it may be headed. Because of traffic tie-ups, much of the overnight express mail business for New York has moved to Newark Liberty International Airport, accounting for much of the cargo growth there. 
 William R. DeCota, director of the Port Authority's Aviation Department, expressed optimism about the prospect of increasing Kennedy's share of the nation's air cargo boom. A decade-long effort to revitalize Kennedy's run-down passenger terminals and improve its internal roadways has helped make the airport a more attractive place to shippers, he said, pointing to several new cargo warehouses, many built with the help of the city's Industrial Development Agency. 
 ''We know cargo is going to grow and that we are going to gain good, solid jobs because of that growth,'' Mr. DeCota said. ''Clearly access is a place we need to do better. We need to sit down with the city and state to come up with solutions to the access problem.'' 
 Kate Ascher, vice president for infrastructure at the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that years of squabbling between City Hall and the Port Authority had hindered efforts to improve access to the airport, but that the relationship had improved. A task force of officials from each agency will begin meeting in a few months to come up with plans to improve access to Kennedy, Ms. Ascher said. 
 Mr. Bowles concluded in a report he wrote on Kennedy's cargo woes in November 2000, a year before Sept. 11 clobbered the industry, that ''without better access, the airport is going to die very slowly.'' He said that city, state and Port Authority officials seemed to be working toward a solution after years of inaction. 
 ''It has definitely been one of those industries that has been ignored for too long,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''It is not sexy, it is way out in eastern Queens. Most people are not even aware of its importance. For a long time the city and even the Port Authority didn't give it the attention it deserves.''

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Post Unexpectedly Strong Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Wholesale inventories rose 1.2 percent in May, more than forecast and the ninth consecutive gain, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, saying that companies kept more goods in stock to keep up with orders.
 More machinery, electrical equipment and imported cars brought the value of stockpiles to $305.5 billion, after a 0.2 percent gain in April, the department said. Sales increased 0.5 percent in May after a 0.9 percent rise. 
 Supplies at distribution centers, warehouses and terminals in May were enough to last 1.13 months at the current sales pace after April's record low of 1.12 months, the report said. The need to build inventories may spur economic growth for the rest of the year, said Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.
 Inventory rebuilding ''is now shifting into higher gear,'' he said. ''Producers will continue to scramble to catch up with demand and inventory accumulation may contribute as much as one percentage point to growth this year.''
 Economists had expected wholesale inventories to increase 0.5 percent in May, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. They had expected sales to rise 0.7 percent.
 Companies probably added $38 billion in inventories at an annual pace last quarter, according to a forecast by Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo. The economy may have grown 4.2 percent during the period, with inventories accounting for 1.5 percentage points of the increase, according to his projections.
 Inventory restocking contributed seven-tenths of a percentage point to growth in the first quarter when the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate, according to government figures. 
 Inventories of durable goods, which include cars, machinery and appliances, rose 1.5 percent in May, the biggest increase since November 1999, after rising 0.4 percent in April. Sales rose 0.1 percent after increasing 1.5 percent in April.

HEADLINE: Japan Premier Faces Tough Fight in Elections Tomorrow

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 9 

 BODY:
After three years in power, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan is losing his outsider magic and, analysts say, will be fighting for his political life in upper-house parliamentary elections on Sunday.
 With opinion polls showing his public approval ratings at their lowest since he took office in April 2001, Mr. Koizumi has desperately kicked his campaign into high gear. 
 He has promised to cut highway tolls, appointed a private sector executive to run the deficit-ridden national pension system and orchestrated an emotional airport reunion of a divided Japanese-American family, precisely in time for the main evening television news on Friday. 
 In Sunday's vote, Mr. Koizumi has set the bar low, hoping to win 50 of the 51 seats held now by his Liberal Democratic Party. But voter approval ratings for Mr. Koizumi have fallen to around 40 percent, from the 80 percent recorded during the last upper-house elections, three years ago. In past parliamentary elections Mr. Koizumi has served as the locomotive for his party.
 In fact, governing largely on his personal popularity and over the heads of party elders, he has managed to become Japan's longest-serving prime minister since Yasuhiro Nakasone in the 1980's. But this popularity was dented by pension changes that will raise premiums and cut benefits and by his dispatch of 550 Japanese soldiers to Iraq. 
 ''Did they shoot pistols? Did they shoot missiles? Did they shoot cannons?'' Nobuteru Ishihara, the minister of land, construction and transportation, said in support of Mr. Koizumi's action during a Thursday evening rush-hour campaign rally in the Ginza district. ''They did not. They are only doing humanitarian work that is welcomed by the Iraqi people, such as building schools and hospitals.''
 But after listening to the speech, Masahide Nakagawa, a 54-year-old clothing store owner, said he was angry that Mr. Koizumi announced on a visit to the United States last month that Japan would keep troops in Iraq indefinitely.
 ''Total nonsense,'' he said, arguing that Japan should hew to its constitutional ban on sending troops to overseas war zones. ''He did not even discuss it in the Diet,'' Japan's Parliament.
 Similarly, a recent poll found that 70 percent of voters disapproved of pension changes enacted last month. The changes were approved after it became known that several members of Parliament, including Mr. Koizumi, had not contributed to the pension system for years at a time. 
 A few days after the pension bill passed, the government released new demographic statistics showing that the birthrate had fallen even lower than the level used to calculate the premium increases. Living in a country where there are more dogs than children, many young workers do not pay pension premiums, believing that there will not be enough workers around to finance their pensions 30 or 40 years down the road.
 ''I am never going to see that pension money,'' Tomoko Koyama, 21, a college sociology major, said after the Ginza rally, adding that she did not plan to vote.
 In late May reporters started to focus on Mr. Koizumi's missing pension payments. He changed the subject by suddenly announcing a one-day trip to North Korea.
 On Friday night he reaped the fruits of that trip, providing a carefully timed happy chapter to a real-life soap opera that has gripped much of Japan's public for the last 21 months. As Japanese television transmitted live from Jakarta's international airport, Charles Robert Jenkins, an American accused of defecting while he served in the Army in Korea, descended the stairs of a charted Japanese jet into the outstretched arms of his Japanese wife, Hitomi Soga. 
 It is unclear how much this aura of good feelings will give the governing Liberal Democratic Party a lift on Sunday.
 The upper house largely has only a veto power, and only half of the 242 seats are up for election. But a poor showing would undermine Mr. Koizumi within his party and possibly even force him to resign. 
 ''Koizumi will stay in power,'' Takao Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline, a political newsletter, predicted Tuesday. ''But his leadership will decline, and he will not be able to pursue his own style.''
 Part of this comes from a feeling that despite an economic recovery, Mr. Koizumi has not delivered much beyond sound-bite slogans for television.
 ''The gap between what he's said and what he's done have disappointed people, and this became the cause of the decline of his popularity,'' Takashi Tachibana, an author, said last week. Referring to the Liberal Democratic Party, he added: ''Koizumi's supporting rate has always exceeded L.D.P.'s. And L.D.P. has enjoyed its supporting rate with a Koizumi premium. But these days, Koizumi's premium is running down.''
 Although the party has run Japan for all but 10 months during the last half-century, its machine is decaying. 
 ''Medical associations, agricultural co-ops, post office chief's associations are traditional bases for the party's strength,'' Mr. Toshikawa said. ''It has been revealed that these organizations have much declined and have been unable to function as vote collection machines.''
 The machine was once so efficient that Mr. Koizumi's predecessor, Yoshiro Mori, told undecided voters in 2000 that they should stay at home. He told reporters: ''They say 40 percent of the voters are still undecided. Those people who aren't interested should just stay in bed.''
 In 1998, Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to resign as prime minister following a disastrous performance by the party in an upper-house election in which it won only 44 seats.
 Many voters have said they plan to vote for the Democratic Party of Japan, set up to support free trade. ''The Japan of today has lost direction,'' Katsuya Okada, the leader of the party, said in its platform. ''It is going around in circles, unable to take advantage of that superb characteristic of the Japanese people, their industriousness.'' 
 But now it is unclear who will win the day on Sunday. A survey by the daily Asahi Shimbun indicated that respondents who said they were very interested in the election tended to be planning to vote for the Democratic Party. 
 ''It's a close contest, isn't it?'' Mr. Koizumi told reporters after he made a campaign speech in Hirosaki, in northern Japan. ''Losing is not a consideration.''
 ''I cannot step down right now, '' he said Sunday at another campaign speech. ''I have a lot of things to do. My duty is to put reform on the right track.''

HEADLINE: Child Photographers Show Lives of Hardship and Hope

BYLINE: By JULIE SALAMON

 BODY:
Judging from an unusual visual diary on display in a Manhattan art gallery, the globalization of childhood has a long way to go.
 In the fall of 2002, a British charity supplied 13 Afghan girls, ages 10 to 14, with cameras and instructions to photograph their everyday existences. They produced images of bombed buildings, child laborers and wall drawings identifying different kinds of mines.
 The accompanying texts deepen the poignancy. ''My neighbor used to collect steel, and he thought a mine was steel he could recycle and took it,'' one girl writes in her photo caption. ''He now cannot walk -- he has lost a foot and a hand.'' 
 Another, explaining her photo of a woman wrapped in a burka and why she does not want to wear one: ''Women have to do exactly the same as men, the same amount of work, but they are not treated the same.''
 The Afghan pictures are part of ''Unbroken: Photography Subjects Speak Out,'' a show at Denise Bibro Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea, through next Saturday. This collection of 60 photographs includes works by children from Kabul, Afghanistan's capital; the streets of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam; refugee camps in Nepal; and a school for the mentally and physically disabled in Bogota, Colombia. The show was sponsored by K'ipay, a Bogota school for the disabled, and PhotoVoice, a nonprofit organization in London, founded in 1998 to teach needy people how to use cameras (and whose financial backers include The Economist magazine and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund).
 How did such worthiness find its way to a commercial art gallery in fashionable Chelsea? By means of George A. Carrano, the retired Metropolitan Transportation Authority official responsible for swapping tokens for Metrocards. Mr. Carrano, who retired from the M.T.A. in 2000, was on vacation in London a couple of years ago when he wandered into a PhotoVoice exhibition in the basement of a church.
 ''For me, these photographs turned photojournalism on its head by putting the cameras into the hands of the people who are usually the subjects,'' Mr. Carrano said in an interview at the gallery. He elaborated on what inspired his passion. ''It's like a Fellini film, all this despair, and at the end, this sense of optimism.''
 He was moved by pictures like ''Selling Newspapers,'' a photograph of a delicate young boy in Ho Chi Minh City, holding a newspaper under one arm, gazing with tired eyes at the camera. The caption by the photographer, Vo Cong Thang, expresses that kind of optimism -- or at least the desire for it: ''Through my photos I want to show homeless children, try everywhere to earn money, they have their jobs: shoeshine, selling lottery tickets. They are not involved in crime, drugs or 'bad' things as many people believe.''
 While Mr. Carrano had always been interested in photographs, he had traveled far more extensively in the five boroughs than around the world. The places represented by the young PhotoVoice photographers were foreign to him. He became determined to give such pictures a wider audience in New York and became a PhotoVoice volunteer.
 He arranged a small exhibition 18 months ago in a converted Army barracks in Rockaway, Queens. ''It was hard to get to,'' he acknowledged. Then he managed to put 20 of the photographs on display at Columbia University last fall.
 Those who saw the Columbia exhibition included Anna Lise Jensen, a photographer and flight attendant who had begun a similar participatory photography project at the K'ipay school in Bogota. She met with Mr. Carrano and, through friends, approached Ms. Bibro, the gallery owner, about mounting a show of the children's work.
 Ms. Bibro has a commercial gallery but was known to have a soft spot for underdogs. ''I represent a few artists you would not consider financially viable, but who I think are doing important work,'' she said. Among them are Carol Jacobsen, an associate professor at the University of Michigan who specializes in works about women in prison and who donated a couple of pieces to an auction Ms. Bibro is sponsoring to raise money for PhotoVoice. 
 ''One of the reasons people have galleries is to educate and enlighten the public,'' Ms. Bibro said. ''Some galleries don't want to remember that.''

HEADLINE: Tilting at Windbags: A Crusade Against Rank

BYLINE: By JULIE SALAMON

 BODY:
Western society has denounced racism, sexism and anti-Semitism, mobilized against ageism and genderism, anguished over postcolonialism and nihilism, taken arms against Marxism, totalitarianism and absolutism, and trashed, at various conferences and cocktail parties, liberalism and conservatism. 
 Is it possible there is yet another ism to mobilize against?
 Robert W. Fuller, a boyishly earnest 67-year-old who has spent most of his life in academia, thinks so, and he calls it ''rankism,'' the bullying behavior of people who think they are superior. The manifesto? Nobodies of the world unite! -- against mean bosses, disdainful doctors, power-hungry politicians, belittling soccer coaches and arrogant professors. 
 ''I wanted a nasty word for the crime, an unpleasant word, a stinky word,'' he said, referring to his choice of the word rankism. ''Language is incredibly important in making political change. I always go back to that word sexism and how it became the catalyst for a movement.'' 
 Mr. Fuller wants nothing less than moral as well as behavioral accountability from the people in charge, whether of governments, companies, patients, employees or students. And he pitches his quixotic notion in a book, a Web site (breakingranks.net), in radio interviews and in lectures at universities and business gatherings that could be considered breeding farms for somebodies.
 ''The theory has the potential to explain many things we just ignore as a given,'' said Camilo Azcarate, Princeton University's ombudsman, who recently attended one of Mr. Fuller's lectures and bought several copies of his book to give to friends. Democracy and education should concentrate on creating virtuous citizens. This is exactly the kind of discussion we need to have.''
 Mr. Fuller began postulating these theories on the Internet several years ago, and then brought them together last year in a book called ''Somebodies and Nobodies'' (New Society Publishers), published recently in paperback. He can't answer how, exactly, his lofty ideas might translate into political or legal action. ''I don't see the form the movement will take,'' he confessed in an interview at his home in Berkeley. ''But I don't feel too bad about it because Betty Friedan told me she didn't have any idea there would be a women's movement when she wrote 'The Feminine Mystique.' You need five years of consciousness-raising before you find the handle.''
 Ms. Friedan provided a blurb for his book. Other supporting blurbers include Bill Moyers, the political scientist Frances Fukuyama and the author Studs Terkel. So far the book has sold 33,000 copies (including bulk sales); and his Web site totals 2,000 to 3,000 visitors a week, his Web master, Melanie Hart, said. 
 Mr. Fuller's appeal nonetheless eludes some critics. In one of the few reviews of ''Somebodies and Nobodies,'' Clay Evans, books editor of The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colo., was dismissive. Mr. Fuller's concepts, he wrote, ''were old when Jesus was making fishers of men.'' 
 But with others, he has struck a chord. Among the 2,000 people who had downloaded a working manuscript of his were Mary Lou and Ann Richardson, two sisters living in Roanoke, Va. They were so inspired by that early version that they eventually met with Mr. Fuller after the book was published. The women, Ann Richardson said, had been taking care of an aging mother with Parkinson's disease and were distressed by how people's treatment of her changed after she lost her ability to speak. They were not happy with the way their siblings responded either.
 ''I couldn't believe that people who loved me could harm me because of the perceived rank they had in the family,'' said Ann Richardson, 46, who used to work as a customer services manager for a graphic arts company in Washington, and is now studying film and photography at Hollins University in Roanoke.
 The sisters began their own Dignitarian Foundation, described on its Web site (dignitarians.org) as ''an organization dedicated to promoting and protecting the intrinsic right to human dignity.'' Ann Richardson said her motive was simple: ''If I can help some people start believing in themselves, it would make the world a much better, more peaceful place.'' 
 This was not the role Mr. Fuller seemed destined to fulfill. Designated a math and science whiz kid, he entered Oberlin College at age 15, expecting to follow the path of his father, Calvin S. Fuller, a physicist at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey who was co-inventor of the solar cell. After Oberlin, Mr. Fuller accumulated credentials with breathtaking speed. By 18 he was enrolled in graduate school at Princeton. At 33 he was named president of Oberlin. 
 In between he learned about politics at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris and economics at the University of Chicago, helped write a significant physics text (''Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics'' (Addison Wesley Publishing Company), taught at Columbia University, did a fellowship at Wesleyan University and was dean of faculty at Trinity College in Hartford.
 His peripatetic intellectual ambitions coincided with an era of social upheaval. Mr. Fuller left for Oberlin as an undergraduate in 1952, thinking Dwight D. Eisenhower was the perfect next president. By the time he returned to Oberlin as its president in 1970, he was ready to lead the college through the revolutions of the period -- making changes in admissions policies for African-American students, abolishing course requirements, ending parietal hours. 
 Then, after 22 years on the academic fast track, he quit -- at age 37. He left Oberlin and his first wife, with whom he had had two children, and traveled around the world for three months. Then he settled in Berkeley where, he said, ''I sat still for two years, read 200 books and completely re-educated myself.'' Among other things, he began to realize his role model may have been his mother, Willmine Works Fuller. ''She wasn't very concerned about social justice, but if someone tried to step on her toes, watch out,'' Mr. Fuller said, recalling a protest his mother organized against putting an airport near his hometown of Chatham, N.J. ''She could not stand to be pushed around by those in authority or bullies.'' Nor was she particularly touchy-feely: she once kept her son confined to his room for 48 hours because he refused to eat his spinach.
 He became obsessed with the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. ''The bomb makes nobodies of all of us, that's how I put it now,'' he said. With a new wife, and eventually two more children in tow (a third wife would come still later) he began traveling through the Soviet Union, paying for the expeditions by giving speeches and raising money from philanthropists. Calling himself a citizen diplomat, he helped arrange televised discussions between Soviet and American scientists via satellite links.
 ''He believes it's possible to work through the cracks of the monolith,'' said Kim Spencer, formerly a producer for ABC News and now president of Link TV, a satellite network that features documentaries from around the world. Mr. Spencer worked with Mr. Fuller on the Soviet programs and remains a friend. ''When I was putting together a TV network I had to go out for a walk with Bob to see the bigger thing,'' he added.
 In 1987, Mr. Fuller found a crucial advocate for his expensive self-discovery -- Robert Cabot, a novelist and diplomat, but also heir to a family fortune. They traveled together to the Soviet Union, Afghanistan and China and together wrote a few articles. Mr. Cabot put money into some of Mr. Fuller's citizen-diplomacy projects, which always struggled for financing.
 One day Mr. Cabot decided to become Mr. Fuller's patron. For 15 years he paid him to think -- and to travel, expenses paid. No rankism there: Mr. Cabot included pension payments, which kicked in two years ago when Mr. Fuller turned 65.
 How does Mr. Cabot feel about the way his money has been spent? ''I am immensely gratified,'' he said. ''I think we are witnessing an extreme abuse of rankism in Washington, D.C., right now. Our policy in the Middle East is rankism.''
 Mr. Fuller acknowledges that rankism is harder to pin down than other more apparent forms of discrimination -- sex, race and disability. ''We try to sniff how much power each of us has by asking: 'What do you do? Where did you go to school? Who's your husband?' '' said Mr. Fuller. ''It's like trying to find out if someone's gay or not, if they're a threat to us or if we can get away with abusing or exploiting them.'' 
 Mr. Fuller isn't calling for an end to hierarchy, but neither is he simply asking for mere politeness. Yes, national leaders should refrain from cursing at one another in public places; executives should treat subordinates with respect. But more controversially, he would get rid of faculty tenure at universities, which he calls ''an outdated sacrosanct privilege of a few somebodies held at the expense of many nobodies.'' 
 He urges people to remember that rank is mutable: you can be a nobody at work and a somebody at home, or vice versa. And, he points out, almost everyone eventually ''gets nobodied.'' 
 The tall and lanky Mr. Fuller, whose presentation can be stiff and formal, doesn't rouse his audiences with smooth patter and startling revelations of abuse he's suffered. But his reflective, old-fashioned professorial approach to his sometimes glib, populist theories has been taken in some quarters as a refreshing whiff of sincerity in a skeptical age.
 When he spoke at Mount Holyoke College last September, Andrea Ayvazian, dean of religious life, was surprised to see how mixed the audience was: students, faculty members, administrators, staff members and campus workers. ''Bob's analysis freed people who considered themselves low in the hierarchy to tell their stories,'' said Dr. Ayvazian, who was a student of Mr. Fuller's 30 years earlier. ''I saw this had struck a chord in unpredictable circles.''


CORRECTION-DATE: July 13, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in Arts & Ideas on Saturday about a campaign by Robert W. Fuller, an academic, against what he calls rankism misidentified an author who provided a blurb for his book ''Somebodies and Nobodies.'' It was Bill Moyer, the social activist who wrote ''Doing Democracy,'' not the television journalist Bill Moyers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Investigative Journalist Is Shot to Death in Russia

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS and SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY; Erin Arvedlund contributed reporting from Moscow for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 10 

 BODY:
A prominent American journalist who had written incisively about the connections of politics, business and crime in Russia throughout its post-Soviet reorganization was shot to death Friday night outside the magazine offices where he worked.
 Paul Klebnikov, the editor in chief of Forbes Russia magazine, was shot four times as he left work and walked toward a nearby subway station, a local radio station reported. The radio cited witnesses who said he was shot by a bearded man who had stepped from a car.
 Mr. Klebnikov, 41, had moved to Moscow last year to open Forbes Russia, a Russian edition of the American business magazine, at which he had worked since 1989. Under his editorship, Forbes Russia published its first issue in April. 
 The magazine was published during a crackdown on the independent media here, but Mr. Klebnikov had vowed he would not be deterred.
 ''Forbes has over the decades won a reputation for independence, and we don't want to give that away lightly,'' he said at the magazine's introduction. 
 Mr. Klebnikov's brand of investigative journalism had long irritated many of Russia's elite. The new magazine under his stewardship bore his stamp.
 In May it published a list of Russia's 100 wealthiest business people, including 36 billionaires. Such lists are sensitive in a country with high rates of poverty and unemployment and a common belief that many of today's wealthiest Russians had swindled public resources during the early and murky years of post-Communist privatization.
 Although no motive for the killing was immediately clear in the hours after his death, the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization based in New York, noted both the difficult climate for the news media here and the sensitivity of the list of 100 wealthiest Russians. It urged the Russian authorities to investigate the case thoroughly.
 ''Russia is consistently one of the world's most dangerous places to be a journalist, and we call on the Russian authorities to aggressively investigate and prosecute this case,'' said the committee's director, Ann Cooper.
 A descendant of emigres who had fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, Mr. Klebnikov was born in New York, the son of an interpreter at the United Nations. Like many of these descendants, he had remained deeply connected to his family's heritage, and had traveled to Russia after the Soviet Union's collapse.
 As a correspondent with both an economics background and fluency in the Russian language, Mr. Klebnikov was especially well equipped to report on Russia's new political and business class. 
 In his work, he had been sharply critical of Boris Berezovsky, the media and oil magnate who was influential in former President Boris Yeltsin's administration, but who later sought asylum in Britain, saying he was marked for murder in Russia.
 Mr. Klebnikov wrote two books. The first, ''Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism,'' was a biography of Mr. Berezovsky. The second, ''Conversation With a Barbarian,'' dealt with organized crime in Russia's continuing war in Chechnya.
 Mr. Klebnikov was married and left three children. Steve Forbes, president and editor in chief of Forbes, sent condolences to the family in a statement from New York. 
 ''Paul was superb reporter -- courageous, energetic, ever-curious,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''We eagerly anticipated reading his stories. The information was always fresh, insightful, fascinating. He exemplified the finest traditions of our profession and served his readers well.''
 The killing of Mr. Klebnikov follows the general tightening of independent news media in Russia. Television here has gradually slipped under effective control of the state. Just hours before Mr. Klebnikov was fatally shot, the program ''Freedom of Speech,'' the last live political talk show in Russia, broadcast what appeared to be its final show. And last month, Leonid Parfyonov, who was host of a popular and provocative current affairs program, was fired after broadcasting an interview with the widow of a former president of Chechnya who was killed by a car bomb in Qatar in February. 
 Mr. Parfyonov said the authorities had asked him not to broadcast the interview. Two Russian intelligence officers were recently convicted of the killing.
 Both of these programs appeared on the network NTV, which had come under serious pressure after a ''Freedom of Speech'' program in October 2002 featured relatives of hostages pleading with the Russian government not to storm a Moscow theater that had been seized by Chechen rebels. The government attacked the theater nonetheless. More than 120 people died.
 The channel's troubles began almost immediately after President Vladimir V. Putin came to power. Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the founder and owner of the Media Most empire of which the channel was part, was briefly jailed, then forced to cede control and leave the country.

HEADLINE: Malpractice Payouts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Medical Liability Reform'' (letter, July 2), Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, former president of the American Medical Association, refers to ''tidbits'' cited by Bob Herbert in a column last month that criticized the position of the A.M.A. and the insurance industry on the malpractice insurance ''crisis.''
 Dr. Palmisano refers to a single sentence in the earlier of two General Accounting Office reports about increased malpractice awards, even though the most thorough study on this topic, by Americans for Insurance Reform, says that payouts per malpracticing doctor have been flat since the mid-1980's when adjusted for medical inflation. 
 Moreover, that sentence is contradicted by the rest of the 65-page report.
 Malpractice premiums are too high because of insurance industry practices -- but then, so are the industry's record profits. 
 Taking away the legal rights of America's families and penalizing the most seriously injured victims of malpractice cannot be the answer.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Aloof, So Far, From Latest Incentive War

BYLINE: By FARA WARNER

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 9 

 BODY:
While General Motors and Ford are increasing incentives to combat slipping market share and rising inventories, Chrysler is holding back as it makes inroads on its two main rivals. 
 G.M. announced this week that it was increasing its incentives on 2004 trucks and sport utility vehicles to $5,000, from $4,000, and is offering $4,000 cash back on most of its cars. It also expanded the rebates to include anyone who walks into the showroom. In June, the offer was only open to current owners of G.M. vehicles. 
 Ford has increased its incentives on Explorers to $4,000 and has put a $5,000 cash rebate on its newest minivan, the Freestar. Both are keeping no-interest loan offers in the market despite the Federal Reserve's increase in its benchmark rate in late June.
 But Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, which once had some of the highest incentives in the industry, is not drastically increasing its rebates as it enjoys surging sales from its new Chrysler 300 and strong advance orders for the Dodge Magnum station wagon. 
 ''We're comfortable with where we are with incentives,'' said Gary Dilts, executive vice president for sales at the Chrysler Group. ''We've got a bunch of new products and we're competitively priced.''
 G.M. and Ford are also sitting on very high inventories going into the summer. G.M. had more than 1.3 million cars and trucks on dealer lots at the end of June, giving it an 89-day supply -- more than 30 days above the industry average. Ford's inventory is 949,000 vehicles, or a 84-day supply, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks such data. That level is higher than the company would like, George Pipas, chief sales analyst for Ford, said during a conference call July 1 to discuss the company's sales figures. 
 Chrysler, on the other hand, has an inventory of 605,000 vehicles, which translates into a 72-day supply.
 Disappointing June sales touched off the new round of incentives from G.M. and Ford. Double-digit declines last month highlighted a downward trend in their overall market share for the first six months of the year despite increased incentives in May and June. 
 In the first six months of the year, G.M.'s market share in the United States has slipped to 26.8 percent, from 27.2 percent, in the period a year earlier, according to the Autodata Corporation, and Ford's market share has dropped almost a full percentage point to 18.8 percent this year, from 19.9 percent, a year earlier.
 Chrysler, however, has been able to push its market share up in a very competitive market, to 13.5 percent, in the first six months, from 13.4 percent. That is in sharp contrast to last summer, when Chrysler was in danger of losing its No.3 position in the United States auto market. In August 2003, Toyota outpaced the company to become the third-best-selling brand in this country. 
 While Chrysler's incentives did increase in the first six months of this year, the company began slowly decreasing them last month, compared with its domestic competitors. According to data compiled by Autodata, Chrysler's incentives in June this year were down 1.2 percent, from June 2003, to an average of $3,659 for each vehicle. Both G.M. and Ford increased their incentives in June, with Ford up 5.4 percent, to $3,679 on average, and G.M. up 4 percent, to $4,091, the highest in the industry.
 But with the onslaught of the new bigger incentives from G.M. and Ford, it may be far tougher to gain market share for all brands, especially in competitive areas like trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
 ''This is going to put added pressure on Nissan and Toyota, whose newer full-size S.U.V.'s and trucks aren't cross-shopped and may not have as high a brand loyalty as Ford and Chevy,'' said Mark McCready, director of pricing strategy at CarsDirect.com, a Web site that offers consumers leads to thousands of dealers. 
 Indeed, Asian automakers had been somewhat insulated from the pricing battles among G.M., Ford and Chrysler because many shoppers do not move between domestic and foreign brands. 
 But over the last six months, Toyota, Honda and Nissan have all increased their incentives, according to Autodata, in an effort to remain competitive and to hold on to the market share they have captured over the last several years. 
 Asian brands, including the Korean makers Hyundai and Kia, captured 34.4 percent of the market in the first six months of this year, while American automakers' share slipped to a historic low of 59 percent. European automakers made up the balance with a 6.6 percent share. 
 Honda has made some of the biggest leaps in incentives in the first six months of the year, according to Autodata. It has more than doubled them, to an average of $1,011 a vehicle, from $479, in the period a year earlier. 
 ''Spending is up across the board. It has gotten into the consumers' mind-set that they are going to get a great deal on a car,'' said Andy Boyd, a Honda spokesman. ''But we're still trying to fight the good fight. We don't give direct customer cash back; instead our spending is more on leasing and interest rates.''
 Even the resurgent Chrysler, which introduced its 2005 models earlier than its competitors, cannot step away completely from the incentives battle, given how competitive the market has become this summer and how fickle consumers can be. 
 ''I do think being the first one out with 2005 models put them at a short-term advantage,'' said David Lucas, a vice president at Autodata. ''I don't know if the advantage will be there in September, October and November.''
 ''These days, the initial excitement for vehicles has a very short duration,'' he added.
 Mr. Dilts said Chrysler would continue to offer a $1,000 cash-back offer on many of its vehicles, including the popular 300C, for people who decide to finance their cars through the company's financial unit, Chrysler Financial. 
 ''We've also sweetened the deal on the Pacifica,'' he said, referring to the new large station wagon that showed sputtering sales in June. The company put a $4,000 cash incentive on that vehicle this month. 
 No matter what the company decides to do with incentives as the summer stretches on, Mr. Dilts said he would keep them as simple as possible for the customer to understand. ''If you confuse them with what the deal is, you run the risk of losing that customer.''

HEADLINE: In the Ancient Streets of Najaf, Pledges of Martyrdom for Cleric

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NAJAF, Iraq, July 6 

 BODY:
Like posters advertising a rapper's latest release, Moktada al-Sadr's hectoring, finger-pointing portrait is plastered across the old quarter here. 
 The 10th-century Imam Ali shrine, one of the most revered sites in Shiite Iraq, where once pilgrims came by the millions to kiss the giant wooden doors, is under the control of his ragtag militia. His men, even after bruising battles with American troops, still guard the checkpoints leading to the old city. His recruits, some too young to shave, stand sentry at the shrine gates, barking at women old enough to be their mothers. 
 At 23, with no more than a primary school education and a short stint as a soldier in Saddam Hussein's army, Mustafa Jabbar says he and his wife stand ready to be martyrs for Mr. Sadr's movement. If need be, he said, they will volunteer their first born as well, a baby boy, now 45 days old. ''I will put mines in the baby and blow him up,'' Mr. Jabbar said. He has named the baby Moktada. 
 Mr. Sadr's dominion over this sacred centerpiece of Iraq's Shiite heartland is nothing short of extraordinary. The shrine is a no-go area to the Iraqi police. The fledgling Iraqi Army has not ventured anywhere near. American soldiers, once under orders to arrest the renegade preacher in connection with the murder of a rival cleric, are posted on the fringes of town, unable to enter the city center under the terms of the truce struck with the Mahdi Army.
 On this scorching afternoon, many shops around the shrine remained shuttered. The hotels in town were closed or empty or bombed out. Even with an end to fighting, Najaf's economy, dependent on the waves of Shiite pilgrims from as far as the Indian subcontinent, was sagging. 
 All day long, pallbearers marched into the shrine's courtyard, carrying coffins on their shoulders. Shiites from all over the country covet a burial place near the shrine, where Ali, the seventh-century Shiite master, is entombed. Their chants could be heard throughout the day: ''God is great. There is no God but Allah.'' Out front, vendors sold blond-haired dolls and toy guns.
 Like Falluja in Sunni territory, how to manage Najaf, and the enfant terrible who has seized some of its most precious real estate, today represents a crucial test of Iraqi government authority. 
 For Iraq's new prime minister, Iyad Allawi, much is at stake. Mr. Sadr, 31, is a neophyte cleric with unalloyed political ambition and widespread popular appeal, particularly among disaffected Shiite youth. How Mr. Sadr is handled by this government also matters to other Shiite leaders, including Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric. 
 The stalemate cannot go on forever, Najaf's American-appointed governor, Adnan al-Zurfi, maintains. ''They need to finish this story pretty quickly,'' Mr. Zurfi said, referring to Mr. Sadr's movement. ''We need to finish this story pretty quickly.''
 Two delicate imperatives are the key to doing that: the demobilization of Mr. Sadr's scrappy but devoted Mahdi Army, and the fate of the arrest warrant against him.
 Since taking the official reins on June 28, Mr. Allawi has made no mention of the arrest warrant. Rather, in behind-the-scenes negotiations with Mr. Sadr's group, government officials and Shiite political leaders are weighing the possibility of either letting the matter lie low for the time being or compelling Mr. Sadr to face charges before a Shariah, or Islamic, court, where, as the scion of a prominent clerical family, he is likely to get a sympathetic hearing. 
 Meanwhile, efforts are under way to nudge him into the political mainstream. Here in Najaf, where two months of fierce fighting between American troops and Mr. Sadr's militia has all but dried up the pilgrim traffic and crippled the local economy, rival Shiite leaders are also counting on his popularity to wane. 
 Mr. Sadr, sources close to the negotiations say, would prefer to appear before a court only after an elected government takes over. Publicly, through a spokesman, he has lambasted Mr. Allawi's cabinet as ''illegitimate.'' 
 [At Friday Prayer on July 9 in Kufa, Najaf's twin city, a statement delivered on behalf of Mr. Sadr characterized the Allawi government as having been ''installed by the occupier'' and issued this defiant warning, ''Any attack to any member of the resistance, be it Sunni or Shia, will be considered an act of aggression against the entire Iraqi people.'' ]
 Judging from his muddled, sometimes contradictory statements, Mr. Sadr appears to be treading a fine line himself when it comes to defining his relations with the new government. He has dismissed it as a pawn of the American occupation, but he has not ruled out cooperation either. 
 He has ordered his militia men from outside Najaf to go home. But he has also defied appeals to disband. He has said he will cooperate with the Iraqi police, but less than a month ago his men stormed a police station in Najaf, freeing prisoners and opening up the precinct to looters. His comments about the Iraqi Army have been mixed. 
 ''Today we don't have confidence in them,'' his spokesman, Ahmed al-Shebani, said in an interview Tuesday in an office on the grounds of the Imam Ali shrine. Then he softened his stance. ''We consider the Iraqi Army as our own brothers,'' he said. ''They are our citizens, and we will cooperate with them.''
 Mr. Shebani said his group remained ''cautious'' about the new government. But he also suggested for the first time that if only Mr. Allawi's government would present a timeline for the withdrawal of American troops from all of Iraq, the Mahdi Army would cooperate. Until now, Mr. Sadr has insisted on the immediate and outright withdrawal of foreign forces. ''He has to force the occupation forces to leave, if not now, then in the future,'' Mr. Shebani said. 
 The government's first olive branch -- an offer of amnesty for insurgents -- Mr. Sadr has rejected outright. ''Amnesty is for criminals,'' Mr. Shebani said flatly. ''The Mahdi Army is not criminals. It is a popular resistance fighting for the independence of Iraq.''
 The most powerful weapon in the hands of Mr. Sadr, who has come to embody the anti-American resistance, is neither his militia (it suffered heavy losses in the April-May battles with United States troops) nor his clerical standing (he is not yet an ayatollah and therefore is unable to issue fatwas, or edicts). It is, rather, the mantle of family history: his father and uncle were both famously persecuted by the Saddam Hussein government. 
 Martyrdom is a hallmark of Shiite theology, and Mr. Sadr plays the martyr card exceptionally well. He has appeared before crowds in a white funeral shroud. He has said he in unafraid to die.
 Such gestures have fed the fervor of young men like Mr. Jabbar. All five of Mr. Jabbar's brothers, natives of the Baghdad slum, Sadr City, which forms Mr. Sadr's base, signed up to join the Mahdi Army a year ago. He alone moved to Najaf with his wife, to stand at Mr. Sadr's side. ''He is an honest man, a faithful man, and he is brave,'' Mr. Jabbar said of his leader. ''For us, he represents the path Iraq must follow.''
 Mr. Jabbar, a man with deep-set eyes and a dirty T-shirt, sat in an alley that veers off the shrine. In normal times, these winding ancient paths, full of bookstalls and bakers, would be lined with Shiite pilgrims from across the world. 
 The Mahdi Army's one concession, made in exchange for the withdrawal of American troops from Najaf, is to squirrel away their guns and grenades. They have suffered heavy casualties. Yet Mr. Sadr has refused to dissolve the militia.
 Whatever the means, it is clear that the key to disarming the Mahdi Army is to offer Mr. Sadr an exit strategy from the arrest warrant hanging over his head. On the one hand, said Salama al-Khafaji, a member of Dawa, a major Shiite political party, who is helping negotiate with the Mahdi Army, the government ought to insist that even a figure as popular as Mr. Sadr answer to the law. At the same time, Mrs. Khafaji warned, it must be done delicately, so as not to provoke what she called ''the Iraqi street.'' 
 ''Our main job is to create a role for them in the state,'' she said, referring to Mr. Sadr's movement. 
 Likewise, Governor Zurfi, who has openly called for the Mahdi Army to disband and quit Najaf, continues to advise against arresting Mr. Sadr. Even his detractors, Mr. Zurfi argued, would not countenance his humiliation, if not for his sake, then for his family's. ''He represents the whole history of the Sadr family,'' Mr. Zurfi warned. ''It's not about Moktada himself.''
 Would Mr. Sadr accept a renewed invitation into politics? A coy Mr. Shebani said Tuesday that his leader did not necessarily want a direct role in governing Iraq, nor, apparently, the accountability that comes with it.
 ''Sayeed Moktada Sadr,'' said Mr. Shebani, using the title bestowed on descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, ''can mobilize the Iraqi people with one word. It's better for him to watch this government than to be a part of it.''

HEADLINE: Winning Between The Lines

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Want to know who is going to win the presidential election?
 Look at the party platforms. 
 True, few voters actually read party platforms, which are intended to be statements of the party's positions and proposals. And who can blame them? The documents -- often leaden, homogenized and full of generic campaign-speak -- can send even the most ardent political observer into the deepest of slumbers. 
 But an analysis of both parties' platforms since 1960 suggests that their length and content can be remarkably helpful in gauging a party's health and, in the end, its chances of electoral success.
 For example, a simple factor like the platform's page count correlates strongly to the party's success in winning the White House -- in inverse proportion. Since 1960, the average page count of the Democrats' platforms in losing years was 82, nearly double the average from winning years, which was 46. The longest platforms, at 128 and 124 pages, came during the disastrous elections of 1980 and 1984, respectively. (The only exception to this rule has been the shortest modern platform: the 16-page document that kicked off Michael Dukakis's woeful 1988 campaign.)
 Another platform indicator is the candidate-to-opponent ratio. In 1984, the Democrats, in their hulking platform, found it almost impossible to spell out their policies without reference to the Republicans. Ronald Reagan, for example, was mentioned 213 times, while Walter Mondale, the nominee, didn't come up once -- and he lost in a rout. Republicans tried the same tactic in 1996, singling out Bill Clinton 153 times -- and giving Bob Dole a paltry 45 mentions. If the strategy was to rally the base, it fell flat with the voters -- an important lesson for members of the ''anybody but Bush'' crowd, who trust hatred of the president, and not support for John Kerry, to ensure a Democratic victory this year.
 There are a few other, slightly less scientific platform guidelines. Rhetoric should always be read with a grain of salt, but it is worth noting the salutary effect of the word ''crisis,'' particularly (and understandably) for challengers taking on a party in power, and particularly when it is featured prominently and early in a platform.
 In 1960, Democrats invoked Jefferson as a guiding spirit for ''periods of national crisis.'' (Kennedy won.) In 1968, Republicans cited Lincoln and Eisenhower as examples of their party's ''leadership at a time of crisis.'' (Nixon won.) The Democratic platform of 1976 spoke of ''crisis after crisis'' in economics, a ''crisis in costs'' for education, an ''urban crisis,'' ''the energy crisis,'' ''unprecedented fiscal crises,'' ''repeated environmental crises,'' and even a ''crisis of juvenile delinquency.'' (Jimmy Carter won.) In 1980, Republicans used the word ''crisis'' a dozen times, including in the first sentence. (Victory: Reagan.) In addition to sprinkling ''crisis'' across its pages, the 1992 Democratic platform took dire vocabulary to a new level, describing an America that ''reverberates with a battle cry of frustration that emanates from America's very soul.'' In each case, the winning formula highlighted a party's ability to articulate an urgency for change without obsessing about its opponent. 
 Similar rhetorical treats are doubtless in store when the Democrats and Republicans issue their platforms this summer. So this political season, instead of ignoring those glossy, bound documents, pick up a copy and be ready to count pages and words. Who knows -- you might even learn who America's next president will be.

HEADLINE: A Push For Bush

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Since President Bush hasn't called me to ask how he can get re-elected, I'm afraid this will be gratuitous advice. But what the heck. . . . 
 Now that John Kerry has found a running mate, Mr. President, you need to lose one. Dick Cheney has to fake chest pains. 
 The first time he begs to be removed from the ticket, you should show your loyalty and refuse. Only after he has sorrowfully insisted -- absolutely insisted! -- on retiring should you reluctantly consent. (This should happen well before the Republican convention so it doesn't look too desperate -- or staged.)
 Four years ago, Mr. Cheney brought national security credentials and gravitas to your ticket. But this November, he'll remind swing voters of the Iraq mess, intelligence-fixing and the leak of the name of the glamour spy, Valerie Plame. Not to mention Halliburton's overcharging. 
 Mr. President, many voters find you likable and a better bet on national security than Mr. Kerry -- as they say, Mr. Kerry looks French -- but they wake up at night wondering whether you're actually a hard-line, mistake-prone ideologue. And that's the problem with Mr. Cheney: the first thought swing voters have when they see the vice president is ''hard-line, mistake-prone ideologue.''
 So you need a running mate who revives the 2000 image of you as a compassionate conservative. That's Colin Powell, if he -- and Alma -- would do it.
 Mr. Powell reassures swing voters because he's not an ideologue, and he would improve your standing among black voters. In 2000 you won only 8 percent of the black vote, but you could raise that to 25 percent or more with Powell. 
 If Powell won't do it, there's Rudy Giuliani. He's strong on national security and crime, but soft on abortion, which is what you need with swing voters. Then there's John McCain; that choice would allow you to win at least the first battle with Mr. Kerry.
 As for issues, Mr. President, you need some. The main election themes now are Iraq and the economy, neither of which is shaping up in your favor. You need a good wedge issue, one that can be used to paint John Kerry as a Massachusetts liberal. The trick is to turn the election focus so it's about values, not issues.
 The Confederate flag issue worked wonders in Southern battleground states in the past and could perhaps be revived. Gay marriage is a possibility nationally, although you'll have to approach it carefully. Most voters are against gay marriage, but they're also against anti-gay bigotry. 
 The best potential wedge is the Ten Commandments, and if you boldly seize this issue, you can win in November. You could encourage local governments to put up versions of the Ten Commandments in offices in the South and Midwest, and then paint Mr. Kerry as anti-God if he demurs.
 Frankly, if your dad could link Michael Dukakis to Willie Horton in television ads, imagine how much more effective it would be to run TV spots linking John Kerry and Satan!
 Oh, and there's an October surprise you can spring that will almost guarantee a victory. After you've taken Mr. Powell as your running mate and he's won plaudits around the country, announce a week before the election that you're taking time off from the campaign on doctor's orders because your own heart has been under strain. That way, you'll get an extra week's vacation on your ranch -- and, if voters believe it, another term in office.
 (For the president's eyes only: Mr. President, you're probably wondering why you should take advice from a columnist who criticizes many of your policies. You may even imagine that I'm an ardent Kerry supporter. But look at it this way: I want to be read, and if Mr. Kerry wins, he'll adopt boring, reasonable positions, and I'll be stuck with nuanced analyses that even my mother won't read. In contrast, you may not always be great for this country, but you're terrific for sputtering pundits.)
 (For my regular readers only: Don't feel betrayed by this column. I'm not actually being as helpful to the president as you may think. Mr. Bush has shown that he pays close attention to all my advice because he consistently does precisely the opposite. So Mr. Cheney is now guaranteed a spot on the ticket.)

David Brooks is on vacation.

HEADLINE: New Trade Pacts Betray the Poorest Partners

BYLINE: By Joseph E. Stiglitz. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz, professor of economics at Columbia and author of ''The Roaring 90's,'' was chief economist of the World Bank from 1997 to 2000. He won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2001.

 BODY:
The United States and Morocco last month signed a new bilateral trade treaty. The Bush administration has been bragging that it exemplifies the way its economic policies can build new ties and new friendships around the world. This is especially important in the Middle East, where, in other respects, America's foreign policy seems to have left something to be desired. The cooperation with moderate Arab governments is meant to demonstrate our broadmindedness, our willingness to offer a carrot (rather than the proverbial stick) to those who behave reasonably. 
 But regrettably, in negotiating the trade agreements with Morocco, Chile and other countries, the Bush administration has used the same approach that earned us the enmity of so much of the rest of the world. The bilateral agreements reveal an economic policy dictated more by special interests than by a concern for the well-being of our poorer trading partners. In Morocco, prospects of the trade agreement were greeted by protests -- an unusual occurrence in a country that is only slowly moving to democracy. The new agreement, many Moroccans fear, will make generic drugs needed in the fight against AIDS even less accessible in their country than they are in the United States. According to Morocco's Association de Lutte contre le SIDA, an AIDS agency, the agreement could increase the effective duration of patent protection from the normal length of 20 years to 30 years. 
 Morocco is not the only country that is worrying about access to life-saving drugs. In all its bilateral agreements, the United States is using its economic muscle to help big drug companies protect their products from generic competitors. For a country like Thailand, which is facing a real AIDS threat, these are issues of more than academic concern. 
 President Bush's policy in this area seems puzzling and hypocritical. While he talks about a global campaign against AIDS, and has offered substantial sums to back it up, what he is giving with one hand is being taken away with the other. Most Americans, I believe, would support greater access to life-saving generic drugs. The loss to the drug companies would be small, and must surely be dwarfed by the huge tax breaks they get. 
 Nor are drugs the only arena in which the United States has used its economic power to advance some special American interest. The agreement with Chile limited its ability to restrict the inflow of speculative, hot money -- money that can come in and out of a country on a moment's notice. Chile had recognized the potential destabilizing effects of these capital movements, and had imposed moderate taxes on these flows. Such restrictions had helped Chile grow a remarkable 7 percent a year in the early 1990's. That is because, unlike many of its neighbors in Latin America, Chile did not have to face the economic havoc caused by capital suddenly flowing in and then just as quickly flowing out. Today, even the International Monetary Fund recognizes that capital- market liberalization often leads to more instability instead of faster growth.
 In telecommunications, too, in Morocco and elsewhere, we have put forward demands (for example, concerning the use of transmitting facilities and the wholesaling of transmission capacities) that we would oppose strenuously if someone were to impose them on us. In the view of the developing world, the bargaining has been extraordinarily one-sided -- with all the power on America's side. 
 The United States and its trade representative, Robert Zoellick, are right that trade policy can be an important instrument for building good will. But when conducted as it has been by the Bush administration, it can be, and is, a way to build ill will, especially among the young, who worry that their elders are selling them short. 
 If the trade agreements bring the economic benefits promised, if the lack of access to affordable drugs (including generic drugs) proves less troublesome than the naysayers worry, then all may be forgiven. But there is a good chance that this will not be the case: in Mexico, for example, real wages actually declined in the decade after the North American Free Trade Agreement. And looking ahead, the demands for capital-market liberalization have a good chance of exposing Chile's economy to disruption, while the AIDS epidemic and the need for cheap drugs to fight it are not about to go away. 
 The good news is that the damage has been limited so far because we have been able to pressure only a few small countries to sign bilateral trade agreements. The bad news is that the enmity that we are earning through these pacts will only grow.

HEADLINE: G.E. Earnings Increase 3.4%; Sales Up the Most Since 2000

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
General Electric reported yesterday that second-quarter profit rose 3.4 percent as acquisitions and demand for plastics, engine parts and loans fueled the biggest sales gain in almost four years. 
 Net income rose to $3.92 billion from $3.79 billion in the period a year earlier, the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said. Per-share profit was unchanged at 38 cents, 1 cent above his forecast, because of 342 million shares issued to finance its purchase of Amersham. 
 Nine of 11 main businesses had profit gains as ''the best economy we've seen in years'' led to orders for industrial goods and consumer demand for appliances and lighting, Mr. Immelt said. Profit was constrained by costs to integrate acquisitions and sell a stake in the Genworth insurance unit. G.E. closed almost $30 billion in transactions in the quarter, part of Mr. Immelt's plan to push annual profit growth next year above 10 percent. 
 ''Ten percent growth is no problem,'' said Robert Millen of Jensen Investment Management, which has 3.3 million General Electric shares. The only two businesses ''that aren't clicking on all cylinders are energy, with the cyclical decline in the last year of gas turbines, and the insurance business,'' he said. 
 Sales at G.E. rose 11 percent, to $37.04 billion, the biggest jump since the third quarter of 2000. 
 The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., raised the low end of its 2004 profit forecast by 1 cent, for a new range of $1.55 to $1.60 a share. 
 General Electric was expected by analysts to report second-quarter profit of 37 cents on sales of $35.6 billion.
 Shares of G.E. rose 47 cents, to $32.17. 
 General Electric's earnings are viewed by some investors as an economic barometer because of the breadth of its businesses. It is the world's biggest maker of jet engines, power-plant turbines, locomotives and medical-imaging equipment. It is also the biggest issuer of private label credit cards and the biggest aircraft lessor. 
 General Electric had 2003 net income of $1.49 a share. Annual profit growth has not exceeded 10 percent since 2000, hurt by falling orders for turbines and engines and rising costs for oil and chemicals used to make plastic. 
 Mr. Immelt, who took over for John F. Welch Jr. in September 2001, said a year ago that he expected little or no profit growth in 2004. He is building businesses that have faster growth rates and that are less sensitive to economic swings, expanding in regions like Asia, and selling a wider range of goods and services. 
 General Electric's industrial sales rose 22 percent in the quarter, while finance sales climbed 8 percent. Sales in consumer finance, which includes credit cards and loans, rose 26 percent. 
 The United States economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, and consumer borrowing rose for a sixth straight month in May.

HEADLINE: Get Out the Glue for a New Business Model

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
BOB DYLAN once warned that ''as the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fading.'' He meant the political establishment four decades ago, of course, but his words also apply to the airline industry today.
 In a year when beleaguered carriers hoped they would bounce back into prosperity after a deep slump brought on by the Sept. 11 attacks, they are instead facing a market that may have changed more fundamentally than at any time since the industry was deregulated in 1978. As a result, even the biggest companies may have to remake themselves radically, quickly and permanently, or face extinction.
 The predominant business model since deregulation -- based on wide availability of service, supported by customers willing to pay a premium for convenience -- is being buried by low-fare airlines that pick and choose their destinations and continually pare costs and ticket prices. 
 ''This industry is transforming itself in front of our very eyes,'' said Patricia A. Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 100,000 workers at several airlines. The changes being forced on the industry today are as far-reaching as those unleashed when President Jimmy Carter pushed through deregulation a generation ago, she said, adding, ''This is Round 2.'' 
 Some executives say that if airlines simply trim costs, they can withstand the onslaught as they did in previous slumps. But others say that the industry cannot just shrink this time, and that it must reshape itself, abandoning assumptions about consumers and labor contracts.
 For example, the hub-and-spoke system, which funnels passengers from smaller cities to major ones, was embraced by most big airlines after deregulation. It may be on the endangered-species list, though, at least as the primary means of moving people around the country. And, analysts and executives say, airlines are likely to evolve from one-size-fits-all megacompanies into more specialized players that carefully aim at specific niches -- international business travelers, for example, or Florida vacation bargain hunters.
 All the business models now being tested, however, share one assumption: lower fares. As a result, all employees, from the pilots to the people who clean the planes and restock the beverage carts, will be pressured to work harder and perhaps work for less. ''The economic situation of the industry is a reality,'' Ms. Friend said. ''We can't change that. We have no choice but to try to adapt ourselves to a new business model while preserving as much as we can.''
 FRANK A. LORENZO, the creator of the Texas Air Group, said change was long overdue. Mr. Lorenzo incurred the wrath of the unions in the late 1980's and early 90's for the drastic cuts he imposed at Continental Airlines, giving it the lowest costs among major airlines as it emerged from bankruptcy protection. But he argued that the economic boom of the 1990's eased pressure on the rest of the industry to follow suit, at least until the market soured in 2001. ''The problems didn't go away,'' Mr. Lorenzo said in an interview last week. ''They only got delayed. Now it's all coming home to roost.''
 Whatever happens, the industry will look much different from the way it did after two previous waves of restructuring, resulting from economic slumps in the 1980's and 90's. Both times, the industry essentially bounced back to its previous form, although with some casualties, including People Express, Pan American World Airways and Eastern Airlines, which shut down while Mr. Lorenzo was running it.
 Back then, airlines that were in decent financial shape could ''simply ride it out'' and go back to charging top dollar for fares once customers returned, said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who is now an adjunct professor of law at Yale.
 Mr. Lorenzo agreed, saying that a single airline hub, like O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, could generate $50 million in revenue a month for an airline during the industry's peak years. 
 Paradoxically, the latest restructuring is occurring amid strong economic growth. But the gains that in the past went to the major airlines are being taken away by low-fare airlines like Southwest and JetBlue, which for the first time are gaining market share as a group, even as the big airlines fight them.
 Professor Levine compared the traditional hub-and-spoke airline industry to an iceberg drifting toward the Equator. ''Some of the carriers are higher up the iceberg, and some of them are lower down,'' he said. When the ice begins to melt as the environment changes, ''you can hope the ones down below drown before you do,'' but eventually everyone will drown, he said.
 The Air Transportation Stabilization Board certainly turned up the heat last month, when, for the third time in 18 months, it refused to guarantee loans for the industry's second-biggest player, United Airlines, despite the political support the company had. That was just as well to critics of the board, which was created in 2001 to help airlines get back on their feet after the Sept. 11 attacks. Some, including Herbert D. Kelleher, the chairman of Southwest Airlines, said the loan guarantees amounted to little more than life support for uncompetitive companies.
 United will now have to arrange additional financing itself. That will mean persuading potential investors and lenders that it can survive and prosper. Other airlines with above-average costs, including Delta and US Airways, face the same challenge. None have said how they plan to become profitable again, although Delta executives are scheduled to present a restructuring plan to the company's board next month. The chief executive, Gerald A. Grinstein, has promised that the plan will start to revitalize the airline.
 FOR its part, US Airways is seeking $800 million in fresh wage and benefit cuts. On Friday, its chief executive, Bruce R. Lakefield, said in a message to employees that the airline's federal loan guarantee package was at risk unless the company got more union concessions. But union officials argue that even if employees worked without pay, major airlines would still bear heavy structural costs, pensions and health care included, that low-fare airlines don't have. 
 But the pressure will not end even if United, Delta and US Airways figure a way out of their problems. Henry C. Joyner, vice president for corporate strategy at American Airlines, foresees years of turbulence, which experts say could lead to fewer jobs, fewer hubs and ultimately, airlines that bear little resemblance to those of today.
 ''We are going to get to a watershed, with some greater levels of change,'' said Mr. Joyner, whose company has been immersed in its own 18-month restructuring drive, which has included $1.8 billion in concessions from its labor unions.
 So far, the major airlines' strategy of cutting ticket prices on routes where they compete head to head with low-fare rivals has failed. Because the big carriers have not cut costs enough to make a profit on cheaper fares, they have fallen deeper into the red -- and have still lost overall market share. Even so, these airlines, the so-called legacy carriers, have done little to change their basic strategy -- the hub-and-spoke system -- even though the low-fare competitors have placed more emphasis on direct flights.
 Executives at these airlines, including Mr. Joyner at American, contend that a network system can still work as long as they can reduce costs and streamline operations. Others are less sanguine.
 ''One, that doesn't get you enough in revenue,'' Professor Levine said, ''and, two, a lot of the management at the airlines doesn't know how to do anything but ask for cuts.''
 Industry innovators like David G. Neeleman, a veteran of Southwest and the founder and chief executive of JetBlue, contend that airlines must give up on unprofitable routes and concentrate on areas where they can dominate. Mr. Lorenzo, founder of Savoy Capital, a Houston investment firm, argued that it no longer made sense to continue offering service just for the sake of being big. ''Companies have got to adjust to the marketplace,'' he said.
 If they do, the industry could divide into at least three layers of competition. 
 At the top would be premium-fare service, with international routes like those to the Asian cities served by United and Northwest, and a few choice domestic cities where a single airline controls three-quarters or more of the market, like Detroit, which is dominated by Northwest, or Cincinnati, where Delta accounts for 9 of 10 flights. Major airlines would most likely stay on top in that class of service, because the cost of entering those markets would tend to discourage low-fare carriers. 
 At the bottom would be highly competitive routes that offer cheap fares and minimal profits, like short flights from Dulles International Airport near Washington or Midway International Airport in Chicago. Here, low-fare carriers would be most competitive because of their low overhead costs.
 In the vast, plump middle tier, low-fare carriers and traditional airlines would vie aggressively for customers, using enticements like in-flight entertainment systems and frequent-flier programs.
 Under such a model, airlines might be able to compete in two types of service successfully, as a carmaker might produce economy cars and family sedans. But airlines would be loath to tackle all three markets because of the expense of playing at the top, the flood of competition in the middle and the razor-thin profits at the bottom.
 Mr. Grinstein at Delta is one leader of a legacy carrier who has said publicly that airlines are facing a fundamental change. In an e-mail message to employees last month, he made clear that the old order at Delta was history. ''We need to reinvent ourselves,'' Mr. Grinstein said. ''Any notion that we can simply grow ourselves out of this predicament is mistaken.
 ''Many of our costs are higher than those of our competitors, and our customers will not pay us to cover the difference,'' he added. ''We must recognize this change and act quickly to address it.''
 If the situation is drastic for airline executives, it is even more painful for labor leaders, whose influence is waning. The industry has never had so many major contract talks in so many places at the same time. Nor have unions that have already granted concessions ever been in the position of facing further requests for cuts -- in the case of US Airways, not just once but twice.
 This erosion of power is particularly frustrating for labor leaders like Ms. Friend, whose union has spent the last 40 years transforming the work of flight attendants from essentially a way station for young women before marriage into a full-time career for employees of both sexes. Especially difficult, she said, is knowing that a deal cut at one company may not hold up if a competitor can get better terms.
 ESPECIALLY worrisome for both labor and management is the suspicion that no airline is too big to fail, not as long as aggressive and financially healthy rivals are around. Alain L. Kornhauser, professor of operations research and financial engineering at Princeton, said that ''if US Airways were to disappear,'' other airlines would quickly replace its flights, hire its crews and lease some of its planes.
 Thomas A. Kochan, professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: ''It's a terrible situation for the employees, for the customers, for the shareholders, for everyone at the moment. But unfortunately that's the world they're in.''
 As Mr. Dylan put it, ''he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.''

HEADLINE: Sex May Be Happiness, but Wealth Isn't Sexiness

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
PROVERBIALLY, money buys neither love nor happiness, only sex. (''Success in the boardroom guarantees success in the bedroom.'') But nobody ever tried to prove it. 
 Recently, however, two economists, David G. Blanchflower of Dartmouth College and Andrew J. Oswald of the University of Warwick in England, submitted a working paper called ''Money, Sex and Happiness: An Empirical Study,'' to the National Bureau of Economic Research, one of the leading organizations in its field. 
 The authors say their study is first rigorous econometric analysis on the topic, and it that the received wisdom may require some revision. As the paper states: ''Money does seem to seem to buy greater happiness. But it does not buy more sex.''
 Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Oswald are among the leaders in the fast-growing field of ''happiness economics,'' which applies econometric techniques, traditionally limited to quantifiable matters like wage rates, to the amorphous arena of human emotion. Areas of research include how happiness is affected by democracy (it increases individual happiness), or new cigarette taxes (smokers, oddly, become happier).
 In their study, Mr. Oswald and Mr. Blanchflower analyzed the self-reported sexual activity and levels of happiness of more than 16,000 American adults who participated in a number of social surveys since the early 1990's. (Happiness is notoriously difficult to define, and the surveys make no attempt to do so; the respondents simply record how happy they believe themselves to be on a sliding scale.) By factoring out the measurable effects of other life events, the study revealed, to no one's surprise, that, ''The more sex, the happier the person.'' 
 Furthermore, the economists compared the levels of happiness produced by a vigorous sex life with other activities whose economic values had been calculated in prior research, allowing them to impute, in dollars, how much happiness sex was worth. They also estimated that increasing the frequency of sexual intercourse from once a month to at least once a week provided as much happiness as putting $50,000 in the bank. 
 A lasting marriage, by comparison, offers about $100,000 worth of happiness a year -- that is, on average, a single person would need to receive $100,000 annually to be as happy as a married person with the same education, job status and other characteristics. Divorce, on the other hand, imposes an emotional toll of about $66,000 a year, though there may be a short-term economic gain from the immediate relief provided by leaving your spouse.
 Possibly the least expected finding of the paper, said Mr. Oswald, was that in general, ''Greater income does not buy more sex, nor sexual partners.'' 
 ''That was surprising to us as economists,'' Mr. Oswald added, ''because by and large, we think money can buy anything.'' (The study found that men who paid a prostitute for sex reported they were considerably less happy.) 
 But the economists' study struck at a number of conventionally accepted notions. ''The conservative, pro-marriage lobby will be delighted to read our paper,'' Mr. Oswald said. ''The 'Sex and the City' view of the world is falsified by the data.'' 
 Married people, he said, were shown to have about 30 percent more sex than their single peers, and were found, at least statistically speaking, to be significantly happier. 
 Likewise, Mr. Oswald said, the gay and lesbian community would be happy with the work. The data showed that the amount of happiness obtained from ''being in a gay relationship is almost identical to being in a heterosexual one'' and that regardless of sexual orientation, the ''happiness-maximizing'' number of partners is one. Celibacy and very low levels of sexual activity, the study found, had a ''statistically indistinguishable'' effect on happiness.
 Not everyone is convinced one can put an accurate price tag on sex -- or at least its emotional payoff. ''Does it matter if it is good sex or bad sex? To me that is of critical importance,'' said Leonore Tiefer, a clinical therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine. 
 Then there is the problem of distinguishing cause from effect. ''Is your sex life good because you are seeing life through rose-colored glasses?'' asked Edward O. Laumann, a University of Chicago sociology professor who directed the 1994 National Health and Social Life Survey, a landmark study on sexual attitudes and behaviors in the United States. ''Or is your happiness a result of your sex life?'' And what about the lurking variable of love? 
 Mr. Oswald concedes the limitations of his statistical analysis. ''All we can do is paint outlines of the numbers,'' he said. ''We can't hope to pick up a myriad of details.'' However, he said a statistical approach can be useful in flushing out evidence that would be difficult to otherwise obtain -- especially when it comes to a topic like sex, where there is a strong incentive to lie. 
 He said he would like to carry out more highly detailed, longitudinal and cross-culture studies, but behavioral lab experiments remain out of the question now. ''It would be great to assign Mr. and Mrs. X a certain amount of sexual activity and a certain amount of income, and see how it impacts their happiness,'' he said. ''But I think it would be hard to get government funding.''
