HEADLINE: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE;
For Brooklyn, a New Rental Tower

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The 32-story building rising on Montague Street is adding an imposing new presence to the Brooklyn Heights skyline and the first new luxury rental building in the neighborhood in nearly four decades.
When leasing begins on April 1, it also will test renters' willingness to pay a premium for the building's 186 apartments. Monthly asking rents will range from $1,900 for the smallest 518-square-foot studio to $6,800 for the largest 1,247-square-foot three-bedroom apartment. 
 The building will have a rooftop health club, and the apartments will have nine-foot-high ceilings. There will be 6,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space and a garage for 75 to 80 cars in the building. It is replacing a two-story commercial structure that stood on the site, between Court and Clinton Streets.
The $50 million-plus project is being developed by the Continuum Company, headed by Ian Bruce Eichner, who lives in the neighborhood. "It presented a unique opportunity to build something not now available in my own backyard," he said, adding that the rental market also was strong.
The rental vacancy rate in Brooklyn Heights is below 2 percent. That is lower than the citywide rate of 5 percent, according to the Brooklyn office of William B. May, the Manhattan-based brokerage concern.
The vacancy rate is more pronounced in Brooklyn Heights because of the lack of development sites and strict zoning regulations that govern most of the neighborhood, which is a city-designated historic district. New buildings developed in the district, the area generally between Atlantic Avenue and Court Street and Cadman Plaza West and the Promenade, are limited to five stories. And their facades must blend with those of the neighboring buildings.
The Montague Street site is just outside the historic district in a primarily commercial area of low- and high-rise buildings. When Mr. Eichner acquired the site in 1998, its zoning permitted the construction of a 20-story building. But to build the "Manhattan style" luxury rental that he envisioned and make it economically viable, Mr. Eichner said, he also bought air rights over two adjacent structures. That enabled him to add 12 stories to the building, providing apartments on the 15th floor and above with views of Manhattan.
Mr. Eichner said that though he could have bought more air rights that would have increased the building's height to up to 50 stories, he decided against it because of, among other things, the expense of building such a tall structure. And a 32-story building, he added, "also made more sense on the block."
In an area where local community groups have fought to protect the brownstone neighborhood's low-rise scale, the height of the Montague Street building provoked some concerns. They were overshadowed, however, by community opposition to a commercial project, including a multiplex movie theater, on Court Street four blocks away, said Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, a civic group.
The Montague Street building, Ms. Stanton said, "will probably bring night life" to that part of the street and "retailers are looking forward" to an influx of new families." But "people expressed concerns that it is inappropriately tall and out of place," she said, adding that with the parking garage's entrance on busy Montague Street, "I have no idea how the cars are going to get in and out."
Mr. Eichner said he has all necessary approvals for the garage.
The Brooklyn Heights Association has opposed new development in the past, including Mr. Eichner's attempt in the 1980's to build a 15-story cooperative building on the site of an old hotel in the landmark district. The battle ended in the developer's favor, but he gained approval only for an 11-story building, which ultimately was sold to the Jehovah's Witnesses for use as a dormitory.
Ms. Stanton said Mr. Eichner's new building "certainly could have been prettier." She described it as having "a lot of brick," not enough windows and little architectural detail. "More could have been done," especially to break up the building's mass, she said.
Mr. Eichner said he and Thomas O'Hara and Associates of Manhattan, his architects, "made a significant effort" to put up a building that was appropriate and are cladding the building in brick rather than glass and installing "oversized windows," consistent with those in upscale housing in Manhattan. The building also has a nine-story base with a setback tower to reduce its scale, he said.
But it will be the services and amenities offered inside the building, which also include Internet access and a concierge, that will distinguish it from the stock of rental units, mostly within brownstones, in the neighborhood. Such services are now available only in cooperative buildings, said Christopher D. Thomas, a senior vice president at the May brokerage.
Mr. Thomas said the project was opening at a time when monthly rents for existing rentals have risen about 10 percent a year for each of the last two years. He said current rents were $1,700 to $2,400 a month on average for one-bedroom apartments with 500 to 800 square feet, and $2,300 to $3,600 for two-bedrooms with 800 to 1,200 square feet.
"My guts tell me that renters will be willing to pay the premium for services" and apartments that are larger and in a new high-rise in an established community like Brooklyn Heights where they can walk to stores, he said.
Mr. Eichner said he was negotiating with "an upscale grocery store" to lease the retail space in the building. He said he expected the building to draw young professionals as well as families from the area and Manhattan. Occupancy is expected to begin by August.

HEADLINE: Riders Know, Study Confirms: Taxis Are Harder to Find

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It's not your imagination. Hailing a yellow cab really has become a lot harder.
According to an analysis of a decade of taxi meter and odometer readings, obtained recently from New York City by a transportation consultant, the availability of cabs over the last seven years has fallen sharply, by 13 percent -- even with an expansion of taxi medallions, two fare increases and the introduction of subway and bus fare discounts. 
 The analysis confirms what anyone who relies on cabs almost anywhere in Manhattan already knows: the city's surging economy is increasing the demand for a taxi supply that has not increased in several years. And the imbalance is beginning to show.
Taxi experts add that the effect on minorities and people seeking to travel outside Manhattan is probably much worse, because as competition for cabs increases so do refusals -- cabdrivers ignoring some hailing passengers or refusing to take them to certain destinations.
"The bottom line here is that the anecdotal stories about how it's much harder to catch a cab are more than borne out by the objective data," said Bruce Schaller, a former policy analyst for the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission and now a private consultant, who obtained the cab data through Freedom of Information laws.
Mr. Schaller said he thought the cab shortage had become so pronounced that the city "really needs to start looking at how to make cab service more readily available."
The analysis, conducted on data that is collected three times a year by the taxi commission during cab inspections, found that the number of passengers in yellow cabs, the most frequently used means of traveling within Manhattan after the subway, had increased 17 percent over the decade. Ridership rose from 206 million a year in 1990 to 240 million last year, the 1999 figure equivalent to more than three-quarters of the population of the United States.
Passengers last year paid an average metered fare of $6.85, or $8.07 with the night surcharge and a 15 percent tip. The length of the average trip -- three miles -- was also greater than in years past, partly because of more airport trips.
Revenue for the taxi industry rose 46 percent in the 1990's, from $949 million in 1990 to $1.39 billion in 1999 -- roughly the amount that investors paid for Rockefeller Center four years ago.
But the statistic that means the most to taxi riders is the number of "dead miles," an estimate of how much time cabbies spent cruising for passengers and the best indicator of how readily a cab can be hailed. As cruising miles increase, a person standing on a street corner is more likely to encounter an available cab. When the miles decrease, finding a cab becomes harder.
In 1992, when cab availability was at a high during the recession, the number of cruising miles was 310 million. The figure decreased to 271 million last year, out of 772 million miles driven on duty.
The records also show that last year, 65 percent of the average cabby's time was spent with a passenger, up from 57 percent in 1992. Because these numbers are skewed by graveyard-shift drivers, who can cruise for long periods without a fare, the percentage of time cabs are occupied during business hours is probably much higher, Mr. Schaller said.
The analysis found that a 1990 fare increase of 11.5 percent was one of several factors that helped taxi availability rise during the first three years of the decade. As the economy heated up, more people were willing to pay the higher fares, and availability began to drop rapidly, hitting a low in 1996.
An additional fare increase in 1996, of about 20 percent, had little effect on availability -- even with the competition from discounted subway and bus fares for Metrocard users and with the auction of 400 more taxi medallions, the first expansion of the cab fleet since the Depression. (A medallion is the badge that gives a cabdriver the right to pick up riders; there are now 12,187.)
Those factors caused taxi availability to rise for just one year, from 1996 to 1997. Then it began to drop again because, Mr. Schaller theorized, tremendous demand was spurred by the creation of many more jobs in the city and a rise in tourism.
Allan J. Fromberg, a spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said the numbers "show what we've believed to be true for some time, which is that the industry has never been more viable."
"This is probably the strongest taxi industry in many years," Mr. Fromberg said.
But the increase in demand, and in industry revenues, has not been as a big a boon to cabdrivers, the report found. The average driver grossed $1.80 per on-duty mile, or $254 for an average shift of 141 miles. The figure includes the additional money from night surcharges and an estimated 15 percent tip, but does not take into account what the drivers must pay for gas and to fleets to lease their cabs.
In 1990, cabbies made about $196 on an average shift. But Mr. Schaller said that in general, increased fare revenue for drivers had been offset by inflation and by higher lease fees.
Mr. Schaller added, however, that the report also showed that the expansion of the taxi fleet in 1996 did not have the dire effect that many drivers feared: driving down their income. And he said he thought this was an argument for increasing the fleet more, a decision that would be up to the State Legislature.
"There's a reservoir of unmet demand for taxis, both through the boom times and the recession, that has absorbed every single mile of additional service," he said.
But others who have studied the taxi industry make an analogy to a rule used by traffic planners -- that cities can never build their way out of traffic congestion by adding roads -- and say that increasing the number of medallions will probably never have any appreciable effect on increasing taxi availability.
"Let's suppose you added 50,000 medallions," said Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College in Manhattan who has studied the industry for many years. "What's going to happen? The area they serve is just going to push out to a larger part of the city, the places that livery cabs serve now."

HEADLINE: For Those Who Can Afford It, Old-Style Medicine Returns

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Two years ago, William O. Daniel's doctor adopted a new policy. No longer would the doctor, Herbert Rubin of Beverly Hills, Calif., accept payments from health maintenance organizations. No longer would he be on insurance companies' preferred provider lists. No longer would he even accept Medicare. From then on, if you wanted to see Dr. Rubin, you paid cash.
"That was frightening to me," said Mr. Daniel, a 72-year-old retired insurance salesman who lives in Hollywood. Reluctantly, he changed doctors. But, he said, his new doctor's waiting room was always crowded and the doctor seemed pressed for time. "I had to get out my symptoms in about 20 seconds or he would start interrupting me," Mr. Daniel said. "Then I would have to wait while he saw more patients and then got back to me." 
 Now Mr. Daniel has returned to Dr. Rubin, one of a growing number of doctors who have severed their ties to health maintenance organizations and insurance companies. In return for cash payments, the doctors often offer a lavish level of service -- uncrowded waiting rooms, long, uninterrupted office visits, and an office staff that knows the patients.
"You always get what you pay for," Dr. Rubin said.
Several years after President Clinton's failed effort to remake health care in America, the health care market is remaking itself. For those with insurance or the money to pay for health care, there is evolving a two-tiered system. One tier is made up of doctors who have cut their prices at the insistence of health insurers and who make up for the reduced prices by increasing their volume, seeing more patients per hour. The other tier is made up of those like Dr. Rubin who offer time and attention -- but at a cost.
While there are no national figures on how many doctors are joining the new tier, health care experts agreed that all of a sudden, doctors who never before dared to abandon health insurance plans were taking the plunge.
They are a different breed from the growing ranks of doctors who are focusing their practices on cosmetic procedures, like laser eye surgery or liposuction, that patients pay for out of their own pockets. Instead, these are doctors like family practitioners and internists who provide basic medical care as well as specialists, like general surgeons, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists and psychologists, and cardiologists, who take care of serious medical problems. These renegade doctors tend to be in urban areas, where managed care has made the greatest inroads, the doctors said.
Patients of these doctors can submit the doctors' bills to their insurance companies, but it is the patient, not the doctor, who must accept whatever the insurer provides. Some of these doctors accept Medicare payments or payments from a few other select insurance plans. Others, like Dr. Rubin, do not. Some doctors are asking patients to give them yearly retainers of thousands of dollars.
"The market is reasserting itself," said Dr. Alan Garber, an economist and specialist in internal medicine at Stanford University. "In characteristic fashion in America, markets have emerged where they didn't exist."
Health policy experts say there is no proof that patients who see doctors like Dr. Rubin are buying better health -- although they are buying more of a doctor's time and attention.
"People are buying what to them is very valuable," said Victor R. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of health economics at Stanford. "They are getting instant attention, instant service. You call the doctor's office and one person is on the phone and he knows you. Suppose you have a medical test. In some situations you have to wait a week for the results. Here, it can be two hours. What some experts don't realize is that a huge amount of the dissatisfaction with medical care has to do with the level of service."
Doctors and health policy experts differ on whether the trend is to be lauded, accepted or deplored. But they agree that it was inevitable, a consequence of peoples' growing irritation with impersonal medical care by rushed doctors and a booming economy that allows many people to pay for the service they want. Dr. Thomas Reardon, a general practitioner who is president of the American Medical Association, said that his organization had no policy on the trend, but that he understood why it was occurring.
"What the doctors are saying is, 'We're tired of managed care, we're tired of Medicare, we're tired of the hassle,' " Dr. Reardon said. Patients are equally peeved by much of medical care today, he added.
But some worry about a loss of fundamental equity and justice, that the affluent are insulating themselves. "We are in an incredibly entrepreneurial climate in medicine, and I think this kind of tiering undercuts people's thinking about collective solutions to the health care problems," said Norman Daniels, a professor of philosophy at Tufts University who specializes in ethics and health care..
Others worry about the effects on patients when their doctors suddenly announce that they will not accept the patients' insurance.
"It is a burden," said Dr. Bernard Katz, a family practitioner who sees H.M.O. patients and is co-chief executive of SMBP Health Services, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that manages doctors like himself.
Dr. Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said that in his hospital it is becoming almost impossible to find surgeons who will accept H.M.O. insurance.
"They basically thumb their noses at the H.M.O.'s," Dr. Lockshin said, adding that he often cannot refer patients to the best surgeons. "I have to deal with patients on a daily basis and it sometimes makes me want to tear my hair out."
The same thing is happening in west Los Angeles as more and more specialists refuse payments from H.M.O.'s and most insurance companies, said Dr. Richard L. Taw Jr., a cardiologist in Santa Monica. Dr. Taw himself has stopped accepting most insurance payments, but his patients stuck with him. "Nobody left me, not one patient," he said. "The economy is so good now that people want to go to doctors that don't treat them like a number."
Not too long ago it was excruciatingly difficult for an independent doctor to thrive. One who tried, Dr. Thomas W. LaGrelius, a general practitioner in Torrance, Calif., said he spent years watching helplessly as his patients bailed out of his practice, refusing to go to a doctor whose fees were not covered by their insurance. Dr. LaGrelius had decided as long ago as 1980 that he wanted no part of H.M.O's.
When his partners decided to stay with an H.M.O., Dr. LaGrelius quit the group and began practicing by himself, but for years he had trouble finding patients.
Now, Dr. LaGrelius said, the climate has changed and patients seek him out. He is head of an organization of independent doctors in his area, called Indoc, which has 104 members and gets inquiries from all over the country.
Some doctors, who once belonged to every H.M.O. in sight, said they recently decided to drop those contracts. When H.M.O.'s came to the New York area in the 1990's, doctors like Andrew Weiland, an orthopedic hand and plastic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery, were afraid that if they did not join they would have no patients. "Everyone jumped on the bandwagon and joined as many as they could for fear of being left off when the train left the station," Dr. Weiland said. But, he added: "You can only run so fast and see so many patients and not run an assembly line."
And so Dr. Weiland started to drop his H.M.O. contracts over about three years. He said he has had no trouble finding patients. "Patients sort of think that if you're out of the plans, you must be good enough to drop out of the plans," he said.
The independent doctors say they see fewer patients and offer them better services. The doctors are easy to reach, patients are not kept on hold, and no one has to wait weeks for an appointment.
Dr. Bradley Fenton, a Philadelphia internist who does not accept payments from H.M.O.'s, says he offers "time and attention." He reserves an hour for a new patient who comes in for a physical examination and allows 15 to 20 minutes for follow-up visits.
"While it may cost more," Dr. Fenton said, "many can afford it if they want to. Instead of going out to dinner one night one week, they can spend an hour with me."
Dr. Richard Schubert, a fee-for-service internist in Washington, says he spends whatever time it takes with his patients -- 30 minutes for a routine office visit, an hour for a consultation. "It costs patients more money, they have to pay for it out of pocket, they have to decide if they think it's good value for the service," he said. "Maybe you think spending the extra money on a doctor is not important and you'd rather get a B.M.W. You have to decide how you want to spend your money."
Many patients say that they are willing to pay the price for a doctor who showers them with attention. Harry Haber, the president of Ginsey Industries, a company in Bellmawr, N.J., that manufactures and distributes novelty bathroom accessories, said he provided an Aetna/US Healthcare health maintenance organization for his 150 employees and himself. But he and his wife are patients of Dr. Fenton of Philadelphia, paying most of the cost themselves.
"Not everyone can afford it," Mr. Haber said. But, he added, "I am a person who's made a choice." He added that when Dr. Fenton suggests an expensive test he may go to his Aetna doctor and hope that he will recommend the same test, so it can be paid for by Aetna.
"That is not always easy," Mr. Haber said. In fact, he recently was turned down for a medical test by his Aetna doctor, forcing him into a decision on whether to pay for it himself.
"I will probably absorb the cost," Mr. Haber said.
Health care economists predict that the two-tiered system may be here to stay, and that no national health care plan is going to obviate it.
"The notion that you're going to provide the same level of care for everyone," Professor Fuchs of Stanford said, "means either that it's going to be enormously expensive or that it's going to be a level of care that's far below what some people are willing and able to pay for." But, said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, doctors with fee-for-service practices may find themselves under a new sort of competitive pressure. People who can afford such doctors also tend to be people who are comfortable using computers and the Internet, he said.
"They will create Web sites that will rank these doctors on quality," Professor Reinhardt said. "That will be the obvious next step. They will put these doctors into statistical fishbowls where everything about these doctors will be on the Web.
"I think the physicians will find it is not quite the world of the late 1950's and the 1960's," Dr. Reinhardt said. "It will be utterly brutal."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
A RECORDVOLUME AS STOCKS SURGE ON THE BIG BOARD

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Investors bought stocks furiously yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in its biggest one-day point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose sharply as investors -- at least for the day -- put aside fears that the Federal Reserve would aggressively raise interest rates and slow the economy to a crawl.
When trading began, buyers flocked to the old-economy companies that make up the bulk of the stock market but that have languished much of this year. Stocks of financial companies like J. P. Morgan performed especially well, as did shares of airlines and other companies whose profits will probably be strong if the United States economy stays healthy. 
 But by midafternoon, the buying had spread to technology and Internet companies, the new-economy stocks that had already posted strong gains this year. By the end of the day, all segments of the market were sharply higher, with the Dow Jones industrials rising 499.19 points, or nearly 5 percent, to 10,630.60.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three days of sharp losses with a gain of nearly 3 percent. Apparently afraid that they would miss out on gains, investors scurried to join the rally, setting a record for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.48 billion shares changing hands.
By any standard, the gains were outsized. Old-economy companies like American Express and General Motors had their stocks dancing like new-technology butterflies, with American Express gaining $10.875, to $143.75, and G.M. $4.9375, to $83.75.
The performance of the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was equally giddy. The S.& P. 500, which represents about 70 percent of the value of all stocks, rose 66.32, or 4.8 percent, to 1,458.47. The point gain was the biggest for the Dow ever, easily surpassing a 380.53 point rise in September 1998. But in percentage terms, the two gains were about the same, 5 percent.
Combined with Wednesday's 3.3 percent increase, yesterday's gain amounted to the best two-day performance for the index since its rally after the crash of October 1987.
"A calm is settling in over the market on interest rates," said James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer of State Street Research, which manages $55 billion. "The market at the moment seems to be comfortable that the Fed is going to raise interest rates a couple of times but not more than that."
The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates four times since June in an effort to slow the booming economy, and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has said he is worried about the potential for inflation to accelerate. Along with higher oil prices, the higher interest rates appear to have slowed the economy slightly, said Jeffrey Applegate of Lehman Brothers.
Mr. Applegate, a longtime bull, said a moderate economic slowdown was good news for stocks, because it meant that over the next few months, the Federal Reserve would not have to raise rates as much as investors previously expected. So investors can begin to look well past the expected quarter-point increase by the Fed policy makers next week to another period of steady interest rates and strong corporate profits. That combination almost always makes for higher stock prices.
"If, in fact, the Fed can go on hold, because there's not a reason to do a lot of tightening, that's good for the markets," Mr. Applegate said.
Still, Mr. Greenspan has expressed concern that the meteoric rise in technology stocks is encouraging spending by consumers who feel increasingly wealthy on paper, which could in turn fuel inflation. To reduce that risk, Mr. Greenspan has said he would like stock prices to grow more slowly, a warning heeded by technology investors in the previous three days but disregarded yesterday.
Wall Street traders, who were even more swamped than usual yesterday, said buy orders seemed to come from all directions. While investors' appetite for stock mutual funds has abated from its record highs in February, when it averaged $10 billion a week, it remains strong, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. AMG, which tracks investment in mutual funds, said $5 billion went into stock funds in the week ended Wednesday.
The day began rather quietly. Right after the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was up fewer than 100 points. The Nasdaq, which has been extremely volatile lately and was down more than 9 percent the previous three days, opened up, but fell sharply toward midday. Shortly after 11 a.m., it was down more than 100 points.
As the day progressed, the Dow rocketed higher, and by mid-afternoon, it had pulled the Nasdaq into positive territory.
The rally in old-economy stalwarts, from drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson to airlines like Delta, actually began on Monday. Many of those companies are posting record profits, but they have been largely ignored by investors seeking the supercharged revenue growth of technology and Internet companies like Cisco Systems and Yahoo.
As a result, many well-known old- economy companies are trading at relatively cheap levels, while some Internet stocks are valued much higher. The average S.& P. 500 company is valued at about 28 times its 1999 profits, while the average Nasdaq stock trades for well over 100 times last year's profits. Yet many S.& P. 500 stocks are showing strong profit growth, with the average S.& P. 500 stock expected to post a profit gain of 17.7 percent this year on top of last year's 18 percent gain.
In the last week, that gap became too wide to ignore, said Seth Tobias of Circle T Partners, a hedge fund that manages $450 million. As an example, Mr. Tobias said he bought shares of United Parcel Service just above $52 on Wednesday after seeing they were trading near their lowest level since the delivery company offered shares to the public last fall -- and seeing that other transportation companies were rallying.
"I swept out all the sellers in the stock, the stock went to $55, and today it's at $57.50," Mr. Tobias said. U.P.S. closed at $56.25, up $1.3125.

Get Real on Kosovo

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Karl Kraus, the famous Austrian journalist and playwright, once observed that European wars were caused by diplomats who lied to journalists and then believed what they read in the newspapers.
One is reminded of that aphorism today when listening to U.S. and NATO officials insist that they are still committed to building a multi-ethnic Kosovo -- despite the murderous inter-ethnic violence still going on there, and the obvious desire of the Pentagon and NATO to get out of Kosovo forever. 
 It's time U.S. and NATO officials stopped fibbing to themselves and then believing their own quotes. It's obvious that the Kosovar Serbs and Albanians hate each other and have no intention of living together in the idealistic multi-ethnic state that the Clintonites once envisaged.
Now it might be momentarily satisfying to just walk away, telling both sides: "You people deserve each other. Why don't you just slug it out and call us when you're exhausted." But that would only lead to another bloodbath and refugee turmoil. Like it or not, the U.S. and NATO do have an interest in stability in the Balkans -- if for no other reason than that it would allow them to focus on more important problems.
Since we can't walk away, our real choices are clear: Either we disarm the warriors of Kosovo or we disarm the warring politics of Kosovo. That is to say, when dealing with an unfinished civil war, in which people hate each other but are still living side by side, one option is to use overwhelming force to disarm the whole population and then stand guard on every street corner until they learn to love each other. At a time when NATO wants to reduce its troops in Kosovo, this option is not realistic.
That leaves the other option -- disarming the politics of Kosovo. Right now the politics of Kosovo is always on the verge of explosion, because neither of the big parties -- the Serbs nor the Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army -- is content or exhausted. The K.L.A. is using the U.S. zone in Kosovo as a privileged sanctuary to infiltrate southern Serbia and aid ethnic Albanians living there, while the Serbs are infiltrating men and materiel into northern Kosovo to protect their people there.
The only way NATO can reduce its presence in Kosovo, without it blowing up, is by doing what NATO did in Bosnia: disarm the politics by tacitly partitioning the country. Bosnia is stable today because the key factions were exhausted by four years of war and got what they wanted: their own ethnic zones. Once the dividing lines were stable, all NATO had to do was patrol them. And once the parties in Bosnia were secure in their own space, they were more willing to reach out to one another.
To disarm the politics of Kosovo, NATO needs to convene the parties and redraw the map or impose a new one. One idea would be to move the Serbian border with Kosovo near Mitrovica to the south -- to encompass the biggest pocket of Serbs still living inside Kosovo. In return, the Serbs would be asked to give the Kosovo Albanians the two small counties of Serbia along Kosovo's eastern border, where a large number of Albanians still live. That would create much cleaner dividing lines. Then NATO could make Kosovo a self-ruling republic of Yugoslavia, with a promise to consider independence sometime in the future.
Finally, NATO could tell the Serbs that if they agreed to this land swap the sanctions on them would be lifted. The Serbs would get out of their deep economic hole. The Albanians would have self-rule. And NATO could patrol the fence between them.
True, this would mean the world would effectively have two Albanias -- the original Albania and a new Kosovo Albania. Although the Albanians have not shown any capacity for running one state properly, let alone two, Europe will have to live with it.
A broken Kosovo is no place to be experimenting with multiculturalism or affirmative action. As Stalin would say, talking of a self-sustaining, multicultural Kosovo today is like talking about "hot ice or dry water." Our interest is that Kosovo, like Bosnia, be a place where the different ethnic communities can live apart, stably, until they choose to live together again, and where the U.S. and NATO can ensure that stability at the lowest cost. Since the Kosovo war ended before a stable dividing line could be established there, we need to draw that now. Without a stable dividing line we will always be peacekeepers in a land with no peace to keep.

Dow Up Nearly 500 Points In Biggest Daily Point Gain
Investors bought stocks furiously, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in its biggest one-day point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose sharply as investors -- at least for the day -- put aside fears that the Federal Reserve will aggressively raise interest rates and slow the economy to a crawl.
The Dow gained 499.19 points, or nearly 5 percent, to 10,630.60. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three days of sharp losses with a gain of 134.77 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 4,717.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 66.32 points, or 4.8 percent, to 1,458.47. Page A1.
 
Disk Drive Breakthrough Reported
A group of I.B.M. scientists said it had achieved a breakthrough that could result in one-inch disk drives capable of holding 100 times the data of the most sophisticated existing hard drives. The breakthrough is significant for the emerging field of nanotechnology, an effort to build microscopic circuitry and machines only a few molecules in size. C2. 

U.S. Candidate Out of I.M.F. Race
The five-month-long scramble to find a new leader for the International Monetary Fund came to a de facto conclusion as the Japanese and American rivals for the job -- Eisuke Sakakibara and Stanley Fischer -- formally withdrew their nominations and cleared a path for a German, Horst Kohler. A12.
 
Nasdaq Spinoff Plan Is Released
The fine print on the National Association of Securities Dealers' plan to issue stock and spin off the Nasdaq stock market later this year became public. While N.A.S.D. executives predict the deal will pass a membership vote easily, some small brokerage firms expressed hostility to the offering in a conference call. Another group may file suit to stop the deal. C8.
 
Wall St. Urged to Disclose All Orders
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, called on Wall Street to voluntarily put together a system that would disclose all stock orders that have not yet been filled. All markets are now required to disclose any limit orders -- orders to buy or sell a stock at a particular price -- if that order represents the best available price in the market. Mr. Levitt proposed going further than that, but he also said that he was "deeply troubled" by evidence that even the disclosures required are often not being made. C8.
 
Peapod Exploring a Possible Sale
Peapod, the pioneer of the online grocery business, announced that its chief executive, Bill Malloy, would be leaving for health reasons. Then a group of investors who had promised to put $120 million into the company said they would not be doing so, given the departure of Mr. Malloy. The company said it had asked its investment bank to explore alternatives, including a sale. C2.

HEADLINE: BMW Will Shed Rover, Selling Sport Utility Vehicle Line to Ford

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 16

 BODY:
Six years and nearly $6 billion after buying the Rover Group, BMW of Germany abandoned the British automaker today.
BMW essentially gave Rover's money-losing car business to a little-known group of British investors. And it negotiated a deal to sell the Land Rover line of sport utility vehicles to the Ford Motor Company for just under $3 billion. 
 "We really can't think of a better group of brands and products than the Land Rover Group," Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
Ford already owns another venerable British brand, Jaguar, and Mr. Nasser said that Jaguar and Land Rover dealers worldwide would probably team up to sell more of both brands. "We've always referred to the Range Rover as the Jaguar of off-road vehicles," Mr. Nasser said. "They fit together in a showroom very well."
Today's moves by BMW marked a retreat from a strategy of getting bigger and broader, at a time that rivals around the world are merging and forming alliances.
The ownership upheavals came as a shock to Rover's 30,000 workers in Britain as well as to the British government, which has been hoping to salvage one of Rover's main factories with a taxpayer subsidy around $220 million.
BMW, based in Munich, bought Rover in 1994 in the hope of expanding beyond its market for luxury vehicles and of keeping up with larger competitors.
The steps today represented a reversal for BMW and more uncertainty for Rover's workers, whose new boss will be Alchemy Partners, an investor group that includes a former Rover executive, Kevin Morley.
Because nearly half of BMW's shares are controlled by the Quandt family of Germany, which has so far rejected all overtures, BMW's independence seemed assured for now. But analysts say the pressures are increasing. Volvo of Sweden sold its car business last year to Ford. And earlier this week, the Agnelli family of Italy agreed to sell 20 percent of Fiat to General Motors.
Though BMW did not disclose the terms, Alchemy Partners is expected to pay little, if any, money up front, and BMW will assume many of Rover's debts.
BMW said the expense of shedding the Rover car business would cost about 3.15 billion euros, or $3.06 billion. As a result, BMW will report an annual loss of about $2.4 billion.
BMW was officially silent today on the future of Land Rover, the profitable and growing sport utility business, but was expected to announce the deal on Friday. Mr. Nasser discussed the deal with reporters gathered in Dearborn today after the boards of Ford and the BMW Group approved a memorandum of understanding on the sale.
The jettisoning of Rover came as a relief to the parent company's investors, who have viewed the British car line as a black hole for money.
Rover lost more than $1 billion in 1998 and $1.2 billion in 1999. Its annual car sales plunged 24.9 percent last year, to 251,000 vehicles.
In further fallout from the Rover developments, BMW dismissed three of its top executives, the second big boardroom shake-up in 13 months. The three executives, responsible respectively for marketing, production and research and development, had been named to the board in February 1999 and were supposed to oversee the integration of Rover and BMW. Joachim Millberg, who became chief executive after the ouster last year of Bernd Pischetsrieder, appears to have been the main architect of today's moves and will remain.
Stephen Reitman, an automobile analyst in London with Merrill Lynch, said today that BMW's future would be brighter now that it has freed itself from Rover. "It has a massive effect on BMW, in the sense that it removes a significant problem," Mr. Reitman said. But he added, "What it doesn't answer is the issue they themselves have been talking about -- the need for scale."
Excluding Rover, BMW's profit margins are the highest of any car manufacturer in the world except for Porsche. Mr. Reitman estimated BMW's profit margin at 12 or 13 percent, based on American rather than German accounting standards. By contrast, he said, the Mercedes business of DaimlerChrysler has a profit margin oround 8.5 percent.
But BMW faces assaults in the luxury market from the Audi unit of Volkswagen A.G., Volvo and Jaguar, owned by Ford; and of course, DaimlerChrysler.
Many analysts are skeptical that sheer size is the basis of success. But large size can make it easier to distribute research and development costs over more vehicles and achieve economies of scale.
Under the deal announced today, Alchemy will take over Rover's unprofitable line of midpriced sedans, including the more expensive Rover 75, and will acquire Rover's big factory at Longbridge, near Birmingham, which has been in danger of closing for more than a year.
Instead of trying to build smaller cars through Rover, BMW will revive a strategy it discarded years ago and design a new line of cheaper cars under the BMW brand. That is a reversal: BMW executives have strenuously argued that they did not want to "stretch" their prized brand with cars that sell too cheap.
In an odd twist, BMW indicated that it would also give Alchemy Partners the line of Mini subcompacts produced by Rover. Yet it said it would retain the redesigned "new Mini" that is due out later this year.
It is unclear exactly what will happen to Rover, but there were signs today that it would disappear as a brand name. In a statement today, Alchemy Partners said it would reintroduce Rover as the MG Car Company -- adopting the MG marque acquired years ago by Rover's owner then, British Leyland.
Under BMW's previous chief executive, Mr. Pischetsrieder, the company committed itself to becoming bigger and capable of competing in the largest and fastest-growing segment of the market -- medium-priced mass-market cars. But the plan turned disastrous. The rising value of the British pound, in relation to the falling euro, made British cars expensive in Continental Europe and open to competition from Volkswagen and G.M.'s Opel subsidiary. Rover also failed to reduce its costs and the size of its labor force. On top of all that, its midsize car models suffered declining popularity.
Though many experts said the sale of Rover was overdue, some analysts contend that BMW and the Quandt family were so concerned with protecting their independence that they missed opportunities. "It is the Quandts' biggest mistake," said Markus Plumer, an analyst with WestLB Research in Dusseldorf. "G.M. or Ford would have been willing to pay an enormous premium for Rover," Mr. Plumer said. Had BMW been willing to trade off 20 percent of its shares, he added, it could have preserved its independence, raised billions in extra capital and tapped the expertise of companies already making mass-market cars.
Georg Sturzer, an analyst at Hypovereinsbank in Munich, said BMW could navigate on its own. Noting that shares of DaimlerChrysler had plunged in the last year, Mr. Sturzer argued that BMW may have been well advised to focus on luxury cars. "The experience of Porsche gives us an indication," he said. "If size were indicative of operating margins, then Porsche should have the lowest margins in the industry. But it has the highest."

Chart: "A Bumpy Ride"
BMW has spent the last six years and billions of dollars trying to turn around Rover, the British car and sport utility vehicle maker. Yesterday, it abandoned the troubled company.
 
1994 -- BMW buys Rover from British Aerospace and Honda for $1.2 billion.
1998 -- In July, 1,500 jobs are cut from Rover's work force of nearly 40,000. A further 2,500 job cuts through attrition are announced in November, and hours are reduced. Rover's losses reach nearly $1 billion for the year.
FEBRUARY 1999 -- After a seven-hour board room battle, BMW's chairman, Bernd Pischetsrieder, is ousted over the losses at Rover.
MARCH 2000 -- With Rover's losses for 1999 expected to be even higher than 1998's and negotiations with the British government for subsidies stalled, BMW announces a deal to give Rover's car business to a British venture capital firm. A deal to sell the sport utility business to Ford was expected today.(pg. C5)

HEADLINE: Pataki Appoints an Adviser To Assess Nassau Finances

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., March 16

 BODY:
Warning that Nassau County's fiscal troubles could affect both its taxpayers and the Long Island economy as a whole, Gov. George E. Pataki named a special adviser today to evaluate the county's finances.
In tapping Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs the Nasdaq stock market, to study Nassau's budget woes, the governor took the unusual step of invoking his executive powers to look into a local government's trials and tribulations. 
 "The last thing I need to do is inject myself into the problems of a local government or a county government," Mr. Pataki said, explaining the move at his office in Manhattan. "We try not to do that. But I have an obligation as governor to make sure this state's local entities and county entities function as well as possible."
Nassau County has not, by most accounts, been functioning as well as possible. While other local governments have been buoyed by the booming economy, Nassau is in the midst of a fiscal crisis.
Its 2000 budget is expected to fall short by $200 million; its bond rating has been downgraded to the level just above junk status; and its elected officials are weighing fee increases, new taxes and service cuts to put the county's finances back in shape.
Today, county officials traded a new round of proposals and counterproposals to make the county solvent, and by evening, it was unclear what, if anything, would be done.
At 11 a.m., the county comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, announced his plan, which is to refinance the county's debt. At noon, the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, announced his plan -- a package of increased fees, new taxes and cutbacks in service intended to eliminate this year's projected $200 million deficit. And by 1 p.m., major elements of Mr. Gulotta's fiscal plan were being called into question by legislative leaders of both major parties.
Mr. Zarb, who has plenty of experience with Nassau politics as the former chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said he would take a businesslike approach to his audit. "This is not a complex nuclear formula," he said of the county's finances. "It's a pretty straightforward business question, and the answers are going to be pretty straightforward as to the options."
His appointment drew mixed responses from state and local officials.
Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who is speaker of the State Assembly, has already lent his support to a stronger measure, the creation of a fiscal oversight board with the power to certify or reject county budgets. A bill calling for such a board was passed by the Assembly last week; it faces strong opposition in the Republican-controlled State Senate.
But Mr. Silver said today that he welcomed the appointment of Mr. Zarb, who is chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, to study the state of the county. "I respect his opinion," he said.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, another Democrat, said that after all the studies of Nassau's finances that had been done in recent years by his office, by the county comptroller and by others, he questioned the need for further study. "I think the assessment has been done," he said. "What's needed now is some action to bring about fiscal stability in the county."
With that end in mind, Mr. Gulotta, the Republican county executive, announced the long-awaited details of his fiscal recovery plan today. The plan calls for union concessions, new park and health fees, a 5-cent cigarette tax and other measures.
And Mr. Gulotta set a deadline, saying he wanted firm commitments from the County Legislature within 45 days that it would enact certain elements of the plan. "If that does not happen within the next 45 days," he said, "then I am prepared to submit legislation to our County Legislature that will seek increases in our local taxes."
But county lawmakers immediately rejected the biggest component of Mr. Gulotta's plan that requires their approval: his request to borrow the remaining $54 million of the county's share of the nation's tobacco settlement. The money is now held in a trust that is used to pay for health care for the county's uninsured residents.
Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat who is the Legislature's presiding officer, said she would not agree to "raid" the tobacco funds. Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican leader, said that he did not think the Legislature had the authority to use the money and that he would be against doing so if it did.
But both Democratic and Republican lawmakers said they were willing to go along with part of Mr. Gulotta's plan: raising fees for a variety of services, from skating lessons at county rinks to docking at county marinas, for an expected $3.5 million in revenue the rest of this year.
Officials questioned whether several other components of Mr. Gulotta's plan were likely to win approval. Mr. Silver noted that the county executive's call to defer a $19 million payment to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which would need state approval, could harm other areas in the state.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Reclusive North Korea Reaches Out to the World

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 16

 BODY:
In the space of a few short weeks, North Korea has gone from one of the world's most politically reclusive states to the most diplomatically ambitious.
With little fanfare, but with a speed that has surprised many people, the Communist government in Pyongyang has established diplomatic relations with Italy and has resumed diplomatic discussions with Japan and Australia for the first time in years. 
It has also recently sent out discreet feelers to at least two other major Western nations, Canada and Britain. And according to diplomats in the Philippines, it has approached their country about joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum.
Political experts attribute much of this diplomatic activity to a feeling among North Korean leaders that they have consolidated their authority and that their government will survive any threats by foreign countries. They also believe that the overall direction of the country is promising, given that only recently it was on the brink of economic collapse, with much of its population hit by famine.
These moves are taking place against the backdrop of talks between the United States and North Korea that diplomats say will be crucial to easing the country's isolation and lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula, one of the cold war's final flash points.
In New York this week, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan, and an American delegation led by Charles Kartman have been discussing final arrangements for high-level talks between the two countries tentatively scheduled for April in Washington. No high-ranking North Korean official has visited Washington since the Korean War ended in 1953.
In September, the Clinton administration lifted some trade, banking and other sanctions that had been imposed on North Korea for decades. Now Pyongyang wants Washington to take it off a list of nations that Washington says support terrorism. Among other things, the United States reportedly wants North Korea to agree that it will not resume tests of ballistic missiles like the one it fired over Japan in 1998.
Washington has also sought to encourage Pyongyang to respond more favorably to the so-called Sunshine Policy of the South Korean leader, Kim Dae Jung. North Korea has recently accepted limited forms of investment and tourism from South Korea, but has spurned offers for direct talks.
"The U.S. has been encouraging them to engage with the outside world," said Park Young Ho, a senior research fellow at the Korean Institute for National Unification, in Seoul. "This is happening at a time when North Korea seems to have realized that it needs to have more relations with other countries in order to improve its own situation."
Other experts have taken a much more skeptical view of Pyongyang's opening. They say it is a short-term ploy meant to keep North Korea's weapons programs and its often belligerent posturing from becoming campaign issues in important legislative elections in South Korea in April, and in the United States presidential election in November.
"This may be a diplomatic flurry for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," said Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. "But, like they say, they've been down so long it looks like up now. All of the new diplomacy is with countries that are willing to give assistance, and it is meant to cover them in case the Washington scenario doesn't work out."
But other recent signs of diplomatic activity by Pyongyang have involved its historic ideological patrons. This month the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, paid an unusual visit to the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang, at the invitation of the ambassador, Wan Yongxiang.
In its only explanation of the visit, the official North Korean media said Mr. Kim "expressed thanks for the invitation and conversed with the leading officials of the embassy."
The visit set off speculation among North Korea experts that Mr. Kim was preparing to visit China. It would be his first overseas trip since assuming power after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
North Korea has also recently signed a new friendship treaty with Russia.
This diplomatic activity comes at a time when Mr. Kim believes that he is in a strong position politically, despite a sharp and prolonged economic decline brought on by the disappearance of its cold war allies from the Soviet bloc, and by unusually harsh weather and crop failures that led to famine.
Last year, the economy is believed to have grown slightly, for the first time in a decade. And in a change from his normal diet of visits to military installations, the 58-year-old North Korean leader began emphasizing visits to factories and food production centers.
Now, many experts say, Mr. Kim appears determined to bring about a rebound from economic collapse. He has apparently decided that one of the keys to doing this is through a controlled opening to the rest of the world. If this is so, there is still considerable divergence among experts over the economic direction to expect from Pyongyang.
Under its Sunshine Policy, South Korea is investing heavily, both in economic and diplomatic terms, in encouraging its neighbor to emulate the gradual evolution toward capitalism undertaken by Communist nations like China and Vietnam.
In a recent interview, President Kim of South Korea said Pyongyang had three options before it: war, which would end disastrously for it; the status quo, which he said has already proven a dead end, and evolutionary change.
"This third option, which I believe is the only viable option, is to follow the example of China and Vietnam," Mr. Kim said. "They have maintained their political systems, while gradually opening up economically. This is what we, and all of our friends and allies, want from North Korea, and we are prepared to help them."

Thornton Is the Calm In the Storm

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: TUCSON

 BODY:
LATE Wednesday evening Darlene Grimes was talking about the hectic week she had already had. While her son, Bootsy Thornton, was in Tucson leading St. John's to a narrow first-round victory in the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament, Grimes was in Baltimore, where she is a medical assistance specialist. Grimes goes from hospital to hospital helping patients fill out insurance paperwork. The hardest part this week has been carrying around the heavy silver trophy her son won last week as the Big East tournament's most valuable player.
The trophy has become a great conversation piece. On Monday she took it to Johns Hopkins University Hospital, where doctors, nurses and patients admired it and offered their congratulations. Then Tuesday it was off to Liberty Medical Center. Yesterday she was taking it to Union Memorial Hospital. 
 "I took it with me when I got my shoes repaired," she said, laughing.
In each place, faces lighted up because Grimes's face was glowing. This was a happy story. Thornton was born in East Baltimore, where he attended Dunbar High School, then played at Tallahassee Community College before coming to St. John's.
"It means a lot to me that he's made it this far," his mother said by telephone. "Since he was 8 years old this has been his dream. He wanted to play college basketball, wanted to play in the N.B.A. I wanted him to get a good education and be an artist. I never thought he'd get this close."
What she is most proud of, she said, is her son's independent mind. Earlier in the season, when teammates wore Band-Aids on their cheeks to commemorate Erick Barkley's N.C.A.A. suspension, Thornton went Band-Aid-less. He refuses to wear earrings.
Last night, Thornton, in his typically cool fashion, bailed St. John's out of a potential nightmare first-round elimination. He hit key shots, grabbed critical rebounds and handed out timely assists, and, finally, hit the last 2 points of the game.
Unfortunately for Thornton, a remarkable senior season -- one that included a dramatic basket to beat Duke -- has been overshadowed by N.C.A.A. investigations and daily disclosures surrounding Barkley, his backcourt mate. For all his on-court accomplishments, Thornton achieved national attention last weekend for a locker-room altercation. He and Barkley exchanged heated words at halftime of a Big East tournament semifinal game.
"I made the paper that day," Thornton said with a hint of humor. "No matter how many good games I had, I never seemed to make the back page; but one little negative thing happened and I get headlines, 'Erick and Bootsy Fight.' That bothered me a little."
He said he and Barkley are friends, not just teammates. "If it's just on court and not off the court, it carries over on the court," he said. "So you have to have a great off-the-court relationship as well as on-court."
Thornton's real first name is Marvis. His mother, who separated from Bootsy's father and was married several years ago, said when she was pregnant she and Bootsy's father had debates over how they would name the baby. "At first he said he wanted the name Marvis, because his name is Marvis and his father's name is Marvis; then he said he didn't care," she said. "I was thinking about naming him Teon Terrell Thornton."
His father changed his mind again. "So we named him Marvis Thornton III," Grimes said. "But I just couldn't call him Marvis. So I tried to come up with different nicknames."
She settled on one inspired by Bootsy Collins, the trend-setting bass player for Parliament-Funkadelic, the band that laid the foundation for generations of rappers. "I really liked him," she said. "I remembered songs he made that I liked, like "Flashlight.' "
Two decades later the nickname is fitting. Thornton has assumed the bass player's role for St. John's. He moves without the ball, deftly uses space, and has an economy of movement that keeps the offense going. When nerves begin to fray, the understated Thornton, standing in the back of the rhythm section, exhorts teammates to keep a cool head, to channel the anger and frustration into the game. Last night, he provided desperately needed offense, scoring 20 points, handing out 3 assists and grabbing 7 rebounds.
"I've always been the quiet, behind-the-scenes guy -- a calm guy who gets the job done," he said. So far it has worked. The tempest continues, the investigation continues. Bootsy Thornton is still keeping steady time.

HEADLINE: Angry Over Confederate Flag, Mayor Plans March

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 16

 BODY:
For years, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, S.C., has done everything but beg the South Carolina Legislature to stop embarrassing the state and lower the Confederate battle flag from atop the state Capitol. Today, frustrated by the lack of progress on the issue, the mayor announced his boldest gesture yet: a 120-mile march from Charleston to Columbia, S.C., next month to increase the pressure on flag supporters.
Mr. Riley, who has been in office since 1975, is a popular figure in South Carolina, widely credited with revitalizing the city as a tolerant and gracious tourist attraction. Although the mayor has never been particularly known for dramatic gestures, he said the flag's divisive presence called for an updated use of an old civil rights technique. 
 "I've been increasingly concerned that the lack of action by our legislature is presenting an inaccurate portrayal of our state," Mr. Riley said in an interview. "The broad majority of citizens in our state want the flag removed -- every religious group, civic group, business group. Our legislature is simply out of step with the people of our state, and I wanted a way to convey that to the country, and to put pressure on the legislature to act, and act now."
The mayor has invited dozens of business and civic leaders to join him on the five-day trek, which is to begin on April 2, and has said he hopes hundreds of people will join in. The march will take place only in daylight hours and will follow U.S. 176, which runs northwest from Charleston and parallels Interstate 26. Mr. Riley said marchers would carry the state flag, which features a palmetto tree and a crescent moon.
"People understand that it's the state flag you should fly on your Capitol," he said, "not the one that represents another government that's been gone for 135 years."
The Confederate battle flag has flown over the Statehouse since 1962, when it was raised as a symbol of defiance to the civil rights movement. There have many campaigns to remove the flag over the years, but it became a flash point in this year's presidential campaign after the N.A.A.C.P., calling the flag a symbol of slavery and intolerance, declared an economic boycott of South Carolina until it is removed.
Vice President Al Gore has urged that the flag be removed; his Republican opponent for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has said the matter should be left to the people of South Carolina.
Despite increasing pressure from the state's business community to remove the flag, the matter has been stalled for months by several hard-line legislators who say they will never agree to move the flag as long as the boycott is in place. Last month Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, a Democrat, proposed a compromise that would move the flag near a statue of Wade Hampton, a Confederate general from South Carolina, at the rear of the Statehouse. But flag supporters oppose the idea, saying the spot is not sufficiently prominent.
Two state senators on opposite sides of the issue -- Glenn F. McConnell, a flag supporter, and Darrell Jackson, an opponent -- said yesterday that they had been negotiating for weeks on a possible compromise, but had not yet succeeded. In general, however, the mood in the Statehouse has been increasingly tense and racially divided.
One leading flag supporter today accused the state's business leaders, many of whom will be joining Mr. Riley on his march, of selling out the state's traditions because of economic concerns. Christopher Sullivan, chairman of the South Carolina Heritage Coalition, which has close ties to many pro-flag legislators, said businesses were so concerned about the boycott that they had made the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce "nothing more than a political shill for the N.A.A.C.P."
Because of its status as a tourist attraction, the Charleston area has been the hardest-hit region of the state by the boycott. Several conventions and sports events have been canceled, along with a performance by the Bill T. Jones dance company, a prominent part of the city's Spoleto arts festival in May and June.
But Mayor Riley said economic pressure was the least of his reasons for organizing the march.
"The boycott concerns me," he said, "but I'm far more worried about the state's reputation. We've had good race relations here. Our governors didn't stand in front of schoolhouse doors and resist integration."
"But this flag issue is creating a different impression," he added, "and I think it's time that the legislature finally feels the heat from the people of South Carolina."

Jobless Rate Lowest For Month Since '89

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New York State's unemployment rate dipped 0.2 percentage points in February to 4.7 percent, the lowest for a February since 1989, the State Labor Department reported yesterday.
The state's unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in January and 5.3 percent in February 1999. 
 Nationally, unemployment was 4.1 percent in February, compared with 4.0 percent in January and 4.4 percent in February 1999.
Joblessness in New York City fell last month to 5.8 percent from 6.1 percent in January and 7.1 percent in February 1999. Among counties, Putnam's jobless rate of 2.9 percent was the lowest for February.
Counties across New York's North Country were the only ones in the state with double-digit unemployment in February: Hamilton (13.9 percent); Lewis (12.8 percent); Jefferson (12.2 percent); Franklin (11.2 percent); Essex (10.4 percent); and St. Lawrence (10.1 percent). Joblessness typically rises across that region in the winter and drops in the summer, when the tourism industry is revived.

HEADLINE: In Culture's Capital, Respect the Librarian

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Forlorn and Forgotten in the Stacks" (news article, March 14):
New York City's public librarians are reported to be paid less than the city's garbage collectors, despite librarians' vital role in public education and the fact that they are required to have a master's degree. Many have been forced to leave for the suburbs or the private sector in search of better pay. 
 It is a disgrace for a city that often boasts of being the cultural capital of the United States, or even of the world, not to be willing or able to pay its librarians decent salaries.
For the city to remain vibrant, economically and culturally, successful librarians are just as important as successful investment bankers.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Coming Closer To a Utopia In the Bronx

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
DESPITE Clarence Stein's painstaking plans, his apartment complex in the Bronx is still not quite the utopia he had in mind. But it's a lot closer than it was a few years ago.
It was called Hillside Homes when Mr. Stein designed it in the early 1930's, shortly after he and Lewis Mumford organized the famous utopian housing project in Queens, Sunnyside Gardens. Mr. Stein moved on to the Williamsbridge section of the North Bronx, at the intersection of Eastchester and Boston Roads, and covered five blocks with low-rise brick buildings. 
 Mr. Stein disdained conventional development as the "marketing and protection of property." His goal was "to create communities." The apartments in the Bronx were built around interconnected courtyards, and included playgrounds and common rooms for workshops and clubs and a nursery school.
The community flourished by attracting Eastern European and Italian immigrants from the Lower East Side, but eventually it declined, for various reasons -- suburban flight, rent control, incompetent management, crack cocaine. By the mid-90's, nearly half of the 1,400 apartments were vacant. The playground was used for pit-bull fights, and the maze of courtyards was a haven for drug dealers.
"The police were afraid to come in," said Brian Lewis, who began managing the project in 1996. "They called it Ambush Alley after an officer was killed here. There were 132 apartments occupied by drug dealers." The buildings were covered with graffiti, and Mr. Lewis counted 4,000 broken windows.
"You were afraid to send kids to the playground," said Dave Burrell, a retired police officer who is the leader of the newly organized tenants' group. "Now you go out there, and there's a group of seniors watching the children play. There's a new pride in the neighborhood."
Now all the buildings are full. The residents, many of them Caribbean immigrants, pay rents from $400 to $750 for a one-bedroom apartment. Mr. Lewis has won an award from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for helping to create that rarity in New York: affordable housing.
What makes it especially rare is that taxpayers are not footing the bill. Although the complex has a long history of government subsidy -- it was originally financed with New Deal money and later was supported by the state's Mitchell-Lama housing program -- the rehabilitation has been paid for entirely by the Emmes Group, the company that took over the bankrupt development three years ago.
The new owners have spent $5 million, a pittance for such a large project, and they say the key to success has been that intangible asset prized by the original architect. "We had to restore the feeling of community," said Harley Frank, a vice president of the company, who grew up not far from the apartment complex.
ONE of the first steps was to rename the complex. Hillside Homes became Eastchester Heights. Mr. Stein might have dismissed it as a mere ploy for the "marketing of property," but the new owners figured the new image was crucial. It was the broken-window theory in reverse.
"We wanted to quickly change everyone's perception of this place," Mr. Frank said. "We wanted to make it clear to the drug dealers that there's a new landlord paying attention, and we wanted tenants to feel the community was worth saving."
The new landlord focused on Mr. Stein's communal spaces. Courtyards were cleaned and landscaped. Graffiti was removed. The playground got new equipment for toddlers and top-of-the-line backboards on the basketball court. Community rooms were refurbished for new after-school programs and clubs.
The result may not meet Mr. Stein's utopian expectations -- you can still find the occasional patch of graffiti and remnant of a drug deal -- but it's impressive by comparison with other efforts to house the working classes. Eastchester Heights feels a lot more public-spirited than the nearby city housing project, Edenwald Houses. The first thing you notice upon visiting the two places is how much less trash there is on the grounds at Eastchester.
"I'll bet you that the city project has twice as many maintenance people as we do, but look at the garbage there," said Jerry Williams, who recently left the New York City Housing Authority to manage Eastchester Heights. "Money is not enough. You have to change people's attitude. When people take pride in their community, they don't throw garbage on the ground."

HEADLINE: Census Takers Moved by Money And Civic Duty;
A Temp Position That Counts, Even if It Doesn't Last Long

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
It's not a job with a future, but the future of many neighborhoods in America may be affected by how well the job is done.
Every 10 years, the Census Bureau hires an army of census takers -- enumerators, in bureau parlance. For the 2000 count, which has just begun, the bureau needs about a half-million of them. 
 The job lasts only six weeks or so. It involves knocking on the doors of strangers -- people who do not return the forms recently sent to every household in the nation -- and asking them personal questions: their ages, their races, the names of their children and, in many cases, whether they are married and how much money they make.
In New York City, it pays $18.50 an hour -- not bad for a temp job. It requires math, reasoning ability and an F.B.I. background check.
Oh, and there's also a quiz.
On a recent morning, two dozen would-be census takers were hunkered down over the test in a conference room at a Downtown Brooklyn building, answering -- or vainly puzzling over -- the 28 questions, which were intended to measure their mathematical, reading, clerical and organizational skills. (Sample question: "Ms. Jones can't remember the year of her birth, but she knows she was born in the month of September. If it is now May 1990, and Ms. Jones tells you she is 78 years old, in what year was she born?" Answer: 1911.)
Despite the thriving economy and low unemployment, many people seem eager for the work, either because they need the money or because they believe it is their civic duty.
On this day, at least two applicants were there because of population pressures in their own families. "I've got two babies to support," said Jose Pena, 25, an unemployed construction worker from the Sunset Park area. Damark Mitchell, 34, of Fort Greene, said he already had a full-time job as a carpenter, but that he was willing to work nights and weekends knocking on doors. "I need extra money," he explained. "I've got three small kids."
Another applicant, Jerry Schultz, 68, of Cobble Hill, said he had worked as an actor, a welfare investigator and a market researcher, among many pursuits, but he was retired now and struggling to meet expenses from his wife's illness. Because of the medical bills, he said, "My bank account is being depleted." He added: "I enjoy meeting people, so it should be interesting."
For Jasmine Lozada, 20, of Sunset Park, the goal was "saving money for college." A graduate of South Brooklyn Community High School, she said she hoped to enroll at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. And while she said, "All that matters is I'll be making the money," to the Census Bureau it matters that she is fluent in Spanish. Bureau officials say those hired will be assigned to the greatest degree possible to the areas they live in, and Sunset Park has a large population of Hispanic immigrants.
"We'll be hiring by the thousands," said Kathy Nicolaou-Hagianis, the recruiting coordinator for the bureau's New York region. She said she could not be more specific until it was clear next month how many of the region's households had failed to return the questionnaire.
Census officials said this week that they had met 90 percent of their goal of testing 3 million applicants nationwide, including about 250,000 in the New York region, for the enumerator jobs. They want a pool of 2.4 million qualified applicants across the country, five times the number they expect to hire, because experience indicates that many who are found eligible will not accept the jobs. Some will have found permanent jobs. Others will have had second thoughts about knocking on strangers' doors.
In the 1990 census, 35 percent of the New York region's 6.1 million households at the time failed to return the form -- the same percentage as in the country generally -- while in New York City that figure was 41 percent.
In its intensive effort to recruit census takers, the bureau has announced the job openings in letters and cards mailed to every residence in the country. Ms. Lozada said she learned about the jobs through television announcements and fliers that the bureau had posted on lampposts and other highly visible places, giving local numbers to call or a national number reachable anywhere in the country: 1-888-325-7733.
Census takers must be at least 17. They need not be citizens, though they must be in the country legally and permitted to work. The pay varies across the country, with the range this year -- from a low of $8.25 an hour in Duncan, Okla., to a high of $18.50 in New York City -- "more competitive with local labor rates than 10 years ago," said Clifton Taylor Jr., chief of recruiting. Those assigned as crew leaders will receive somewhat more.
The census was once handled entirely by door-to-door enumerators. But since 1970, the bureau has relied on the questionnaires, followed by visits to those who did not respond to them. This time, the surveys were mailed in recent days to 98 million homes. In the case of an additional 20 million homes, mostly in rural areas where people pick up their mail at post offices and other central locations, the forms are being delivered to the residences.
The forms are due back by April 1. Near the end of April, the census takers will begin making their rounds. If nobody is home, they are supposed to return as many as three times, and make up to three telephone calls, said Peter Sefton, the Census Bureau's chief of household enumeration. If those efforts fail, he said, "they are to try to get the information from a neighbor" or someone like an apartment house manager.
In the 1990 census, not all the enumerators were so diligent; some made up the information instead. In northern New Jersey, census workers said some supervisors told them to fabricate data for thousands of households in response to pressure from the Philadelphia regional office to finish the count. As a result, the bureau sent new enumerators to 18,000 homes at an additional cost of several hundred thousand dollars.
This year, Mr. Sefton said, the bureau is taking "proactive steps" to combat falsification, including checking a random sample of each census taker's work by sending another enumerator back to the homes in the sample.
Critics of the census say the real accuracy problem is not the few instances of faked forms, but the undercount. In recent years, there have been politically and racially charged debates and lawsuits about the accuracy of the census, which is used for apportioning seats among the states in the House of Representatives and for redistricting state legislatures.
Those disputes have stemmed from the difficulty of achieving a full and accurate count because of people who, out of fear, suspicion or the belief that some of the questions are intrusive, refuse to return the surveys, provide false or incomplete information or try to avoid the census takers. They include illegal immigrants fearful of deportation, welfare recipients worried about losing benefits if they list their spouses as living with them, and people afraid of being evicted if they report relatives or friends who have moved into the home without the landlord's permission. As a result, demographic experts estimate, the 1990 census missed about four million people, or 1.6 percent of the nation's population. New York City officials say that about 300,000 people living in the city were not counted. That census missed a disproportionately large number of minorities in low-income urban areas, experts said.
For these reasons, census takers have a crucial role to play in persuading people to cooperate.
Officials said the enumerators will be instructed to stress that federal law mandates that census information remain confidential, even from law enforcement and immigration agencies. They will be told to point out that a full and accurate count is important to the family and its community because of the data's role in determining how much government money is distributed to cities and neighborhoods for programs like school aid, job training, housing assistance and health services. As a last resort, they can point out that refusing to answer the census can bring a $100 fine -- although in 1990, nobody was prosecuted.
If census takers feel threatened, officials said, they are supposed to leave immediately.
In the test-taking session in Downtown Brooklyn, the applicants who were interviewed said they were not concerned about where they might be assigned. But Helene Leskin, a recruiting official for the area running from Brooklyn Heights to Sunset Park, said some applicants, especially the elderly, did indicate concern about safety. "We'll say, 'You're going to be working in your neighborhood,' and they feel more comfortable," she said.
One applicant, Rafael Torres Jr., 21, a mason tender from Red Hook, said that for him, working in his own neighborhood was precisely the point. Red Hook is one of the areas in the city that Ms. Leskin called "red zones," those with census tracts that had very low rates of questionnaire returns in 1990.
"I come from an impoverished neighborhood," Mr. Torres said, "and I noticed that ghetto communities go undercounted." He said he wanted to do his part to ensure that everyone in his community is counted.
"We're always complaining," he said. "We should be doing."

HEADLINE: Surging Petroleum Prices Push Inflation Rate to 3-Year High

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Surging petroleum prices pushed the inflation rate in February to its highest level in three years, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But beyond fuel and energy, the nation remained remarkably free of the rising inflation that the booming economy was expected to have produced by now.
The Consumer Price Index, the best-known inflation gauge, has risen 3.2 percent over the last 12 months, the first time the yearlong rate had gone above 3 percent since February 1997. But with energy excluded, the annual rate was only 2.1 percent, unchanged for many months, although some economists had expected a much greater impact from labor shortages and rising wages. 
 The inflation rate remained at 2.1 percent when food was excluded as well as energy. Prices in these sectors often jump around from month to month, so economists subtract them to get a "core" inflation rate.
"In a certain bizarre way, life would be easier for Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve if there had been a bad C.P.I.," said Robert Barbera, chief economist for the Hoenig Group. "They could then have dealt with their real problem, an excessively high stock market, and blamed their actions on inflation in goods and services."
The Fed's policy makers are expected to raise interest rates when they meet on Tuesday, but not by enough to inhibit stock market investors, many analysts say.
Most of last month's increase of 0.5 percent -- the largest one-month rise since last April -- reflected the run-up in petroleum prices. Gasoline at the pump averaged $1.42 a gallon, up from $1.36 in January. Airline fares rose as airlines tacked on surcharges to cover higher fuel prices. And the cost of running a home rose, reflecting higher prices for heating oil and natural gas, whose price fluctuates with that of petroleum.
Natural gas is widely used to generate electricity, and electricity rates jumped 0.8 percent in February, the biggest increase since July 1997. So far, however, the rise in petroleum and natural gas prices has not spread to other products, like plastics, which are made from oil or natural gas.
Toy prices, for example, did not rise, and vehicle prices, adjusted for quality improvements, fell last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Even truckers have not managed to jack up freight rates, although the squeeze on their earnings from higher fuel prices has truckers protesting in Washington for relief.
Those situations will change, says Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers L.L.C. in St. Louis, if the petroleum-producing countries somehow manage to make the oil price increases stick.
"If companies expect the increase to be temporary, they will eat the cost and squeeze profit margins temporarily," he said. "But if energy prices stay high, firms will try to restore their profits by raising prices."
Beyond energy, there were scattered price increases, in cigarettes, for example, and hospital rates. Meat and pork prices rose 1.7 percent, which is more than usual, and such increases may repeat themselves because of a supply shortage, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist in the consumer price division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Fruit and vegetable prices also rose last month, but the 0.7 percent increase mainly reflected an aberration in the way prices are adjusted for seasonal factors, Mr. Jackman said.
And some prices fell in February. Vehicle prices dropped 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent drop in January. Long-distance telephone rates also fell, along with the cost of purchasing and using a cell phone.

HEADLINE: Caviar-and-Carpet Diplomacy

 BODY:
The White House responded smartly yesterday to the recent election of a moderate Iranian Parliament by lifting some economic sanctions and hinting that more might follow. Tehran must make the next move by dropping its resistance to direct government-to-government talks with Washington.
The American actions, outlined by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, end a ban on the import of Iranian food and handicrafts, accelerate talks on resolving competing financial claims going back to the 1979 Iranian revolution and ease licensing rules for cultural and academic exchanges. Food and handicraft exports like caviar, pistachio nuts and carpets bring in far less revenue than oil exports, which remain barred. But Dr. Albright implied that other steps could come if Iran responds positively, including reconsideration of a prohibition on American investment in Iran's oil industry. 
 The reform coalition around President Mohammad Khatami has an ambitious domestic agenda that includes working out a reallocation of power with conservative clerical authorities, reviving Iran's economy and restoring rule of law. Until now, the reformers have been skittish about taking on sensitive foreign policy issues like mending ties with Washington. But Dr. Albright's proposals demonstrate the domestic advantages to be gained from less strained relations with the United States. Food and handicraft exports to America can generate millions of jobs, helping the reformers reduce Iran's dangerously high unemployment rate. A successful conclusion to the claims talks could also free assets needed for development.
As Dr. Albright noted, conservative clerical leaders still exercise great power. There can be no normal ties, and probably no lifting of oil sanctions, until the clerically controlled Revolutionary Guards and intelligence agencies sever their ties with terrorism and the military abandons its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Dr. Albright also drew a proper link between human rights issues and future improvements in relations with Iran.
Washington has now offered a gesture of friendship, including a frank acknowledgment of past American policy mistakes toward Iran. With his strengthened political hand at home, Mr. Khatami should do his part to ease an estrangement that serves neither America's interests nor Iran's.

HEADLINE: Predatory Loan Scams

 BODY:
A Minnesota paralegal realizes too late that her home equity loan was for $13,000 more than she thought. A borrower finds out belatedly that her $45,000 loan required not only $90,000 of repayments over 15 years, but also a final additional payment of $41,000. These are despicable examples of predatory subprime home equity loans -- loans using the borrower's home as collateral that are made to people with blemished credit records and that impose exorbitant fees or conditions that virtually force the borrower into foreclosure.
As reported this week by Diana Henriques of The Times in cooperation with ABC News, one such lender, First Alliance Corporation, has been sued for deceptive practices by a dozen homeowners, the AARP and regulators in several states. First Alliance and some other subprime lenders are accused of preying upon naive and desperate people who could not borrow from conventional lenders. They wound up borrowing amounts they could not afford to repay at rates that were far out of line with what other subprime lenders were charging. First Alliance denies the allegations. 
 The courts can take care of any misrepresentation or fraud, but who should clamp down on the lenders is a trickier question. Subprime lenders, good and bad, get their money from some of Wall Street's finest. First Alliance's money came from securities sold to investors by Lehman Brothers, and Lehman says it disclosed all relevant financial risks to these investors. But underwriters do not attest to the moral virtue of their clients.
States, however, can step in. In New York, regulators are designing rules that would outlaw some of the worst features of predatory lending. The rules set limits on some of the fees that borrowers could be charged and would require lenders to consider whether the borrower could afford to repay the loan as negotiated.
Subprime lenders, most of whom are legitimate, must charge people with blemished credit records higher than normal fees and interest rates in order to compensate for the risk. If state regulators crack down too hard they risk driving legitimate lenders out of the market, leaving needy borrowers in the lurch. But the New York proposals, if anything, are overly lenient. Many of the people in the subprime market are unsophisticated in financial matters and easy victims for sleazy sales practices. They deserve better legal protection.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce the Japanese Way;
Ubiquitous Convenience Stores Branch Into Cyberspace

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 17

 BODY:
Tucked amid the instant noodles, pantyhose and canned drinks at the local Lawson, Japan's second-largest convenience store chain, customers now find a computer terminal that gives them access to a system called Loppi. With a few stabs at the keyboard, they can order concert tickets, make train and plane reservations and pay at the cash register on the way out.
Need a book? Seven-Eleven Japan, the country's largest operator of convenience stores, lets a customer hop online to eShopping Books, a site owned by Softbank, Seven-Eleven, Yahoo! Japan and Tohan, Japan's leading book distributor. A day or so later, on the way home from work perhaps, the customer picks up the selection and pays for it at the local Seven-Eleven. 
 Seven-Eleven -- with the Seven spelled out, unlike its American counterpart -- can also help with elderly parents. Just order a meal online and the company will deliver it.
With no further room to expand physically in this densely packed country and with competition intensifying as new stores cannibalize old, the neighborhood convenience store, or "conbini," is betting on the new economy in Japan, moving to embrace technology. Long accustomed to adding some 50 new products to its merchandise mix every week on average, the conbini are fast grabbing hunks of cyberspace to expand its limited shelf space.
At the same time, the deregulation that has been unfolding since the mid-1990's is allowing Japanese convenience stores to encroach on territory long out of their reach, like beauty and health aids and banking.
"In the last year, the convenience store has become an indispensable part of the mosaic that is electronic commerce," said Kenyu Adachi, director of the distribution industry division of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. "Without the convenience store, e-commerce in Japan would have more trouble taking off."
Nonetheless, Mr. Adachi and his ministry express a more tempered enthusiasm for e-tailing in Japan than do investors, who have, at least initially, bid up to astonishing levels the stocks of any Japanese company remotely associated with the Internet and information technology.
A study last year by the ministry and Andersen Consulting concluded that while e-commerce in Japan would one day have the same market share it has in the United States, Japan's less-developed information technology infrastructure and its still significant regulatory hurdles would mean a much slower rollout.
But the big convenience store chains, which have most of the market, are adding new virtual services and connections at such a clip that analysts complain they cannot keep track of it all. Almost simultaneously, the major chains have begun introducing Internet strategies, raising questions about the profitability of such ventures.
Convenience stores have a special place in society here, where tiny homes with space for only miniature refrigerators and minimal storage make frequent shopping a necessity. Because of its size, averaging about 100 square meters, the convenience store escaped the reach of Japanese regulators and thus can be far nimbler and more responsive to customer whims and fancies than its larger brethren.
At Seven-Eleven, inventory is controlled by advanced inventory management and technology. Plus, unlike other stores, most conbini are open round the clock.
There are more than 33,000 convenience stores across the country and traffic in them is high: some 900 people a day visit the average Seven-Eleven store, while two other large chains, FamilyMart and the Circle K Japan unit of the UNY Corporation, have about 700 customers a day. (Lawson, part of the Japanese retailer Daiei Inc., does not make its numbers available.) Makoto Usui, director and general manager of information systems at Seven-Eleven, said the average customer visits a Seven-Eleven store once every other day.
The bonds are deep. In a recent interview, when Hidetoshi Nakata, the Japanese soccer star who plays for Rome, was asked what he most missed about home, he answered, "Conbini."
Their ubiquity and popularity make them attractive partners to the many virtually unknown e-commerce companies out there, whose biggest expense is likely to be marketing. "They have a huge advantage over the typical Internet start-up," said Mike Allen, a retail analyst at ING Barings here. "The biggest cost that has prevented dot-com companies from making money is promotion, and convenience stores have almost no promotional costs because customers flock to them."
The conbini have helped Japanese e-commerce pioneers like the Softbank Corporation and Rakuten Ichiba, an online bazaar, leap two major hurdles: payment and delivery. Japanese consumers are more reluctant than their American counterparts to send their credit card account numbers out into cyberspace. And the product orders can piggyback onto the stores' existing distribution system.
The conbini also give consumers access to a computer terminal. Though computers have been selling at a blistering pace here of late, penetration is still lower than in the United States and Internet access charges are still high in comparison with those in other parts of the world. And though conbini customers cannot yet surf the entire World Wide Web, they soon will be able to.
"What does a convenience store have that makes it attractive to us and our customers?" said Yasuhiro Suzuki, president and chief executive of the e-Shopping Information Corporation, the Softbank unit that manages e-commerce ventures. "In a word, convenience."
Operations like Mr. Suzuki's would, in turn, appear to solve a major problem for Japanese convenience stores: the lack of space. The only way they have kept sales moving forward is by opening more stores; in general, sales in stores open at least one year are falling. But there are few practical locations left.
"The backdrop of expanding our business to include e-commerce is the need to expand our current offering of goods and services and increase our ability to meet the needs of customers without expanding our space," Mr. Usui of Seven-Eleven said.
Whether e-commerce will help the convenience stores become more profitable is unclear. Take the introduction of so-called energy drinks. Previously sold only in drugstores, convenience stores started selling the vitamin- and herb-laced drinks last spring, when deregulation opened the market to them.
But unlike the addition of beer and sake to the merchandise mix five years ago, the introduction of energy drinks has not significantly increased the stores' overall revenues. While sales of the new products have met projections, they merely replaced those of the other items that previously occupied the selling space.
Though those constraints do not exist in cyberspace, there, too, profitability may be a problem. E-Shopping Books, the joint venture, was billed as a baby Amazon.com, but sales so far are minuscule: as of the end of January, each Seven-Eleven store was selling four books every 10 days on average.
Mr. Suzuki said that figure represented a quadrupling in volume since the service started in November, and added, "The progress we've seen in the business has been better than expected."
He said he was confident the business would turn profitable, in part because its cost structure may be lower than Amazon.com's. E-Shopping Books does not shoulder the costs of warehousing merchandise, since it can use Tohan's and Seven-Eleven's warehouses, and it pays for the books only after they have been sold. The business will also share the e-shopping name, administrative functions and technological infrastructure with Softbank's online toy and car parts businesses, as well as others introduced in the future, cutting marketing and administrative costs.
"A newcomer to the business would have a tough time finding temporary warehousing for delivery to customers, but convenience stores can act as the final pick-up point quite easily because of their infrastructure," said Ken Sakamura, a professor at Tokyo University. "They already have warehouses."
But while such teamwork lowers costs, it also means that profits, should they materialize, have to be divided.
The same sort of division of the spoils has so far, in an experimental stage, proved unprofitable for the conbini. Although polls show that consumers here have long wished for automated teller machines in convenience stores, they have not used the A.T.M.'s enough in the few months they have been available to make it worthwhile.
The machines allow customers to do everything from arrange money transfers to make deposits and withdrawals and even obtain small consumer loans. Mr. Allen at ING Barings said 100 transactions a day were needed to make store-based A.T.M.'s profitable. In test cases by various convenience store chains, which have placed A.T.M.'s in their bigger stores, transactions are running at 10 to 50 a day, a level that generates a loss for the stores after they pay their banking partner and their technology and software providers.
To help overcome this barrier to profitability, the Ito-Yokado Company, which controls Seven-Eleven, plans to apply for a banking license.
The most promising area of new business for the convenience stores is likely to be online services like ticketing and reservations. Such services are popular -- and go quickly -- because people typically know exactly what they are looking for, said Hideki Tanaka, an e-commerce analyst at the Fujitsu Research Institute. "But I question whether the typical convenience store customer is going to take 10 or 20 extra minutes to stand at a computer terminal in the store browsing for goods they want to buy," he said.
Considering that the most popular use of Loppi, Lawson's online system, is looking up one's horoscope, that is a question well worth contemplating.

HEADLINE: Outlining Goals, I.M.F. Heir Apparent Cites Dialogue and Stability

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The presumptive new leader of the International Monetary Fund gave a general outline of his goals today, promising to listen to criticism from outsiders and to make the fund "a cornerstone for promoting growth and stability."
Horst Kohler, whose way to become the managing director of the monetary fund was cleared when American and Japanese rivals for the post dropped out on Thursday, said he was committed to a dialogue with the United States Congress. Some of its members have been sharply critical of the fund in the past, and with the public in general. 
 "I do think that it's an obligation to explain I.M.F. policy, better maybe than we have in the past," Mr. Kohler said at a get-acquainted news conference at the fund's headquarters here.
The fund was founded in 1946 to promote economic stability around the world, partly through loans to countries in need. From time to time, it has been accused of straying from its original mission and trying ineffectually to bring about profound social changes.
Mr. Kohler's remarks came just 10 days after a study commissioned by Congress recommended that the fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, be trimmed back. The commission further suggested that the fund emphasize short-term, emergency aid to countries as opposed to trying to effect major social changes, like relieving poverty.
Responding to a question, Mr. Kohler said today that he would try to keep the fund focused on "crisis prevention" in individual countries.
On an especially sensitive subject, Russia, Mr. Kohler said he was "open for a constructive dialogue" with Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom he met in December, and was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
The fund has met political resistance in Russia and has repeatedly delayed disbursing its funds there. Moreover, the institution that Mr. Kohler is leaving to head the I.M.F., the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has had a series of bad loans in Russia under Mr. Kohler's watch.
Taking care not to appear over-confident, even though most of the representatives of the fund's 182 member nations have signaled their support for him, Mr. Kohler said he was "honored by this expression of confidence." He said he had had fruitful discussions with Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and with Stanley Fischer, the deputy managing director who was in the running for the directorship.
Mr. Kohler praised Mr. Fischer's "intellectual brilliance and experience" and said he was pleased that Mr. Fischer had said he would stay at the agency. The other man Mr. Kohler beat out was Eisuke Sakakibara, a former Finance Ministry official in Japan.
Alluding to the weeks of controversy in which he emerged as the top contender after the United States rejected Germany's first choice, Caio Koch-Weser, Mr. Kohler said, "I agree that this process was really not the best I could imagine."

NAME: Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Catholic Who Found a Harmony in His Apology to Jews

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
IN the living room of the 19th-century brick house that serves as the residence of Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland stands a studio grand piano, with sheets of Chopin waltzes spread out above the keys.
For a visitor, it is a reminder that the archbishop, the spiritual head of nearly 700,000 Roman Catholics in southern Wisconsin, was recently notified by Columbia University in New York that he would soon receive his doctorate in music, completing a degree he began working on in the 1950's, then halted, only to resume a few years ago. His first music teacher, a nun at a parochial school in Pennsylvania, would no doubt have been proud. 
 But yesterday morning, the talk turns from music to the spoken word -- to two highly unusual homilies, one given by Pope John Paul II last Sunday, the other four months earlier by Archbishop Weakland. Both were apologies for errors committed by Catholics against others.
While the pope's remarks were broad and timed for the first Sunday in Lent, the archbishop was more specific, directing his statements to Jews, in Milwaukee and elsewhere. Speaking in a local synagogue last Nov. 7, Archbishop Weakland said that conversion, the change of attitude that precedes an effort to change one's life and society, must include acknowledgment of wrongdoing, a request for forgiveness and a resolve to reform.
Both the timing of the speech and its "interactive quality," in which the archbishop asked his Catholic listeners to say "amen" as he made his points, marked the occasion as a major event, said Rabbi A. James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee. "That Nov. 7 speech electrified the Jewish community, not only in Milwaukee but throughout the United States," he said.
Although other prelates have since offered apologies (notably Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, and Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles), Archbishop Weakland's homily "was the first of the millennial season, of the run-up to the year 2000," Rabbi Rudin said.
In his homily last November, Archbishop Weakland said that "we Catholics" had acted "contrary to God's law" in dealings with Jews in the past, that the Jewish community was harmed as a result, and that by preaching "that the Jewish people were unfaithful, hypocritical and God-killers," Catholics had reduced Jews' human dignity. And that, he said, "contributed to attitudes that made the Holocaust possible." He called on members of both faiths to work together to heal the world.
In an interview, Archbishop Weakland said: "The idea of apologies for the past is difficult. We have only the sense of personal sin and personal guilt." But he added that he did not think people could move ahead unless they regarded themselves as part of a group and were responsible for its actions. "Otherwise," he said, "the fear remains that history will repeat."
Archbishop Weakland said he did not want to be accusatory. But neither is he finished with this process. He plans apologies to African-Americans and probably to others as well. These must be made on appropriate occasions, he said, lest the intent of the message be lost and the apology be reduced to mere words.
In a larger sense, he said, he sees the major religions as standing at a unique juncture in history, when modern communications have brought them into much closer proximity than ever. "How much must we hold in common in order to live in common?" he asked, adding that what religions contribute positively to society will depend in part on how their members cooperate with one another.
Back in September 1977, when Pope Paul VI appointed him to the archdiocese here, Archbishop Weakland found an interfaith group already established. His homily last November was timed for its 25th anniversary.
"I was talking to a group that knew each other well, that I knew well," he said, responding to a question about why he had felt he could be more specific in his remarks than the pope would be later. "The pope had to be general, because he's talking to the whole church."
Nonetheless, Archbishop Weakland has become known for a certain outspokenness, perhaps more obvious now that the nation's Catholic hierarchy, in its annual meetings, seems far more cautious than it was a decade ago, when the bishops issued major pastoral statements on peace and the economy.
In the interview, the archbishop said he could recall no single instance that persuaded him he needed to preach the apology. But then he recalled a trip he made with parishioners to Poland in 1990. Visiting Krakow, he said, they saw a wall with anti-Semitic graffiti. When he asked a guide why the statements were not painted over, she replied that whoever did it would just put them up again. "I had a feeling that what caused the Holocaust was not completely over," he said.
The archbishop will turn 73 in April. He became a Benedictine monk at 22 and was ordained a priest two years later. He was, for a time in his 30's, a music teacher at a Catholic college.
His roots lie in Pennsylvania coal country, where he was one of six children in a family that received public assistance. "The only possessions the family had," he said, "were an upright piano and 10 volumes of music." He tinkered at the keys, but it was his fourth-grade teacher -- the nun -- who really taught him how to play.
Is there any relationship between playing music and the awareness that one needs to apologize for errors? Well, yes, Archbishop Weakland replied. Music, especially pieces like those that Mozart composed, can be very difficult to get right. "You realize that no human being is perfect," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
As Some Look for More Fireworks, the Dow Takes a Dip

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
If history is any guide, the powerful 499-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday augurs well for investors over the next few months.
Past performance, of course, is no guarantee of future success, as many a mutual fund advertisement notes. But the statistics are unambiguous. 
 Before this week, the Dow, which gained 4.9 percent on Thursday, had rallied at least 4 percent 10 times since the current bull market began in 1982. On eight of those occasions, stocks extended their gains for at least three months after the big one-day move, according to Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch. The gains were substantial, too. Even factoring in the two times the Dow did not continue to rally, the gains over the three months after the market's big day averaged a 7.5 percent gain.
Over a longer period, the positive results are even more pronounced, according to a study by Birinyi Associates. Including Thursday, Birinyi looked at the Dow's 25 best days since 1970, a period that covers both bull and bear markets. The firm found that those best days presaged a gain of more than 14 percent over the following six months.
"What the last move is showing is that investors have not abandoned stocks, " said Robin Griffiths, the chief technical analyst at HSBC Securities. "This is greed rather than fear, and as long as we have greed around, we have a bull market."
The Dow pulled back slightly yesterday, falling 35.37 points, to 10,595.23, a 0.33 percent drop. The Nasdaq composite index rose 80.74 points, or 1.71 percent, to 4,798.13, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 6 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,464.47.
Despite history's pattern of further gains, technical analysts on Wall Street said the rally this week might be an exception to the trend.
These technicians try to divine future moves of stocks from their price histories. To the many investors and economists who believe stocks are impossible to predict that way, technicians are little more than psychics with computers. But most major Wall Street firms keep at least a couple of technical analysts on staff.
Generally, a rally will have staying power, technicians say, if in addition to price movements it has heavy trading volume and breadth, meaning that several stocks rise for each stock that falls. The rally on Thursday seems to fit all three criteria. Almost 1.5 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, a record, and seven stocks rose for every two that dropped.
Rallies like that "have tended to mean that the market will go up for a number of weeks and in many cases a number of months," said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia Securities in North Carolina. But he said he remained "very cautious about this market," in part because the Dow remains below its average of the last 200 days, a trend that technicians view as bearish.
Mr. McCabe said he was also uncertain that Thursday's gains would hold, though for a different reason. He is worried that investors are too bullish. It may seem counterintuitive, but technical analysts say the strongest rallies begin when most investors have turned very negative and selling pressure has reached a climax. Recent surveys show that investors are very complacent, as opposed to negative, about the market, Mr. McCabe said. He fears that stocks will turn down again "sometime in the spring," he said.
Bob Dickey, managing director for technical analysis at Dain Rauscher, said he expected stocks to remain in a tight range over the next several months and finish the year not far from current levels. Slipping a bit of fundamental analysis into his explanation, Mr. Dickey said, "We're in a period of rising interest rates similar to 1994, and so I think this year will be similar to 1994," a year when most stocks ended slightly down.
In fact, "Don't fight the Fed" is one of Wall Street's hoariest maxims, and the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has repeatedly indicated concern about stock price levels.
But though the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times since June in an effort to slow the economy, corporate profits continue to chug along. Analysts expect profits to rise 17.7 percent this year, following a rise of 18 percent last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Long-term interest rates have also dropped substantially since hitting highs in January. Lower interest rates are considered good for stocks, because they reduce the cost of corporate borrowing while making bonds less attractive as an investment alternative.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32 yesterday, to 10314/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: As Taiwan Votes in Close 3-Way Race Today, a Weak Government Is the Likeliest Outcome

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 17

 BODY:
No matter who wins the hotly contested presidential election on Saturday, the outcome will almost certainly be the weakest, most divided government since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island in 1949.
At fervent rallies tonight that brought hundreds of thousands of flag-waving citizens into the capital's streets, the three main candidates made their final appeals in a race that appeared too close to call. 
 Polling has not been allowed in the final 10 days, adding to the suspense of an election that has been fought with all the exuberance of a young democracy facing profound choices.
The contenders are Vice President Lien Chan from the governing Nationalist Party; James Soong, a former Nationalist official who is running as an independent; and Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressives, the main opposition party.
Hanging over the campaign were heavy-handed warnings from Beijing, which considers Taiwan a region separated from the mainland since the civil war of the 1940's and threatened war if the island indefinitely delayed reunification talks.
But a more immediate problem for the Nationalists, who have firmly governed Taiwan through 51 years of dictatorship and then a democracy that they ushered in, is that this election represents a wrenching turning point, transforming the island's politics.
The Nationalist candidate, Mr. Lien, is in serious danger of losing in a three-way, winner-take-all race that has disastrously divided the party's traditional majority. Even if he wins, the prospect is for debilitating internal clashes.
"Everyone is focusing so much on the cross-straits problem," said Steven M. Goldstein, an expert on Taiwan politics at Smith College, in Massachusetts. "But no matter who gets elected, there's going to be a constitutional crisis."
The once impregnable Nationalists have been seriously weakened by charges of corruption and by an internal rift that produced Mr. Soong's breakaway candidacy and improves the chances of victory for Mr. Chen.
However, in an unusual prospect of a divided government here, either Mr. Chen or Mr. Soong, if elected, would have to contend with a Nationalist majority in the legislature, which is not up for re-election.
Even if Vice President Lien gains a plurality, allowing the Nationalists to hold on the presidency, the party will face new challenges to its vast business holdings and freewheeling political deals.
Both Mr. Chen and Mr. Soong have gained from their campaigning against "black gold" in politics, the term here for the business manipulations, alliances with mobsters and vote buying that have plagued Taiwanese politics. Many supporters of Mr. Chen and Mr. Soong are united in disgust at what they call the continued corruption of the Nationalists under the departing president, Lee Teng-hui.
"We have to get rid of the corruption and organized crime and vote buying," said Lu Chiu-chien, 42, a social worker from Keelung City who furiously waved a Chen flag here tonight.
Mr. Soong's credibility was hurt by evidence, released by the Nationalists, that he diverted party money to personal accounts in the past. But supporters like Mary Lu, 45, a homemaker who was out cheering for Mr. Soong, say he has been persecuted by a vindictive Mr. Lee.
Also, although he is stepping down as president, Mr. Lee has said he wants to serve out his remaining one and a half years as chairman of the Nationalist Party, a position that has arguably been more powerful than the presidency.
"Suddenly, the same person will no longer be both president and chairman of the party," said John Hsieh, the Taiwan-born director of the Center for Asian Studies at the University of South Carolina. "A serious confrontation is likely."
But attitudes toward Taiwan's independence remain the fundamental cleavage in the electorate, said Mr. Hsieh, an expert on public opinion here. The campaign has not only brought out festering animosities within the Nationalist Party, but also between those who basically favor independence and the majority, who want to leave well enough alone.
Cheng Yin-fu, 41, a furniture seller who was wildly waving a Chen Shui-bian flag at the stadium tonight, expressed the attitude that China -- and some worried Taiwanese -- dread to hear. "Spiritually and morally I support independence," he said. "But as for the actual action, we can wait for a while."
President Lee has outraged Chinese officials with his insistence on Taiwan's equal status with the mainland, a position that is widely shared here. But in recent days, Beijing has pointedly attacked Mr. Chen, the opposition party challenger, warning that his victory would be dangerous.
Alone among the candidates, Mr. Chen long championed a Taiwanese declaration of independence. But in this campaign, he moderated his position, saying a formal declaration would be unnecessary because Taiwan was effectively sovereign.
Although he has tried to press the anticorruption theme, he has had to spend much of his campaign trying to assure voters that he will not act recklessly and will seek peace.
Given China's deep suspicions, his election would open a period of serious tension, anxiously watched in Washington, because the United States has pledged to help defend Taiwan and would be drawn into a cross-strait war.
With a wide sense that Mr. Chen was gaining ground, Vice President Lien started trying to scare voters with warnings that electing Mr. Chen would court a military attack. Tonight he told cheering supporters that Mr. Chen and his party represented "chaos, disaster, war!"
Holding high Mr. Lien's hand at tonight's rally, President Lee continued this line of attack, shouting that Mr. Chen "is inexperienced, and everything he says will give jitters to everyone!"
But Mr. Chen's generally ardent supporters, including many younger people who yearn for a fresh and cleaner government, as well as an independent Taiwanese identity, have not been deterred.
"Taiwan, stand up!" was a loud chant at the Chen rally tonight, the largest and most frenzied of the three, which spilled far into the streets from a packed football stadium.
Considered by many to be a weak candidate, Mr. Lien, who has an American doctorate in political science and has held several top government posts, has offered little more in his campaign than appeals to experience and stability.
After having been pushed aside by his former mentor, President Lee, Mr. Soong, a onetime Nationalist stalwart, has driven his independent run by attacking the corruption of the party that he had long served and by billing himself as a more competent leader than Mr. Lien.
At the same time, Mr. Soong, who also has an American doctorate in politics, is more willing to discuss the mainland's core principle of "one China." He says he would be best able to negotiate with the mainland. But the independence-leaning supporters of Mr. Chen fear that he would sell out Taiwan's interests.
All three candidates say they will seek to broaden economic ties with the mainland. But whether any of them can meet Beijing's demands for unity talks is unclear, because the vast majority of voters prefer their current status of undeclared independence. And political experts wonder how the island will cope with pressures from Beijing if its government is seriously divided.
At the Hsingtien Buddhist temple here today, hundreds of people attended daily services. Most were older women. "At the beginning of the prayers, everybody here made a wish for peace and stability," said one, Zhang Pai-tsai. She was worried by China's threats and said she would vote for Mr. Lien.
Outside the temple, Lin Tsai-cheng, 32, an electrician, said he was leaning toward Mr. Soong. "It's time for a change, but since Soong comes out of the KMT, it won't be too drastic a change," said Mr. Lin, using the initials for the Nationalists.
Mr. Chen's supporters tend to shrug off the mainland warnings.
"I don't give a damn about the threats from the mainland," Li Jing-huang, 50, a guide for Japanese tourists, said. "I was in the Taiwanese marines in Vietnam and I saw real war. But I don't think they'll attack. China can't afford a war."

HEADLINE: Newark Residents File Suit For the Right to Speak Out

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 17

 BODY:
Democracy has always had its messy side, and here in New Jersey's largest city, where politics is a rough-and-tumble affair, almost everyone agrees that City Council meetings have become more acrid than a drum of battery acid. Protesters have been arrested, Council members have been called Nazis and sessions have often stretched into the wee hours.
In response to the increasing venom -- and to the growing length of the gatherings -- the Council began trying three years ago to limit the open-mike part of the meetings. 
 People who wish to speak at regular meetings are now required to sign up five days in advance, and comments are limited to matters up for a vote. As an alternative to the tumultuous public sessions, the Council has established special "citizens' hearings" in each of the city's five wards, but residents often find themselves addressing only one or two of the Council's nine members.
Saying that their right to free speech is being violated, a group of residents filed suit against the Council today in an effort to bring back the days when the full Council was forced to listen to comments on matters as varied as police misconduct, broken street lamps or a once-beloved Council member gone bad.
"They may not like what we have to say, but the way this country works, they have to hear us out," said Ras Baraka, a teacher and a plaintiff in the lawsuit. "You can't use your power to stop people from speaking their minds."
The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Constitutional Litigation Clinic of Rutgers University School of Law and the Public Interest Law Center of New Jersey.
Although Council members have said that their actions were not meant to stifle free speech, none of them returned calls seeking comment.
Today's suit is just the latest skirmish in a war between the Council and some of the city's most tenacious gadflies. Both sides agree that the strife has grown more intense in recent years as Newark, once mostly concerned with survival, finds itself in the midst of a modest boom.
With a flurry of new development proposals before the Council, including a downtown sports arena that would displace residents and businesses, many people complain that their elected officials are deaf to their concerns, and that there is little airing of dissent. A majority of the nine-member Council, they point out, sides with Mayor Sharpe James.
"Newark is supposedly having a renaissance, but you can't have a rebirth without the participation of the people who live here," said Manuel Lavin, a community organizer whose group stopped the city from building a minor league baseball stadium in the East Ward's biggest park three years ago.
It was during the outpouring of anger over the stadium that the Council moved to restrict the public comment period. To Mr. Lavin, it was clear that many Council members felt threatened by the growing number of residents willing to speak out against their elected officials. Because the hearings were televised on a local cable channel, he said, people from other wards were drawn to the sessions and began freely venting their frustrations.
"Since the riots, we've all been divided up in separate wards, and for the first time we're starting to come together," Mr. Lavin said. "That really scares the Council."
Opponents say that by ending the anything-goes public sessions and replacing them with periodic "citizens' hearings" in the city's five wards, the Council is trying to isolate popular discontent by funneling it into far-flung meetings that are poorly attended and never televised.
Last year, a group of residents collected 3,600 signatures in an effort to force a referendum on whether the public should be allowed to speak on any matter of their choosing during Council meetings. Although the number of signatures qualified the issue for next November's ballot, the Council instead adopted a new meeting ordinance that they said would accomplish the same goal. In addition to requiring at least five Council members at each citizens' hearing, the ordinance established a public session two hours before each regular Council meeting.
The city clerk, Robert Marasco, said the Council had the right to decide if an issue was worthy of a referendum, which can cost up to $500,000. The Council has addressed criticisms, he said, by increasing the opportunities for public participation. But the residents' lawsuit insists that the referendum take place.
Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the A.C.L.U. in New Jersey, called the ordinance "a watered-down version" of the ballot measure and said it was a clear effort to subvert state law on referendums. She pointed out that Council members were not required to attend the newly established sessions. As for the citizens' hearings, she said, if fewer than five Council members show up, the meeting is simply canceled.
Renee Steinhagen, executive director of the Public Interest Law Center of New Jersey, said she knew of no other municipality in the state that had tried to limit public comment during regular meetings. Rejecting a ballot initiative, she said, was especially egregious.
"It's obvious that they want to make decisions without being bothered by criticism," she said. "Not only is it patronizing, but it's outrageous."

Rover Workers Fear for their Jobs
Many of the 9,000 employees at the Rover manufacturing plant in Longbridge, England, fear that they will lose their jobs now that BMW has sold the plant. The reverberations extended also to the 50,000 people who depend on the auto industry for their livelihood in the region, which was once the heart of the British auto industry. BMW's move also drew criticism from the British government. C2.
 
Bank One to Eliminate 5,100 Jobs
Bank One said that it would eliminate 5,100 jobs, or about 5.6 percent of its work force, to lower costs as the bank struggles to raise earnings and its share price.

U.S. Eases Iran Sanctions In Overture to Moderates
Secretary of State Madeleine K.

Gun Maker's Concessions Avert 15 Cities' Lawsuits
Smith & Wesson, the nation's oldest and largest manufacturer of handguns, agreed to accept a wide array of restrictions on the way it makes, sells and distributes handguns each year in exchange for ending lawsuits by 15 cities that had threatened to bankrupt it. But 15 other cities and counties that had filed similar suits had not signed on by the end of the day.

HEADLINE: In Clinton, India Sees a Bridegroom

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 17

 BODY:
Like a family preparing for a sumptuous wedding that will unite two great ancestral lines, India has been dressing itself up for its first visit from an American president in more than two decades -- a visit in which the world's largest democracy and its most powerful one will again try to build an alliance that has eluded them for a half-century.
With President Clinton touching down here on Sunday evening, workers were out in force today. There were battalions of malis -- or gardeners -- planting frowsy-headed yellow dahlias along the route he will drive. Sweepers with spiky brooms were ridding lawns of leaves and teams of men were pushing wheelbarrows of steaming tar to spread in potholes. 
 Indians believe that it is auspicious to paint their homes and repair what is broken before the occasion of a marriage. And if the relationship between India and the United States is to progress, a great deal of good fortune will be required.
President Clinton -- cast as an Indian bridegroom on the cover of a newsmagazine here in a full-length golden jacket and curly-toed slippers -- recently decided to make the trip despite the failure of intensive American efforts to persuade India to sign the nuclear test ban treaty or to cap its nuclear arsenal.
But with his tenure as president running out, President Clinton's timing, again, has not proved lucky; relations between India and its longtime rival and neighbor, Pakistan, have continued to deteriorate.
His decision to pay a brief visit to America's old ally, Pakistan -- despite the explicit opposition of the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and Mr. Vajpayee's request that the Americans instead put Pakistan on a list of terrorist states -- has tempered any euphoria here about Mr. Clinton's far longer five-day visit to India.
American diplomats, businessmen and policy analysts have been trying to convince India, the subcontinent's economic power, that the president's visit is fundamentally about building a broader, deeper relationship -- one that will encompass cooperative efforts in trade, science and technology, the environment and health, among others.
And the Indians, who do not like being treated as though their country is no more important than far smaller Pakistan, seem encouraged by a speech Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright gave last week and its not-so-veiled criticisms of Pakistan.
While declaring India's decision to conduct nuclear tests "a historic mistake," she also said that Pakistan should take steps to "address the effects of terror on Pakistan's neighbors, notably India." The United States has asked Pakistan to ban a Pakistan-based Islamic fundamentalist group the Americans have categorized as terrorist -- and whose members are waging a holy war against India in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
Politicians in India applauded the remarks meant for Pakistan in which Dr. Albright also said the so-called Line of Control that divides Kashmir must be respected. Pakistan is held responsible for organizing an incursion into Indian territory last summer that led to a vicious confrontation between the two nuclear-armed nations.
The Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, referred with satisfaction on Thursday to Dr. Albright's "reaffirmation of the validity of the Line of Control."
Frank Wisner, who was the American ambassador to India from 1994 to 1997, said Dr. Albright's speech was an indication of America's willingness to talk straight with the Pakistanis.
"Having watched us be careful and nuanced over the years, that was not careful and nuanced; that was blunt," he said. "If this speech does not make clear the explicit difference in the American view of India and Pakistan, I don't know what else you need. A four-and-a-half day visit to India and a four-and-a-half hour visit to Pakistan?"
The estrangement between India and the United States -- two great, multicultural democracies that would seem to have so much in common -- stretches back to the 1950's and the height of the cold war. India, the proud new nation finally freed of colonial domination, chose the path of nonalignment, while Pakistan, its smaller, insecure neighbor, sought to ally with the United States.
Through the years, the Americans grew cozy with Pakistan's military dictators, funneling billions of dollars in military aid that sometimes wound up turned against India. By the early 1970's, India had drawn closer to the Soviet Union. When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, India refused to condemn the aggression, while Pakistan was a key player in American support for the Islamic mujahedeen battling the Soviet Army.
With the crumbling of the Soviet Union and India's decision in 1991 to begin loosening barriers to trade and investment, the conditions that had kept socialist India and capitalist America apart were profoundly changed.
Still, old habits of mistrust die hard. India, craving recognition as a global power, often finds what it sees as American arrogance hard to take. In the eyes of many Indians, the American opposition to the nuclear tests seemed the height of hypocrisy, coming from a nation that still has thousands of nuclear warheads.
The former Indian foreign secretary, J. N. Dixit, has described the Indo-American relationship with the Hindi word panga, which roughly translates as prickly, petulant, confrontational.
Mr. K. Subrahmanyam, who recently headed a committee that looked into army intelligence failures for the Indian government, offered a perfect illustration of panga in his contentious reaction to President Clinton's tour of India.
"This visit is purely symbolic of the fact that two years after the nuclear tests, India has done nothing to comply with the stentorian demands of the nuclear hegemonists and still the U.S. president is coming to visit," Mr. Subrahmanyam declared in his own stentorian tones. "In spite of all the rhetoric, the United States accepts reality."
A stream of Americans from Washington institutions have come through Delhi in recent weeks and many of them have been advising the president to brave the thorny task of talking with the Indians for the sake of the rose -- better relations with a country that is the second most populous in the world, with an economy growing at a rate that has averaged more than 6 percent since 1991.
Few expect any developments of earth-shaking importance from the visit. India has already declared that the test ban treaty and its relations with Pakistan are not open for negotiation. Still, given the history, the symbolism of the visit itself may have content.
Like the rituals of a wedding, the ceremonies of a state visit could lay the foundations for a new understanding -- at least that is what diplomats on both sides hope.
Lloyd I. Rudolph, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said that after more than 20 years of neglect -- the last presidential visit was by Jimmy Carter in 1978 -- the Americans need to come to pay their respects. "You sometimes have to have a cup of tea before people will trust you," he said.

HEADLINE: Ambition Turns to Crisis Control as Clinton Visits the Subcontinent

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
When President Clinton first contemplated visiting India three years ago he was eager to open a relationship with the vastly populated, democratic country that had remained outside the Western fold during the cold war. He was also gripped with the ambition, his aides said, to display the fabric of modern India to the rest of the world.
But the fall of two Indian governments and the nuclear tests of May 1998 conspired against Mr. Clinton's timetable. 
 Now the president is embarking on a five-day, five-city journey to India and a five-hour stop in Pakistan at a time when tensions on the subcontinent are high. A confrontation between the two countries over Kashmir, where their fighters clash on 15,000-foot mountain tops, is seen as the most likely dispute on earth to spark a nuclear clash. In fact, the president hopes that with this trip he can somehow defuse the situation in Kashmir. But he and his aides are pessimistic about the chances for actual progress.
Mr. Clinton will also become the first American president to visit Bangladesh, where he plans to make a day trip. Bangladesh, a democratic Muslim country, is striving to emerge from deep poverty.
It may be an overwhelming task for Mr. Clinton to balance his desire to support the India of trade and technology with his hope of calming the treacherous rivalry between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers. Complicating the situation considerably is the military government that came to power in Pakistan last October. Mr. Clinton is eager not to endorse that government's hold on power, but he does want to talk with it.
Mr. Clinton is making India the 62d foreign country he has visited, a position down the list that some Indians have noted unhappily, and he arrives almost as a lame-duck president, with little opportunity to capitalize afterward on diplomatic gains.
Overall, some of his aides, as well as experts on the subcontinent, fear that the original intention of displaying India as the economic and strategic power of the region will be undermined by the increasingly strong-willed attitudes of the Indian government toward nuclear weapons, Pakistan and Kashmir.
Mr. Clinton will face an Indian government whose nuclear doctrine calls for the development of a "large strategic Indian capability sometime in the future," said Stephen Cohen of the Brookings Institution, who was one of a group of experts on South Asia who met with the president at the White House on Thursday evening to help him prepare for the trip.
Mr. Cohen added that there were prominent voices in New Delhi calling for further tests because India did not produce a thermonuclear explosion in May 1998. The government of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was prepared, he said, to pay the price of Washington's sanctions in order to keep its nuclear arsenal.
After India's nuclear tests, which were followed by tests by Pakistan, the administration initiated a round of talks aimed at persuading India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the talks extended to 12 rounds with the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, but, so far, to no avail.
In a speech previewing Mr. Clinton's trip, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright cautioned that the lack of progress at a time when Russia and the United States were moving toward deeper cuts in their arsenals was a major stumbling block to a fuller relationship with Washington.
"We must accept that significant progress in this area is necessary, before India and the United States can realize fully the vast potential of our relationship," Dr. Albright told the Asia Society here on Tuesday. "We have not yet found a way to create sufficient common ground on these issues."
At a discussion at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace this week, Gary Samore, a member of the National Security Council staff who specializes in nonproliferation, said that in his 15 years working on India and Pakistan, "I don't think the situation has ever looked any worse."
The prospects were bleak, Mr. Samore said, because neither India nor Pakistan really understood the instability provoked by strategic threat of their nuclear weapons and "to make matters worse, both sides are spoiling for a fight" in Kashmir. Another conflict over the territory -- Pakistan and India have already fought three wars there -- carries the "potential spark for a nuclear confrontation," Mr. Samore said.
When Mr. Clinton met with the group of experts from the region at the White House on Thursday evening, he seemed intensely interested in how he could defuse the situation but also worried about the limited prospects for success, several participants said. The group included two former ambassadors to India, Frank Wisner and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now the senior Democratic senator from New York.
Aside from overcoming the enormous enmity between the two countries, Mr. Clinton must face the fact that India has insisted that it will not accept mediation.
And although Pakistan has said it will accept mediation, Mr. Clinton's clout in influencing the behavior of the new military leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, appears limited, his aides say.
In a briefing on Thursday to reporters who will accompany Mr. Clinton, his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said: "The president is not going to South Asia to mediate the dispute between them. But he will urge them to exercise restraint and resume dialogue."
One fundamental request that Mr. Clinton is likely to put to General Musharraf is for a halt to the Pakistani incursions over the so-called Line of Control, the cease-fire line in Kashmir that divides the territory. The Indian leadership has said there can be no discussion over Kashmir until the Pakistanis take "concrete steps" to withdraw. Last July, Mr. Clinton successfully persuaded the last civilian leader of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, to take such steps. But three months later Mr. Sharif was overthrown by the general. Given this history, administration officials said they were skeptical that General Musharraf would do what Mr. Sharif promised.
Nonetheless, Dr. Albright said in her speech that as a start Pakistan must pledge to make no further incursions into the Indian-held part of Kashmir.
"Nations must not attempt to change borders or zones of occupation through armed force," she said, adding that "tangible steps" should be taken to respect the Line of Control.

HEADLINE: U.S. ENDING A FEW OF THE SANCTIONS IMPOSED ON IRAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ended a few of America's economic sanctions against Iran today, and declared a commitment to take extensive steps toward ending two decades of hostility "if Iran indicates a desire and commitment to do so."
Her comments describing a map for normalizing economic ties came in a speech today that Clinton administration officials described as their most explicit overture to the moderates who triumphed in Iran's parliamentary elections last month. 
 Without specifying them, Dr. Albright held out the prospect of ending such sanctions as the bans on American investment in Iran's oil industry and the blocking of large loans to Tehran by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
But she made no mention of a resumption of full diplomatic relations.
In Tehran, the Iranian government issued a muted but moderately positive response.
Dr. Albright also acknowledged -- without apologizing -- a variety of American errors in past dealings with Iran, including Washington's support of the 1953 coup that restored Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to power, and of Iraq during its war with Iran in the 1980's.
Nonetheless, Dr. Albright made clear that forces in Iran that she said support terrorism and try to obtain nuclear weapons technology would have to loosen their hold on the security apparatus before there would be a deeper removal of sanctions.
The sanctions ended today are chiefly symbolic, and aimed at small businesses. The United States will end restrictions on Iranian-made carpets -- a law that was widely flouted anyway -- and reduce prohibitive tariffs on pistachios and caviar. Those areas were chosen, Dr. Albright said, "to show the millions of Iranian craftsmen, farmers and fishermen who work in these industries, and the Iranian people as a whole, that the United States bears them no ill will."
But she acknowledged that it would take more than pistachio diplomacy to remove what President Mohammad Khatami -- whose moderation she praised at some length -- calls the "wall of mistrust."
"To date the political developments in Iran have not caused its military to cease its determined effort to acquire the technology, materials and assistance needed to develop nuclear weapons," she said. Nor have the intelligence services chosen "to get out of the terrorism business," she said.
"Until these policies change," she continued, "fully normal ties between our governments will not be possible and our principal sanctions will remain."
Under American law, for instance, Washington cannot support loans for Iran through the I.M.F. or the World Bank until Iran is removed from the State Department's list of nations that support terrorism.
Dr. Albright's speech received mixed reviews in Congress, just as small overtures toward Cuba and North Korea have in recent months. Senator Connie Mack of Florida, a Republican, called the administration's move "unprincipled" and said "American victims of terrorism deserve justice, not pistachios and caviar."
But Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican who represents the farm state of Kansas, said, "A failed U.S. sanctions policy has forced Iran to purchase a substantial amount of commodities from our competitors." He urged a far greater removal of sanctions.
The State Department took some unusual steps to amplify its message in Iran. It faxed advance copies of Dr. Albright's speech to the pro-reform newspapers that have blossomed in Tehran, to enable them to print the text in their Saturday issues.
The Iranian government was also briefed in advance, and afterward the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, said, "We welcome the ability to export Iranian foodstuff and carpets and see it as positive," according to a report from the country's official news agency, IRNA.
Here in Washington, however, Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, Iran's representative to the United Nations, said that while his country would find a way to reciprocate for Dr. Albright's gesture, "these steps, as important as they may be, are insufficient" to bring about official talks between the two nations.
The administration has periodically made modest moves to reach out to moderates in Iran, but President Khatami has been locked in a struggle with conservatives who appear to control the security apparatus, and the gestures have not borne fruit.
Dr. Albright's effort to convey a new openness to Iran, without offering many concrete concessions, came after what senior officials said was a long debate in the State Department and the National Security Council.
"Everyone recognized that there had been a massive change in the internal dynamics in Iran," one official said, "but good as the changes have been internally, they have not affected those with the levers of power on the issues of greatest importance to us -- terrorism and weapons of mass destruction."
Another element of that debate, officials said, centered on how Dr. Albright should word her description of America's troubled encounters with Iran throughout the cold war. She chose, in the end, to acknowledge the facts and hint at American wrongdoing or errors of judgment, but to neither apologize nor explain.
"In 1953 the United States played a significant role in orchestrating the overthrow of Iran's popular prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh," she told the audience, touching briefly and lightly on what almost everyone in her audience of Iranian-Americans knew as Operation Ajax, the Central Intelligence Agency's first major success in overthrowing a foreign government.
"The Eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons," she continued. "But the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's political development. And it is easy to see now why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal affairs."
Before the overthrow, the Mossadegh government had acted to legalize the Iranian Communist Party, and had also nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
The decision to go ahead with the coup was made by Allen Dulles, the first head of the postwar C.I.A., and his brother, John Foster Dulles, the secretary of state at the time. And it was executed chiefly by Kermit Roosevelt, a grandson of Theodore Roosevelt.
While today's reference to those events fell far short of an apology, it appears to be the closest to one any senior American official has publicly offered.
Dr. Albright also briefly acknowledged that the shah, installed after the coup, "brutally repressed political dissent." And she added, with a reference to the president of Iraq, that "aspects of U.S. policy toward Iraq during its conflict with Iran appear now to have been regrettably shortsighted, especially in light of our subsequent experiences with Saddam Hussein."
Among those in the audience today was Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser under President Reagan, who made a secret trip to Iran in 1986 bearing a key-shaped cake and a Bible in a failed effort to get Iran to use its influence to win the release of hostages held in Lebanon by Iranian-backed Shiites.
"It's better late than never," Mr. McFarlane said of today's initiative. "This is not an administration known for risk-taking." He said he assumed that Iran must have made "some private assurances" to the United States about cutting off support for terrorist groups.
Among the issues left deliberately vague in the speech was how to handle financial disputes between the countries that date back to the taking of American hostages in Tehran in 1979. At the time, Iranian assets in the United States were frozen.
Since then, a tribunal set up at The Hague has resolved a number of disputes. But others remain, including for instance, the issue of reimbursing Iran for American military equipment that was never delivered, and the disposition of diplomatic properties in the United States. Iran puts the value of what it terms "frozen assets" -- the United States does not use that phrase -- at upwards of $10 billion, while Washington says the figure is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Resolving those disputes would have far less economic impact on Iran than a lifting of the sanctions on oil and development aid.
Washington's Caspian Sea oil policy has been directed at preventing any pipeline from traveling through Iranian territory.
The prohibition on American investment and technology in Iran's oil industry has meant European countries have a competitive edge.

Sticking It to the Taxpayer

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS; Murray Chass reports on sports for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THIS is the golden age of new stadiums and arenas. They are sprouting all over the country. Public money pays for most of them. Team owners stand in line, hat in hand, waiting for their turn, their rightful dole.
Taxpayers are growing increasingly disenchanted with this public subsidization for the benefit of private businessmen. In New Jersey, one owner wanted to buck the trend. He wanted to build an arena completely with private funds. 
 But he needed non-economic cooperation from the governor of the state, and she rejected the idea. So instead of erecting his arena in Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York, John McMullen is selling the Devils, his National Hockey League franchise. A entity affiliated with the YankeesNets, Puck Holdings, will pay Mr. McMullen about $175 million, but never had a man been so reluctant to accept twice as much as his team should go for.
"I'm sick about it," Mr. McMullen said recently.
In partnership with Cablevision of New York, Charles Dolan's sports and cable conglomerate, Mr. McMullen was going to build the arena as the centerpiece of a sports, dining and entertainment project that one Hoboken official said would complement the expansion the city is doing on its waterfront. The arena would have been constructed over the train shed at the Hoboken railroad terminal, just as Madison Square Garden was erected over Penn Station in Manhattan.
But the project required the state to grant air rights over the shed, and Governor Whitman has refused Mr. McMullen's request.
"Before the last election," Mr. McMullen said in a recent interview, "the governor said she'd let me go to Hoboken."
But the proposal became embroiled with the Nets' desire to build an arena in Newark, and Governor Whitman opted to support that project.
"If an arena can have two teams play in it, and the Hoboken arena as proposed by John McMullen could have two teams playing in it, we'd do everything we can to grant those air rights," said Pete McDonough the governor's spokesman. "But first off he has to bring us a plan that shows here's where two teams are going to play."
Mr. McMullen counters that since he and Cablevision would have built the arena privately, the need for two teams was not a concern. Two teams might be needed for an arena like the one the Devils and the Nets play in now at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, but not for the Hoboken arena. According to Mr. McMullen, James Dolan of Cablevision has said it could fill the Hoboken arena for more than 200 nights a year.
"They have excess programming for the Garden and Radio City," Mr. McMullen said.
Mr. McDonough disputed Mr. McMullen's position that the arena would have cost the state nothing. He quoted Rick Mroz, the governor's counsel, as saying the project would require roadway funds totaling from $200 million to $300 million in state and federal money. But Mr. McMullen and Robert Drasheff, director of Hoboken's waterfront development, disputed that claim.
They say that Mr. Mroz is referring to the Bergen Arches, an abandoned railroad right of way that would be converted into a highway running from the Jersey City traffic circle to the area in Jersey City known as Newport City. Three years ago, at Mr. McMullen's urging, senators and representatives from New Jersey got $105 million for the right of way included in the federal transportation bill.
"I knew about Bergen Arches because I drove to New York every day," Mr. McMullen said. "The main purpose of the arches is to separate local traffic from New York traffic headed for the Holland Tunnel. I did it as a civic gesture. Would the arena benefit? Slightly. But we wouldn't need it. I've told them I don't need the Bergen Arches, don't charge me with it, but they keep bringing it up."
Those opposed to the arena also raised concerns about parking in an already congested area, but Mr. McMullen and Mr. Drasheff said that a shipping slip on the waterfront could be filled in and, according to Mr. Drasheff, accomodate 20,000 cars.
In his initial plans, Mr. McMullen proposed that the state pay for the $30 million platform on which the arena would be built. "But when they raised so much objection to it," he said, "I said we'd pay for it."
Mr. McMullen sent Governor Whitman a three-page proposal last September in which he said he was not seeking any state investment in the arena. He included a letter from the Chase Bank saying it was prepared to finance the arena for Mr. McMullen and Cablevision.
Still, Mr. McDonough contends that history shows that the only arenas that work financially are ones that have two teams. Mr. McMullen and Mr. Drasheff counter that the state is too narrowly focusing on the arena and missing the larger picture.
"Hoboken has slowly converted itself into a residential town," Mr. Drasheff said, "so our only industry now is dining and entertainment. We see the arena as the next logical step in that dining and entertainment service business. It brings in a lot of jobs, and it brings in the prestige of a world-class team, a first-class operation and it takes an abandoned space that's been neglected for 40 to 50 years and finally turns it into a profit-making venture for individuals, the state and the city."

YELTSIN
 A Revolutionary Life.
 By Leon Aron.
 Illustrated. 934 pp. New York:
 St. Martin's Press. $35. 
 Has any major figure of our time been so variously caricatured as Boris Yeltsin? In Russia he has been, depending on the moment and the author, a populist spoiler, a hero of democracy, a drunken clown, a traitor to the motherland, a nationalist thug, the slayer of Communism, a stooge of corrupt oligarchs.
Outside Russia, the conventional wisdom has tended to be unfriendly. When Yeltsin emerged in the mid-1980's as the Communist Party boss of Moscow, a rambunctious, crowd-pleasing reformer, Western officials viewed him as an uninvited guest at the Gorbachev honeymoon. "What a flake!" Secretary of State James A. Baker III was said to have remarked after meeting Yeltsin. "He sure makes Gorbachev look good by comparison." To scholars on the left, he was an irksome distraction from the attempt to humanize socialism; to scholars on the right, his origins as a Communist functionary in the hinterlands made him deeply suspect -- a typical provincial apparatchik," was the dismissive judgment of Dmitri K. Simes. He enjoyed a rush of adulation after his iconic photo op in 1991, defying a hard-line putsch from the top of a tank, and he won an infusion of loans with his attempts to create capitalism by decree. But over the past half decade, the Yeltsin persona degenerated steadily. He was the frustrated, fickle and ineffectual prisoner of his own cockeyed democracy, the butcher of Chechnya and finally a walking corpse. When he suddenly resigned at the turn of the new century, after eight and a half years as Russia's first popularly elected president, the send-offs were, at their most generous, equivocal.
In his ambitious and perfectly timed new biography, "Yeltsin: A Revolutionary Life," Leon Aron sets out to reclaim Yeltsin from the cartoonists and establish his importance as the instrument of a profound transformation of Russia. It is a complex and nuanced political portrait, not adoring but unabashedly admiring.
Aron, who emigrated from Russia as a young man in 1973 and now resides at the American Enterprise Institute, cannot always contain his disdain for those who have underrated Yeltsin's performance. These include not only Yeltsin's reactionary adversaries in Russia -- here portrayed in all their vileness -- but the condescending intelligentsia in Russia and abroad, the Western governments infatuated with Gorbachev and a segment of the Western press. Aron's book is therefore likely to provoke some defensiveness from the sort of people who are normally invited to review books about Russia.
One can only hope any fireworks will draw readers to see for themselves, because the book is a godsend. Such a fine, full-blooded political portrait of Yeltsin would, by itself, be important -- for even in the best eyewitness surveys of the Soviet unraveling, Yeltsin is an unfinished character. But the more exciting distinction of Aron's book is the context. He understands in his bones the weird operational milieu of Soviet Communism. He understands how it got that way, how it functioned during the few decades when it functioned, how and why it failed and how on its deathbed it produced such anomalous Communists as Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. He understands that the end of the Soviet empire was not primarily the work of a romantic popular uprising (although, unlike some scholars, he gives the Russian public its due), nor was it especially a triumph of cold-war containment; it was the result of the inevitable collapse of an exhausted economy propped up by a cynical ideology. Aron understands all this well enough to make it coherent and accessible. Consequently, this book is not just a welcome resurrection of Boris Yeltsin, it is also a superb account of the end of the Soviet experiment.
Aron begins with Yeltsin's political germination 1,000 miles east of Moscow in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). Yeltsin, a combative farm boy who studied construction engineering and worked his way up the ladder as the region's development chief, perfected his driven, ardently populist political style long before his name reached Moscow. Out of school, offered the usual postgraduate assignment as a construction foreman, he insisted on first spending a year as a bricklayer, concrete maker, truck driver, carpenter, joiner, glass cutter, plasterer, house painter and crane operator, often pulling two shifts a day. In Sverdlovsk -- and later in Moscow, where he rode the subways and popped up incognito in the shops -- Yeltsin's insistence on seeing for himself schooled his eye for the failings of the system and bought him enormous street credibility.
He was a gifted showman. When he was a construction boss, his favorite stunt was to gather a huge team and throw up a complete five-story apartment building in five days. Such feats of razzle-dazzle won him a measure of official license, which he spent on more meaningful reforms. A favorite, which foreshadowed Gorbachev by years, was an attack on the stifling egalitarian work ethic, using entrepreneurial brigades that were rewarded for performance, not for just showing up. He became adept at initiating experiments that played to the current Moscow fashion, and then pushing them to the brink of heresy.
Adept as he was at the inside game, Yeltsin was the first political figure of national stature to really grasp the politics of public performance. Aron uses the French term bain de foule, bathing in the crowd, to describe Yeltsin's passion for full-immersion town meetings. These open-ended and often shockingly candid evenings of political cabaret added to the Yeltsin legend and forged his connection with an adoring public. By the last years of Leonid Brezhnev, Yeltsin was regaling audiences with megadoses of inconvenient truth -- even, in the cold-war year of 1981, admiring the United States for the tonic of "capitalist competition." Some "typical provincial apparatchik."
In these early chapters, Aron draws heavily from Yeltsin's enjoyable but self-mythologizing autobiography. He has tested Yeltsin's own hindsight at key points by interviewing Yeltsin's contemporaries and scouring local archives, but at times the portrait feels a little rosy.
Yeltsin's reputation reached Gorbachev, who summoned him to Moscow in 1985 as that city's party boss. For the next seven years the political pas de deux of these men became the defining choreography of Russia. At first, Yeltsin's flamboyant testing of the limits made Gorbachev look comparatively safe to the anxious old guard. Yeltsin excoriated the pampered elites (including spoiled intellectuals, who never forgave him). He lashed out at the hard-liners in Gorbachev's Politburo. Gorbachev chided him, then humiliated and demoted him, but never silenced him. Yeltsin was a useful foil.
But as glasnost evolved into fierce iconoclasm, as liberalism fed the hunger for real liberation, as failed economic tinkering led to calls for free markets, Yeltsin was always a long jump ahead. Soon he was denouncing the Communist Party itself, advocating genuinely free elections and private property. Having been down in the engine room while Gorbachev was aloft at the helm, Yeltsin was far quicker to recognize that half measures were failing. Then Gorbachev became his foil.
The book dawdles sometimes in recounting Yeltsin's evolution. Like most biographies these days, this one feels at least 100 pages longer than it needs to be, and at times, although his narrative skill is formidable, Aron seems to be recounting the machinations of plenums and elections and congresses in real time. So skim a few chapters.
Perhaps the most interesting thing about Yeltsin has always been his remarkable agility, his capacity to absorb new information, rub it against his assumptions and change. Unlike Gorbachev, who never really outgrew his faith in benign Leninism, Yeltsin was a lifelong work in progress, much like Russia itself. One of the most engaging chapters accompanies Yeltsin on his 1989 trip to America. You may remember this visit for the cold shoulder presented by the ever-equivocating Bush White House, or for the widely published gossip (methodically debunked by Aron) of Yeltsin drinking sprees. But for Yeltsin, whose ravenous curiosity led him to interview everyone he met and see everything he could see, the trip seems to have been the kind of genuine epiphany other Soviet visitors, including Gorbachev, were incapable of experiencing. The prosperity, the rule of law, the freedom and efficiency he witnessed in America catalyzed his notions about the fraud of Communism.
America confirmed for Yeltsin what he was lurching toward. Getting there, however, proved a crushingly difficult undertaking. The relentless opposition of the tenacious Communists and their neofascist outriders, the squabbling among reformists and Yeltsin's own strategic blunders turned the economic transformation of Russia into a slog and demoralized his miserable public. As the enemies he could see and outwit gave way to dangers "less amenable to a frontal political assault: inflation, depression, poverty, cynicism," Aron writes, Yeltsin succumbed to drink, depression and insomnia. He would rouse himself for one last electoral victory in the summer of 1996, and then devote his waning years to concocting a successor regime he hoped could keep the Communist revanchists at bay. The book went to press before Yeltsin surrendered his office to his prime minister, Vladimir Putin, an enigmatic former KGB agent who, for better or worse, represents Yeltsin's last great gamble.
A biographer who regards Yeltsin as a friend of democracy must contend with the man's authoritarian side. Yeltsin's 1993 battle with an openly seditious Russian legislature, which ended with army tanks bombarding the Parliament building, is rather easily defended. Unpretty as that episode may have been, when the story is fully told there is little question that had the leaders of the parliamentary insurrection and their armed paramilitary prevailed, Russia today would resemble the miserable police state of neighboring Belarus.
A more egregious case was Yeltsin's acquiescence in the catastrophic war against the breakaway province of Chechnya. The second round of that war continues today under Yeltsin's anointed successor. Aron makes no apology for the stupidity and cruelty with which that assault was carried out, although he points out that Yeltsin's resolve to protect the integrity of his country was itself well within the bounds of international law. The unpopular war, Aron says, ended the Russian people's romance with Yeltsin; only by negotiating a hasty withdrawal did he narrowly avert an electoral defeat. Thereafter "Yeltsin looked more and more like a black hole: a giant star exerting enormous gravitational pull on everything around it, but coming to the end of its life, depleted of fuel and incapable of projecting light."
At the same time, Aron argues, Yeltsin passed up at least two opportunities -- in 1991 and in 1993 -- to assume dictatorial powers by popular acclamation. Unlike Gorbachev, Yeltsin turned again and again to the public for his mandates. And he did not merely stockpile political capital; he spent it on noble intentions, the jump-starting of a capitalist economy, and it is only partly his fault that he was not more successful. "A revolution that fails to live up to the fullness of its promise," Aron writes, "is not a revolution that has not happened."
Thanks in large part to Yeltsin, we have a Russia freer, less belligerent, more accommodating of its citizens and its neighbors. A huge if corrupted transfer of wealth into private hands "broke the back of the Russian patrimonial state" and allowed the beginnings of a middle class. We have a Russia in which power derives from the consent of the governed.
Aron concludes that if -- a critical if -- Russia remains on this course, Yeltsin's ultimate place in history will be analogous to that of two other "authoritarian democrats" who broke laws and spilled blood in the course of saving their nations: Abraham Lincoln and Charles de Gaulle. On the strength of this book, that provisional judgment holds up much better than the dismissive stereotypes that went before it.

Something
 in the Soil
 Legacies and Reckonings
 in the New West.
 By Patricia Nelson Limerick.
 384 pp. New York:
 W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95. 
 Usually, folks outside of the ivory tower don't pay very much attention to academic infighting. But starting in the late 1980's, media outlets not known for their interest in scholarship scrambled to gather copy about the New Western History and its head honchos: Patricia Nelson Limerick, Richard White, William Cronon and Donald Worster.
Limerick's 1987 "Legacy of Conquest" is one of the movement's manifestoes. Breaking with Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, which had dominated the study of the American West since the 1890's, she portrayed the West not as empty land waiting to be civilized and Christianized by strapping, independent pioneers, but as a region dependent on federal dollars, where Bostonians and New Yorkers clashed with American Indians and Asian immigrants, unchecked business development devastated the environment and boom-and-bust cycles of mining and oil drilling shook up the economy. Hence the brouhaha. As a columnist in The Arizona Republic put it in 1989: "Why can't the revisionists simply leave our myths alone? Westerners -- and most other Americans, for that matter -- are content with our storied past, even if it tends to fib a bit."
In "Something in the Soil," a collection of speeches and previously published essays, Limerick continues to erode the fibs, describing the ecological consequences of the Gold Rush; investigating the 1872-73 Modoc War; knocking John Sutter, the "Father of California," off his pedestal; and doing her best to turn Juan Bautista de Anza, a little-known colonial governor of New Mexico, into a "household name."
Throughout, Limerick demonstrates her trademark concern for the real world. Green-friendly readers will appreciate "Mission to the Environmentalists" and its argument that history can help environmentalists, a fractious and fissiparous bunch, understand themselves, one another and their differences of opinion and behavior. If Limerick's insistent reminders that she has made it as a public intellectual grow tiresome, her point is well taken: a history lesson won't solve all of the West's problems, but contemporary Westerners would do well to draw "perspective . . . from the longer haul of time."
What distinguishes Limerick from other prominent Western historians is her inimitable prose. Limerick boldly breaks all the rules of academic writing. She writes about her own childhood, right down to the church she attended; she tells jokes; she uses game-show expressions in titles ("Will the Real Californian Please Stand Up?"); and she treats readers to irreverent paragraphs like:
"With a little rewriting -+essentially, changing 'Give me your tired, your poor,' to 'Give me your tired, your tasteless, your rich' -- Miss Lazarus's words could appear on the letterhead of any number of Colorado home builder and land development companies. Heaven knows, the shore of California is 'teeming'; and 'tempest-tossed' could be easily changed, with an economy of syllables, to 'earthquake-tossed.' 'Wretched refuse,' of course, has never been the most flattering of characterizations, but it does give Californians some advance warning of the opinion in which they are held by quite a number of Coloradans."
But the last three chapters -- A How-To Guide for the Academic Going Public," "Dancing With Professors: The Trouble With Academic Prose" and "Limerick's Rules of Verbal Etiquette" -+resemble a stylebook. She urges readers to avoid the passive voice, to write in complete sentences and to make sure every paragraph has a topic sentence. Reading Limerick's writing on the West is far more satisfying than reading Limerick's writing on writing. Treasure "Something in the Soil" but don't throw out your copy of "Fowler's Modern English Usage."

HEADLINE: Genetic Codes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his review of Matt Ridley's "Genome" (Feb. 27), Lee M. Silver, embracing an assertion of the author's, writes that "eugenics laws were examples not of unrestrained science but of unrestrained government." But science of the eugenic era does not merit any such blanket absolution. Eugenic measures were the product of a collaboration between governments and scientists. In the United States, for example, passage of eugenic sterilization laws was promoted by various biologists who proclaimed that the "racial" stock of the country was degenerating as a result of excessive reproduction by the lower classes, including immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. Many states declined to pass sterilization laws despite the biologists, because of objections from religious groups and civil libertarians. 
 Silver invokes government responsibility for the enactment of eugenic cruelties in the past in service of warning against governmental interference with reproductive freedom now and in the future. People should have the right to "use the messages in their own DNA as they see fit," he writes. Of course they should, and without governmental coercion. But consumers don't necessarily possess completely neutral, unbiased knowledge about those messages. Their notions of what they can do with their DNA -- or have done to it, as in the case of Jesse Gelsinger, the 18-year-old who died last September in a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania -- are colored by delineations of risks, costs and benefits that are supplied by, among others, biomedical scientists, many of them with professional or economic interests in the matter. The contemporary state of gene therapy should suffice to spotlight the need for effective government regulation over interventions in the human genome. Consumer protection is no less warranted in human genetic manipulation than it is in the introduction of new therapeutic drugs.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Oil Prices Rise, Air Fares Follow

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
THE price of oil is affecting travel everywhere. Surcharges of $20 on a round trip are being added to most airline tickets. Airport shuttle prices are inching up. And although a spokesman for Greyhound Lines says increases in the cost of driving improve the company's business, Greyhound has also added a fuel surcharge. Officials in the hotel industry, noting the possibility that higher prices will bring a downturn in travel, say there could be an impact there, too: inexpensive motels might lower prices.
The increases are unpredictable. Supershuttle, an airport van service in many major cities, has added a charge of 50 cents to its trip prices. But Gray Line, which serves airports in New York, has not, although Lee Gelber, a spokesman, said that the fare for the day trip to the Woodbury Common mall had increased by $1. On Feb. 2, Olympia Bus Service raised its fare from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan to Newark Airport from $10 to $11, but created a round-trip fare of $20. A spokeswoman called it a fuel surcharge, but acknowledged that it was unlikely to be withdrawn. This supports the notion that a surcharge is simply an increase that will stay even if oil prices drop. 
 Air passengers are feeling the biggest impact right now. Last week brought turmoil in fares provoked by fuel costs, but even before that, the major lines followed Continental's lead in adding $10 to each one-way fare. But because Southwest Airlines has not -- although it has increased fares slightly -- some other airlines are not adding the surcharge in areas where they compete with Southwest or other discount lines. For example, United's service in California does not have surcharges.
 
Airlines' Policies Vary
My encounter with the fuel surcharge uncovered what appears to be the most eccentric pattern in its application. I went to a Continental ticket counter last month to exchange two senior coupons for a round-trip ticket to San Antonio in April. For those unfamiliar with senior coupons, all the lines sell them to people over 62 for roughly competitive prices; each coupon is good for a one-way flight in the 48 states. My coupons cost $579 for four, and I was expecting to use two -- or about $289 worth -- for my San Antonio trip.
The agent said there would be a $20 surcharge, bringing my fare to $309 for a schedule that required a connection on the way home. This was irritating. I made another choice, a ticket for $355, figuring I would use the coupons when they represented a greater saving.
Not all airlines impose the extra charge on the coupons, I discovered when I examined the major lines' fuel-surcharge policies.
Continental put its $10-each-way surcharge into all domestic markets on Feb. 1. As I found, it adds the charge to senior coupons when they are turned into tickets.
Both American Airlines and Trans World Airlines are adding the surcharge to all their domestic tickets regardless of the competition, they say. Both put the charge into effect Feb. 1; neither adds a surcharge to senior coupons. If the tickets were bought before the increase took effect, it is not added later.
Jim Brown, a T.W.A. spokesman, said that when the line had a fare sale for four days in mid-February, there was no fuel charge on those tickets. There might be such sales again, he said. But when asked if the surcharge was ever going to go away, he said "no comment," as did every other airline spokesperson.
American, T.W.A. and all the others add the fuel charge if the passenger changes an itinerary on a ticket purchased before the surcharge went into effect. This is on top of the regular fee for changing a ticket. The airlines contend that it becomes, in effect, a new ticket.
Northwest Airlines imposes the charge in most markets, according to Dennis Mollura, a spokesman. "In competitive markets," he said, "we do what the competition is doing." Senior coupons are not surcharged.
United Airlines, according to Joseph P. Hopkins, a spokesman, matches Continental and Southwest where it competes with them. Senior coupons are not surcharged.
US Airways levies the surcharge in most domestic markets, but not on the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle. US Airways adds the charge to tickets bought with senior coupons.
Delta also adds the surcharge to most domestic tickets, except where it competes with low-price airlines, according to John Kennedy, a spokesman. The Boston-New York-Washington shuttle is exempted, as are senior coupons.
Southwest Airlines disdains a fuel surcharge; Ed Stewart, a spokesman, said, "A fare increase is a fare increase." On Jan. 25, Southwest increased its ticket prices $2 for a trip of up to 600 miles; $3 for 600 to 900 miles, and $4 for more than 900 miles. The increases are doubled for a round trip.
 
Agents' Complaint
Both the American Society of Travel Agents and an organization called the United States Travel Agent Registry, a group formed in 1995 that says it has 780 member agencies, sent complaints in January and February to the Department of Transportation saying that the airlines' computer fare displays did not show the fuel surcharges, or other added fees, on the first screen. Sam Podberesky, in the department's regulatory division, combined the two complaints, and the department has asked several airlines to respond.
The complaints can be read on the Web at dms.dot.gov. When the "search" box appears, enter the last four digits of the docket identifier: OST-200-6821.
 
Higher Bus Fares
Meanwhile, on the ground, Greyhound increased fares 1.5 percent in late January. "Part is fuel, part is a general price increase," said George Gravley, a spokesman. "We have a lot of trouble raising prices," he said. "But we pick up passengers because of the cost of driving."
Gale C. Ellsworth, president of Trailways, said that its 54 franchised operators were responding individually. "Some are calling it a surcharge," Ms. Ellsworth said, "some are calling it an increase." Peter Pan, in New England, has added 50 cents for any one-way trip, and Adirondack Trailways in New York went up 5 percent across the board.
Gasoline prices for cars have taken a huge swing, from an average of 96 cents a gallon for self-service regular unleaded in February 1999 to $1.37 last month, according to AAA figures. Jerry Cheske, a AAA spokesman, said prices would probably continue to rise. But, he said, the response has been different from 1990, when gas prices rose and in August "tourism almost fell through the floor."
"We don't see the kind of outrage we saw then," he said. The economy is better and people are driving vehicles that use a lot more gas, he said.
If people who drive on their vacations hold back this summer, according to Warren J. Marr, director of hospitality and leisure consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, it will affect prices at less expensive hotels but not luxury places. "People who have to do business will still do it," Mr. Marr said, "but there may be more aggressive pricing at the lower-priced hotels by summer."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 3-19-00;
Marriage A la Market

BYLINE: By Jack Hitt; Jack Hitt is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent article was about teenage filmmakers.

 BODY:
California voters recently passed Proposition 22, which says that only marriages between men and women are officially recognized, and yet the state legislature already extends some benefits to domestic partnerships. In December, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled pretty much the same thing: gay couples cannot be deprived of the legal benefits enjoyed by married heterosexuals. In both cases, the usual brigade of talking heads bobbed across my television screen screaming that these cases constituted an assault on marriage.
I'll say. This is what marriage has come to? A bunch of pension rollover deferments, tax loopholes and health-care portability abatements? Now, I'm a straight first-time husband with two legitimate kids, and according to America's family-values czar, the thrice-married Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, my love-laced nest is the source of all that is good and true in this world (where are my royalties?) and is now under siege. I happen to think Barr is right. But it's not gay folks I'm worried about; it's Adam Smith. Increasingly, marriage is being recast as just another budget item in everyone's personal finance portfolio. 
 The House just passed a bill reducing the "marriage tax penalty." Prenuptial agreements were once optional instruments for multimillionaires; now legal Web sites instruct us that "every couple should and must have a prenuptial agreement or marriage contract."
In our pop culture, the wife or husband as economic object is now a routine Hollywood plot device. Ever since "Indecent Proposal," that consumerist reworking of the fabled droit du seigneur, and all the way up to the recent "The Bachelor" (Chris O'Donnell must marry somebody by a certain date or lose the big inheritance), the message is clear: next to money, romance is second-rate bunk. Must I mention Rick Rockwell and "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" At one point the show's proposed host was none other than Marla Maples.
Increasingly, marriage is being converted into a neo-feudal property arrangement for the Nasdaq gentry. Even dating these days is understood as little more than the discovery period before the big merger. WB's new dating show, "Change of Heart," arranges for a boy or girl who is going out with someone to date someone else and then come on the show to discuss the two before deciding between them. You may recognize this process. It's called comparison shopping.
What is happening to marriage is the culmination of the market's radical reshaping of the culture at large. The invisible hand is tearing away the ideals that once held together most of our institutions. Hospitals used to operate under some unwritten notion of altruism. Now patients are "health care consumers" told to shop among various doctors or "gatekeepers" whose new duties include monitoring the flow of gross costs.
Schools are also undergoing a similar metaphorical shift with a customer-clerk relationship replacing the old student-teacher one. The Dewey principle of public education for all? Let 'em eat vouchers. Even churches have hired market consultants, and now the surging congregations out West gather in huge warehouse temples selling spirituality the way Home Depot moves precut lumber. It makes sense that love would go the same way -- just another failed ideology, like communism, collapsing in the path of the market's indiscriminate force to lay bare the economic decision at the core.
According to the academics, this is where marriage began. Feudal dads chose their children's spouses to upwardly mobilize themselves. Romantic passion is said to be a cultural construction that dates from the 12th-century poetic tradition of courtly love and developed into a new ideal of romance in the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine. Then, the story goes, the growing humanism of the Renaissance and the Industrial Age emancipated men and women to become wild romantic honeys -- like Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald or Nick and Nora Charles.
I've never bought this stuff. Maybe that's how it developed for some Burgundian merchant class. But I spent four college years with my face in a Lewis & Short dictionary translating Latin. Horace's Pyrrha, Catullus's Lesbia. Trust me, romantic love predated the French.
But the public institution of marriage, declared sacred and presided over by the clergy, did not. Despite what Bob Barr may think, marriage was largely a private vow made between two people without witnesses. (For Christianity's first 1,000 years, marriage was even a suspect state, arguably a mockery of God's love and doctrinally inferior to celibacy.) Protestant agitation made marriage into an official public occasion, with licenses, clergy and witnesses. The Catholic Church didn't catch up until the Council of Trent in 1563. The British Parliament did not make marriage a state-sanctioned event until 1753. America's common-law marital tradition is not some hick version of free love but, in fact, the remnant of the oldest form of marriage, the romantic vow.
Have you ever fallen in love? And run around cooing to all your friends like a moon-drunk calf? That fine little moment, I'm willing to bet, has always been at the beginning of most marriages. Recasting the institution as some kind of tax-loophole, Defense of Marriage Act, comparison-shopping, bridal-auction bargain deal is the real threat -- not homosexuals in love. But I don't want you to think I don't set limits. I have kids; I am a father; I draw the line. Precisely because Bob Barr and I agree that love-in-marriage is the bedrock of Western civilization, I would never permit Marla Maples or Rick Rockwell in my house -- or any of their kind, whether it be prenuptially arranged dot-com tycoons or old-school climbers who shed one legal spouse after another, like Pamela Churchill Harriman or, come to think of it, Bob Barr. I've got to think of my children.

"Benefits? Benefit of having a prenuptial marriage contract before getting married is enormous. It may save your life and family wealth. . . . As I said in the past that divorce or separation is as inevitable as deaths. It is bound to come to one partner regardless how much or how little we love each other. In my opinion, every couple should and must have a prenuptial agreement or marriage contract. . . . Most people neglect this part as they usually have very little when they start family life and tend to think that it is not as important. . . . Without this prenuptial marriage contract one's life will be ruined." -- from the "Prenuptial Marriage Contracts" section of the Mowchuk.com Web site

HEADLINE: Which One's Audrey, and Why It Matters;
Copying Copies: The Sad Slide From Stardom To Celebrity

BYLINE: By JEFF MACGREGOR; Jeff MacGregor worked in the television industry for 20 years, as writer, producer and network correspondent.

 BODY:
IN those ancient days long before the earth had cooled, when the mighty pterodactyl still ruled the darkling skies, I took my first job in television news. This was 1975, the early Polyester Period of the Cenozoic Era, and the only thing wider than the bright horizon on which I projected my youthful ambitions was the tie I wore to work. It was an age of great social and technological upheaval: American women abandoned the spiritual impoverishment of the home for the spiritual impoverishment of the workplace, and, in response, men began using hair dryers and wearing platform saddle shoes. Microwave ovens delivered bad popcorn in only half the time. Back in Minnesota, we recorded and reported these events with all due dispatch and the appropriate gravity.
That year, technology also brought the widespread use of videotape to television news gathering. Film was laborious and expensive, so we welcomed the convenience and speed of videotape. We were warned by factory representatives, however, of a serious concern with the new medium. "Generational deterioration," they would solemnly intone, speaking directly into the tabletop, bent double by the weight of neckwear the size of lobster bibs, "is a real problem." Unable to nod, we could only murmur our agreement. 
 Generational deterioration describes what happens when you make copies of copies of copies, an effect common in videotape (and the genealogy of Europe's royal families). By the fourth or fifth generation the loss of quality is obvious, and one is left with only a dim facsimile, a blurred and colorless rendering of the original.
A similar phenomenon can be observed in its proper laboratory setting on March 27 when the ubiquitous ingenue Jennifer Love Hewitt essays the title role in the television biopic "The Audrey Hepburn Story." While Ms. Hewitt's charms are considerable, and her various talents have been corroborated by an astonishing number of teen-zine cover stories, the portrayal by a popular young actress of a show business original like a Hepburn, any Hepburn, can only result in lopsided comparisons. It seems to me that the outcome of viewing something like this will be to increase our longing for the genuine article at the expense of our regard for the woman playing her.
That fans of "Roman Holiday" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" greeted the news of this project with barnyard snorts and eye-rolling of a magnitude unseen since the heyday of Snub Pollard is not a direct attack on Ms. Hewitt. Miscast or not, she will do her best, I am sure, and the movie, like most movies, will be promptly forgotten in any case. What seems to gall people is the potential damage that might be done to their memories, however imprecise, of Audrey Hepburn.
But there is something else at work here, too. Fueling that upset is perhaps the broader exasperation we feel at the explosive growth of "celebrity" and the proportional shrinkage of old school "stardom" that accompanies it; at the casual and unapologetic devaluation of originality; and at the melancholy xerography of most current entertainment. Audrey Hepburn versus Jennifer Love Hewitt competing for America's affections is a fixed fight, certainly, but may be emblematic of a much bigger problem. In trying so hard to earn a buck on the cusp of the Intertainment Age, Hollywood seems to specialize now in nothing so much as its own diminishment.
Before it gave way to new technologies and economies in the 1950's, the old studio system thrived on the gradual assembly of film legends. It could take years to build a John Wayne or a James Stewart or an Audrey Hepburn. The Hollywood bosses of that feudal era understood that what they manufactured was not movies but movie stars. The time and money it took to make one was well spent, because that kind of marquee appeal was a guarantee of moviegoing fannies in the seats. It was a long-term investment, one in which both parties benefited. The studios got their stars, at a price, and the stars, while constrained by their ironclad contracts, usually learned their craft with a schoolhouse rigor unimaginable today. If one looks at the kind of roles assumed by Errol Flynn or Joan Crawford or Spencer Tracy, the breadth and variety of the material they tried (or were forced to try) is stunning.
Today, though, Hollywood is engaged in the bulk manufacture of celebrities -- interchangeable entertainment widgets. The face on that magazine cover seems vaguely familiar and may belong to that guy we saw in that movie that time but, then again, may belong to that other guy in that other movie. That the company that owns the movie also owns the magazine and the magazine show covering them both makes for a closed economy wherein the importance of the individual is superseded by the impersonal necessities of a business done in volume. Hence a generation of actors like Ben Affleck or Jennifer Lopez who are on magazine covers because they are in the movies and seem to be in the movies only because they are on so many magazine covers. Ben Affleck is, I am sure, a nice young man, and somebody somewhere is determined to make him a celebrity if it kills him. Who and why I cannot say. Happily, the likelihood of seeing him in something like "The Jimmy Stewart Story" remains remote, at least for the moment. The part may go to Vince Vaughn. Or that other guy.
This sort of strangely anonymous celebrity, with its high-speed turnover and confusing sub-identities, is not limited to film. In the space of about a month last year, we witnessed the emergence of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore. The music business has obviously perfected the genetic engineering of blonde, sexpot teen-pop singers, and these are the results. In the old days Madonna had to invent herself piecemeal by invoking the ghost of Marilyn Monroe. These four sprang full grown from the MTV laboratories and are virtually identical, right down to the bare midriff and semisuggestive lyrics. I would challenge the scientists who created them to differentiate them (or their songs) in a police lineup. Can't be done.
What is most awe-inspiring about the new age of show business devolution, though, is its copy-to-copy-to-copy rapidity. More channels than ever, with more time to fill with more "content," means more derivative performers in more derivative formats than at any time in history. Digital technology aside, a copy is a copy is a copy, especially if there are more of them.
Witness the current state of television, the great devolver. Who among us can honestly keep the casts of "Felicity," "Popular" and "Dawson's Creek" straight? And why, after all, should we bother? Maybe because we've been booked to appear on "Greed"!
The big story of the last six months has been the triumphant return of the quiz show. ABC's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" breathed life into a form long thought dead by the experts. Based on a British show of the same format, it has made an unlikely prime-time colossus of Regis Philbin. Dressed in a manner befitting a stylish Cosa Nostra funeral director, Mr. Philbin sits on the bridge of the starship Free Enterprise, firing questions at chatty contestants and signing their souvenir checks. In its Americanized production, the questions are not very tough (if you got through junior high earth science and have a subscription to People magazine, you can make some real dough), and the appeal of the thing seems to lie in its ready accessibility. It is now on the air 128 nights a week and seems to muscle its way onto the schedule whenever it damn well feels like it.
The theory of waning generations, however, kicked in with the subsequent rollout of NBC's counterweapon, "Twenty One." Not only is this a show trying to capitalize on the first-generation success of "Millionaire," it is likewise a pale descendant of one of television's most (in)famous early hits. Dumbed down as though the whole thing had been poleaxed with the stupid stick, it betrays the initial appeal of the original, which was hard questions asked of sweating contestants in giant soundproof saltshakers. Now the Q & A is remedial multiple choice, the booths look air-conditioned and the only tension arises when the M.C., Maury Povich, tries to crack a joke. He has all the comic timing of a death row chaplain and is far better suited to his talk-show day job supervising teen prostitute makeovers and mouthing pieties about our failing family values. The original "Twenty One" may have been rigged, but at least it was worth watching. NBC is learning this the hard way as the new show's ratings travel quickly south.
In the seat just ahead of it on that downbound bus is the aforementioned "Greed." A Fox show from top to bottom, it has failed to catch fire, maybe because it stole only the elements from "Millionaire" that nobody liked: the music and the set. Or perhaps the audience doesn't think that knowing the five most popular sandwich spreads is worth a million bucks. If Fox knows how to make lemons into chicken salad, though, next month we will all be glued to the set watching "Who Wants to Marry Chuck Woolery?"
The CBS entry in the quiz show sweepstakes, "Winning Lines," was dead on arrival. More complicated than the New York State tax code, the entire show was taken up by Dick Clark's dogged explanation of the rules. Thus ended, in a matter of weeks, the explosive success cycle of prime-time game shows. Only Regis seems destined to endure.
WHAT is remarkable about all this is not that network television resorts to ripping off successful ideas from its competition or its own past but that it can do it so quickly. It has long been axiomatic that imitation is the sincerest form of television, but this season we have witnessed a new achievement in the turnaround time necessary to beat the life out of a defenseless idea.
Television is history's most insistently derivative medium. Our other major pop-cult industries, like film and music, depend on it for the promotion and cross-pollination of their own derivatives. The lookalike morning show books the lookalike actors who are on the lookalike magazine covers plumping the lookalike movies that start this Friday. The next day another actor another magazine another movie. And the next. And the next. The rapidity with which these pale copies track past us diminishes the value of each, including the ones that preceded them, blurring and obscuring even the most authentic. In this way we spiral into ever faster, more meaningless cycles of spin, sales figures and cynicism.
Thus diminished and inured to sensation, we can easily forget why we loved that generation of originals from long ago, from the time before the world grew cold. But if in remembering, or trying to remember, you decide to rent "Roman Holiday" or "Breakfast at Tiffany's" as an act of defiance or absolution or faith, don't forget to thank young Jennifer Love Hewitt for the inspiration.

Demand Continues Strong for Million-Dollar Homes

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
DESPITE recent blips in interest rates and swings in the stock market, the luxury home market in Westchester, which had record sales last year, is still "going strong," said Ebie Wood, a vice president with the Houlihan/Lawrence brokerage concern.
"People don't seem deterred at all by fluctuations in the market," Ms. Wood said. "Last year, the market in million-dollar homes exploded and it just keeps going." So far this year, she said, 22 houses costing $1 million or more have been sold in the northeast section of the county, which includes some of its most affluent areas, among them Bedford, Armonk, South Salem and Pound Ridge. 
 The average price was $2 million, and "the days on the market were 178," Ms. Wood said. "That's really the sign of an active market," she said.
Last year, her office sold 127 million-dollar houses at an average price of $1.7 million, and houses stayed on the market an average of 192 days. "There's definitely a pent-up demand," Ms. Wood said. "People are ready to buy. And they have the money in their pockets."
Another sign that this year is starting out even better than last, Ms. Wood said, is that harder-to-sell houses, which have unusual features, are being snatched up. "One house that was put on the market last summer lingered into the fall and then was taken off," Ms. Wood said. "We just put it back on, and we have an accepted offer."
A record of 403 homes sold for $1 million or more in Westchester last year, Houlihan/ Lawrence reported last month. That was up 33 percent from 308 houses sold in 1998. The number that sold for more $2 million jumped to 89 in 1999, up 41 percent from 63 in 1998. Houlihan/Lawrence's report covers sales reported by the Westchester Multiple Listing Service as well as those in their own offices.
Coldwell Banker Connecticut/New York also reported strong sales of luxury homes in 1999, although its report included sales only in its own offices. It sold 107 houses in the New York region -- which includes Westchester and Rockland Counties -- for $1 million or more last year, up 40 percent from 65 in 1998, said Lisa Harness, a vice president with Previews, Coldwell Banker's luxury properties division.
Dollar sales in that price range last year was $165.8 million, a 54 percent increase from the previous year. "New York homes in the Previews program had an average selling price of $1.5 million in 1999," Ms. Harness said, "compared to $1.25 million in 1998, a 17 percent increase."
Those increases do not mean, however, that house prices are increasing by that margin, Ms. Harness said.
"It just means that a greater number of more expensive houses are in the market now." she said. "We're seeing homes selling for between $4 million and $5 million and that brings the averages up."
In fact, it has got to the point where a million-dollar house is commonplace, Ms. Harness said. "I mean, to be a millionaire today, what is that? People are now buying $3, $4 and $5 million houses and paying for them in cash."
THE market in luxury homes today is similar to the boom years of the 1980's, Ms. Harness said, but with some important differences. "Then we saw 100 percent financing, robbing Peter to pay Paul," she said, "and when the market crashed, many of those people lost their homes. Today with so many cash transactions, even if the market turns down, people won't lose their homes."
The profile of sellers has also changed, Ms. Harness added. "In the 1980's, it was these moneyed people in their 60's who were downsizing," she said. "Now you have people in their 40's who are selling $1 million houses and moving up to even bigger houses. And there's also been more new construction at this price range."
Two years ago, John Ciardullo started building a development called Rock Shelter Road, a 21-lot subdivision, in Waccabuc. On a site spread over 100 wooded acres, he is building four- and five-bedroom colonial and shingle-style homes at $1.5 million to $2.5 million each.
"I thought I'd get yuppies with a lot of money to spend on a house," Mr. Ciardullo said. And that is pretty much what has happened, he said. Now starting on his ninth house, Mr. Ciardullo said that most buyers have been in their "early to late 30's, with young children." And at least one parent commutes into Manhattan, he added.
"But I've also gotten buyers in their early 50's who have just relocated, and some other combinations, such as a widow and her daughter and son-in-law who bought a house," Mr. Ciardullo said. "It's a real mix."
Amanda and Gary Brown were the first buyers at Rock Shelter Road, buying a four- bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath, shingle-style house, with 6,800 square feet, on four acres. "We'd looked all over Westchester," Ms. Brown said. "We looked at houses half the size on three-quarters of an acre in the same price range. And we looked at new construction that wasn't very well built before finding this. The minute we saw it we knew it was exactly what we wanted."
Two years ago, the house sold for $1.3 million, which was "a giveaway at the time," Mr. Ciardullo said. "I lost about $250,000 on it, but I just wanted to get the development going. Today that house would sell for $2 million."
TODAY five houses at Rock Shelter Road are complete, and three are under construction. "I'm starting the ninth house now. I've been building some speculative houses," Mr. Ciardullo said, "because I'm confident they'll sell. Some people don't want to go through the trouble of having a house built. They want something they can move right into."
One of his speculative houses, a five-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bath colonial, is in contract for $2.2 million, the list price. "I had two offers for the house at list," Mr. Ciardullo said. The 7,405-square-foot colonial has a two-story foyer, a columned entry in the living room, four fireplaces, a wood-paneled library and maid's quarters. "The people who are buying it are planning to use it as a weekend home," Mr. Ciardullo said. Their permanent home is in Manhattan.
Even with projects like Mr. Ciardullo's and others in construction, low inventory in the $1 million-plus category remains a problem.
"It's really a problem across all price ranges," said Ms. Wood, "but especially at this price range. We just got two listings in last week, and they're gone. Everything sells immediately if the house is in good shape and priced properly. But even with low supply, buyers at this price range are very savvy, and they won't overpay. If a house is not priced right, it will sit on the market. That's one thing that hasn't changed."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Walking Out On Uneasy Success

BYLINE: By DAVID HECHT; David Hecht, a freelancer based in Dakar, Senegal, writes about culture.

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal

 BODY:
IN 1985, Angelique Kidjo left Benin in West Africa, poor and relatively unknown. But once in Paris the feisty Ms. Kidjo, a singer who contemporizes traditional music from across Africa, soon became a modern-day Josephine Baker, selling out concerts at the renowned Olympia concert hall. French government agencies were handing her plane tickets and cash even before they granted her French nationality. She lived a comfortable life in Paris's fashionable Marais -- that is until a couple of years ago, when she moved to Brooklyn. "I had to get out," Ms. Kidjo said recently from her brownstone in Park Slope. "France was stifling me."
Paris has been the capital of world music, embracing salsa and bossa nova before they were known elsewhere in the West as well as providing sanctuary for expatriate American jazz and blues musicians. Yet Ms. Kidjo is one of many African musicians who have made careers for themselves there and then expressed about as much appreciation as a love interest of Pepe Le Pew's. "There's an arrogance," said Richard Bona, a singer and bass player from Cameroon who, despite his success in France, has, like Kidjo, moved to New York. "They think they understand my music better than I do." Even Aicha Kone, Ivory Coast's most Frenchified diva, publicly complained recently that some African music made in France "doesn't sound African." 
 Still, leaving Paris for America -- or even returning to Africa -- might not be the answer for musicians seeking more than fame and fortune. The fact is that the music of Ms. Kone, Mr. Bona and Ms. Kidjo continues to exude a distinctly French aesthetic. "With most of it you can tell who colonized us," said Bouba N'Dour, head of Jololi, a new record company based in Senegal and founded by his brother, the well-known singer Youssou N'Dour. "The best African music tries to decide for itself its relationship with the outside world."
Figuring out that relationship is a tricky matter. African musicians have found recognition and financial support in Paris; breaking away from the French influence is not easy. Their intent is not to create a music that is purely African; to do so would leave them without electric instruments and the Western pop-song structure. Given that Western pop traces its roots to Africa, Africans should be able to combine the best of African and Western traditions without sounding derivative.
Afropop, as the music is known in America, has a long relationship with France. Most of it is produced by the more than 150 record labels in France specializing in world music, and much of it is tinged with variete francaise, France's sugary pop music, which in fact has little variety. "Just sample any French-made world music CD's and you'll get the idea," said Saliou Lamine Diop, a young Senegalese record producer based in New York. "There's always the same cheesy French synthesizers in the background."
Non-Western music of all sorts is a part of France's national psyche. "World music gets beyond the injuries of colonialism," asserts a recent article in Label France, a magazine produced by the ministry of foreign affairs, "to the universalism that is dear to the 'France spirit.' " This universalism, supposedly an outgrowth of the French revolution, is the raison d'etre for francophonie, which has come to mean a French government policy of encouraging cultural and economic ties among French-speaking countries. In the cultural sphere, francophonie encompasses the way the French repackage existing cultures and at the same time renew their own sense of nationalism. Critics like Charles L. Miller, professor of French and African American Studies at Yale University, view francophonie as "inherent neo-colonialism."
But Africans have undeniably benefited from French cultural largesse. There are more French cultural centers in Africa than anyplace in the world, and government ministries for culture and foreign affairs have generous budgets to support African artists. The French music industry has a niche for African musicians. "For France, all African culture has in a sense become a part of our own," said Emmanuel Morlet, a foreign ministry official.
It is precisely that attitude that troubles African musicians. They often say their music is being co-opted, manipulated and then marginalized. Despite the influence of variete francaise, "few French musicians know anything about African music," complained Antoine Yvernault, who organizes annual talent competitions throughout Africa for the government-sponored Radio France International. Immigrant communities in France offer a large audience for world music. Yet, in 1997, when more than 20,000 such CD's were available -- roughly a quarter of all current recordings -- they represented less than 2 percent of the music played on local French radio, according to a report obtained from a government agency.
Africans do not all submit blindly to French values, and sometimes they turn the values on their heads. Take soukous, a popular dance music in Central Africa. Frantic Congolese beats provide a backdrop for dancers dressed up in outfits that take French high fashion to ridiculous extremes. The sendup is even more pointed in a slow version of soukous known as zouk-love. Originally from the French Antilles, in the Caribbean, it is blatantly similar to variete francaise. The difference is that the French schmaltzy romantic lyrics are made sexually explicit and the beat is a little less insipid. In zouk-love, the idea is that grandly dressed couples can slowly grind their pelvises together on the dance floor while playfully imagining themselves to be French bourgeoisie.
The outlook for those African musicians who have left Paris is not clear. Leading musicians like Oumou Sangare of Mali and Baaba Maal of Senegal have abandoned their labels in France and signed with British companies. Others, like Cesaria Evora of Cape Verde and Habib Koite of Mali, have signed with American labels. "Koite is getting air play on commercial radio coast to coast," said Dan Storper, the chief executive of Mr. Koite's American label, Putamayo, "and other African artists may also soon cross over."
American tastes in music seem to be opening up. Sales of world music have risen steadily in the United States in recent years. (In contrast, sales of world music made in France have declined recently in America, according to Qualiton, a leading importer of French labels.) In dance clubs, hits from the 1970's by Mori Kante of Mali and Fela Anikulapo-Kuti of Nigeria are now standard remix material. Fela's son, Femi Anikulapo-Kuti, and Fela's former drummer, Tony Allen, are each fusing his so-called Afrobeat style with contemporary Western genres, and both have audiences in the West beyond the traditional world music niche.
For most African musicians, though, trying to fit in in America or Britian may be no more rewarding than trying to fit in in France. Western audiences -- and by extension Western record companies -- have specific tastes, and they often do not conform to African tastes. As a result, African musicians frequently make two versions of their albums, one to cater to an American audience and another to an African one. In the process they are only adding to the confusion about for whom their pop music is intended.
The best Afropop plays to both audiences. Papa Wemba in the Congo, Salif Keita in Mali and Youssou N'Dour in Senegal have all made records that have sold well in the West and they are national heroes in their own countries. Their music approaches the ideal of African musicians: it sells internationally while retaining enough of an indigenous identity to appeal to African audiences.
Mr. N'Dour continues to live and perform in Senegal. He sometimes sings in French as well as English -- like in his unfortunate recent collaboration with Sting. But his best music is undoubtedly made in his native Wolof. His rhythmically playful mbalax style is based on the intensely syncopated, polyrhythmic sabar drumming that every Senegalese grows up with. For native listeners, the fun of the music is guessing where the beat will fall. And while Mr. N'Dour's mbalax is world music, it is also a private joke among Senegalese.
At Jololi, Mr. N'Dour's label, new artists are only marketed locally. "Their first albums are just meant to appeal to Senegalese," said Kabou Gueye, the label's artistic director. "Then maybe later, if it gets popular, we might do a world beat album." But the market in most African countries is small. Thus the lure of France remains strong.
The French mostly dismiss the idea that Africans are fleeing Paris. "Some may leave but more will always come," said Mr. Yvernault. If they sing in French they are eligible for government support, though it may not help their careers. Salif Keita recently made an album of "variete francaise" classics called "Sosie" ("Spitting image"). It was not well liked; those who heard it generally agreed it was his worst.

HEADLINE: The View From/Bridgeport;
City Schools Using Mentors to Slow the Exodus of Teachers

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL

 BODY:
AFTER working for more than 20 years in auditing jobs in companies such as Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Gary DeBrizzi, 47, decided a few years ago to pursue an old dream -- to become a teacher.
He is now in his third year as a fifth-grade teacher at Paul Laurence Dunbar School in Bridgeport and said he hopes to teach there for a long time. 
 Elena Pelaez, 23, is in just her second year as a Spanish teacher at the Multi-Cultural Magnet School in Bridgeport and said she can envision staying in the Bridgeport schools for the rest of her career.
But in a school district that loses up to one third of its new teachers every year, and in a nation where half of all new teachers quit within five years, according to the National Education Association, the chances of teachers like Ms. Palaez and Mr. Debrizzi being in classrooms here a decade from now are slim.
School administrators across the country, in fact, said there is a national teacher retention crisis, with urban centers being the hardest hit in a booming economy that provides new teachers with the opportunity to earn considerably more money in the suburbs.
Teachers who leave say in their exit interviews that low salaries and the increasingly difficult task of reaching inner-city students who bring serious life problems into the classroom are the leading reasons they don't stay in urban school districts.
But Bridgeport educators are fighting to keep new teachers in the district, and they say they are succeeding. What's making the difference, they say, is a mentoring program that pairs new teachers with veteran teachers who provide professional and personal support every day.
The Peer Assistance Program, which was made possible two years ago with an annual $4,000 National Education Association urban grant that has been renewed twice, is being jointly run with the Bridgeport school system, which provides matching funds. That makes it possible to train mentors, pay workshop and conference fees and hold after-hour social events that provide a vehicle for teachers to stay connected to each other, school officials said.
Both administrators and teachers said the program is already having an impact. They said 45 of 50 new teachers who participated last year are still in Bridgeport, and that the ratio of new teachers who leave after their first year has declined three years in a row.
While 43 of 109 new teachers departed at the end of the 96-97 school year, the number dropped to 33 of 95 in 1997-98 and to 23 of 115 last year. Those kinds of results have national educators studying the program as a potential model for other urban districts.
"There are rapidly growing numbers of people qualified to teach in this country who aren't teaching and that is a major problem we must address and are being addressed in programs like the one in Bridgeport," said Robert Chase president of the National Education Association in Washington, D.C.
Mr. Chase, the former president of the Connecticut Education Association and a Danbury teacher for 25 years, said programs like the one in Bridgeport were "absolutely essential if we are to have enough teachers to put in classrooms by 2007 when school enrollments will balloon to an unprecedented 54.3 million."
Both Mr. DeBrizzi and Ms. Pelaez said the program had greatly helped them.
"I always wanted to teach and was very idealistic when I finally got here after years in corporate jobs," Mr. DeBrizzi said. "The students have a lot of problems and it was very discouraging to realize you couldn't just make things better for them. Having the support of veteran teachers got me through some very frustrating times."
Ms. Pelaez said the program also helped get her through her first year.
"You can have all the confidence in the world as a teacher, but it's pretty overwhelming to suddenly be in charge of a classroom," she said. "Being able to rely on a veteran teacher who has been through it all at a moment's notice for guidance on managing a classroom or preparing a lesson plan can be invaluable."
Ms. Pelaez credits her mentor, third-grade teacher Margaret E. Cunningham, with providing that kind of support.
Ms. Cunningham, who has had two separate teaching stints in Bridgeport over a 35-year period, said, "I think the biggest problem is that new teachers come in knowing their subject very well, but not understanding that the first few years in the classroom can be very tough.
"Having someone to talk to who has been through the same thing can be very reassuring, and can even make the difference in whether somebody stays or leaves."
That kind of support may have helped keep teachers like Shirley Taylor in the system when an "avalanche of paper work" and classroom unrest had the High Horizons Magnet School math teacher thinking about leaving a few years ago.
"The biggest problems new teachers face are getting used to the paper work and keeping pupils calm and focused," Ms. Taylor said. "But those aren't subjects covered in college."
They, are however, subjects covered in the Peer Assistance Program. The program has done that by "providing enough daily support to new teachers so they feel connected to both their students and the school community as a whole," said the program coordinator Mary Lou Weiner of the Bridgeport Education Association.
Ms. Weiner said the program was far more extensive than the state-mandated Beginning Educator Support and Training program that requires new teachers have a mentor in order to obtain certification.
Fran Rabinowitz, executive director of teaching and learning for the Bridgeport school system, said losing new teachers in urban districts like Bridgeport was a complex problem.
"We know it's a tough sell to convince teachers to stay, but what we are doing here in Bridgeport is unique," she said. "The administration is working together with the teachers' union to provide as much support as possible to teachers in their early years so that we at least have a chance to keep new teachers here. And we are seeing results."

E-Commerce Tenants Spur the Need for Warehouses

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE collection of big boxy warehouses that dots the landscape in north and central New Jersey is filling up and growing larger as the wave of leasing and building that washed over the state's industrial sector in 1999 rolls into this year.
The demand is coming from conventional as well as a small but growing number of e-commerce tenants who in response to a soaring economy are opening new centers to meet their expansion needs or consolidating operations to increase efficiency. In turn, most of the 4.1 million square feet of space added last year has been taken, prompting developers to build 5.6 million more square feet over the next 12 months, said Cushman & Wakefield, the national commercial brokerage company. 
 Meanwhile, the boxes are getting bigger and being installed with the latest equipment as distributors try to deliver goods to their consumers in 24 hours, said Jeffrey J. Toia, a senior director at the Garibaldi Group, a commercial brokerage company in Chatham. All these factors are driving the market and, despite the addition of new space, keeping demand ahead of supply, he said.
Stephen P. Jenco, research services manager at the Fairfield office of Grubb & Ellis, the national brokerage company, added: "New construction is not putting a dent in demand for industrial space, which may even be stronger than the demand for offices." His firm put the industrial vacancy rate in the 11-county northern and central parts of the state at 3.5 percent at the end of 1999, down from 4.7 percent in 1998.
Most of the activity is occurring in a few of the state's bigger submarkets. One is the Meadowlands, which continues to attract tenants that need to be near Manhattan. Another is Middlesex County, which has been accommodating companies looking to consolidate, with Edison and the area around Interchange Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike attracting much of the attention. Demand is also gradually pushing south on the turnpike to Exit 7A in Mercer County. Rents in those areas are rising.
Among the projects planned is a million-square-foot warehouse distribution center to be built for Seaman Furniture Company, off Exit 7A in Washington Township. Three speculative projects with 500,000 to almost a million square feet also are expected to proceed in South Brunswick and Monroe, both off Exit 8A and in Edison, which is near Exit 10.
All are being built with, among other things, 32- to 38-foot-high ceilings, so goods can be stacked ever higher on racking systems that tenants install. They will also have ultra flat floors so that forklifts can move through narrow aisles where goods can be packed more closely, as well as truck loading docks on both sides of the warehouse so goods can be received on one side and shipped out the other at the same time.
"Larger buildings seem to be the order of the day as businesses consolidate operations into fewer and bigger warehouses rather than many smaller ones," said Jules Nissim, an associate director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield. He said that 12 tenants were scouring New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for buildings of a million square feet or more, with 14 more needing 400,000 to a million square feet.
But there are fewer places left in the state to develop such large centers. That is one reason that the 7A area, where large tracts of land are available, is gaining attention, brokers said.
That is where Seaman will put its million-square-foot warehouse, which will serve the Woodbury, N.Y., retailer's customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as accommodate future growth. The company, with 49 stores in the northeast, plans new ones in Baltimore and Washington.
The warehouse, which Seaman will lease, will be developed by the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury. It will start to rise in two weeks at Matrix's 400-acre Northeast Business Park, which is next to the turnpike exit and close to Interstate 95, linking it to other points along the Eastern Seaboard -- a location that appealed to Seaman.
With this project, 1.8 million square feet of an eventual 5 million feet will be built at the park, reflecting "its maturity," said Alec Taylor, chief operating officer at Matrix, which is also active in the 8A market.
"The interesting thing," Mr. Taylor said, "is that while 7A is well suited to accommodate larger buildings for specific tenants. 8A remains mostly a place for speculative development." He explained that companies often wanted warehouses ready when they decided to enter markets.
This month his company will also start a 500,000-square-foot speculative warehouse at its 900-acre Center Point business park straddling Cranbury and South Brunswick in the 8A region.
"The competition is keen," Mr. Taylor said, "but typically the buildings are substantially leased before they are completed." Asking rents will be $4.75 a square foot a year.
That is on a par with area rents, which rose 21 cents, to $4.78 a square foot, from 1998 to 1999. Though nearly three million square feet was added to the area during that period, its vacancy rate fell to 3 percent from 4.4 percent, according to Grubb & Ellis.
THOSE factors encouraged Opus East L.L.C -- the regional arm of the Opus Group of Companies, a Minneapolis developer -- to enter the 8A market with a 90-acre campus in South Brunswick. It will have 1.2 million square feet in three buildings.
"It's too good a market to ignore," said James J. Lee, senior vice president at Opus East, which has offices in Bethesda, Md. He said his company expected to start construction by this summer on the first 526,400-square-foot building on 40 acres off Exit 8A.
Given the building's size, "we may lose some of the larger deals," he said, but added that "the typical user in the 8A market still wants 200,000 to 300,000 square feet." Rents will be competitive, he said, noting that his company expected to build the two other buildings in the next two years.
On a 202-acre tract in South Brunswick, Heller Industrial Parks, of Edison, has approvals to build nearly four million square feet in five buildings. Jeffrey J. Milanaik, the company's president, said that with much of the speculative building this year concentrated again in the 8A region, he would initially focus on build-to-suit deals at the South Brunswick project. He said he had interest from three users for buildings of 600,000 to 700,000 square feet each.
Meanwhile, he said his company was planning a two-building, 1.2 million-square-foot speculative project at its 410-acre industrial park, on Mill Road in Edison. "Building on speculation there is not a question," he said, adding that two speculative developments his company built over the last five years at the park, totaling 2.3 million square feet, were fully occupied.
Mr. Milanaik said he expected local and county approvals for the project next month and to start construction on the first 960,000-square-foot building in May. It will be designed for tenants needing 200,000 square feet or more, but the space could be divided into areas as small as 70,000 square feet. Rents will be $4.50 to $4.75 a square foot.
Existing warehouses are also being leased, some by e-commerce companies. One is the 348,885-square-foot warehouse on 91st Street in North Bergen in the Meadowlands that Webvan, the on-line grocer, based in Foster City, Calif, leased last month. The transaction is part of the company's expansion into 26 markets.
"We choose big metropolitan areas that will allow us to build a national footprint," said Amy Nobile, the company's public relations manager. She said the North Bergen center would be modeled after one in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is crisscrossed with conveyor belts and relies on a computer system to pack customers' orders.
Webvan is leasing the building from Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus, among the largest landowners in the Meadowlands. The Meadowlands covers parts of seven communities in Hudson and Bergen Counties. "This market is clicking on all cylinders," said Emanuel Stern, Hartz's president, adding that Internet companies were contributing to its health. He said that his company's 20 million square feet of space had a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent and that the area's rents had risen to $6 to $7 a square foot from $4.50 to $5.50 two years ago.
In turn, he said his company was negotiating with two tenants to build a distribution center for each and "for the first time in a long time also is considering building a speculative warehouse." Each building will have 300,000 to 400,000 square feet.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Dr. David M. Nganele;
Leading Minorities to Better Health Care

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
DR. DAVID M. NGANELE would like to do in Westchester what he recently began doing in Harlem -- running full-time educational programs so African-Americans and other minorities can get better health care.
Dr. Nganele (pronounced GAN-ih-lay), who received his Ph.D. in physiology from New York Medical College in Valhalla, gave up a job a year ago at Pfizer to start, with its financial support, a health-education program at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem. His company, Harmony Health Communications in Harrison, is affiliated with North General Hospital and plans to establish a library on health issues. It is an attempt to overcome more than just financial barriers to good health care. Minorities, he said, distrust the white-dominated medical profession. 
 Dr. Nganele of Mount Kisco was born in Cameroon, where he went to Roman Catholic boarding school. He came to the United States in 1980 when he was 22. After earning his doctorate from the college (where he met his wife, Dr. Charlotte Nganele, a psychiatrist), he earned an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School and in 1990 went to work for Pfizer. There he was part of the team that marketed Procardia, a drug that helps with hypertension. Later, as a senior manager in marketing, he helped market the anti-depressant Zoloft.
Dr. Nganele said the disparities between health care for whites and nonwhites are staggering. For example, blacks die more than six years earlier on average than whites and are more likely to come down with more diseases. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation:
Q. What was your life like growing up in West Africa?
Q. Relative to Cameroon, I was middle class. My father is an accountant and my mother is a dressmaker. So I went to prestigious schools and got grounded well in terms of education. Cameroon is relatively a homogenous society. We have differences in terms of tribal backgrounds, different customs. But we don't have the racial composition that you find in this country.
Q. What was health care like in Cameroon?
A. It's universal. The government pays for health care; the hospitals are free. But there are private hospitals as well, which means if you don't want to go to the government hospitals and you have money you can go to see private physicians and private hospitals. The government also provides free medical education.
Q. How did you get involved on the business side of medicine?
A. I love research and wanted as much education as possible. What took me out of doing basic medical science was that at the time the Reagan administration was cutting back on research grants to academia so you spent a lot of time looking for grants; increasingly, we turned to the drug industry for research grants.
Q. How did you get interested in the quality of health care for African-Americans?
A. After I went to Pfizer and helped launch the drug Procardia, I started understanding the demographics of hypertension. It is a disease that disproportionately affects African-Americans. So I increasingly became aware of the differences in diseases prevalent in this country. I started looking more into it, and as the years went by I realized it didn't just stop with hypertension, that a lot of chronic diseases have a very high prevalence in the minority population. From diabetes, AIDS and others.
Q. Are the disparities in health care between whites and nonwhites an issue of life style or genetics?
A. I started doing research into that, and I realized that maybe it's not that much genetic. We have available information and technology that can make a difference. No one should sit back and say, well, maybe certain groups are more prone to these diseases. As I looked into it, I realized that the African-American community and the minority community don't have as much access to technology and information.
Q. Is a lack of access to health information mainly linked to financial reasons?
A. There are a lot of factors that affect access to health care. One that gets thrown around is insurance. There are two ways to look at that. The data says that 23 percent of African-Americans do not have health insurance. If you turn that around it means that almost 80 percent do have it. So the question is, Are those people who have health insurance making use of it? My feeling is that no, they are not, that a lot of people wait until there is a crisis. And of those people who do not have health insurance, the question is how resourceful are they in getting health care? A lot of resources are actually there for people who do not have health insurance.
Q. What are you trying to do through your company, Harmony Health Communications?
A. This is a medical education company with a mission to educate all the consumers and physicians in how to take care of the minority population. The mission is increasing access to health care. There is a physician-education component and a consumer-education component. The reason there is a physician-education component is because numerous studies have shown if a physician meets a patient with a different cultural background there are issues of communication.
Physicians have to become what is known as "culturally competent." You have to understand that your patient has a background that affects the way they receive medical care. For example, there is a belief in some African-Americans that exercise is stressful. So if somebody comes in with hypertension and you as a physician say to them you need to exercise, for some patients there is a conflict. If you as a physician do not understand that and take time to explain that to the patient, they will walk out thinking you, the doctor, don't know what you're talking about and not take your advice.
Q. What is the consumer-education component of the program at Harmony?
A. This is a big challenge. Patients have to understand how they can help themselves. One of the most significant factors is that the minority community does not trust the medical establishment. In fact, Emory University did a study that showed that 74 percent of African-Americans believe they will be used as guinea pigs by their doctors without their consent. So I looked for an institution that can bridge that gap, and it turns out it's the church. It is the church that across every culture people tend to give unconditional trust. So we need to use the church to help us educate consumers about health care. Ministers in the African-American community have spent a lot of time and energy speaking about the spiritual well-being and social and political issues and economic empowerment. Now they need to get involved in health. They can make all the political and economic gains, but without health that goes for naught.
Q. To what extent are churches involved in health issues now?
A. A lot of churches have realized they need to play a bigger role and have health committees and do health fairs and screening programs. Unfortunately, they're not in that business; they get volunteers and maybe do it once or twice a year. You cannot change a habit this way.
The hope is to get to the point where this becomes a key part of the church's activities. The project that I did at Convent Church, which is a pilot project, actually set up a multimedia health education facility in the church. There is a room that is a health library with books, computers with Internet access, video and audio tapes, a blood pressure machine. It's a room that you can walk into and, regardless of your level of literacy, you can access health information. And the church is open seven days a week. And it's affiliated with North General Hospital, which does screening programs every month, and these programs have been really well attended. These people now have a place where they feel comfortable.
Q. Are the health needs of minorities in Westchester any different from those in Harlem where you have an education program?
A. No, because we have pockets of areas in Westchester with great need -- Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Ossining, Mount Kisco and others. And the needs are not just with the minority population. Look at the growth of the noninsured. Right now it's at 44 million, and the growth is in the middle class. This means that these people need to learn how to take care of themselves. In Mount Kisco, I am working with my church, St. Francis of Assisi. I have developed a resource guide for what to do when you don't have insurance or are underinsured. And I'm starting to talk to other ministers to develop health education centers in Westchester, as I did at Convent. Convent was a pilot, and we hope to duplicate it around the country.

HEADLINE: X in Electricity Equation: a Non-LIPA Plant

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
THE promise of a Texas company to generate electricity on Long Island more efficiently, with less pollution and at lower cost is receiving generally positive reviews from the Long Island Power Authority and business leaders. Residents near the proposed site are more cautious.
The company, American National Power, wants to build a gas-fired power plant on a vacant 25-acre plot just south of the Long Island Expressway at Exit 66, in Yaphank. The facility, which could generate 580 megawatts of electricity, would be the first built on the Island by any company other than the local utility. Construction is proposed to begin next year, with completion in 2003. 
 "I think it's an exciting idea," said LIPA's chairman, Richard M. Kessel. "There is obviously a huge need for energy on Long Island, and if this plant was built, it might help us fill out the picture of how we would meet that demand."
The Brookhaven Town supervisor, Felix Grucci Jr., said the proposal "is in concert with what I have been requesting -- alternative and competitive power on Long Island that may bring lower electric rates to the town and all of Suffolk."
The electricity would be "significantly less expensive" than that generated by plants owned and operated by KeySpan Energy, according to Robert J. Charlebois, vice president of American National Power.
KeySpan is currently the only company on Long Island that generates electricity for LIPA. It was created in May 1998 when the Long Island Lighting Company was dissolved and LIPA assumed control of its electric transmission and distribution lines and KeySpan took control of its five power plants.
David J. Manning, senior vice president of KeySpan, acknowledged that "any new generating plant built today will use the most current gas-fired turbine technology." Keyspan's plants were initially oil-fired but were converted to allow them to burn primarily natural gas and now, Mr. Manning said, KeySpan is considering upgrading them.
Mitchell Palley, a vice president of the Long Island Association, said: "This proposal is what energy deregulation means -- the ability of private companies to come in, build power plants and sell electricity at less than current suppliers. If it meets community needs, it is something we would support."
Mr. Kessel noted that LIPA buys nearly all of its electricity from KeySpan. It is able to import no more than 1,200 megawatts of electricity through five connections with suppliers off the Island.
On a very hot day, energy demand can reach 4,200 to 4,300 megawatts. Last July 6, in the middle of a heat wave, the demand reached a record 4,590 megawatts. The system's maximum capacity is 5,100 megawatts.
Bert J. Cunningham, LIPA's vice president for communications, noted that demand had increased 3.5 to 4 percent annually in the last three or four years and that it is expected to continue that pace.
Mr. Kessel said that he had met with Mr. Charlebois and that LIPA is now discussing integrating the electricity generated at Yaphank into the utility's grid.
To help meet energy demands this summer, LIPA awarded KeySpan Energy Construction, a KeySpan subsidiary, a $67 million contract on Feb. 29 to string a 138-kilovolt cable from Riverhead to Southampton by June. Energy demand on the East End has been rising sharply because of housing construction there.
Mr. Cunningham also noted that the utility should be awarding contracts soon to companies that bid on a proposal to build two or three power plants that would generate a total of 225 megawatts of electricity. "The companies would build the plants at their own expense and sell the electricity to us exclusively," he said.
Another request for a proposal (R.F.P.), to lay a 600-megawatt cable under the Sound from New Haven to Shoreham, has been modified, he said, to reduce the initial capacity to 200 to 300 megawatts, but with the possibility of adding a second cable.
"We are looking for flexibility in bringing electricity from off the Island," Mr. Cunningham said. "We felt from the information we developed through the first R.F.P. process that it was better to look at different types of cable technologies and perhaps multiple cables."
Mr. Charlebois said his proposed plant would be a "viable alternative" to the cable. But Mr. Kessel pointed out that if the underwater cable were approved, it would be operational in 2002. The proposed power plant, even if it were built on time, would not be running until 2003.
A decision on the cable will be made by June, Mr. Kessel said. He added that he is confident that even if the cable project is approved, growing demand for power will make the American National Power project a necessity.
Mr. Charlebois put the cost of the Yaphank project, including the land, at about $300 million.
"One of the reasons we like this site is that the closest residence is about 2,000 feet away," he said. "The plant would be south of the Long Island Expressway at the intersection with Sills Road, and the majority of the homes are north of the expressway."
He noted that he has met with some civic leaders and will be sending letters to about 5,000 residents who live within two miles.
"We're interested at the end of the day in designing a project that is as satisfactory as possible," he said. "We are not going to go to areas where we are not welcome."
Connie Kepert, president of the Affiliated Brookhaven Civic Organizations, said that in her meeting with Mr. Charlebois, he promised to come back in the spring with more detailed information about the project's economic and environmental impact.
"It certainly is important to bring competition to Long Island as far as electricity is concerned," she said. "So this is a good thing. But we want to make sure that there are no environmental concerns that become a burden to the town. I know there will be an oil storage facility on the site and I'm concerned about water and air quality. I'd like to see a little more information."
Nanette Essel, co-president of the Yaphank Taxpayers and Civic Association, which represents the neighboring homeowners, raised those same concerns, saying: "It is premature to comment before we have seen all the facts. The devil is in the details and we haven't seen any, so we have to be cautious and wait."
In its literature, American National Power writes that the project would use "clean-burning natural gas, highly efficient electricity generating technology and cutting-edge pollution-control and water-minimization equipment.
"The plant will be designed to meet the Clean Air Act's 'lowest achievable emission rate' and 'best available control technology' standards," the statement continues. "Because of air-cooling technology used at the plant, the generation of a vapor plume will be almost nonexistent."
Mr. Charlebois said the plan calls for two smokestacks no higher than 180 feet. And he said the company would "maintain as much visual buffer as possible." He said also that there would be no odors and that the noise from the generator turbines would not be heard 2,000 feet away.
American National Power estimated that 700 jobs would be created for the construction of the power plant and that another 25 full-time operators would be needed once it is erected.
Supervisor Grucci said that in addition to creating jobs, the project would add millions to the tax base, with much of it going to the Longwood School District.
"At this point the proposal is in front of us, and when the plan becomes more real, the town will look at it," he said. "But it is very much in concert with what we trying to do."

HEADLINE: A Hiker's Dream, and Sobering Realities

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
TEN years ago, when talk began about a hiking trail that would traverse eastern Long Island, many hikers though it was some kind of joke.
"Everyone was so fixated on mountains back then," said Nancy Manfredonia, one of a handful of early trail visionaries. "People would say, 'What do you mean, hiking on Long Island?' " 
 This spring, 100 miles of winding pineland and coastal hiking trail, stretching from eastern Brookhaven to Montauk Point, is blazed and ready. The trail, called the Paumanok Path, is not continuous yet -- about 20 miles of gaps remain in Southampton -- but the gaps are fewer than ever before, and hikers are not waiting for completion to lace up their boots.
The Paumanok Path is possible only because of major public land acquisitions over the past 30 years, thousands of hours of volunteer work and help from government agencies.
But as it beckons to more hikers, the path is facing onslaughts from a growing number of illegally operated all-terrain vehicles, called A.T.V.'s or quads, and from dirt bikes that tear up fragile trails and shatter the stillness of the woods. And east of the Shinnecock Canal in Southampton, trailblazers trying to fill in the remaining gaps are confounded by a paucity of public land and heavy development pressure that is rapidly consuming remaining open spaces.
Even with the gaps, the path is impressive. From its beginning in Rocky Point it winds through the core of the 100,000-acre Long Island Pine Barrens Preserve and then picks its way eastward through parks and private lands. On the way it passes pitch pines, globally rare dwarf pines, hardwood forests, glacial hills and kettleholes, a maple swamp, freshwater wetlands, grasslands, beaches and bluffs -- some of the most beautiful and environmentally significant lands left on Long Island.
"I see the Paumanok Path as a strand of DNA strewn across dozens of communities," said Tom Stock, a writer, naturalist and retired school teacher from Smithtown who helped blaze the path. "This trail is spectacular. It is the barometer for changing attitudes toward the Long Island environment."
Some trail sections skirt backyards or follow roads. But others are surprisingly remote, beyond earshot of road noise and out of sight of houses, power lines or any sign of civilization. White trail markers painted on trees at close intervals keep hikers from getting lost.
No overnight camping is permitted, so the path must be seen one day-hike at a time, though campsites may be added later. But the main thing lacking is more hikers.
"People just don't know about it yet," said Ms. Manfredonia, president of the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference, the principal organization of trails volunteers. "It's still kind of a little secret. Yet we have some of the most spectacular scenery in the world here."
"When you get to Montauk and look out over the ocean on one side and the bay on the other, it is just breathtaking," she said. "I'll take it over a mountaintop any day."
Kenneth Kindler of Mount Sinai, a retired businessman who works full-time on trails, said a Paumanok Path celebration in June he is promoting will bring out hikers and show them where and how to get on the path.
"People don't know how to go about accessing it," Mr. Kindler said. "You could be talking about the Amazon." He maintains a web site (www.hike-li.com) offering trail information.
The trail is also attracting uninvited guests -- the all-terrain vehicle and dirt bike riders. Even though it is illegal to operate the vehicles anywhere but on private land with the owner's permission, A.T.V. riders are ripping up trails and sometimes clashing with hikers.
"These people ignore our postings and ride wherever their machines will go," said William F. Peters, chief of the Suffolk County Park Police. "And right now we are losing the battle against them."
George Fernandez of Ridge, an illustrator and college art teacher who organizes volunteers for trail cleanup and repair, said A.T.V.'s ruin a trail in a hurry.
"They go into areas where there are hills and just tear up them up," he said. "Where there was a trail, they create these gullies three feet deep. It's unbelievable how much damage they do."
Because the Paumanok Path and other trails run through different jurisdictions, law enforcement is coordinated by an 18-agency council, said Lawrence J. Hynes, the council chairman and also director of public safety for Suffolk parks. Mr. Hynes said the council regularly fielded enforcement teams that confiscated A.T.V.'s and dirt bikes in areas where they had been reported.
Under a county law, owners pay a $250 fee, or $500 for a second offense, to get the vehicles back.
But despite enforcement efforts, trail users say that the A.T.V.'s rule some sections of the trail, and that the riders resent the presence of hikers.
"It's like the Wild West out there," said Eric Burke of Ridge, who lives near the path. "You see these little kids, 8 or 9 years old, flying at you on a quad."
While state motor vehicle law bars drivers under 16 years of age, the provision is largely ignored among A.T.V. riders.
Mr. Burke said he has been confronted several times by A.T.V. operators yelling at him to get out of their way. One antagonist, he said, turned out to be his new neighbor.
Mr. Burke said that when he went next door to tell the neighbor that A.T.V.'s were illegal in the woods, the man became enraged and hit him with a crowbar. After treatment for a pelvic injury, he filed assault charges.
While that run-in is an extreme example of the tensions in the woods, there have been other incidents. Mr. Hynes said hikers can call a pine barrens hotline, 1-877-BARRENS, to report illegal riders. "People should not get physically involved," he said. "We ask them to call the hotline number and then let the officers do their job."
Chief Peters of the Park Police said that more than 300 summonses were issued to riders last year. But Mr. Burke said his calls to the Suffolk police had been in vain. "They won't go in there," he said. "I don't even bother to call them anymore."
A statewide group representing A.T.V. users, the New York State Off-Highway Recreational Vehicle Association, is seeking state support for special A.T.V. trails upstate, where legal riding is now limited to designated areas in two state forests.
"I know there is a real problem on Long Island for people who own A.T.V.'s," said Alex Ernst of Ravena, the group's communications director. "The economy is good so they can afford these toys, but then there is no place to use them."
Registration figures for 1997, the most recent year available, showed that combined registrations of 1,568 A.T.V.'s in Suffolk and 703 in Nassau were second only to St. Lawrence County in northern New York.
But Mr. Ernst estimated there are about 14,000 A.T.V.'s in use on Long Island. A.T.V. buyers are supposed to register the vehicles but it is widely acknowledged that many do not, and dealers are not required to assure registration before the vehicles leave the showroom.
"The attraction, in a word, is fun," Mr. Ernst said. "It's a quick, exciting way of getting around in places that you don't normally get to see from the highway."
Hikers cringe at such descriptions. "People can't just destroy woodlands because they want to have fun," said Ms. Manfredonia of the trails conference.
She said that A.T.V. dealers on Long Island don't tell buyers that the vehicles can only be used by permission on private land. "The dealers are not going to do anything to jeopardize a sale," Ms. Manfredonia said.
At an A.T.V. dealership in Riverhead, a salesman who was asked where the vehicles could be used answered, "Anywhere there's not a road." But at a dealership in Port Jefferson, a salesman gave correct information.
Some hikers question why the state Department of Environmental Conservation requires permits for use of its Long Island lands. The permits are free, but require an application by mail.
Mark Lowery, a spokesman for the Long Island regional office of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said hiking permits are required because of the large number of people using the Long Island properties.
"We have some more specific regulations there than for other pieces of property," he said. "And the permit gives the department the opportunity to put the regulations in the hands of each permittee rather than just posting them."
Ms. Manfredonia said the department didn't require hikers to get permits in other parts of the state and shouldn't require them on Long Island. "It's very difficult for people who are visiting," she said.
But the trailblazers' emphasis is on linking the western and eastern portions of the Paumanok Path.
Steven Biasetti, an environmental analyst at the Group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton, said closing trail gaps of 15 to 20 miles east of the Shinnecock Canal in the Town of Southampton will be difficult. He said private property owners are reluctant to permit trail corridors because of concerns about liability, or in some cases for fear of lost privacy.
A town trails advisory board, of which Mr. Biasetti is a member, springs into action when subdivisions are proposed. If the property has trail potential, the board asks town officials to add trail corridors to the development plans.
The results have sometimes been disappointing. At the disputed Parrish Ponds subdivision, a housing development that the Shinnecock Indian nation claims as ancestral land, the trail corridor is only 10 feet wide and passes near housing lots.
"We try to get a 50-foot-wide easement because otherwise it's just like walking through back yards," said Dai Dayton, president of the Southampton Trails Preservation Society.
Ms. Dayton was not optimistic about closing the gaps. "It is going to be quite difficult in some places," she said. "We may have to road-walk a little bit. But what's in place is very beautiful."
Ms. Manfredonia said the lack of parks and publicly owned lands in Southampton east of the canal complicated the task. "We are lucky on Long Island because we have a great deal of publicly owned land, but very little of it is in Southampton," she said. "So we will need little successes here and there in getting easements."
In East Hampton, the final leg of the Paumanok Path was completed in 1998 and now extends 46 miles from the town's western border to Montauk Point.
Richard M. Lupoletti of East Hampton, a retired school librarian and former president of the East Hampton Trails Preservation Society, said that last year volunteer trail guides conducted 150 free hikes on the East Hampton trails that attracted more than 4,000 people.
Trails in the two Hamptons are generally opened to hiking, horseback riding and, with some restrictions, mountain bikes. Horseback riders who had long ridden the trails were at the core of trail preservation efforts.
A.T.V.'s have left their mark on trails in both towns. "We're alert to the problem and we call the police when we see them," said Mr. Lupoletti. "But it's not stopping us from enjoying our trails."
Mr. Fernandez, a frequent witness to torn-up trails and gouged-out gullies A.T.V.s leave in their wake on trails to the west, said the worst was yet to come on eastern sections. "Out in the Hamptons, their problems are just starting," he said.
Information for the Paumanok Path and other trails is available at the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference office in Smithtown (631) 360-0753. A trail information office on Route 111 in Manorville north of exit 70 reopens on April 15.
Permit applications for state-owned lands are available from the state Department of Environmental Conservation at (631) 444-0273. The address is the Sporting License Office, SUNY Building 40, Stony Brook, N.Y. 11790-2356. The three-year permit comes with trail maps.
 
Gimme a P! Gimme an A!
Paumanok, an Indian name for eastern Long Island, probably means "land of tribute." It first appeared in written form in deeds conveying land from Montauk chiefs to East Hampton settlers.
William Wallace Tooker of Sag Harbor, an authority on Indian place-names on Long Island, said in a book published in 1911 that he encountered the word in a deed for Gardiners Island dated 1639, and in many other later deeds.
 "This part of Long Island," Tooker wrote, "was under tribute at this period and previous both to the Pequots and to the whites." A more contemporary description of "under tribute" would be that the Montauks were paying both Pequots -- the Connecticut tribe that now runs the Foxwoods casion -- and settlers for protection, in shells and land.
The many spellings include Paumanack, Pommanock, Pamunke, Pammanach, Pawmanuck, Pammanake, Paumanuck, Paumanacke and Paumanhacky.
The current spelling comes from Walt Whitman in his 1860 poem "Starting from Paumanok," part of "Leaves of Grass." It begins:
Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,
well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother, . . .
"That poem is what really made the word famous," said Roger Wunderlich, a professor at SUNY-Stony Brook and editor of the Long Island Historical Journal. JOHN RATHER

HEADLINE: A Touch of Gray Is No Barrier To a Job Today

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
NO one else but seniors would take this job," said Theresa Delaurentis, a representative of REH Marketing, who gets paid $8 an hour to travel to supermarkets throughout the Island and ask shoppers to sample different products. On a recent afternoon at Pathmark in Woodbury, Ms. Delaurentis, a Bethpage resident who acknowledged only that she is over 65, was offering graham crackers to customers as they shopped.
"For me, it's better than sitting at home," Ms. Delaurentis said. "Working is a way to get out and meet people." 
 Another sample-distributor, Mary Kaiser of Syosset, agreed, saying, "I do it both for the money and because it's a social job." She makes $7.70 an hour and works about 22 hours a week.
The spread of seniors in the work force is a new phenomenon, said Pearl Kamer, chief economist of the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group. Although there are no numbers on seniors returning to work in unskilled positions, the anecdotal evidence is strong, she said.
The labor crunch has left many positions in supermarkets, drug stores, fast food chains, bus and taxi companies and retail stores unfilled, Dr. Kamer added, a shortage that has become as acute as that in the skilled and high-tech areas. Unemployment in Nassau was 2.6 percent in December and in Suffolk it was 3.2 percent -- both figures well below the statewide rate of 4.5 percent.
As the pool of candidates for entry-level jobs has shrunk, the faces that were once primarily those of 17- and 18-year-olds are now often of men and women over 60.
"We've never before seen such early retirements," Dr. Kamer said. "In the past, people usually worked until they were 65. But today, many people are retiring in their 50's, and either because of economic need or because they are bored and want contact with the world, they are returning to work.
"I'd say that in this high-cost area, 90 percent of the time there's an economic need to supplement a pension or Social Security."
For Ronald Strasfeld, 69, who works at Edwards in Woodbury, the motivation to get a part-time job was twofold.
"I was bored, and I needed the income," said Mr. Strasfeld, a Syosset resident who for the past year has been greeting shoppers at the store's entrance with a hot-dog cart and a smile. "I retired at 62, after years as a successful textile salesman, and stayed home until last year. Then I lost some money in the stock market and started fighting with my wife because there was too much togetherness. I came to Edwards on a lark, and they hired me."
Mr. Strasfeld now works 25 hours a week, making $7 an hour.
"Like most middle-class people in today's economy, it's impossible to live on my pension, Social Security and savings," he said. "With my rent at $1,600 a month, a new car and high taxes, I need to supplement my income to make ends meet."
Recruitment of older workers has been accelerated by a decline in the number of students available to work, Dr. Kamer said.
"It used to be that if you needed a hamburger-flipper or a cashier, young people who needed money for high school or college were there to fill the jobs," she said. "But as the population on Long Island is aging, there are fewer people in the under-20 category.
"And those students we have are far more sophisticated. They want to pursue jobs that will in some way benefit them in a career. Many are even willing to take unpaid internships in a field of their interest. That automatically cuts out one source of our labor."
Charlie Rex, manager of King Kullen in Syosset, said: "The help shortage is a terrible situation. We are having so much trouble finding and keeping workers. We're looking for anyone -- old or young, it doesn't matter."
Cari Lap, manager of Yogurteria in Syosset, agreed: "We're desperate for help. It's become impossible to find people willing to work for $6 an hour."
Eddie Lasneski, a familiar face at CVS in Syosset, was originally hired to keep commuters from leaving their cars in the CVS parking lot all day.
"I saw a sign on the door, went in and got hired the same day," said the 67-year-old Woodbury resident, who works to supplement his Social Security and two small retirement pensions from years in the fur trade and at Grumman. "I immediately became a Jekyll and Hyde, because while I was in the parking lot chasing people away, I began on my own to greet people as they came into the store. Then once the parking problem was under control, they asked me to stay and work full time in the store. Being a senior carries some weight, out of respect for my age."
While Mr. Lasneski has thought about selling his house and moving from the high-cost Island, his wife does not want to leave her relatives, he said, adding, "I don't want to stop working yet, but I would like to smell the coffee a little more."
In this healthy economy, more options have opened for older people who want to work part time, said Gary Huth, a labor analyst for the New York State Labor Department.
"Any time you have an extended period of low unemployment rates, the effects on the job market include a labor shortage," he said. "In 1991, there was no problem filling every retail job because so many people were out of work. We had stories of engineers working at Home Depot. Companies could afford to be more selective and expect their employees to have higher skills.
"But today, even people without skills have other options aside from entry level or retail, and many of those same companies are able and willing to spend time training these people to upgrade their skills. Consequently, someone whose horizons were formerly limited to a job at a fast-food restaurant now has other options. That leaves the fast-food place with fewer people to choose from."
There are now 218,000 retail jobs on the Island, and seniors are filling many of the vacant positions, Mr. Huth said, adding, "Businesses that previously overlooked the capability of older people have been pleasantly surprised."
For the last six years, Helen Ullman has been a saleswoman at Protass, a luggage, handbag and gift shop in Woodbury Commons. "This job keeps me going," said Ms. Ullman, 66, who commutes from Massapequa Park. "I love the social aspects and working with the customers, but the bottom line is that I need the income. It's not always easy juggling a job, then trying to help my daughter out, taking care of my grandchildren."
At the Island's 13 Home Depots, more seniors are filling jobs, said John Simley, a company spokesman.
"In many cases, it's a natural fit," he said. "What do you do if you've been a bricklayer and you're now 65? You can't still lift bricks, but a job at Home Depot can help maintain a sense of self-worth."
For 72-year-old Marvin Grotell of Jericho, who retired seven years ago as a dental technician, a part-time job at his local Home Depot, one mile from home, is more fun than work, he said. Mr. Grotell, who was hired as a salesperson and horticulturist, works three days a week for $11.50 an hour, unloading and displaying plants.
"I do this because I love it," said Mr. Grotell, who has a degree in botany. "When I'm not working with the plants at Home Depot, I'm usually either in my own greenhouse or at Old Westbury Gardens, where I'm a volunteer gardener."
Efforts to recruit school-bus drivers have also been increasingly answered by seniors, said Barbara Drexler, manager of Hendrickson Bus Company, based in Bayville.
"With this economy, it's been harder to find drivers, despite the salaries that are well above minimum wage," she said. (The pay is $11 an hour for driving a small bus, $13 an hour for a big bus.) "A large percentage of our drivers are now retirees who may have retired early and want to work part time, make decent money and still have time to pursue other activities."
Recruitment efforts are reflected in signs on almost every supermarket, drug store, fast-food chain and super-store, many of which list employee benefits right on the "help wanted" posters. And some companies have taken further steps.
At King Kullen, in addition to advertising in the local Pennysaver and inserting a message about accepting job applications on every cash register receipt, management has contacted the local high schools. "We call the guidance office every week, looking for kids to work here," Mr. Rex said.
Grand Union, which has five Long Island stores, recently sent a mailing directed at homemakers, students and seniors with a job application form attached. CVS managers have been attending senior job fairs and working with county and local agencies related to senior citizens.
But high schools have not been a very fruitful place to look, particularly in more affluent areas. "Many of the kids around here just don't need to work," said Steve McGuiness, assistant manager of Edwards in Woodbury, where the pay starts at $6.50 an hour.
Ms. Lap, at Yogurteria, has a similar problem. "When kids come in to apply for a job, they want to make their own hours and tell us exactly what they're willing to do," she said. "If I tell them that the job includes mopping and sweeping, they look at me like I'm crazy."
One of the biggest problems, Mr. Rex said, is a lack of employee loyalty. "People bounce around from one job to another, because they may get $1 more at one job, 50 cents more at another."
But in contrast to the fickle youth, seniors are far more reliable, Mr. McGuiness said.
One of the longest-working employees at Edwards is Catherine Fiore, 73, a cashier who works about 25 hours a week for $13 an hour and has been commuting to Woodbury from New Hyde Park for the last 29 years.
"It gives me something to do," said Ms. Fiore. "And I really enjoy the people."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Redwood Curtain' on Stage in Croton Falls

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: CROTON FALLS

 BODY:
ON the streets of Arcata, a lumber town in Northern California, the playwright Lanford Wilson was startled by living ghosts, hovering in the light of day. "They just stared at me," he recalled in a conversation last October when his newest play, "Book of Days," was in previews at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut.
In New York, the lost silent men might be dismissively called bag men, those faceless street people blended into the contemporary urban landscape, no longer cluttering it, just taken for granted, passed over, even stepped over. 
 In Arcata such vagrants were also disregarded, but the playwright could not shut his eyes. Ever the investigator with the soul, and the gift, of a poet, Mr. Wilson became obsessed with this strange breed, abandoned by society. "The whole town was boiling over with them," he said, and he searched for their stories.
And he identified "them" as Vietnam veterans, which means all their different stories added up to one story, that of a country's shame.
Mr. Wilson talked of the "train walk." Sometimes "they walked down to the tracks onto the oncoming trains," he said. "Since Vietnam 30,000 committed suicide, and there are still over 100 groups around the country who get together to talk about their experiences."
So you thought it was all over. In Arcata, these men lived in the redwoods, and the playwright discovered that the West Coast "was littered with the debris of Vietnam." A master storyteller, Mr. Wilson created one in terms of a fable that would serve as a wake-up call for a forgetful America in 1993. That was the year his play, "Redwood Curtain," opened on Broadway after tryouts in Seattle, Philadelphia and San Diego, and that was just another year in the death of the serious new play on Broadway. "Redwood Curtain" lasted about a month.
In Seattle in 1991, "Redwood Curtain," an intimate play with three characters and lots of big trees, was envisioned as a candidate for Broadway, where it was produced at a cost of just under $1 million, but Mr. Wilson said then, "We'll do it somewhere smaller Off Broadway, and that will be just fine."
At the Schoolhouse here, very small and way Off Broadway, the playwright's alternative is realized, though it is not just fine. On Broadway, the original setting by John Lee Beatty was so monumental it became the play's fourth character without overwhelming it. The towering scenic design was not only a creation of theater art but also as much a visualization of the play's enchantment, exemplified by setting and by the character of the 17-year-old piano prodigy Geri, who is imbued with the gifts of her "very magical culture" (Vietnam) as of the environmental concerns expressed by Geneva, Geri's aunt, caustic social observer and heiress to a family lumber business, which has been overtaken by raiders of the endangered land.
Anyone who is familiar with the works of Mr. Wilson, one of the foremost lyric voices of our time, knows that his plays are far reaching (the cycle of Talley plays, including "Fifth of July"), structurally complex, sometimes just plot heavy and issue oriented.
"Redwood Curtain" is especially fierce to pull off; it is verbose, fusing mystical and very real elements into statements about a country's denial and the redeeming, healing power of music. It winds up with a cathartic musical coda by Erik Satie, a quiet moment of compassion and affirmation, but it's a long pull to get there; 100 intermissionless minutes, that is.
In its original staging, Mr. Beatty's enchanted forest and the performances of Debra Monk, who won a Tony for best featured actress, as Geneva, and Jeff Daniels as Lyman, recluse of the redwoods, justified the production's size artistically, if not economically.
In Lisa Milinazzo's staging at the Schoolhouse, the play's intrinsic sweep is not released from the captivity of its verbiage. In the most difficult role, Ann Hu as Geri is entrapped by the playwright's expository details and the character's precociousness.
Bostin Christopher is a one-note Lyman, the hostile castoff who Geri thinks may be her father. "I don't want people talking to me," he protests. "I don't know how to be with people." "Come home," the searching girl implores. "Don't you know you're a hero?"
Mr. Wilson makes it clear that Lyman represents the wandering, not the homeless, men who are scavengers, eating out of garbage pails, as they did in Vietnam. That's why they come to the forest.
"Army men are trained at great expense to be homicidal," Geneva observes. "My own brother came back a wacko." Yet, Geneva's sharp lines and off-center comic character just lie there, unseized by the actress Ellen David.
Mr. Wilson did not write yet another post-traumatic Vietnam shock play or, for that matter, one about identity crisis. He's too hip for that. As Geneva observes about Geri's relentless quest for finding not only her ancestry but also herself: "I thought we were finished with that in the 60's." His play is about family and memory -- short term, selective or buried. It is about being set free, individually and collectively. And spiritually.
Given the duality of "Redwood Curtain" -- a worldly, moralistic purpose and an other-worldly aura -- the play is a killer by practical standards. Mr. Wilson's apparently unreasonable stage directions were outmaneuvered by a television adaptation in 1995, in which Geri's adoptive father and his wife were written in. Yet, somehow the play was diminished by being so expanded. It is no surprise that an enterprising theater with a mind of its own has taken on a daunting task, a mission improbable.
"Redwood Curtain" by Langford Wilson at the Schoolhouse on Owens Road off Route 22. Performances through next Sunday. Box office: 277-8477.

HEADLINE: Learning the Lessons That Floyd Left Behind

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WHAT lessons can be learned from Tropical Storm Floyd, a weather event so rare that it will not likely occur again for centuries?
A climate historian, Dr. Jerome S. Thaler, described Floyd as a "300-year storm," and Gov. George E. Pataki described it as a "200-year" event. And while some officials might reason that one can never be adequately prepared for such unusual disasters, Liam Murphy, the county's Director of Emergency Services, thinks otherwise. 
 As Mr. Murphy observed last week, the hard financial fact is that the damage from the storm cost municipalities and school districts in the county more than $13.5 million, according to the federal government. Arguing that the county is regularly hit by northeasters and other extreme weather, Mr. Murphy said no one can afford to forget the lessons from the devastation that Floyd left behind. "And that lesson is to be better prepared next time," he said. "The cost has been heavy."
The village of Ossining was hardest hit, with damage estimates of $1.3 million. Yorktown was next at $922,585; Yorktown Central School District incurred $728,796 in damage. Peekskill reported losses of $672,857. And Westchester's parks had $801,146 in damage.
"We're looking not to just fix things to the way they were, but to fix them so they won't break again," Mr. Murphy said. He cited the Saw Mill River, which he said stayed within its banks only in places where the Army Corps of Engineers had taken long-range storm-control measures like reinforcing the banks, grading and providing proper drainage. For example, the river did not overflow in Ardsley, where work had been completed to remedy past problems that allowed the river to flood the adjacent Saw Mill River Parkway, and in the process, strand cars. By contrast in Elmsford and parts of Greenburgh, where no reinforcement of banks have been done, residents witnessed heavy flooding, Mr. Murphy said.
To pay for storm restoration work, the county is also using $827,000 in federal Job Training Partnership Act funds. The county has hired 55 people who had been unemployed for 15 months or longer and is paying them $9.25 an hour. The workers are also eligible for long-term job training and career placement services.
So far, the new employees have cleared downed trees and branches, repaired pipes, bridges and roadways at 18 county parks, including Wilson Woods, Glen Island and Saxon Woods, and in municipalities like Ossining and Peekskill.
In Ossining, much of the early work focused on reopening roads and getting people back to work.
Even with all that out of the way, Lynn McCrum, director of community development in the village, said that problems remain. "Some residents' backyards are still a mess," he said, and road repair work and stream clearing continues. But he said that, according to federal government estimates, it often takes municipalities 30 months to return to normal after a storm.
Heeding the harsh lessons that Floyd delivered, many municipalities, like Mount Kisco, are taking stock of their resources and their ability to handle future disasters. The village's commercial area was hard hit by flooding, with about 10 stores closing in the storm's aftermath. And although most reopened quickly, two had major damage and were shut for several months.
"Even though we're not supposed to get another storm like this for 100 years, we're developing a plan now to deal with the next emergency, whenever that occurs," Mayor Patricia M. Reilly said. "We can get hit by hurricanes, tornadoes and other things, and we should know who is in charge of what and how we plan to evacuate people if that becomes necessary."
While governments prepare, homeowners would be wise to do the same, Mr. Murphy said. All households should be prepared to survive three or four days by laying in extra supplies of water, nonperishable food, which does not need to be cooked before eating; blankets and alternative sources of heat. "Why go to a shelter if you don't have to?" he said.

A Master Storyteller's Post-Vietnam Tale

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

ON the streets of Arcata, a lumber town in northern California, the playwright Lanford Wilson was startled by living ghosts.

 Mr. Wilson described what he called the "train walk." Sometimes "they walked down to the tracks into the oncoming trains," he said. "Since Vietnam, 30,000 committed suicide, and there are still over 100 groups around the country who get together to talk about their experiences."
In Arcata the men lived in the redwoods and the playwright also discovered that they were elsewhere in the region. "The West Coast was littered with the debris of Vietnam," Mr. Wilson said. A master storyteller, he created a fable for a forgetful America in 1993. That was the year "Redwood Curtain" opened on Broadway (after tryouts in Seattle, Philadelphia and San Diego) and lasted for 11 previews and 40 performances.
In Seattle in 1991, "Redwood Curtain," an intimate work with three characters and lots of big trees, had been envisioned as a play for Broadway, but Mr. Wilson said "we'll do it somewhere smaller, Off Broadway, and that will be just fine."
At the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls, N.Y., very small and way Off Broadway, the playwright's alternative is realized, though it is not just fine.
On Broadway the original setting by John Lee Beatty was so monumental that it became the play's fourth character. The towering scenic design was not only a creation of theater art but also a visualization of the play's enchantment. A 17-year-old piano prodigy, Geri, is imbued with the gifts of her Vietnamese culture. Geneva, Geri's adoptive aunt, is a caustic social observer and heiress to a family lumber business that has been overtaken by raiders of the endangered land. The third character is Lyman, a recluse of the redwoods.
Mr. Wilson's works are far reaching (the Talley plays including "Fifth of July"), structurally complex, sometimes just plot heavy and issue oriented.
"Redwood Curtain" is especially fierce as well as verbose, fusing mystical and very real elements into statements about a country's denial and the healing power of music. The play concludes with a cathartic coda by Satie, a quiet moment of compassion and affirmation, but it is a long pull -- 100 intermissionless minutes -- to get there.
In its original staging, Mr. Beatty's enchanted forest and the performances of Debra Monk, who won a Tony as Geneva, and Jeff Daniels as Lyman, justified the production's size artistically, if not economically. In Lisa Milinazzo's staging at the Schoolhouse, the play's intrinsic sweep is not released from the captivity of its verbiage.
In the play's most difficult role (Geri), Ann Hu is entrapped by the playwright's expository details and the character's precociousness. Bostin Christopher is a one-note Lyman, the castoff Geri thinks may be her father. And Geneva's sharp lines and off-center comic character just lie there, unseized by Ellen David.
Mr. Wilson did not write yet another post-traumatic Vietnam play or, for that matter, one about identity crisis. He's too hip for that. As Geneva observes about Geri's relentless quest for finding herself: "I thought we were finished with that in the 60's." His play is about family and memory, short term, selective or buried. It is about being set free, individually and collectively as well as spiritually.
Given the duality of "Redwood Curtain" -- worldly and moralistic purpose, other worldly aura -- the play is a killer by practical standards. Mr. Wilson's apparently unreasonable stage directions were outmaneuvered by a television adaptation in 1995, in which Geri's adoptive parents were written in. Somehow the play was diminished by being so expanded. It is no surprise that an enterprising theater with a mind of its own has taken on a daunting task, a mission improbable.
"Redwood Curtain," The Schoolhouse, Owens Road (off Route 22), Croton Falls, N.Y. (914) 277-8477. Performances through next Sunday.

HEADLINE: The Internet May Be Virtual, But the Jobs It Brings Are Real;
Hundreds of Companies Have Moved In. The Trick Is to Keep Them Here.

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE

 BODY:
NEUVIS INC. is one of those shooting star companies specializing in Internet e-commerce business that everyone is talking about. Started last August, the Shelton software company has grown from six employees to more than 200 in half a year.
Sirocco Systems in Wallingford is another. The company, which produces computer hardware and software for communications networks, had four employees in January 1999; now it has 85. 
 The two companies are among hundreds that have sprung up with dizzying suddenness in the software information technology industry, one of the fastest growing parts of Connecticut's economy, and government and economic development leaders want to see more of them.
Mark Prisloe, an economist with the State Department of Economic and Community Development, said information technology revenues are expected to rise from $108 million in 1998 to $1.14 billion in 2003, when the industry will account for 2.5 percent of the state's overall business sales.
"It at least matches the tourism business in terms of gross state product," he said.
Most of the companies are clustered in Fairfield and New Haven counties, extending along the Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways to Wallingford. There is also a modest group of companies in the outer ring suburbs of Hartford.
The state economic department said that since 1994 information technology companies have had employment growth of 20 percent. That growth is more than three times as fast as the rest of the state's nonfarm economy. Information technology stood at 73,558 jobs as of the first quarter of 1999, out of a total 1.7 million nonfarm jobs. These technology jobs pay on the average $68,146, compared to the $40,926 for the state as a whole.
"I never thought that you'd see Connecticut as a hotbed for e-commerce," Joseph McGee, vice president of public policy and programs for the Southwest Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford.
Although there are Internet companies around the state, Fairfield County is becoming the hub. Mr. McGee said about half of the 610 Internet technology companies in Connecticut are located in Fairfield County. He said it was because the county is richly endowed with the assets that make Connecticut attractive for software and information technology companies.
Priceline.com of Norwalk, which runs the Internet site where consumers name their own price for a variety of goods, is probably the most well-known of the state's Internet companies. It has 337 employees and expects to do about $1 billion of business this year.
"This is a company that could not have existed except on the Internet," said Brian Ek, vice president for corporate communications.
Mr. Ek said the two most important reasons why the company is located in Fairfield County is to be near the railroad and interstate highway so employees can commute from throughout the region, thus expanding its reach for technical talent, and because its chief executive, Jay Walker, is from Fairfield County.
Being near the New York airports also helps. "Access to a major airport, I can tell you that was a major factor for us to move to Stamford rather than farther up the line," said Dale Kutnick, chief executive of the META Group, a market consulting company specializing in the information technology industry.
Mr. Kutnick noted that Connecticut also has good schools, and rich cultural and recreational activities, and the state is a lovely place to live.
"A lot of people are shocked at how bucolic Connecticut is once you get outside the cities," he said.
He predicted that teleconferencing technology will make it increasingly unimportant for a company to be located in or near a city. He said some senior employees perform 40 percent of their work at home. This will make it easier for Connecticut to exploit its affordability, compared with more expensive centers of technology commerce like Silicon Valley.
"High tech is spreading. For affordability reasons it's easier to start a company in Connecticut," Mr. Kutnick said.
But the growth in information technology industry has created the same problem that other states in the region have experienced: finding enough high-tech workers to fill all the new jobs that are being created and keeping them here.
"I've had people who have accepted job offers and never shown up for work because they had other job offers," said Keith Reynolds, chief executive of a new company, Chatbroker.com, that is producing specialized customer service Internet software.
State Senator George C. Jepsen of Stamford said between 5,000 to 6,000 information technology industry jobs are unfilled just in Fairfield County. He said the state must entice high-tech talent to move here and develop more homegrown talent and keeping it in the state.
Last October, the state government formed a Software and Information Technology Cluster Initiative, administered by the Connecticut Technology Council, an industry association. The plan is to improve the competitiveness of software and information technology businesses in the state by having them share marketing expertise and work with government, educational and economic development organizations to identify their needs, such as for skilled workers and office space.
At a conference in Stamford last month, Gov. John G. Rowland, Mr. Jepsen and other state government officials met with software and information technology entrepreneurs and heard proposals to help improve the business climate for their industry. From those ideas legislative leaders drafted a bill, approved at a joint hearing on March 3 of the Education and Commerce committees, which includes paying the educational or moving costs for some computer employees who agree to work in Connecticut for five years, similar to how other states create incentives to recruit teachers for urban schools or doctors for rural areas.
The bill would also authorize the creation of special business zones where the state may help develop "smart buildings" that have the sophisticated wiring needed for Internet-related businesses, provisions for state colleges to enter into agreements with companies for training and business development purposes, and would allow the faculty of state colleges more flexibility for moonlighting to persuade them to remain teaching instead of quitting to take lucrative Internet-business positions.
Mr. Jepsen said skilled employees are the most important need of the new technology companies.
"Connecticut has, on a per capita basis, a very highly trained work force, but we need more of those workers," he said.
In fact, when Priceline.com looked for a new location, having had to move out of Stamford because of that city's shortage of commercial space, it chose a building close to Norwalk Community and Technical College expecting to create a relationship with the college and hire its graduates, Mr. Jepsen said.
"We're hearing numbers like 50,000 workers are going to be needed in the next five years" in Internet-related businesses in Connecticut, said Jeffrey Cantor, dean of extended studies and work force education at the Norwalk College.
Mr. Cantor said the college has signed agreements with several technology companies to provide specialized training for employees in networking technologies and software development, and is expanding course offerings in those areas.
While Connecticut has its share of people with computer expertise, that isn't the whole reason for the state's success. Instead, entrepreneurs mentioned its wealth in experienced marketing and managerial executives, its location near several international airports, its financial services and venture capital investors, and its quality of life as other important factors.
The fact that there are already many companies engaged in e-commerce, software development, and information technology creates a talent pool for each new venture.
"There's something of a critical mass building," said Will McEachern, editor of The Connecticut Economy, a quarterly journal published at the University of Connecticut that follows the state's economy.
"If you look under the covers of many of these companies you will find a lot of people who started other companies," said Connie Galley, president and chief executive of Mercator Software in Wilton, whichproduces software that allows other computer programs to work with each other.
"There's a history of R and D companies in this area," observed Arum Gupta, the software entrepreneur who started NeuVis Inc., which makes software for companies that want to sell their products on the Internet. "I think some of the people who work for them have decided to take the jump and start up."
Mr. Jepsen, however, noted that the state had a problem in attracting young men and women with technology skills: it isn't cool. He said the state has more of a country squire image than of a hip, urban lifestyle, and it will have to change its image by providing more night life if it wants to attract and keep recent university graduates.
Another need is for technology incubators. These are start-up campuses, buildings that are wired for fast Internet connections and laid out like lofts, where the high-tech companies can swap ideas and work together at a reasonable cost.
"There's a lot of ideas that are being brainstormed and discussed," he said. "We have to act quickly because speed is a real hallmark of the Internet business."
Ms. Galley noted that the conference in Stamford sent that message to officials who attended. "What I think everyone took home was how fast we have to move, how fast we have to make decisions."

HEADLINE: J.F.K. Enters the Era of the Megaterminal

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
AFTER years of failed promises and false starts, it seems that there is a tunnel at the end of the tunnel at Kennedy International Airport.
The tunnel in question will run out to a new kind of building at Kennedy: a midfield concourse that will substantially add to the capacity of Terminal 8, a 57-gate giant for American Airlines that will dwarf its predecessors. In January, workers began disentangling utility lines around the 107-acre site, setting the stage for a seven-year, $1.3 billion construction project. 
 Across the field, in mid-February, the first passengers arrived at the west concourse of the new International Air Terminal. The structural framework of its departures and retail hall -- so vast that Union Square Park could fit under the gently bowed roof -- was topped off three weeks later. And all around these construction sites, looking (and sprouting) like mushrooms, are 326 columns for the AirTrain light-rail system that will link the terminals to one another and to mass transit stations in Queens.
Though Kennedy is still saddled with a well-earned reputation as one of the least hospitable of the world's transportation hubs, the early results of its $9 billion makeover have become remarkably visible.
None of this will untangle the politics. The Giuliani administration wants to wrest control of Kennedy from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport on a lease from the city, as it has since opening day in 1948. The authority says it has no intention of giving up control.
But the squabbling has not visibly impeded the first significant transformation of the airport since the Eisenhower era, when Terminal City took form, giving each airline its own distinctive architectural presence, rather like a collection of World's Fair pavilions. "They had their logic, and they had their time," said Barry Abramowitz, the assistant director of the aviation capital program at the Port Authority. "We're now past that."
In their place will rise a ring of megaterminals, diaphanous arenas with airfoil roof lines, connected to parking garages and the elevated AirTrain stations.
Terminal 1 opened in 1998 and now serves 11 airlines. It will be eclipsed next year by the International Air Terminal, Terminal 4, which will dominate the field until 2006, when American finishes Terminal 8. That may be rivaled by a Delta Air Lines terminal next to and perhaps linked with Terminal 4.
"Delta wants to make New York City one of its major terminals and destinations in the eastern United States and is committed to developing a very substantial project," said D. Kent Turner, a senior principal in Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the architectural firm that is working on plans for the area around Terminals 2 and 3.
William Nicholas Bodouva & Associates, the architects for Terminal 1, are working with United Airlines and the new airline JetBlue on the area around Terminal 5 and Terminal 6, which they share.
At the same time, British Airways is expanding and renovating Terminal 7. The $220 million project, designed by Corgan Associates, will add 83,000 square feet of space to the 30-year-old structure, in part by extending the building forward and connecting it to a new parking deck.
In front of Terminal 7, construction crews are erecting one of the elevated sections of guideway for the AirTrain system.
The first 5.3-mile leg of AirTrain is to open in 2002 with service from eight stations around Kennedy to and from the A train stop at Howard Beach, Queens. By 2003, AirTrain is expected to reach Jamaica, Queens, on an elevated guideway along the median of the Van Wyck Expressway.
AirTrain is being designed, built, operated and maintained for the Port Authority by the AirRail Transit Consortium, led by Bombardier Transportation of Canada and Skanska (U.S.A.), a unit of the Swedish construction and development company. The architects and engineers are STV Inc.
Three years from now, travelers departing from Manhattan will be able to reach Kennedy on the Long Island Rail Road or the subway, transferring to AirTrain for a trip around the terminals. Passengers bound for Terminal 4 will get off AirTrain in the building itself, since it incorporates a station on the mezzanine.
EASE of access is a common theme among the projects. As concourses expand to serve ever-larger aircraft, "Kennedy is going to be a place of moving walkways," said Ted D. Kleiner, the program director for the redevelopment of the airport.
Travelers will increasingly find ticket counters set like islands in the middle of check-in areas, rather than arrayed along the back like a hurdle. Broad open spaces, skylights and glass walls will delineate the travel paths -- first to the shopping centers and then to the aircraft gates beyond -- even for those who cannot read the signs.
"The structure will assist the passengers in wayfinding," said Ashok Raiji, a principal in Ove Arup & Partners, the consulting engineers on the International Air Terminal and the British Airways projects.
"You can see the tails of the aircraft sitting out there on the apron," added Gregory Hodkinson, another principal at Arup.
It is no coincidence that every new terminal seems to have a swooping roof. "We want big open spaces," Mr. Hodkinson said. "If you have that, an efficient form is the curve, because you can get the arch action of the trusses. People are drawn by the shape of the roof to get to the other side, which is just where we want them to go."
Clear travel paths contribute to security, said Mr. Abramowitz of the Port Authority. "There's no place to hide without sticking out like a sore thumb," he said. "There's no reason for anyone to dally."
Unless it is to shop. Stores and restaurants are proliferating in the areas between check-in counters and departure gates. "Retailing in the 60's was a modest convenience, not a product of having to arrive two or three hours before a flight," Mr. Kleiner said. "Marketers have found an opportunity that's there to be captured."
Terminals must grow vertically since real estate is such a scarce resource at Kennedy. "Ultimately, you run out of places to park aircraft," Mr. Hodkinson said. The central terminal area is bounded on the north, east and south by runways, including 13R-31L, a 2.8-mile stretch that is the longest commercial runway in North America and a formidable barrier to expansion.
Only on the west could a 40-acre building site be created for American Airlines by realigning taxiways. But even there, much of the new terminal will rise on the site of the old buildings, which must remain in service while construction is under way.
That is also the case at Terminal 4, which is being built in, around and alongside the International Arrivals Building of 1957, a process not unlike performing open-heart surgery on a patient who is simultaneously running a marathon.
The parabolic arch over the old arrivals hall has already been demolished, as has the old west concourse, and the rest of the structure will soon follow.
The current Terminal 8, built by American in 1960, is doomed, although the airline plans to salvage in some form the 317-foot-long abstract stained-glass facade by Robert Sowers. Terminal 9 next door, built for United Airlines in 1959, will also be razed.
The Eastern terminal of 1959 was demolished to make way for Terminal 1, which was developed by Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa German Airlines. Also high on the endangered-species list are Terminal 6, by I. M. Pei & Partners, and Terminal 3, the former Pan Am Worldport, an umbrellalike structure designed by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, now TAMS Consultants.
In fact, when the dust clears, only one building may remain from the original Terminal City complex at what was once Idlewild: Eero Saarinen's T.W.A. Flight Center of 1962, now called Terminal 5. Were it not an internationally renowned architectural icon and a designated landmark, there is little doubt that Terminal 5 -- woefully small and outdated -- would have been swept away, too.
Mr. Kleiner said the Port Authority had "accepted the challenge of developing plans which would provide for keeping the most well-known exterior visual image and interior spaces of the main building."
Port Authority planners are not unmindful of Terminal City's positive legacy. "We are trying to recreate that whole verve and excitement that you're entering the world's greatest gateway," said William R. DeCota, the director of the aviation department.
The Giuliani administration believes that little good -- and not enough revenue -- come from the authority's stewardship of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports. "They are two of the worst airports in America, for large airports," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said last year. "This is the worst form of a government bureaucracy that is running something that should be run by private enterprise."
In January, four groups responded to the city's search for a private operator to serve as a consultant until 2015 and then take over management of the airports after the Port Authority's lease expires.
One respondent was the group that is now building Terminal 4, a consortium composed of Schiphol U.S.A., the American subsidiary of the Dutch company that runs Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam; LCOR, a New York developer, and Lehman Brothers.
OTHER responses came from B.A.A., the private successor to the British Airport Authority, which operates 14 airports including Heathrow and Indianapolis; Hochtief AirPort, a German company that runs the Dusseldorf airport and is developing a new airport in Athens, and the Zurich Airport company.
"The response reflects a very healthy appetite on the part of the bidders to participate in the running of the airports and the privatization of the airports," said Michael G. Carey, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
"We're very excited about that," Mr. Carey said. "It confirms that we're going in the right direction."
Not in the eyes of the Port Authority, which opposes wholesale privatization, even though it has handed over many smaller functions to private operators. "The Port Authority has retained control of all the common elements," Mr. DeCota said. "We've operated the airports, in the public interest, as a system."
"People think the Port Authority is ignoring Kennedy, but $9 billion is real," Mr. DeCota said. According to the Port Authority, about $5.1 billion is being spent on passenger terminals, $600 million on cargo terminals, $1.5 billion on AirTrain and $1.8 billion on runways, taxiways, roads, parking garages and utilities.
And even as it excoriates the Port Authority, the Giuliani administration has played a role in the redevelopment, most recently by providing access for American Airlines to the tax-exempt bond market, through the sale of $1.3 billion in bonds issued by the city's Industrial Development Agency. Because proceeds from a municipal bond are exempt from federal, state and city taxes, they carry a lower interest rate, which makes them attractive to borrowers.
Given the uncertain nature of Kennedy's future, American has had to negotiate one lease with the Port Authority and a "mirror" lease with New York City, guaranteeing that its terms of occupancy would continue should the airport revert to municipal control in 2015 or earlier.
The second lease is under review, said Gary J. Pelletier, the project manager in the airline's corporate real estate department.
But the work is already under way. The first challenge is to move utility lines. This is not simply a matter of an electrical conduit here and a gas pipe there, but of storm sewers 12 feet wide. "We're actually relocating culverts," Mr. Pelletier said.
Besides its sheer volume -- at 2.2 million square feet it will be almost 50 percent larger than Terminal 4 -- the American gateway will also be distinctive in the layout of its concourses, which are parallel to the roadway rather than perpendicular.
The first two concourses will form the legs of an H whose crossbar contains the arrivals area on the lower level and the departures hall on the upper level. The third concourse will be an island in the middle of the apron, reached by moving sidewalk through a 420-foot-long tunnel.
Given the height of the water table, about six or seven feet below grade, the tunnel has to be designed to withstand immersion and also to defeat its natural buoyancy.
Construction of the midfield concourse will begin next year. Its opening will permit demolition to proceed on the old buildings. "At one point, you'll have one new and two existing terminals running," said Edmund A. Narbutas, managing principal in the New York office of Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall, the architect for Terminal 8.
The midfield concourse is intended primarily for domestic traffic, while the concourse closest to the roadway will serve the commuter jets of American Eagle. The intermediate concourse will have room for 10 Boeing 747-400's at one time. This will allow American to accommodate its partners in the OneWorld Alliance, like Finnair and Qantas, Mr. Pelletier said.
As recently as three years ago, American intended to keep its older terminals and to build a new center concourse at the midpoint between them, where it had earlier built a connecting structure, designed by Murphy/Jahn and engineered by Arup.
That was the first project at Kennedy for Arup, one of a number of architectural and engineering firms that are not widely known by the general public but are very active and influential in airport design.
Arup has worked on some of the largest-scale airport development projects of the late 20th century, including Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong and Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan.
Sir Ove Arup, a Danish engineer, founded the firm in London in 1946, focusing first on the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. Arup attracted international attention in the early 1970's for engineering the audacious Sydney Opera House, designed by Jorn Utson. The firm now has nearly 6,000 employees in offices around the world.
It is associated on the Terminal 4 project with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and TAMS Consultants, which was also responsible for the concept of the new American Airlines terminal, now being refined by Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall.
Terminal 4 breaks the mold by extending far into the central parking area, a suggestion made early on by Paul Fernandez, a Port Authority architect, in part to preserve precious apron space for airliners.
Pushing the terminal forward allowed it to incorporate an AirTrain station that is structurally independent from the building that surrounds it. "When you stand here, you won't feel the train there," said Nancy Hamilton, a senior associate at Arup, as she walked through what will be the customs checkpoint, directly under the tracks.
THE arrivals hall extends under and beyond the elevated roadway leading to the departures hall, meaning that travelers will be greeted by a wall of glass rather than the underside of a viaduct. But they will no longer be greeted by Alexander Calder's 40-foot "Flight" mobile, which used to hang in the International Arrivals Building. That is to be moved upstairs.
Vast as the terminal already is, it has been designed to permit future enlargement. "Who knows what's around the corner?" said Mr. Raiji of Arup. "You have to build with flexibility in mind."
For the moment, Terminal 4 is a crazy-quilt hybrid of the new and old. Although the project is not scheduled for completion until May 2001, the spacious west concourse opened for service Feb. 11 with the arrival of an Air India flight.
As a commercial real estate venture, Terminal 4 is competing for tenants just as an office tower would. David A. Sigman, a senior vice president of LCOR, said the developers expected to sign seven-year leases next week with their first tenants: Sabena, Swissair and TAP-Air Portugal.
Terminal 1, which has been open since May 1998, has seven tenants besides the airlines that built it. They are Air Afrique, Austrian Airlines, Olympic Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways.
"We're happy to say we're the cream right now," said August F. Vettorino of Terminal 1 Management Inc.
Although it will end up as the smallest of the new passenger buildings, Terminal 1 affords a preview of the future at Kennedy, with four ticketing islands set into a spacious departures hall. The passport control area and the "sterile" corridor leading to it are suffused with daylight.
There is also a pleasant throwback to the days when observation decks were the rage. The upstairs food court offers views out to the taxiways and Runway 13R-31L. "You can sit and look out airside," Mr. Kleiner said, as a Royal Air Maroc 747 pushed away from the gate, "which you haven't had a chance to do for many years."

In Times Square, Waiting for Korn

BYLINE: By THOMAS HINE; Thomas Hine is author of "The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager," published last fall by Bard/Avon.

 BODY:
IT'S rare in contemporary America that anyone who has dollars to spend is ever made to feel unwelcome. But, as is often the case, the situation is slightly different for teenagers.
The new family-friendly, media-manic Times Square is beset, an article in The New York Times reported recently, by a new youth problem: truants with money. These are high school and middle school students from New York and its suburbs who skip classes for a day, often with their parents' blessing, to spend a day at the center of their culture. They stand outside MTV's window in hopes of getting on camera while they wait for 'N Sync or Korn to arrive. Or they line up at Virgin to get their favorite stars' autographs on a new compact disc. 
 And some of them, though not very many, get arrested.
As bad news goes, this doesn't seem earthshaking. Their behavior is at worst, mildly mischievous. The really troubled youth -- abused runaways, prostitutes, drug abusers -- have moved to other, less visible places.
The illusion of Times Square is that you can stand there and see the new world taking shape before your very eyes. It is a magnet for the young. And unlike many other contemporary environments, it is a place where they fit in comfortably and have a role to play.
Almost six decades ago, Times Square played an important role in the emergence of the distinct creature we now call the teenager. Frank Sinatra's concerts at the Paramount Theater in 1942, and especially in 1944, tied up traffic on the West Side for weeks, and demonstrated that young people were a significant force in the culture and in the economy.
Even earlier, in the mid-19th century, young people in their teens who made their living as messengers, newsboys and other members of the information proletariat of that era provided the clientele for hundreds of cheap theaters and music halls found throughout the city. (They also provoked a backlash in the form of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and its leader, Anthony Comstock. He argued that censoring the amusements of the young would save money on penitentiary-building later.)
In Horatio Alger's novels, the East Side street boy's first step to respectability was to stop going to theaters and use the admission money to open a savings account. The streets of New York aren't as filled with teenagers earning money as they were a century ago, but many young people have jobs. The difference is that we can scarcely imagine that they might save some of the money they make.
It is an article of faith that we consume our way to prosperity, and teenagers are our purest consumers. The money they spend -- $141 billion last year -- has few strings attached. It is spent on cars, clothes and entertainment. The economy depends on the young to embrace new things and keep fashions churning.
In a sense these new truants are doing exactly what today's Times Square invites them to do. It is a little risky to skip school, but they're not likely to be stopped as long as they stay in groups and don't go far from the places that need them to provide excitement. Their energy and their willingness to spend help create the scene that has made New York newly attractive and prosperous. MTV needs them outside that window in order to put on a good show.
Many young people are eager to play this role, and who can blame them? It's almost the only way that people in their teens can exert any power at all.
In the past, people in their teens played responsible roles in the society and were on the threshold of adulthood. Today's teenagers look forward to a decade or more of preparation and waiting, which is a great luxury for some and a burdensome waste of time for others.
Adults mistakenly assume that the "job" of teenagers is to go to high school. It's not. The great task of adolescence is to figure out how to become a valued part of your society, a successful individual. The good news is that there are far more ways to succeed in life than there are to succeed in high school. But the bad news is that we don't have ways to help young people grow up by putting them in contact with people unlike themselves. We don't have ways to allow them to make mistakes that aren't catastrophic to their future. We have bureaucratized youth, then harnessed their inevitable frustration to power a lucrative, commercialized youth culture.
Erik Erikson argued that adolescents want to engage their moment in history. For most though, opportunities to do that are limited because we segregate teenagers in a world of their own. No wonder it seems to many that the coolest, most potent thing they can do is to stand at the MTV window, dodging the truant officers, waiting for Korn.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;
More Asian-American Businesses, Yet Few Seek Loans

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
For all of New York's famous assertiveness, its Asian-Americans are bringing up the rear when it comes to seeking loans from the federal Small Business Administration.
"The San Francisco and Los Angeles Asian communities are more aggressive than we are in New York," said Justin Yu, secretary of the Better Chinatown Association. "They participate in the political process, apply for government loans and are more involved in the mainstream than we are." 
 In fact, said Aubrey A. Rogers, the director of the Small Business Administration for 14 downstate counties, "in New York City S.B.A. loans to Asian-Americans have been going down," even while there has been an increase in new small businesses started by this group.
The agency hopes a new program will reverse the trend. "We are reaching out by going to business organizations that would more readily get to the community," Mr. Rogers said. "They make a translation of our programs in their language, in their newspapers, and get out the word on a more credible basis."
In the past, the agency has conducted such initiatives among African-Americans, women in business and other groups.
Mr. Rogers said the S.B.A. approved 98 or 99 percent of its applications, which are submitted after a bank has agreed to make the loan. For the 12 months ended September 1998, the S.B.A. approved 359 loans to the New York Asian-American community. But in the following 12 months, the number dropped to 272, despite general agreement that the number of small businesses in that community had increased during that time.
No one knows exactly why these applications for low-interest, federally guaranteed loans have eroded. Mr. Rogers said that, given language differences, "We've heard that they are not comfortable talking to the government."
Paul J. Q. Lee, a local businessman, pointed to a practice common among Chinese business people of lending money to each other through loose business confederations. He also mentioned the perceived complexity of Small Business Administration applications.
"I'm a college graduate and a second-generation American, and I have trouble understanding some of those rules," he said. ERIC V. COPAGE

HEADLINE: Happy What? You Wish!;
Every year, the lies get bolder and the liars get younger.

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
THE invitation last month promised a big birthday bash in a private room at City Hall, a TriBeCa restaurant. The fashion designer summoned nearly three dozen friends from New York, East Hampton and Palm Beach to witness as she blew out the candles on a tarte Tatin, marking what she announced was her 29th birthday. This was to be the last year of her go-go 20's, and she wanted the world to know.
There was just one problem. The birthday girl's arithmetic was off. 
 "How could she be turning 29 when we were in the same class in kindergarten and I'm turning 31," said one of her friends, who asked not to be named to save the birthday girl embarrassment.
The Big Three-Oh is a milestone that many approach with a mixture of ambivalence and dread. It marks the twilight of youth, a bringing down of the curtain on life's first act, and many chose to observe it very quietly or ignore it altogether.
But not so another kind of birthday baby increasingly common in New York. She kicks up as much fuss as possible, inviting friends and acquaintances to a blow-out. It's all a charade, because the real milestone being passed is 32 or 33 or 34, but this celebrator hopes to shave a few years off her age in as public a display as possible.
"A lot of women I know on the Upper East Side wouldn't dream of celebrating their 30th birthday until they are at least 34," said Kristina Stewart, the society editor of Vanity Fair.
Fibbing about one's age is nothing new, of course. Women have long done it, giving rise to the taboo against asking a "lady" her age, and the coy expression "a woman of a certain age," which refers to anyone from 50-ish to 70-ish.
But lying about age seems to have become more aggressive, more elaborate and -- most surprising -- the province of ever younger women, including many in their 20's who would seem to be so dewey with youth that lying should be unnecessary. Yet they do, at ever more tender ages. And men are beginning to join them.
Melissa Peregrin and Kristie Tippner, both 22-year-old seniors at Syracuse University, have already started telling people that they are still 21.
"For so long, we wanted to be older," said Ms. Peregrin, an economics major. "You can't wait to drive at 16. Then you can't wait to leave home at 18. You can drink at 21. But then after 21, it's all about buying beauty cream."
Her friend, Ms. Tippner, an advertising major, said, "I'm already looking at the lines under my eyes in pictures and it bothers me."
Meredith Hanley, another Syracuse student, who is majoring in public relations, is still 21. "I'm going to say I'm 21 until I'm 30," she said. "What's the advantage of being older? Your health declines, your husband leaves you for another woman and you can't find a job."
Somewhere Naomi Wolf, the author of "The Beauty Myth" (Morrow, 1991), is softly weeping. She and countless other feminists have spent decades trying to convince women, men and society at large that a woman's worth transcends appearances. But to hear many young women tell it, those efforts have changed little.
Twenty-something women who fudge their birthdays say they get the message that they must be younger, ever younger, to succeed at love, at work and in the marketplace as a catered-to consumer. And many cultural critics back them up.
"The Girl -- capital T, capital G -- is it," said Susan Faludi, author of "Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women (Crown, 1991). "It is what is most valued and what is rewarded with fame and fortune, because we live in a visual, entertainment, ornamental culture. What is valued is image and appearance and youth, and it's what makes the consumer culture run.
"Look at Ally McBeal compared to the women on 'Cagney and Lacey.' "They were not conventionally cookie-cutter attractive; they were basically middle-aged and looked it. But now you're supposed to be middle-aged and look like you're 15. Ally McBeal doesn't look like any grown-up lawyer. She looks like a teenager dressed in career-mommy clothes."
Hollywood, our most potent image factory, worships youth on-screen and off. It is an industry that pairs over-50 male stars like Harrison Ford with under-30 love interests like Anne Heche, and it's a town where not long ago a 32-year-old television writer, Riley Weston, famously pretended to be 19 to get work on "Felicity," the WB show dealing with teenagers.
Actresses have always been expected to "play younger" than they really are, so their fictions about age hardly raise an eyebrow. But what is new is how many people in nonpublic walks of life feel pressured to play younger, too.
Deserving some of the blame may be the playground called the Internet. The business pages are full of dot-com wunderkinds who have made a million by age 30. Investment bankers bring home six-figure compensation packages in their mid-20's. So workers in other industries feel pressure to demonstrate that they, too, have achieved impressive success very early in life.
"If you're 27 and doing well, then it's O.K. to say you're 27," explained Stephanie DiIorio, who is in fact 27 and a restaurant consultant in New York. "But if you're not. . . .Well, let's say I could see getting to 30 and being 30 for five years."
Ploys to shave off years and deceive friends, lovers and colleagues have become more elaborate, like the 30th-birthday-party charade. Another ploy, useful to those in the public eye, is to give a fictional age to a newspaper or magazine; the fake statistic is inevitably picked up and repeated so often it becomes part of the record and a fact checker's truth. Taylor Stein, a party-loving young woman about town who until recently ran the restaurant Brown's on East 61st Street, told The New York Times she was 29 for a profile last April. Ms. Stein now admits that she fibbed -- and that she does so regularly when it comes to age. (Ms. Stein still will not reveal her age. "Age is a number; mine's unlisted," she said.)
"I think as your age goes up, your market value goes down, unlike real estate," Ms. Stein said. She admitted the foolishness of the effort: "It's all about insecurity. Do you think two years makes a difference?"
James Tully, 31, an artist in Manhattan, described a woman he dated for a number of years who had a remarkable ability to reverse time. "The first year we started dating she was 27, and her age progressed naturally for three years," he said. "Then all of sudden, when she hit 30, she went down to 28. I kept getting confused because she kept getting younger and younger."
Whenever he tried to pin her down, she would get upset. "She was so insistent, and unless you wanted to invite an irrational harangue, you would leave the subject alone," he said. "In my own mind, I'm keeping track, and she must be about 35 now, though she pretends to hover around 30."
Reached for a comment while driving down a highway in California, the woman insisted she had to pull over before addressing Mr. Tully's version of events. She promised to call back on her cell phone, but never did.
Last year, one group of Manhattanites who were classmates at the Nightingale-Bamford School, the all-girls private school on East 92nd Street, made a pact to collectively revise the year of their graduation. Instead of admitting they graduated in 1986, which pegs them as 31 today, these half-dozen women all cite 1991 as the date they received their diplomas, making them 26.
"It gives us more time," said one of the women in the group, who is single, doesn't work and volunteers on junior charity committees. "When you're not married and don't have a career, New York can be harsh on women. Men can be harsh on women."
Many women make no apologies for lying about their age. If society -- men, the workplace, popular culture -- is going to conspire against them, they reason, then they will make up whatever age suits them. Eve Packer, a tutor who works from her Manhattan home, said she lies always, changing her age each day depending on her mood. "I feel like it's a weapon used against women; it's like a club," she said. "If you're 29, then they look at you like, Why aren't you 19? Or if you're 39, then they say, 'Why aren't you 25?' People size you up by your age."
When Marie Claire magazine recently polled 100 men and 100 women about everyday lies they tell, Michele Lavery, the deputy editor, was shocked by the results. "The degree to which people lie unconsciously is really surprising," she said. The survey found that people lie about almost everything: whether they are working late, if they thought the sex was great, and yes, how old they are.
"Women only lie about being younger than they are, while men lie up and down depending on who they are trying to impress," Ms. Lavery said.
ndre Vasquez, 32, a home attendant from Paramus, N.J., has no qualms about pretending to be 25 to attract younger women. "I tell them I'm 25 so I don't scare them off," he said. "Young girls don't like older men, because they think older men are possessive and like to control young girls. I like them to think I'm o their level."
He eventually reveals the truth. "I tell them after I've been with them," he said. "After I've bought them things. You have to buy them things, then you have them."
Given that lying about one's age is so pervasive, and accepted in some quarters almost as a matter of course, can there be anything wrong with it?
Yes, said Sissela Bok, author of the 1978 book "Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life" (Vintage Books). Lying about one's age puts one on a slippery slope toward more serious falsehoods, she said. "Once a person engages in a series of lies, then they have to keep telling more and more lies to support the first one," said Ms. Bok, who is an interim director of the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. "Now that they've started, it bomes very hard to stop."
Although small lies may not not seem to hurt anyone, Ms. Bok said, the liar is frequently the one who suffers. "People trust themselves less if they know others cannot trust them," she said.
Furthermore, Ms. Bok said, it erodes one's credibility on larger matters; once someone learns you've lied about your age, they will be disinclined to trust you on larger matters. All this lying leads to "a knd of pollution to society," she said.
And how old is Ms. Bok?
She hesitated a long moment.
Finally, she answered: "65."

Aetna Plans a Recovery; H.M.O.'s May Not Make It

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
MAYBE they should call it unmanageable care.
In just four frenetic years, the respected if somewhat stodgy insurance company once affectionately nicknamed Mother Aetna transformed itself into a colossal force in a much-criticized business, health plans. At the end of the rainbow there was supposed to be a gold mine of profits wrung from managing away the inefficiencies and excesses of modern medicine. 
 Instead, Aetna found itself the biggest target in an industry under siege. Its woes raise questions about whether the traditional H.M.O. approach to paying for health care has a viable future.
Last week, under intense pressure from investors who had sent the company's stock spinning downward and brought on the resignation of its chief executive, Richard L. Huber, the company adopted a new candor about its shortcomings and the powerful backlash against its specialty, tightly controlled managed care.
Rejecting a takeover bid by WellPoint Health Networks of California and ING Group, a Dutch financial services company, Aetna's new chief executive, William H. Donaldson, pointed to growing demand by customers and patients for "choice and empowerment."
Mr. Donaldson, an Aetna board member who spent most of his career on Wall Street, vowed to improve relations with physicians and hospitals and "do a better job of meeting the expectations of customers and patients." To that end, Aetna said it would split itself into two separate companies, one for managed health care and one for financial services.
Some analysts said Aetna's troubles portended the demise of stringently controlled health maintenance organizations of the type that Mr. Huber bought from U.S. Healthcare in 1996 to begin Aetna's transformation.
"H.M.O.'s are in a very precarious position," said Larry Feinberg, a partner at Oracle Partners, a New York-based health care hedge fund. "The model we all love to hate will become extinct in the next five years."
Managed care companies like Aetna have come under heavy attack in Congress, the states and the courts. Aetna alone is fending off at least nine class-action challenges to such fundamentals of managed care as the use of financial incentives for doctors who keep costs down.
H.M.O.'s have also found their efforts to contain costs outfoxed by drug companies, whose direct-to-consumer advertising stokes demand for expensive prescription drugs, driving up the health plans' drug costs. And patients are empowering themselves by clicking on an estimated 100,000 health care Web sites (who's counting?) offering everything from solid science to nostrums, and then bombarding doctors with questions that can stretch office visits and spur more tests and prescriptions. For these and other reasons, health care inflation is returning to double-digit territory after several years of restraint.
Meanwhile, enrollees have been voting with their feet for less restrictive types of managed care, which are now growing faster than H.M.O.'s. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York said enrollment in its more flexible preferred provider plans rose 16 percent, to 2.6 million in the year ending last January, while membership in its H.M.O.'s fell 10 percent, to 230,000.
The crucial distinction between the two types of plans involves patient freedom. In a traditional H.M.O., tests, treatments and access to specialists are not covered unless authorized by a designated primary-care physician, a plan administrator or, in many cases, both. Preferred provider networks have none of those restrictions, and offer more freedom to choose out-of-network providers for patients willing to shoulder more of the cost themselves.
Many analysts predict a comeback for H.M.O.'s if the economy cools down and taming of the health cost spiral becomes a priority again, because H.M.O.'s are cheaper than other types of plans. According to Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, the annual cost of coverage for a typical family in an H.M.O. is $7,000; in a network of preferred physicians and hospitals, $9,000; and in traditional unmanaged health insurance, known as indemnity plans, $12,000. Those differences are usually mirrored in the amounts workers contribute from their paychecks toward the cost of coverage.
But while the economy is strong and labor markets remain tight, large employers, which still pick up most of the tab for their employees' care, try to please their staffs by offering a range of health plans of all types. "In boom times, an engineer won't put up with managed care restrictions," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton, though easily replaceable workers often have no choice, and young, healthy workers who are low on the pay scale still sign up for H.M.O.'s.
Liz Rossman, vice president for benefits at Sears, Roebuck, said 87 percent of Sears employees remained in H.M.O.'s even after the company added a preferred provider network that offered direct access to more doctors. One discouraging feature of the network plan for low-income workers is a deductible for hospitalization or surgery of $300 for single employees and $900 for families.
Employers and health plans are emphasizing choice. Honeywell offers workers a menu of different health plans, plus access to an Internet database describing the credentials and health plan affiliations for nearly every doctor in the country, said Brian Marcotte, vice president for benefits at the company.
After buying U.S. Healthcare and the health plans run by New York Life and Prudential Insurance, Aetna became the nation's largest health insurer, covering 22 million people. This includes 7.8 million in commercial H.M.O.'s, 6.2 million in point of service plans -- essentially, H.M.O.'s that also offer access to out-of-network doctors -- and 4 million in preferred provider networks. There are also 700,000 members in its Medicare H.M.O.'s and several million in the dwindling group that still takes part in unmanaged indemnity or fee-for-service plans.
Like its national competitors, Cigna Corporation and UnitedHealth Group, Aetna can meet the widespread demand for choices. But when it bought U.S. Healthcare for a high price of $2,500 a member, it acquired a hard-driving culture that transformed many doctors into adversaries in lawsuits and in lobbying battles in state legislatures and in Congress.
Doctors were especially incensed by a take-it-or-leave-it rule that required them to treat low-paying Aetna H.M.O. members or give up Aetna members in the more lucrative preferred provider networks.
"Too many of America's patients and physicians are already at the mercy of powerful health insurance giants who offer only 'take-it-or-leave-it' contract provisions," said Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, president of the American Medical Association, in a statement after the WellPoint offer was announced early this month. He said the association was concerned that merging insurance companies would have "too much leverage in their dealings with patients and physicians."
Without naming the medical association, Aetna's Mr. Donaldson told Wall Street analysts last week that the critical "reactions of many groups around the world" were on Aetna's list of reasons for rejecting WellPoint -- along with antitrust and market share problems, WellPoint's smaller size, and the "tentative nature" of the offer, which was conditioned on giving WellPoint a chance to delve into Aetna's books.
The challenge for Aetna, if it is to regain the confidence of investors and secure an independent future, is to discover a way to hold down costs and run its health plans economically without incurring so much wrath from doctors and patients alike -- if such a way exists.

HEADLINE: In Japan, The Legacy Of a Phone Monopoly

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE jackhammers start their work at 10 p.m., and in this case, their rat-a-tat-tat brings a machine gun to mind. For the trench they are digging, which will be home to a state-of-the-art fiber optic cable transmitting data and voices around the globe, lies on the front lines of the battle for the heart and soul of the Japanese economy.
Operating the jackhammers are Japanese construction workers under contract to KVH Telecom, a fledgling telecommunications company financed by a unit of FMR's Fidelity Investments. They are laying a cable that KVH promises will provide better quality, higher speed and cheaper service than anything Japan has ever seen. And in doing so, they are creating a piece of the infrastructure upon which a new Japan will rise after a decade of economic decline. 
 Dictating how the trench will be dug -- and in many ways, discouraging the digging -- are Japanese regulators. They are only the most recent in a line of officials who have single-mindedly promoted the interests of Japanese business -- particularly those of the mighty Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, by many measures Japan's most formidable company and long its telephone monopoly. Their rules, which add months to every project, have made Japan the most expensive telecommunications market in the industrialized world.
On Tuesday, American trade negotiators will meet their Japanese counterparts here in what may be the last in a long series of skirmishes over Japan's regulation of the telecommunications market before the United States takes its case to the World Trade Organization. Other areas like energy, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and housing will also be under discussion, but the bulk of the talks will be devoted to telecommunications.
Competitors and Washington contend that N.T.T. has considerable advantages beyond having been the only game in town for decades. Government regulation, they say, favors N.T.T. in the way that prices are set, in limiting access to rights of way and in severely circumscribing how various types of telecommunications carriers can do business.
The fight, however, is much more than a trade dispute. "This is not a battle between the United States, foreigners and Japanese, small companies and large ones," said Harumasa Sato, a professor of economics at Konan University in Kobe and a member of the government's Telecommunication Council, an advisory board of academics and experts. "This is a battle between monopoly and competition, old Japan and new Japan, the past and the future."
While similar fights are taking place throughout the Japanese economy these days, perhaps none is so pivotal. After all, it is the development and deployment of telecommunications systems, with their delicate glass fibers and light-speed switches, that is knitting the global economy into a seamless whole and playing a bigger and bigger role in the prosperity of individual economies.
The Japanese insist they are intent on becoming a critical link in the network and are working as fast as is practical to deregulate their market. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications refused to make any of its officials available for an interview, saying they were too busy.
And it is, in fact, getting easier to compete here; N.T.T. officials point to the presence of KVH and many other competitors as proof of that.
"I cannot understand why foreign competitors are saying N.T.T. gets preferential treatment," said Kanji Koide, a senior vice president at N.T.T. "The reason they are here is that the Japanese market is a level playing field."
But there is a general backlash against deregulation in Japan, as evidence of the economy's growing openness sinks into the popular psyche. Seeing a packed Starbucks shop on seemingly every corner in Tokyo -- often across the street from a struggling Japanese competitor -- raises fears among many that Japan is losing its identity.
So there are signs of foot-dragging, notably in the telecommunications sector. In 1998, then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto promised President Clinton that Japan would adopt a method of calculating interconnection fees -- what N.T.T. charges other carriers to hook into its local network -- that would make Japan competitive with other major markets around the globe by this April. Yet now the government says it cannot live up to Mr. Hashimoto's pledge, because dropping fees so far so fast would be "devastating" to N.T.T.
MEANWHILE, practical impediments to competition here have not been dismantled, adding immensely to the costs of any company trying to build a telecommunications system that challenges N.T.T. on its home turf.
Take KVH's trench. Construction costs average around $2,000 a meter, roughly five times what they would be in Europe and 10 to 12 times higher than in Latin America.
Why? The trench must be opened, dug and closed each night. All the soil that is dug out of the trench must be hauled away, and new dirt hauled in to replace it. Each night. The pit must be 55 inches deep, compared with 31 inches in Europe; the greater depth means steel plates must be used to reinforce the trench.
The Ministry of Construction, which imposes these rules, says they are necessary because Japan is earthquake prone and densely populated and its cities ancient.
The upshot, though, is that by the time KVH completes the first 66 miles of its network this month, construction will have accounted for some 80 percent of its costs. "It sometimes feels like we're in the construction business instead of the telecom business," said Akira Tada, KVH's director of corporate planning.
Further, though KVH's goal is to give customers service that bypasses N.T.T., it cannot provide such services without itself doing business with N.T.T.; the phone company, together with local power companies, owns the conduits that feed into buildings here.
So roughly 70 percent of the internal ducts that KVH will use must be leased from N.T.T. at an average cost of $70 a meter. In building a phone system, "speed is very important, and if we use their ducts, we get speed," Mr. Tada said. "We have to pay for speed."
At the end of one year, KVH has completed less than 20 percent of its network, far less than it expected. It has taken MCI WorldCom three years and dozens of bruising battles with regulators and building owners to wire two buildings. After trying to compete with N.T.T. for more than a decade, the Tokyo Telecommunications Network, or TT Net, has captured only 0.8 percent of the nationwide market.
"It's hard to do business here, but still the situation is much better than it was three years ago," said Mirei Kuroda, an executive at MCI WorldCom who recalls being summoned to the ministry at 11 one night when MCI was applying for its license. "But the ministry is still not supportive."
Despite all this, businesses are pressing hard for alternatives, and in doing so are forcing N.T.T. to respond. KVH, MCI WorldCom, Japan Telecom and others are laying loops of fiber optic cable all over Tokyo and Osaka, hooking up to buildings owned by major real estate companies like Mori Building and Mitsui Fudosan.
The buildings those developers own and manage were previously served only by N.T.T., but times -- and tenants -- have changed. Foreign financial service and law firms, proliferating thanks to deregulation in the financial markets here, are demanding high-speed, high-quality, fault-free telecommunications services at a competitive cost.
Mori Building is on the verge of offering its tenants long-distance service using MCI WorldCom's lines; over the longer term, it plans to give them a menu of carriers to choose from.
Hiroo Mori, a director of Mori Building, figures the cost of a long-distance call will drop by as much as 75 percent. "We think this will enhance our reputation and make us more appealing to tenants," he said.
But as Mr. Koide of N.T.T. notes, only business customers -- the most lucrative market for any upstart phone company, whether in Japan, the United States or elsewhere -- will benefit.
"They are only planning to serve customers who use a lot of international service," he said. "We have to provide service to everyone here, even when we don't make a profit."
Indeed, the Japanese consumer has figured hardly at all in the dreams of MCI WorldCom, KVH and the like, largely because the cost of reaching her is so high. N.T.T. is at both ends of 99 percent of local calls, because it controls the critical wires into Japanese homes. That means every time someone using MCI's network picks up the phone and calls someone else here, MCI pays N.T.T. an interconnection fee that amounts to somewhere around 40 percent of the revenue from the call.
Those fees are the core of the fight between the United States Trade Representative's office and Japanese regulators. Tokyo has proposed cutting them by 22.5 percent over four years; Washington wants a 41 percent reduction right away. Neither side is budging.
TO understand how interconnection fees affect carriers, take a look at TT Net, to date the only company attempting to compete with N.T.T. in providing local phone service.
Started in 1986 by Tokyo Electric Power in the wake of N.T.T.'s privatization, it faces few of the challenges that foreign carriers do, because it can use the conduits, ducts and rights of way owned by its parent. For the first decade of its existence, it served business customers and other telecommunications carriers that used its system end to end, capturing almost one-third of the demand for high-speed digital transmission in its service area.
Then, in 1998, TT Net began offering telephone services to households in Tokyo and eight surrounding prefectures, using a high-speed optical fiber network laid alongside the electric company's cables and distribution lines. It priced its service at 9 yen for three minutes, 1 yen lower than N.T.T.'s rate, and came up with some catchy advertising. By the end of last May, it had attracted more than two million customers.
But to complete local phone calls, TT Net had to connect to N.T.T.'s network -- and its profitability plummeted. Net income fell from 2.5 billion yen in 1997 to 300 million yen in 1998, then tumbled to 100 million yen in the fiscal year that ended last March.
"The cost of interconnection is a real and harsh one," said Hiroyuki Tsukamoto, deputy general manager of TT Net's corporate planning department. "It is the center of our problems." TT Net, of course, knew from the start that interconnection fees were high. But it started the service believing that the government planned to cut them this year.
Mr. Koide contends, though, that TT Net's problems are the result of a flawed business strategy and an excessive reliance on N.T.T.'s sites. "Charging 9 yen is uneconomical," he said. "We charge 10 yen and can hardly make money."
To be sure, lowering interconnection fees will be hard on N.T.T., which has been trying to find its footing since being forced by the government last year to spin off its two most promising businesses and carve its remaining operations into three parts.
The Japanese government estimates that its own proposal would slice $4 billion out of the revenues of N.T.T.'s two local phone companies, one of which is already losing money. Any further reduction, it says, would force N.T.T. to either charge its retail customers higher rates -- which would be all but impossible, politically -- or absorb the pain itself, since the law prohibits it from simply eliminating unprofitable service.
"On the one hand, we must provide service to remote regional areas at our own cost, and on the other hand, we are exposed to harsh competition in the more lucrative urban areas," Mr. Koide said. "We feel there's a contradiction in that system."
But Mr. Koide and the government are ignoring the experience of the United States and other countries where interconnection fees have been reduced. Competition has forced prices lower, and regulators have set up mechanisms to ensure that deregulation neither reduced service in unprofitable areas nor hampered the ability of local phone companies to make money.
Plus, the United States and others have raised questions about the numbers used in the model that Tokyo relied on in determining the impact on N.T.T. of cutting interconnection fees.
Depending on who is right, the extra cost to consumers could be as little as 56 cents a month, or a more unpalatable $3.15 monthly. If the costs were absorbed wholly by N.T.T., they could be just $462 million annually -- or as much as $2.5 billion.
While would-be competitors bicker over the costs of traditional fixed-line phone service, Japanese consumers have been voting with their pocketbooks, switching in droves to cellular phones. The cost of wireless phones has dropped 78 percent over the last 15 years; fixed-line phone rates have risen 13 percent in the same time.
The irony, of course, is that the biggest beneficiary of the switch to cellular has been N.T.T. itself. The company has a 67 percent stake in Japan's largest mobile phone carrier, NTT Mobile Telecommunications, or NTT DoCoMo, one of the two companies that N.T.T. spun off as part of its breakup last year.
Demand has been huge for DoCoMo's i-mode phones, which provide Internet access for about $2.83 a month. That is 96 percent less than N.T.T. charges for Internet service over fixed phone lines, a differential that helps explain why only 12 percent of the Japanese population has such service, compared with one-third or more of Americans, for example.
So in spite of the woes of its local phone subsidiaries, N.T.T. is a rich company. The value of its stake in DoCoMo alone is roughly 24.1 trillion yen, or $227.6 billion, and it also holds the majority of NTT Data, the data transmission company that it spun off with DoCoMo last year.
If N.T.T. were to sell just 20 percent of its DoCoMo stake -- which would still leave it in control of the mobile phone operator -- it would pocket some 2.5 trillion yen, or $23.6 billion, after taxes.
Professor Sato, the homegrown critic, likes to daydream about ways the company could use that windfall to promote competition. "N.T.T. could adopt the U.S. proposal immediately using this money," Professor Sato said, referring to the call for a sharp cut in interconnection fees.
"It could even afford to create a special incentive program to encourage early retirement, which would help it to streamline, cut costs and become more competitive," he said.
His argument is simplistic -- liquidating a position of that size would be tricky -- but it now looks like the ruling party may study a similar proposal. And Prof. Sato has a point: Far from emasculating N.T.T. by creating a market value for its component parts, the government gave the company a fat piggy bank it could use to numb the pain of fundamentally reorienting its business.
N.T.T. is not thinking that way. Rather, it is resentful that it was forced to sell even small parts of its prized subsidiaries.
"I would say that we could have done much better with DoCoMo and Data if we had full control of them," Mr. Koide said. "But N.T.T. had no choice in the matter."
FOR all its foot-dragging, N.T.T. can move at lightening speed to cut costs when it is threatened. In the last two months, several companies have announced plans to provide access to the Internet using a technology called A.D.S.L. that ensures higher speed and better quality than the system N.T.T. offers over so-called I.S.D.N. lines.
Within days of the first announcements, N.T.T. said it would lower the price of Internet access. In some parts of Tokyo, it will drop its fixed-rate Internet access charge to 2,900 yen, or $27.36, a month from 8,000 yen, or $75.47. N.T.T. had previously resisted widespread demands for lower Internet rates, saying they would be unprofitable.
"What we consider unfair is that if N.T.T. can afford to lower rates that fast in that business, why can't they reduce interconnection fees?" TT Net's Mr. Tsukamoto said.
Indeed, competitors believe N.T.T. will similarly slash prices for phone service by as much as 50 or 60 percent -- if and when they start to pose a serious challenge.
Of course, the more consumers flock to N.T.T.'s cheaper I.S.D.N. service, the harder it will be for the new, higher-speed technology to make inroads here.
N.T.T. is also starting to introduce the new technology, but given its investment in I.S.D.N., it cannot afford to have it become too popular too quickly.
"It's another bottleneck the Japanese economy must pass through to get into the new world," Professor Sato said.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
What? A Quiet Texas Billionaire?

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to Texas billionaires, L. Lowry Mays doesn't seem eccentric enough. Sure, he has a ranch or two, and he takes some nice vacations with a little hunting and fishing thrown in. But he just doesn't live as large as some of his peers. No monstrous mansions, helicopters or yachts. And no trophy wives or stop-and-start presidential campaigns.
Indeed, Mr. Mays, 64, is among the richest but least-known media tycoons in the land. 
 As chairman and chief executive of Clear Channel Communications, however, Mr. Mays has provided his stockholders with gaudy returns, averaging 64 percent a year over the last decade.
The company, based in San Antonio, is already the world's largest owner of billboards and, with its agreement last October to buy AMFM Inc. for $17.4 billion, it will be the world's largest owner of radio stations, too. The deal-making continued on Feb. 29, when Clear Channel agreed to buy SFX Entertainment, a concert producer, arena owner and sports promoter, for $3.3 billion.
The two deals are the latest of the media acquisitions that began in 1972, when Mr. Mays and Red McCombs (now owner of the Minnesota Vikings) bought a struggling San Antonio radio station. For Mr. Mays, buying media properties was always more about considerations like free cash flow than a chance to hang out with celebrities. He soon saw the efficiencies, and the attractiveness for advertisers, to be gained from consolidation.
Mr. Mays now oversees a media empire upon which the sun never sets, from gospel radio in Greensboro, N.C., to billboards in Beijing. Including pending acquisitions, the company will have operations in 32 countries and will own or have stakes in 19 television stations, 550,000 billboards and 110 entertainment venues. It will also own all or part of 1,100 radio stations, although some are being sold to satisfy regulators. For dessert, it will use SFX's agents to handle elite sports figures like Michael Jordan and Andre Agassi.
Even so, Mr. Mays presents himself as a modest sort. "I'm not concerned with how big we are," he said. "I'm not even sure I know what big means." Of course, in expanding the company, he has proceeded with a good deal of calculation. He buys radio and TV stations and billboards in the same market, then cuts costs and sells advertising packages across the three media. With radio stations in most major markets, Mr. Mays can deliver audiences that were once available only on prime-time television.
But Mr. Mays is starting to hear some static. Media buyers have begun complaining about the company's advertising rates, which, they say, have risen in recent months. The higher tariffs have led some advertisers to desert.
Kevin Gallagher, the media director at Starcom Worldwide, a unit of the Leo Group, the ad agency based in Chicago, said he recently advised a client to switch to television. Although Mr. Gallagher would not criticize Clear Channel's rates, he said, "at a certain point radio isn't worth it." Despite his reservations, Mr. Gallagher said Clear Channel offered an attractive one-stop-shopping option combining outlets like billboards and the Internet.
Other criticism comes from outside the industry. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a public interest law firm that promotes broad access to electronic media, says Clear Channel's economies come at a cost. "They are done at the expense of local news and public affairs programming," he said.
Mr. Mays says those objections are misplaced. "We are doing more public service work within our communities than we ever have before," he said.
While Clear Channel's growth has caused some controversy, Mr. Mays's personal exploits are unlikely to stir much attention. A Dallas native who speaks with just a hint of a twang, he received a petroleum engineering degree from Texas A&M and an M.B.A. from Harvard. He has been married to his wife, Peggy, for 40 years.
They live in a comfortable, if not lavish, five-bedroom house in San Antonio. On weekends, they often retreat to a 2,000-acre ranch near Spring Branch, 40 miles north of San Antonio, where they raise registered longhorns. They spend much of their free time with their four children and 10 grandchildren. Mark, 36, is Clear Channel's president and chief operating officer. Randall, 34, is its chief financial officer and Kathryn Mays Johnson, 39, is director of communications. Linda Mays McCaul, 38, doesn't work at the company.
As the owner of 30.3 million shares of Clear Channel stock worth about $2.08 billion, Mr. Mays plans to give away much of his fortune. So far, his pet causes have been local or regional, including gifts to Texas A&M and to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He and his wife have started a foundation that now has $25 million in assets; he hopes it will grow to $250 million. But Mr. Mays isn't ready to focus full-time on philanthropy just yet.
Instead, he is preparing Clear Channel for an assault on the Internet. By the end of next year, Mr. Mays predicted, all the Web sites of the company's radio stations will have streaming audio. That, combined with SFX's concerts, could let it offer pay-per-view concerts over the Web.
Mr. Mays says the Internet will become a growing source of advertising revenue for the company. "We have 110 million people a week listening to our radio stations," he said. "That's damn near half the nation. If we can move a portion of those listeners to our Web sites, we have the power to create more traffic than anyone else on the Net. We will have the most active Web sites in the country," he said.
Given investors' frenzied embrace of Internet stocks, Mr. Mays hopes the company's recent and future moves will help buoy Clear Channel's stock. It slumped after the SFX announcement, as some analysts questioned whether the deal would pay off.
And for Mr. Mays, the chance to hang out with rock stars is not much of a payoff, either. Nor with most of the sports stars. "I'd be embarrassed to play tennis with Andre," he said, but conceded: "I wouldn't mind playing golf with Jordan."

HEADLINE: Good Times Prove Brief for an Irish Factory Town

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: MILFORD, Ireland

 BODY:
THE old Fruit of the Loom plant here is a short walk from the center of town, just past an elementary school, on a winding country road lined with stone walls and tumbling yellow gorse bushes. Employees used to joke about how the factory windows overlooked the white and black crosses of the local cemetery. Now the symbolism is too rich to mention without a bitter grin.
The plant is one of four Fruit of the Loom sites that closed last year in County Donegal. More than half of the company's roughly 2,000 Irish employees have lost their jobs in the turmoil that has accompanied its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States. 
 Because of its remote location in the north of Ireland and its proximity to sectarian violence, Donegal has seldom enjoyed prosperous times. But Fruit of the Loom's arrival in 1987 seemed a godsend. "People saw a light at the end of the tunnel," said Bridie Burns, who worked for 12 years at the principal location, in the town of Buncrana. "There was nothing else there."
Now, the locals' role as a tiny cog in the global economy has hit home. "The rag trade is a risky business," said Jim Sheridan, a county councilor in Buncrana. "People came to terms with the fact that a multinational has a certain life span."
Everything started on the right foot, as Fruit of the Loom acquired W. P. McCarter & Company, a textile manufacturer. John McCarter, who with his brother Willy had taken over the company from their uncle, described the combination as "a very willing and good match" -- a partnership to jump-start the local economy. By maintaining impeccable labor relations and a commitment to local communities, Fruit of the Loom tied itself to the region. It sponsored soccer teams and St. Patrick's Day parades.
Mr. McCarter and his brother were ousted from the company six years later in an episode that Ms. Burns compared to "a death in the family." But workers and union officials attribute the company's woes to vague management issues like poor communication and a failure to motivate workers, not on William F. Farley and his executive team.
"We can't criticize Farley, because he came from America and put this here, and we got 12 good years out of it," said Nuala Lynch, a union steward at the plant in Malin Head.
Only sewing plants have been closed -- leaving behind industrial operations like dyeing and spinning. Nearly all who lost their jobs are women. Now living on generous severance packages, most families have yet to feel the economic impact. But they are anxious about the future.
When she was laid off in January, Eithne Fullerton, 60, had spent 28 years working for the McCarter Company and Fruit of the Loom, earning a little over $300 a week. Her 27-year-old son, Patrick, who has worked at the Buncrana plant since he was 14, sometimes brings home more than $375 a week, but he is moving out soon to get married. Her husband hasn't worked in 18 years, after two hip replacements.
With unemployment in Donegal at 22 percent -- compared with a national average of less than 5 percent -- emigration again threatens to depopulate the region. The Irish government, which owns the closed plants, is busily courting new employers and hopes to retrain residents to work in tourism and information technologies.
Nonetheless, some of the laid-off workers, aware that Irish cities are thriving, say Dublin's efforts are too little, too late.
"We feel that the government have forgotten about this part of the world," said Ms. Lynch, 47, now working part time as a substitute clerk in the post office in Malin. "They promised us the sun, the moon, and the stars, and we haven't seen any one of them."

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Journey to South Asia

 BODY:
With just 10 months left in office, President Clinton today begins one of the most important trips of his presidency. Though India, Pakistan and Bangladesh make up a sixth of the earth's population, no American president has visited this turbulent region since Jimmy Carter in 1978. In part, the long neglect is attributable to the cold war, when Pakistan was assigned the role of front-line ally against the Soviet Union while India got written off as a friend of the Kremlin. Today it is the tensions between these two countries that threaten a nuclear war, and the United States needs to re-energize its approach to their problems.
India is the first stop and showcase of Mr. Clinton's trip, as it should be. Since the acceleration of economic reforms in 1991, India has enjoyed impressive economic growth. Most of its population still lives in hundreds of thousands of small villages, while other Indians are developing software in high-tech centers for export to America. Appropriately, Mr. Clinton plans to visit both of these Indias, and to stop at tourist sites like the Taj Mahal. It has always been odd for the United States not to have a closer relationship with the world's most populous and diverse democracy, and the president's visit can move toward that goal. But while trying to reach agreements on trade, technology transfer and environmental issues, Mr. Clinton must make clear that his greatest interest is to see India and Pakistan reduce the danger of a nuclear confrontation. 
 In Bangladesh, which has also made economic gains in recent years, Mr. Clinton will encounter another reminder of the region's violent past. Like so many South Asian leaders of recent decades, the country's prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, is the daughter of an independence leader. Her father, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated in 1975, a few years after he led Bangladesh to freedom in the last India-Pakistan war. Mr. Clinton's visit can lead to further assistance to help Bangladesh fight disease, hunger and overpopulation.
But the trickiest part of Mr. Clinton's trip will come at the end, when he stops briefly in Pakistan. The visit was added in response to Pakistani warnings that a snub would encourage terrorist and fundamentalist tendencies. In a speech last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said correctly that Mr. Clinton's decision must not be seen as a sign of approval for the military coup in Islamabad last year. Mr. Clinton needs to use his brief visit to press for a quick return to democracy and for military restraint, including an end to Pakistan's ties with terrorist and insurgent groups in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state.
By devoting four days to India and traveling throughout the country, Mr. Clinton may earn enough good will for some frank talk about Kashmir with his host, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. There can be no military solution to the Kashmir problem. India can take a step toward eased tensions by reducing its military forces in Kashmir in return for reciprocal action by Pakistan, including withdrawal of insurgent groups it may be supporting. In the nuclear area, both countries need to make progress toward signing a test-ban treaty and curbing deployment of missiles and production of fissile materials.
In his waning months in office, Mr. Clinton has a chance to nudge peace efforts ahead in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. Whether he can do so in South Asia as well will depend in large part on how effectively he handles this week's visit.

Whose Economy Is It?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THE old economy lives.
Just when the dull old stocks that used to dominate the economy appeared to be dead in the water, they took off with a vengeance last week. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 666 points, or 6.7 percent, for the week. 
 That's the largest weekly percentage gain for the Dow since the summer of 1984, when the average began the big week at 1,114, or only a little more than a tenth of the current level. In points, it is by far the largest weekly leap ever.
That move was welcome for investors who had avoided the technology stocks that have dominated the stock market, particularly during the last six months. Stocks in such industries as banking, insurance, retail and electric utilities were trading at their lowest level in a couple of years, even as the tech stocks zoomed to ever higher levels.
Moreover, stocks that are traditionally sensitive to the economy, like Caterpillar and Goodyear, were trading as if a recession were imminent, even though virtually all the economic numbers show that the boom continues unabated despite four rounds of interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The fifth such move is virtually certain to arrive on Tuesday, but fear of the Fed seems to have faded.
One reason it faded is that the latest inflation numbers took on a rosy glow after Wall Street was through interpreting them.
"Outside of oil prices, there is nothing going on on the inflation front," said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist of Merrill Lynch, who figures that oil prices will start coming down this spring as oil producers step up output.
"Market participants are wagering that Alan Greenspan, faced with continued good news on the inflation front, will recant," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
But Mr. Barbera thinks that is wrong. He thinks that Mr. Greenspan, who has repeatedly said that Americans are spending too much, in part because rising stock prices have made them feel wealthier, is worried about the ways in which the stock market has changed over the last year.
Higher rates caused investors in the old economy to worry, but technology stocks have roared back after every plunge. That happened again last week, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell more than 11 percent in the first three and a half days of trading, then made up most of the losses in the final day and a half.
Meanwhile, consumer spending is running higher than most economists expected and stock market investors are borrowing money at a record rate to finance their investments.
It appears that mutual fund buyers have continued to pour money into the narrow group of funds that buy fast-growing technology companies.
If Mr. Barbera is right, then the Fed is likely to keep raising rates until the new economy stocks finally go down and stay down.
If so, it remains to be seen whether the old economy stocks -- not to mention the old economy itself -- can withstand the onslaught.

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
For a few days last week it suddenly occurred to U.S. investors that tech stocks might be a bit, um, speculative, and they hurried back to what they somehow imagine to be the safety of old-economy blue chips. (Hey, some of these mammals might not make it; better put your money on the dinosaurs.) But sitting in England, where tech fever is more recent but if anything runs even hotter, I feel the urge to put in something of a good word for the American technology boom. Put it this way: our investors seem moderate, sensible and on the right track -- at least when you compare them with their counterparts elsewhere in the world.
The big story of the week here was the I.P.O. of Lastminute.com, which has a concept very similar to that of Priceline.com. Martha Lane Fox, the firm's 27-year-old co-founder, graced the cover of just about every national newspaper. And why not? At the end of its first day as a public company the firm -- which needless to say loses money, and had fourth-quarter sales of only about $650,000 -- had a market valuation of more than $1 billion. Americans may be used to that sort of thing, but in England it's still a novelty. 
 But while Ms. Lane Fox is photogenic, and for all I know very much on top of her business, what the newspapers here really seem to like about her is that she comes from a very posh family (the double-barreled name is a giveaway). Her father is a well-known historian, and -- as every article managed to point out in the second or third paragraph -- she is descended from the sixth Marquess of Anglesey.
She is not an isolated instance. Last month's big British I.P.O. was Oxygen, an "incubator" firm that is supposed to make money by backing other people's business ideas. Its stock soared 3,000 percent on the first day, to a value something like 20 times its capital. (As an English friend put it, the valuation depends on Oxygen being able to find clients smart enough to come up with great business ideas yet dumb enough to sell those ideas for 5 percent of what they are worth.) What was Oxygen's appeal? Its extraordinary list of founders, including Elisabeth Murdoch (daughter of you-know-who) and Matthew Freud, a famed publicist who is the good doctor's great-grandson.
Even The Financial Times found itself moved to a bit of populist bile: "The internet, which was supposed to be a great leveler -- cutting through class and traditional networks -- has instead quickly become a platform for the rise of a new/old moneyed elite. The names of some individuals read like an extract from Debrett's the reference book on the aristocracy ."
But I don't really mean to single out Britain. There are other places where the same phenomenon -- investor enthusiasm for the new economy mysteriously turning into a get-richer-quick scheme for elite families -- has literally run wild. In Hong Kong police had to be called out to control the crowds trying to purchase shares in Tom.com, an Internet offering by the powerful businessman Li Ka-shing. And the market placed such a high valuation on Pacific Century Cyberworks, a company founded by his son, Richard Li, that Mr. Li the younger was able to take control of Hong Kong's principal telephone company. (An Asian version of AOL-Time Warner? Not quite: Pacific Century has no subscribers and almost no revenue.)
Now the U.S. is not a classless meritocracy. Our next president will not be a self-made man. Our business elite, as my M.I.T. colleague Peter Temin points out in a recent paper, still consists disproportionately of tall men from well-off WASP families. Still, it's hard to imagine American investors pouring money into a company that has no plausible business plan, simply because the founder comes from a prominent family.
Indeed, to a remarkable extent America's new economy seems to be the creation of new men (and a few new women). Not only weren't they born to wealth; in many cases they are immigrants or the children of immigrants. (Asians own nearly a quarter of Silicon Valley startups.) The old line that "It's not what you know, it's who you know" has never seemed less true.
So let's hear it for America, where our technology stars are selling ideas, not connections and -- who knows? -- might actually make money for their stockholders.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
War Talk Is Cheap. War Isn't. Keep Talking.

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
THERE'S been plenty of talk of war between China and Taiwan recently, but the oratory obscures a more concrete calculus -- one based not on missile throw-weight but on dollars and cents. By that calculus, preparations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait remain modest and, according to the experts, will most likely stay that way.
While China has been modestly beefing up its arsenal against Taiwan in hopes of eventually forcing the island to negotiate reunification with the mainland, there has been no dramatic increase in spending that would signal a shift toward a war economy. 
 One part of the calculus is that in the long run, China can much better afford a future arms race than Taiwan, but is not yet willing to risk the cost to its economic growth. That casts some light on why China has so far been willing to raise the decibel level of its threats against Taiwan, without dramatically increasing its preparations for a shooting war.
Of course China is modernizing its army, as can be expected of a country its size. But that has been known for some time, and the pace of that modernization remains slow. There is no concerted attempt, for example, to build the kind of amphibious fleet that would be needed to transport an invasion force across the narrow strait -- a project that could take a decade to complete. And China's military spending is still only about a tenth of what the United States spends, or less than 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The Soviet Union, by contrast, spent more than 20 percent of its G.D.P. on defense at the height of the cold war.
China has preferred instead to put general economic development ahead of military development, following Deng Xiaoping's maxim that national strength derives from the economy rather than the barrel of a gun. The strategy has served the country well in recent years as the government ramped up infrastructure spending to slow a slide in economic growth, something it might not have been as free to do had military spending commanded a larger share of the national budget.
China's military spending has been increasing in recent years -- a sizable ship costs several billion dollars -- but the country is reluctant to allow its army to grow overly dependent on any outside supplier, least of all a historically unstable ally such as Russia, its main source of foreign arms today.
At the same time, stepping up domestic arms production would present problems of its own. China's domestic arms industry has proven abysmal by most measures in areas other than missile, tank and artillery production. The country has been working since the early 1980's to develop a high-tech fighter, the F-10, but has only recently got prototypes into the air.
That's not to say that China isn't seeking to create a genuine military threat with which to scare Taiwan into serious talks. Toward this end, the country has bought from Russia two Sovremenny guided missile destroyers and four diesel electric Kilo-class submarines. It has bought 48 SU-27 advanced fighter jets and has begun assembling kits for 200 more. And it has agreed to buy still more advanced SU-30's.
"Our preparation for war against Taiwan's independence will not stop, regardless of what happens in Taiwan, because we have to prepare for the worst situation," says Shen Dingli, an arms control expert at Fudan University here. "If the U.S. gives Taiwan more weapons," he adds, "this will fan an arms race, but it is an arms race China can afford."
On that count, Mr. Shen appears to be right. China could easily double domestic defense spending without putting an undue strain on its economy. And its fat foreign reserves, which at $155 billion are the largest in the world after Japan's, could pay for much of what China needs from abroad if it wanted to decisively shift the cross-strait balance of power in its favor.
BUT that is not something China appears ready to do just yet. Drawing down reserves would increase the country's cost of foreign capital, weaken its currency and further delay economic reforms that depend on eventual convertibility of the yuan. And domestic weapons spending would widen the country's budget deficit and divert resources needed to keep the overall economy plugging along.
There are other constraints on accelerating the buildup as well.
Both armies, for example, are already struggling to absorb sophisticated arms they can't yet use. This means, on both sides of the strait, that any commitment to new systems stretches out the time frame for an arms race -- and for investing in it.
"Even if China did begin a crash program on some systems, which they haven't begun in my view, it will take at least four to six years for the new systems to enter the inventory," says David Shambaugh, a specialist on the Chinese military at George Washington University. He says it will be several years before China can confidently wield the recently purchased Russian destroyers in a conflict.
In fact, experts say, China is likely to opt for a far cheaper and more focused buildup, one that Taiwan will find itself hard pressed to outrun. Already, the mainland possesses enough short-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm Taiwan's defenses. That raises the possibility that the United States might develop a broader missile defense system and apply it to Taiwan. But then China could just build more missiles, which cost a fraction of what it costs to shoot them down.
In the face of the threat of a missile attack, Taiwan has requested more powerful arms from the United States -- most recently destroyers equipped with Aegis anti-missile systems and Tomahawk cruise missiles with a striking range well beyond the width of the narrow strait. But here the United States may well think twice, because increasing the weaponry in the strait could increase the risk of accidental conflict.
"Today, neither side has an air-to-air or cruise missile with a range of more than 40 miles and that creates a buffer, it gives them time to think," says Larry Wortzel, a retired United States Army colonel and former military attache in Beijing who is now at the Heritage Foundation.
AND given the economic calculus, pushing China into an arms race is likely only to erode the considerable potential for constructive political dialogue. That potential is also better understood by following economic logic, with Taiwanese businesses having invested more than $40 billion in the mainland and showing interest in investing more.
"In the end, weapons are not going to solve this problem for either side," says Bates Gill, an expert on Chinese weapons at the Brookings Institution. "The attention of all sides needs to focus like a laser beam on the difficult choices of a political answer, not the easy choices of more weapons and more bluster."

HEADLINE: A Nation's High Price For Success

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, is the author of "The Coming Anarchy: Shattering the Dreams of the Post-Cold War."

 BODY:
President Clinton's trip to South Asia is being viewed in terms of a stark contrast: He is visiting India to pay homage to a rising economic and nuclear power, and he will make a token stop in Pakistan to urge restraint and democracy on a military regime struggling to keep the nation from disintegrating.
But the situation in both countries is far more complex. Indeed, the nuclear arms race in the subcontinent and the sporadic fighting in Kashmir are symptoms of how state authority itself is under siege in both countries. 
 On an economist's chart, India is a success story, with millions of new wage earners and a middle class numbering up to 180 million, depending on one's definition of "middle class." But India may not be a rising power at all: its state authority is simply weakening at a slower pace, and in more nuanced ways, than Pakistan's. The paradox is that the fraying of the Indian government is driven not by social and economic failure, but by social and economic dynamism.
While in absolute terms India's middle class has grown, in relative terms it really hasn't. The overwhelming majority of India's billion-plus population is still backbreakingly poor. India is increasingly less an exotic canvas of rustic villages populated by subsistence farmers with little hope for a better lot in life than an industrial and post-industrial dynamo with tens of millions of migrants flooding into polluted, grimy factory encampments. When these workers take on low-wage jobs, new ambitions and resentments come to the fore.
As these workers migrate and come into contact with different ethnic groups and social classes, they are assaulted by the temptations of the pseudo-western city -- luxury cars, night clubs, gangs, pornographic movies. Moreover, their lives are plagued by frequent electricity blackouts, shortages of safe drinking water and poor handling of sewage.
Thus while Westerners romanticize globalization and nouveau riche entrepreneurs, they slight another pivotal, globalized class of the post-cold war world: a growing, industrialized subproletariat that surrounds the great cities not only of India but also of China, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan and other countries.
Whatever language they speak, whatever their skin color or religion, these new inhabitants of the third-world city have similar desires. Many resent the distant national governments that cannot provide them with basic necessities. They are creating new political communities, including religious and ethnic ones. It is notable that the Hindu extremists in India who burned down mosques in the early 1990's and attacked Christians in the late 1990's were for the most part clad in cheap western-style polyester outfits rather than traditional clothes, and came from the working quarters of India's industrialized landscape rather than from its villages.
While the vibrancy and flexibility of India's democracy have been duly celebrated in the West, the thuggery and ballot-rigging that goes on in local elections throughout this new India, along with the rise of regional and sectarian parties at the expense of secular and national ones, are not taken seriously enough. Even as governing authority is weakened by change, the Hindu nationalist government now in power reflects the severe religious ideologies of an angry working class.
India, though never truly stable or tightly controlled to begin with, is becoming increasingly an assemblage of region-states, city-states and tribal entities. Fortunately, this change is occurring slowly enough to avoid cataclysm. But when there is a state in the southwest like Kerala, with literacy and birthrates nearly at first-world levels, and a state like Bihar in the northeast, which is as poor and dysfunctional as anyplace in the third world, then the very notion of India as a single entity becomes all the more disputable.
Foreign policy may be the medium through which the Indian government can most easily assert primacy. As India's governing complexities mount, "the bomb" and the perceived willingness to use it loom brighter as a totem of state legitimacy: "Because we have the bomb, we are an advanced and unified state -- not merely a culturally rich and dynamic civilization!" (A similar scenario holds for China, where the expansion of the subproletariat and the government's trouble exerting control in too many places at once are going hand-in-hand with belligerence toward Taiwan.)
Thus the argument of recent weeks that President Clinton's trip should be used to convince India that it, as the stable and growing power in the region, should take the initiative in calming relations with its crumbling neighbor Pakistan misses the point. It is the challenge of modernity itself that is making India so bellicose.
This is not to play down the crisis in Pakistan. Whereas India's democratic system has at least earned legitimacy through longevity, Pakistan's history is littered with the wreckage of military regimes and ill-fated democratic experiments. While India's religious and ethnic divisions are subtle, complex and not prone to territorial solutions -- Hindus, Muslims and others are sufficiently dispersed to make secession impractical -- Pakistan is somewhat more easily divided: Sindhis in the south, Punjabis in the northeast, Baluchis in the southwest, Pathans in the northwest. More significant, anarchy in Afghanistan has destabilized Pakistan through the flow of drugs and weapons across the border.
Pakistan's democratic leaders in the 1990's -- feudal lords more than real politicians -- destroyed the fabric of civil society. There is no going back to that system, at least not in the immediate future. On the other hand, its military and intelligence community is compromised by extremist elements that, among other things, provide support for Islamic holy warriors fighting India in Kashmir. Americans delude themselves if they think the choice is between democracy and dictatorship in Pakistan. For the moment, the choice is between Gen. Pervez Musharraf's relatively benign and tenuous dictatorship and some theocratic nightmare.
The last thing General Musharraf needs is a lecture about swiftly holding elections. It took decades before Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's military rule in Turkey provided the institutional base for successful democratic experimentation, and Pakistan today is as complex and unstable as Ataturk's Turkey. Because Pakistan's regime is so precarious, its reliance on the prestige of nuclear weapons is as great, if not greater, than India's.
These two countries are prime examples of the transition many nations in the developing world are undergoing as they become more fractured and urbanized, and poorer in basic resources. Some states, here and there, will unravel. We can live with that. What we cannot live with are large failed states with nuclear weapons. Therefore, the last thing we should want are weak populist regimes -- democratic or not -- that may act on impulse to legitimize themselves.

Suffolk Asks Towns To Slow Development

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
The Suffolk County Legislature unanimously approved a measure last week asking towns and villages to delay development approvals voluntarily for a year while county planners prepare a "smart growth" outline to limit sprawl.
The plan, which would be only advisory for towns and villages but binding on county agencies, would promote revitalization of older downtown areas, recycling of vacant commercial properties and transfers of development rights to direct construction away from open land. 
 The sponsor, Virginia Fields, a first-term Democrat legislator from Oakdale, said "smart growth" techniques were being used successfully in other regions.
"I grew up on Long Island and I have watched the changes in the landscape," said Ms. Fields, 54. "I have heard the complaints. I have heard the people saying, 'What are they doing now?' And it's time we did something to stop these negative effects of development."
But the Babylon supervisor, Richard H. Schaffer, a Democrat, said he saw obstacles to suspending approvals. "I don't mind the county giving us suggestions," he said, "and the objective is laudable. But I don't think an outright stop would be practical, just from an economic standpoint."
In Huntington, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Frank P. Petrone, a Republican, said the town was already using similar planning techniques. "Traditionally, zoning and land-use decisions are within the jurisdiction of the towns," said the spokeswoman, Patricia Reiss. "I don't know how they will feel about Suffolk County coming in and saying they can do it better." JOHN RATHER

An Insecure City Loses, or Rediscovers, Its Identity

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
PEOPLE here recoiled at the news last week that The Los Angeles Times had been sold to an out-of-town company, with many moaning that this insecure city -- frequently described by its residents as a shapeless megalopolis that doesn't even have, or deserve, a professional football team -- had been robbed of an essential piece of its identity.
But the real symbolic weight of the event may not have been that the Tribune Company, a media giant from Chicago, bought the city's most influential newspaper, but that it was up for sale in the first place. 
 The notion that the institutional voice of this multi-throated city, controlled for more than a century by a wealthy family that defined the establishment, was suddenly up for grabs was so telling because, more than anything, the deal drove home the reality that Los Angeles' once solid civic architecture has been largely dismantled in recent years, under pressure from dramatic economic and demographic changes. And no one is quite sure what will replace it.
Yet what was disconcerting for many is that it is not at all clear what kind of power structure will replace the one that appeared to be waning.
"With the sale of The Los Angeles Times there's a loss of the last remnants of our old governing structure," said Antonio Villaraigosa, the speaker of the California State Assembly and a declaredcandidate for next year's mayoral race. "Something will take the place of the old structure, but it's hard to say what it will look like."
Jose Legaspi, a real estate developer and a member of the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he believed that the talk here all week of a loss of identity with the sale of The Los Angeles Times was really code for the resistance of many people to the strong tide of ethnic change.
"The loss of identity was not because companies were sold but because of the demographic changes here," Mr. Legaspi said. "People tended to react against it. The business and political leaders, the old stakeholders, they didn't know how to deal with that."
Eli Broad, the chairman of Sun America and a longstanding civic booster who has helped create two major museums and is a leader of the committee planning the Democratic presidential convention this summer, said he agreed that some people were overreacting simply out of fear of the new. The city still has powerful basketball (the Lakers) and baseball (the Dodgers) franchises, he noted, and the economy, now driven by small, entrepreneurial companies, is thriving. He said, though, that the changes were deep, their ultimate impact uncertain.
"I wish it hadn't happened," Mr. Broad said of the sale of the newspaper. "I wish it had stayed with local ownership, but I'm not sure it matters. The old power structure is changing and we're headed toward something new."
THE signs of civic change have been conspicuous. Forty years ago, when the city's elite decided that they needed a major new performing arts center, Buffy Chandler, the wife of The Los Angeles Times' publisher, Norman Chandler, organized her friends and built a world-class complex. Just a few years ago, efforts to construct a new cultural complex downtown, Disney Hall, foundered embarrassingly for lack of money until a last ditch private fund-raising effort got construction moving.
Los Angeles lost out to Houston last year in a bid to get a new professional football franchise, in large measure because city leaders would not offer as generous a financial package. The San Fernando Valley, a generally affluent, mostly white swath of the city, has been trying to secede.
Giant corporate citizens like Lockheed, Rockwell International, Unocal and First Interstate Bank have either moved, been sold or broken up, and now Arco, a staunch city booster for years, is set to be sold.
But even while there are signs that the cohesiveness of the old elite has frayed, there are also signs that a new civic order is taking shape and that it is responding to the realities of a city which is roughly 60 percent Hispanic and Asian American and less than 28 percent non-Hispanic white .
For instance, this past week the Autry Museum of Western Heritage said it would open a major exhibit this summer documenting the role of Chinese Americans in the west, the largest such show of its kind.
In a departure from its traditional focus on middle-class car culture, the Petersen Auto Museum has a first-of-its-kind exhibit on lowriders, the flamboyant street cruisers favored by Chicanos here. When the Getty Museum was initially flooded with visitors, it eliminated all radio advertising, except on Spanish-language stations.
The United Way of Los Angeles, an organization whose board was often seen as a badge of prestige for the city's elite, announced earlier this year that it was adopting a new philosophy under which it would cut contributions to many of the organizations it had traditionally supported, like the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association.
INSTEAD, it will start contributing a portion of the $62 million it raises each year to programs that focus on poor people in the inner city -- meaning largely new immigrants. And the group says it will be offering not hand-outs but programs to help the recipients get better jobs, buy their own homes and prepare their children for English-language schools.
"We were very much colorblind in making this new policy," said Dominic Ng, the chairman of EastWest Bank and head of the United Way committee that formulated the policy. "But what we did will move us away from what you might call mainstream white America. Los Angeles is changing, so we had to change. You can't look back and be sentimental. You move forward and respond to the realities."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS: Pumped Up;
As Oil Prices Explode, What's Next? Voters?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SUPER TUESDAY has come and gone, but stand by for another defining event.
Call it OPEC Monday. 
 Consider the stage. The oil cartel, once dismissed as a has-been, has displayed startling muscle in the past year, sending oil prices tripling to more than $30 a barrel. That has sent gasoline prices soaring, and suddenly the American economy no longer seems quite so invincible.
At the next meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, on March 27 in Vienna, the question on the table will be whether it is time to reverse the price tide. The answer matters a lot, and not just to experts worried about the pace of international economic growth. In this election year, what happens a week from tomorrow will touch directly on American wallets, by determining just what kinds of prices American voters confront every time they pull up to the pump all spring and summer -- and right up to Election Day.
Little wonder, then, that oil is quickly becoming an issue between George W. Bush and Al Gore, who effectively clinched their party's nominations in the Super Tuesday primaries of March 7.
"This is the kind of issue voters take home with them," said Andrew Kohut, a public opinion expert and director of the Pew Research Center in Washington. "On some issues, like campaign finance, that don't really affect voters directly, the voters will often say that neither candidate is any better than the other. But on issues that affect the old pocketbook, there is a greater propensity for voters to choose sides."
Until now, a bedrock assumption about the political campaign has been that anyone trying to unseat the Democrats from the White House would have a tough job persuading Americans to be dissatisfied. Even as Wall Street rockets along, the economy has managed to keep inflation down and unemployment almost nonexistent at the same time -- for most of a decade. That is not the kind of situation to make a voter uneasy about his or her wallet, or resentful of a member of the White House team. Or so Al Gore's managers have assumed.
Enter uncertainty. A first blast of ire over soaring fuel prices is already being registered by American truckers, who have demonstrated twice in Washington in the past month. And government statistics released last week showed that producer prices increased by 1 percent in February, their largest such gain in a decade.
NEARLY all of that surge was due to higher energy costs. Even though Wall Street seemed to shrug off the bad news, the inescapable nature of gasoline prices will make them all but impossible for ordinary Americans to ignore, experts say. Bad news at the pump is bound to compound any gnawing sense of uneasiness, particularly if the Federal Reserve Board continues to weigh in against inflation with incremental increases in interest rates.
"Gasoline prices are the most visible prices in the United States," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at the University of South Georgia. "Every time you drive to and from work, they're staring you in the face."
Translate that into political terms, and it is easy to understand how high the stakes are for the Clinton Administration, and Mr. Gore in particular, at that meeting in Vienna eight days hence. Even if a decision is made then to boost oil production, prices will remain high over the summer. But if they are receding by, say, October, voters could approach Election Day reassured about the future. And that is what Democrats are hoping for.
It also helps explain the sense of alarm with which the administration sent Energy Secretary Bill Richardson off to the Middle East to push for a decision to produce more. For now, at least, all signs do point to such a move, , easing the yearlong shortage if not eliminating it. In the last week, prices have fallen back from their $34 peak, thanks to a Saudi-Iranian agreement to seek a production hike.
One thing going for the Americans as they seek a price rollback is the knowledge that the oil producers' unity last year was exceptional -- a product of cooperation not just among OPEC members but by non-OPEC members like Mexico and Norway, whose economies also suffered when prices fell too low. Now the situation is reversed, and Americans can argue that if oil prices choke the American economy, the producers will be damaging their most important customer, on which the entire global economy and their hopes for economic partnership rely.
Mr. Richardson made that case on a two-week trip last month in which he met with top Saudi and Kuwaiti officials. He has also made it in meetings with other oil producers, including Venezuela, a member of the cartel, as well as Mexico and Norway. Those last two have already signaled a receptiveness to the American argument, and neither is expected to sign on to renewed OPEC production limits, making them much harder to enforce.
Still, despite Mr. Richardson's entreaties, at least some OPEC countries -- particularly price hawks like Iraq, Libya and Algeria -- have so far remained reluctant to tamper much with a strategy that restored their upper hand after years of budget shortfalls that they traced to low oil prices.
What many remember with trepidation is what happened after a meeting in Jakarta in 1997, the last time the cartel agreed to a big production increase. The price of oil plunged, ultimately to well below $10 a barrel. That is what set the stage for last year's production cutback.
This time, no one is sure how far the countries will be prepared to go. The experts' best guess so far is a quota hike of about 1 million barrels a day -- less than half of the 2 million to 2.5 million barrels a day that Energy Department statisticians say will be needed to meet world demand.
Based on that scenario, the department's Energy Information Agency still predicts that American gasoline prices will turn higher before there is any sign of relief. The national average, now at $1.53 a gallon, is now projected to peak at between $1.56 and $1.80 a gallon sometime in May. And though prices would then begin to turn down, it is highly unlikely that the average price would drop below $1.30 a gallon by Election Day, said Jay Hakes, the agency's director.
That sets the scenes for a long summer and autumn in which high gas prices could become an even bigger part of American life and the presidential campaign.
ALREADY, Republicans have rushed to exploit what they see as a chink in Vice President Gore's economic armor.
Governor Bush has said he would have pressed harder to persuade OPEC countries to "turn on the spigots," and said he is considering a call to repeal a 4.3 cent federal gas tax approved in 1993 as part of President Clinton's economic plan, for which Vice President Gore cast the tiebreaking vote.
A Gore spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, said: "The Administration is in tough negotiations with the OPEC countries, and that is where the solution lies."
One Republican, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, is calling for cuts in aid and arms sales to OPEC members, on grounds that the organization is seeking a stranglehold on the world economy. So far, though, the two presidential candidates have steered clear of such table-thumping.
Perhaps tellingly, the Clinton Administration chose last week to extend a new olive branch to Iran, a major adversary for 21 years but also a pivotal member of OPEC. Last year, its cooperation with Saudi Arabia in clamping down on production was crucial in the decision to squeeze oil supplies. This year, it and Saudi Arabia seem likely to play precisely the opposite role.
News of the gesture to Iran immediately provoked criticism from some Republicans on grounds that Iran remains on America's list of terrorist nations. But, then, it was also a week when the television news was showing some gas prices hitting $2 a gallon.

HEADLINE: New Amnesty May Lure More Illegal Immigrants

 BODY:
Re: " 'Hidden' Workers Nurse Hope of Amnesty" Feb. 27 . Such an amnesty would be a major mistake.
In 1986 Congress granted amnesty to three million illegal aliens. This was to be a one-time amnesty. Since then an estimated six million immigrants have entered this country illegally. Granting amnesty again would send a signal that you can become an American by breaking the law, then waiting for the next amnesty. This is unfair to those who have waited so long to enter this country legally. 
 It has been estimated that half the gap in wages between high school dropouts and other workers is due to the immigration of unskilled laborers. While economic conditions may be harsh in other countries, those countries are responsible for their citizens' lot. The United States does not exist to improve the lives of citizens of other countries by hurting the lives of Americans. Permitting illegal immigration is not the answer.

The Politics of Race And the Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE four words on the census form, "check all that apply," sound more bureaucratic than revolutionary. Yet when used in a question asking people to describe their race, those words represent the latest shake-up in the way the country views itself racially.
With high levels of immigration, rising rates of intermarriage and groups clamoring for recognition, America's racial and ethnic stew is undergoing radical change. Some people say this change portends the end of whites as the majority race by the middle of the next century -- a dubious theory as best. 
 Even if whites retain their numerical dominance, the subtly changing flavor of the country's racial and ethnic bouillabaisse is already reflected in the forms the Census Bureau is mailing to more than 120 million households this month. For the first time people can describe themselves as members of one or more of six racial categories. They can check all that apply. Thus individuals could list themselves as white or black or white and Asian or black and white and American Indian and "other."
The resulting 63 potential variations have caused confusion among sociologists and statisticians, provoked consternation among some civil rights advocates and become the butt of jokes among late-night comedians. The new categories also raise questions about how the government will keep track of this new racial and ethnic mix (and whether it should be classifying people by race at all). The changes point out an abiding feature of this country's racial history: when it comes to determining what exactly is a racial category, politics, not biology, is the deciding factor.
Orlando Patterson, a sociologist at Harvard University, said that at different times Jews, Italians and Irish were considered separate races. But as they gained more economic and political power, the larger society accepted them as white and ethnic. At one point the census categorized some blacks according to how many white ancestors they had. But as state-sanctioned segregation arose, all people of African descent were classified into one race -- black. "These are all basically political decisions," Professor Patterson said. "The census always just reflects changing attitudes."
The odyssey of the mixed race category on the census form is further testament to political forces. The grouping was first promoted by officials in the Office of Management and Budget, which sets policy on racial classifications. They were moved by the heartfelt stories of parents whose children were forced to select either the race of the father or of the mother. In response, the officials initially proposed a new category, "multiracial."
CIVIL rights organizations were aghast, fearing that the grouping would dilute the numbers of blacks, Asians-Americans or American Indians. They worried that smaller figures would make it harder to show discrimination patterns and to draw legislative districts where minorities constitute the majority of voters.
In the end, said Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, the civil rights groups "won less on the strength of our intellectual arguments, and more on our political strength. O.M.B. backed down."
When the budget office said that instead of a multiracial category, people could check more than one racial category, civil rights groups put enough pressure on the Clinton Administration that the budget office announced last week that people who list themselves as part white and part minority will be counted as a member of that minority group.
Civil rights groups did not relish this battle. Many readily admit that the issue pulls them between two contending beliefs: self-determination and their view of a way to fight discrimination.
"Discrimination is not about who you think you are," Ms. Narasaki said. "I could run around thinking I'm white. Many Asians do. Does that help them in the end? Not always because other people say, 'No, you're not.' "
Still the swirl of categories and politics has prompted calls for the federal government to stop grouping people by race and ethnicity.
"We're back to the one drop rule," said Michael Lind, a senior fellow with the New America Foundation, referring to the old segregationist rule of thumb that designated people with scant black blood as black. "I'm disgusted with the whole thing. This census should have been the first one not to identify people by race. Mexico got rid of its racial classifications in the 1820's. We keep ours basically because of the black civil rights lobby, which has lobbied in favor of the one drop rule."
Still, whether people like it or not, America's racial mix is shifting, primarily because of rising rates of intermarriage.
Census figures in 1960 show that there were about 149,000 interracial marriages, generally between whites and blacks, whites and Asians, and whites and Indians. In 1990 there were more than 1.46 million. Experts say the numbers have risen even faster during the last decade. The figures do not include marriages between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, which have grown rapidly.
The experts have estimated that in 1990 among young native-born Hispanic women, 31.4 percent have non-Hispanic white husbands and that among young Hispanic men, 31.6 have non-Hispanic white wives. The figures are even higher for Asians where 45.2 percent of native-born women and 36 percent of native-born men have white spouses.
But intermarriage is far less common for blacks. In contrast only about 8 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women marry outside their race.
Mr. Lind sees a new racial divide appearing: on one side, blacks; on the other non-blacks, which would include whites and the offspring of whites and other racial and ethnic minorities. What that will mean in terms of solidarity among people of color and for the aspirations of African-Americans is anyone's guess.
STILL others like Professor Patterson see an even more nuanced trend emerging: the Census Bureau's dress rehearsal for the 2000 Census held last year in Sacramento, Calif., and rural counties in South Carolina found that intermarriage rates among blacks and whites were far lower in South Carolina than in California where Hispanics and Asians are much more prevalent and marrying whites in large numbers.
Professor Patterson said that in areas like the Northeast, the Southwest and West Coast where there has been more immigration tests show that a new racial amalgam that includes blacks will emerge, while other sections like the South and the Midwest will be left behind. "Certain parts of the country are going to become bastions of the one drop rule," he said.

New Jersey's unemployment rate was back above 4 percent in February, the state reported last week. The rate went from an 11-year low of 3.9 percent in January to 4.1 percent in February, the state Department of Labor reported. Nonetheless, the February rate was still the second lowest level since July 1989, and the 29th month in a row that the rate was below 5 percent, the state said. Non-agricultural jobs dipped by 1,600, from among a total workforce of 3.9 million. STEVE STRUNSKY

Little Everyday Inflation

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Americans expect to spend an average of $15,210 this year on day-to-day expenses. A survey of 800 adults by American Express found that amounts spent on items like groceries, gasoline, fast food and cellular and Internet services would remain relatively unchanged from 1999 to 2000; in last year's survey, respondents reported $14,917 in such expenses. 
 The survey also found that men and women are involved in household financial management in different ways. Seventy-two percent of women and 52 percent of men said they handled bill-paying; 57 percent of the men and 43 percent of the women said they made investment decisions.

Sweet Buys in Lemons Of Car-Dealer Stocks?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
AT first, it hardly seems worth the effort to kick the tires of beaten-up auto dealership stocks. Interest rates are rising, gasoline is more than $1.50 a gallon at the pump, and competition from online car dealers like Autobytel.com and Autoweb has scared investors.
Most important, America's largest automotive dealership, AutoNation, under its chairman, H. Wayne Huizenga, has put a chill on the sector. Analysts say it overpaid for acquisitions, found itself undercut on prices because of a misguided "no haggle" pricing policy and was forced to shutter 23 used-car superstores. Its rental car division, which includes Alamo and National, has also suffered and is being spun off to shareholders. AutoNation's stock is down 37.2 percent over the last 12 months. 
 Its rivals, the UnitedAuto Group, Lithia Motors and Sonic Automotive have not had these same problems. Yet all of their stocks have hit 52-week lows in the last two months.
So, are any of these stocks good values? Well, Americans' penchant for new cars shows few signs of easing. In February, United States car and light truck sales rose 6.1 percent, putting the nation on course to hit a record 17.7 million in vehicle sales this year versus 16.96 million vehicles last year. And the dealership companies as a whole posted 37.5 percent earnings growth in 1999 and should grow 20 to 30 percent this year, said Tom Thomson, an analyst at First Union Securities.
Moreover, the industry remains ripe for consolidation. "This is a very fragmented market, with the top 10 players only accounting for 5 percent of the market," said Timothy G. Fogarty, an analyst at ING Barings.
All of this is prompting some investors to take a closer look at auto dealers. Juliet Ellis, manager of the Chase Vista Small Cap Equity fund, said she considered Lithia of Medford, Ore., to be a growth stock because the company's earnings rose 40 percent in 1999. But its sharp drop in price also makes the stock appealing to value investors, she added. Lithia, with 101 dealer franchises, is focused on six Western states and has been growing quickly through well-priced acquisitions. "They know what they are doing," Ms. Ellis said.
She added that Lithia is relatively well-insulated from a possible downturn of the economy, because its fixed costs are low and its margins are high. Lithia's Class A shares closed on Friday at $15.50. Mr. Fogarty has a strong buy on the stock, and a 12-month price target of $30.
Shares of UnitedAuto, which is based in Manhattan but operates 104 franchises mostly in the South, hit a 52-week low of $7.4375 last Tuesday. But sales for franchises open at least a year were up 9.7 percent for the fourth quarter, and its financing and insurance business revenues were up an impressive 22.8 percent.
The company is unloading underperforming dealerships and is benefiting from the leadership, analysts say, of Roger Penske, named chief executive last May. Mr. Penske, who is also chairman of Penske Corporation, the transportation giant, holds a stake of more than 40 percent in UnitedAuto. In December, the company announced plans to buy back three million of its shares.
"Penske is a winner, or at least he has been in previous business ventures," said Gordon Grender, manager of the GAMerica Capital fund. Shares now trade at $8.6875, or 7.9 times his 2000 earnings estimate of $1.10 a share.
Sonic Automotive, of Charlotte, N.C., operates 165 franchises in 12 states, mostly in the Southeast and California. The company's earnings growth has been 50 percent or more for nine consecutive quarters. The stock now trades at $8.5625.
"Sonic is the best of the bunch," said N. Richard Nelson Jr., an analyst at Stephens Inc., who thinks the shares can hit $25 in 12 months.

HEADLINE: Early Campaign Clashes

 BODY:
Removing any doubts that theirs would be a long, tough campaign for the White House, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush attacked each other last week in extremely personal terms. Whether the public as a whole has an appetite for months of squabbling is an interesting question. Mr. Bush has the additional problem of demonstrating that he truly is a uniter, not a divider, of his own party. Based on his resistance to fully embracing the campaign finance agenda of Senator John McCain and the confusion over meshing his policies with those of Congressional Republicans, he has some work to do.
Both candidates need to reach beyond their parties as well. The task may be easier for Mr. Gore simply because while Mr. Bush was forced to the right to get the nomination, the vice president stayed in the center. But Mr. Bush is clearly hoping that he can prevent the vice president from winning independent votes by hammering at the issue of Mr. Gore's trustworthiness. That is part of the reason this campaign has begun on such a sour note. By asserting that Mr. Gore will do anything to win the election, the governor may have hit on an effective way of tying together the doubts that many people have about Mr. Gore's tendency to exaggerate and his fund-raising in 1996. 
 But the problem for Mr. Bush is that he cannot yet claim to have calmed down his party. He asserted in an interview with this newspaper that his views had not been changed by his competition with Mr. McCain, then later took a more conciliatory tone. The Bush and McCain camps are in a struggle over the makeup of the Michigan delegation. This week, when Mr. McCain returns to Washington, he may well renew his demands for Mr. Bush to become a full supporter of campaign-finance reform.
Mr. Bush has begun sending signals to Republican Congressional leaders that he would love a compromise with the White House that might take gun control off the table. But G.O.P. hard-liners, echoing the National Rifle Association, do not want to give an inch. On budget issues there is even more discord. Mr. Bush's tax-cut scheme is so extreme that the Republican leadership rejected it, coming up with a smaller tax cut.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore faces a test of his own skills as a uniter on the trade issue. Many Democrats are opposed to granting favorable trade status to China and approving its entry into the World Trade Organization. Some cite China's human rights record while others are simply echoing organized labor. Mr. Gore has made clear his own support of China's membership in the W.T.O., but he is not exactly leading the fight on Capitol Hill. He is leaving that to President Clinton. Mr. Bush, by contrast, has been speaking in favor of Chinese membership, even though some in his party would block China because of human rights.
No one expects either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore to be singing from his party song book all the time. But these early tests of their ability to work with their own colleagues may give clues as to their ability to reach out to skeptics in the middle. There was a big turnout of independent voters this year, in large part because of Mr. McCain. On the Democratic side, for all the fireworks of the contest between Mr. Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, turnout was low. Voters may want more than eight months of hurling insults. They will be looking for signs of maturity, leadership and an ability to listen.

Step Right Up, Test Your Skill And Win a Job

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: SOMERSET, N.J.

 BODY:
JOYCE AXELROD and her partner, wearing matching red shirts and white pants, delivered the exact same pitch again and again to the milling crowd. Ms. Axelrod is no day worker hawking soap samples on the street. She is a business executive, and she spent Thursday asking anyone who would listen: "Do you have any clinical research experience? Do you have any clinical research experience?"
Only in certain company is that a workable pick-up line. But Ms. Axelrod was in the thick of it, in a hotel ballroom near New Brunswick amid hundreds of people at a job fair for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and health care industries. 
 When Ms. Axelrod snagged a prospect for her company, which places researchers in jobs, she implored: "Do you know anyone else you can recommend? If we place them, you get $500."
Job fairs, once picked-over salad bars for the downsized, are now smorgasbords where worker-starved companies comb the thin ranks of the underemployed, and where the gainfully employed scout better deals. One day last week, there were two fairs just off I-287, a corridor of corporate campuses and new housing developments, both flush with the sense of possibility.
The fairs -- the other was for high-tech jobs -- drew heavily from the now-fashionable pocket protector crowd, for whom one's abilities are a "skill set" and stock options are not an option, but a must. You could hear a chemist lamenting, "I think I'm going to be stuck in polymers the rest of my life," or a swaggering tech jockey delivering a postmodern come-on: "I'm a hardware guy."
Judy McNish, staffing the popular Aventis Pharmaceuticals booth, said, "You would think that with unemployment as low as it is that this place would be empty, but look at this line." Little wonder, with many drug companies offering on-site fitness clubs, convenience stores, dry cleaners, day care and prepared dinners -- plus top salaries and flextime. Still, she said, "we really have a lot of open positions."
That's why Brad Roman and Tom Molesky, fresh business grads of Fairleigh Dickinson, were in the Aventis line envisioning entry-level sales jobs paying $40,000, a car, a laptop, maybe a 401(k).
More people at the Hirehealth fair were like John DeMarco. "I'm a physicist," he said, "and I'm just here to see how much I'm underpaid." Happy with his job, he said he had taken off work to meet with a roofer about his new house -- which could make anyone look hard at his paycheck. How far underpaid is he? "About $10,000."
The glitter of promise can be harsh for those left out. John Lewinson, a chemist in his "low 60's," has been trying to fit into the soaring drug industry since his chemical industry job was eliminated a few years ago. A consultant, he's often told he's overqualified for permanent jobs, which he takes as a euphemism for being too old. "I've kept my spirits up," he said.
Eroding loyalty on all sides of the work equation feeds the perpetual job hunt. An information technology specialist waiting in the Bayer Corporation line said that since emigrating from Russia a decade ago he had worked for three major corporations "and a couple of smaller ones."
Three hours later, the 48-year-old surfaced at the Hi-Tech Career Fair 30 miles north in Parsippany. "This is a country where all your dreams become reality."
Lorne A. Epstein, recruiting for Telco Systems, a computer communications company in Washington and Boston, came to Parsippany in desperate search of engineers and programmers. Last week he prospected in Ottawa. The salaries, he said, "are getting crazy."
Telco's literature promises a "highly competitive compensation and benefit package, including 401(k), two weeks' vacation, casual dress and volleyball and basketball courts for lunchtime games."
The atmosphere of plenty is infectious, even for a high-tech recruiter, making $40 to $60 an hour. "I met a woman in Ottawa," he said. "She's a contract recruiter. She said, 'Come out to California. I'll pay you $150 an hour.' That's $350,000 a year."
So when's he leaving?
"I thought about it," he said, then corrected himself. "I'm thinking about it."

HEADLINE: Sonny Hine, 69, Skip Away's Adventurous Owner and Trainer

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO 

 BODY:
Sonny Hine, who owned and trained Skip Away, the Horse of the Year in 1998 and one of racing's stars of modern times, died Friday at a hospital in Miami. He was 69.
Hialeah racing officials reported that Hine died of complications from pneumonia. He had been suffering from cancer since 1996. 
 Sonny Hine led a life with adventurous twists that included two years as a fingerprint specialist with the F.B.I. and a stint as a State Department investigator in Hong Kong during the Korean War. He was fluent in the Mandarin dialect of Chinese, which he had studied in an Air Force language school, enabling him to intercept and translate messages.
"They needed someone with an investigative background who could speak Chinese," Hine said. "I was very reluctant to go, but the money was good."
But the abiding passion of his career was the horses he trained, and none stood higher than Skip Away, who was nominally owned by Hine's wife of 37 years, Carolyn, who accompanied him regularly on their racing travels. The gray colt earned $9.6 million, second only to the $10 million won by his great rival, Cigar.
In the Jockey Club Gold Cup in 1996, Skip Away defeated Cigar and came back to win the race again the next year, starting a nine-race winning streak that ended when he ran third in the Gold Cup in 1998. Along the way, he also won the Pimlico Special, Hollywood Gold Cup, Woodward Stakes and Donn Handicap.
In the second start of his winning streak, Skip Away was entered in the Breeders' Cup Classic after Hine paid $480,000 as a supplemental fee because the horse had not been nominated. It was a significant gamble, but Skip Away redeemed his owner's faith by winning the Classic by six lengths in record time of 1:59.
But despite his durability and dramatic performances, Skip Away ran second to Cigar in the voting for Horse of the Year and again ran second in 1997, that time to the juvenile star Favorite Trick.
He won the title Horse of the Year in 1998 at the age of 5.
"He won nine in a row, including seven Grade I's," Hine said with some bitterness after Skip Away was finally honored. "He stayed in training for months on end. What more could he do?"
And Carolyn Hine, who considered Skip Away a member of the family, said with feeling: "If he hadn't won, I would have been numb. This horse deserves all the accolades."
Hubert (Sonny) Hine was born in the Bronx, but was intrigued with horses at a young age. He and his brother Marvin rode horses in match races at fairground meetings and, Hine remembered: "My father trained horses, but he had to make a living doing other things. Training horses was his dream, and I guess that's where I got my interest."
The night he graduated from high school, Sonny Hine hitchhiked to Charles Town race track in West Virginia and, he said, "I've been on and off the race track ever since."
He saddled his first winner, Miss Economy, at Marlboro Race Course in 1948 but then interrupted his career to work for his friend J. Edgar Hoover, director of the F.B.I. He left the bureau in 1950 and, four years later, went to work for the State Department in Hong Kong. Between jobs, he attended college, served in the Air Force and kept his hand in the training of horses.
In addition to Skip Away, he trained Technology; Norquestor; Dawn Quixote; Amber Pass; Best Bet; Cojak; Guilty Conscience, the champion sprinter of 1981, and Skip Trial, the sire of Skip Away.

HEADLINE: Iranians Respond to Overture From the U.S. With Mixed Signals

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, March 18

 BODY:
Iran's reformist government today welcomed Washington's decision to ease some economic sanctions, but cautioned that the change in United States policy was not enough to warrant an immediate restoration of long-broken ties.
The American overture brought a mixed response from key conservatives in the government, highlighting the domestic political battle that reformers will face to mend fences with Washington. 
 Tehran will give a "positive and appropriate response" to the United States' decision to end import restrictions on Iranian-made carpets and to reduce tariffs on pistachios and caviar, said Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, the Iranian representative to the United Nations.
"It's a positive step and a prelude to a new situation," he said. "But it's not sufficient to change the current state of relations rapidly or substantially."
A rapid rapprochement would require an end to the United States embargo on Iran's oil and gas industry, which accounts for 85 percent of its hard-currency income, as well as an end to American accusations of state terrorism, Mr. Hosseinian said.
"Changes will be possible when there is no pressure, no embargo, no accusations and above all, when there is no longer this superiority complex from one side," he said.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced the changes on Friday in Washington's first policy response to the reformers' landslide victory in parliamentary elections last month.
But the mixed response she drew from conservatives here highlighted the differences that still split the Iranian government over the pace of any opening to the United States. The head of Iran's top security agency, Hassan Rouhani, said Dr. Albright's statement was "repugnant and unacceptable."
"We must condemn this new and flagrant interference in our affairs," said Mr. Rouhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. "This statement is full of irksome, threatening and interventionist elements, which call our institutions into question."
Mr. Rouhani, who lost his seat in Parliament in the recent vote, grudgingly welcomed Dr. Albright's acknowledgement of past United States policy errors toward Iran, including Washington's support of the 1953 coup that restored Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to power, and its backing of Iraq during its war with Iran in the 1980's. But he derided Washington's decision to ease restrictions on non-oil imports and to move to lift a freeze on billions of dollars of Iranian assets in the United States, which has been in place since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
"It is only a tiny step, which appears positive but is in fact completely negative," Mr. Rouhani said.
But Mohammad Javad Larijani, another conservative member of Parliament, was more upbeat. "This statement is something new, and as such merits careful examination," he said.

HEADLINE: DECISION IN TAIWAN: THE NATIONALISTS;
Party Undone by Liberty It Nurtured

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

 BODY:
The Taiwanese election marks a huge defeat for the Nationalist Party, which in the 20th century controlled first China and then Taiwan, and which presided over the emergence of the very democratic forces that ultimately upended it.
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great Chinese nationalist and revolutionary, formed a predecessor organization of the Nationalist Party in 1894 while he was living in exile in Hawaii. The party's initial aim was to overthrow the corrupt Qing Dynasty, which was already disintegrating and finally collapsed in 1911-12. 
 The party dominated China for the next few tumultuous decades, although power was also divided among warlords and for a time the Japanese invaders. Party leaders, such as Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, were initially impressed by the organization of the Soviet Communist Party and modeled the Nationalist Party along Leninist principles, even calling each other "comrade."
While they had a good deal of support from Americans, the Nationalists became detested in China because of their corruption, brutality and failure to fight the Japanese invaders. In 1949, the Communists under Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalists and forced them to flee and move their seat of government to the offshore island of Taiwan, which had just been recovered from Japan in 1945.
Some two million Nationalist soldiers and officials settled on Taiwan, where they were bitterly resented by many local people. In particular, the Nationalists were hated for massacring local people during upheavals that began on Feb. 28, 1947, and ever since then the phrase "2-28" has been a sensitive code word in Taiwan that conjures those antagonisms between local people and the mainlanders.
The Communists might well have seized Taiwan in the early 1950's, because Generalissimo Chiang's army was in chaos and America was unwilling to help it. But then fate intervened: In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, and Americans became increasingly fearful of Communism around the world. The upshot was that President Truman sent the Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan. Ever since, the United States has either promised or hinted that it would protect Taiwan from a mainland Chinese attack.
In ruling Taiwan, the Nationalist Party had little ideology other than self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment. Particularly in the 1950's and 1960's, the security forces under Chiang and his son and successor, Chiang Ching-kuo, often dragged away critics of the regime. Initially, they were often killed immediately; later they tended to face torture and sham trials.
The Nationalists imposed their ideas and language on Taiwan, and children were forced to speak Mandarin Chinese and punished if they spoke the Taiwanese or Hakka dialects that they spoke at home. There was almost no teaching of local history, and instead children learned about distant mainland Chinese provinces that they could never visit.
Yet the Nationalist Party redistributed land, promoted education and encouraged the Taiwanese people to form businesses and get rich. The result was an economic and educational revolution in Taiwan that laid the seeds for a political one as well.
In the 1980's, the Nationalists responded to popular aspirations and began to permit opposition party activities -- although even then critics of the Nationalists were tortured and occasionally killed. The playing field was never level, for the Nationalists manipulated the news media and owned companies that gave them huge economic resources, but they gradually allowed opposition figures to win local elections and form local power bases.
The greatest changes came after the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988. Control of the Nationalist Party passed uneasily to Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese who as vice president was Taiwan's new president. Mr. Lee transformed the Nationalist Party by democratizing it, distancing it from its mainland Chinese roots, and ultimately by creating a more pluralistic Taiwan in which an opposition victory became possible.

HEADLINE: As Prison Labor Grows, So Does the Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: OTAY MESA, Calif.

 BODY:
Behind five barbed-wire fences, four identification checkpoints, two guard towers and one 50,000-volt electric fence sits one of the few remaining solutions to America's tightest labor market in 30 years.
Every weekday, some 100 prisoners report for work at one of three private companies here at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, a series of squat buildings hidden among the hills at the base of Otay Mountain, just five miles from the Mexican border. The men, convicted murderers and robbers among them, stitch T-shirts, recycle tires and make beer and wine vats. 
 Other than the workers' uniformly blue outfits and the armed guards who occasionally patrol the factory floors, the workplace looks quite normal. A radio plays the Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun" and Queen's "We Will Rock You." Hunched over sewing machines or welding together stainless steel vats, the men earn about $5.75 an hour, the California minimum wage. The products end up attached to trendy clothing labels like No Fear and in upscale pubs.
With unemployment low and a record number of Americans behind bars, prison labor is coming to mean much more than painting license plates. As inmates undertake everything from telemarketing to the manufacturing of computer circuit boards and furniture, the change has caused a growing debate, playing out in state legislatures and in two bills before Congress, over the role the nation's two million prisoners should play in its economy.
Across the country, more than 80,000 inmates now hold traditional jobs, working for governments or private companies and earning 25 cents to $7 an hour. The private sector programs, which exist in 36 states and employ 3,500, have doubled in size since 1995 after years of almost no growth. And the federal program that employs 21,000 inmates, up 14 percent in the last two years, and that has $600 million in annual sales, is seeking to expand.
Both supporters and opponents agree the debate is at a critical juncture because employment in prisons could spread quickly in the coming years. On virtually every other question, however -- whether prison labor helps inmates or is cruel to them, whether it is an economic benefit or a force holding down wages -- the two sides differ vehemently.
Supporters of the employment of inmates include law enforcement officials who view the programs as a way to reform convicts and business groups who see inexpensive labor. Many prisoners want to work, the backers say, and they point to research showing that inmates who work are less likely to commit crimes when they are released.
"It's a problem for corrections officers to have prisoners without anything constructive to do," said Edwin Meese III, the former United States attorney general, who lobbies for expanded inmate labor as chairman of the Enterprise Prison Institute, a Bethesda, Md., research group financed by state grants, research centers and private companies.
In addition, supporters say, prisoners offer the ultimate in a flexible and dependable work force. "If I lay them off for a week," said Pierre Sleiman, the owner of the T-shirt company at Donovan, referring to his workers, "I don't have to worry about someone else coming and saying, 'Come work for me.' "
To opponents, inmate labor is both a potential human rights abuse and a threat to workers outside prison walls. Inmates have no bargaining power and are easily exploited, the critics say. In one California lawsuit, for example, two prisoners have sued both their employer and the prison, saying they were put in solitary confinement after complaining about working conditions.
The opponents also say the programs have stolen jobs from outside workers and hold down wages for other workers. Inmate labor, said Gordon Lafer, a political science professor at the University of Oregon, "is a decent-sized problem that is poised to explode."
Most of the companies now in the program are small. Earlier in the 1990's, big companies like AT&T and Microsoft hired inmates, but most backed away after the arrangements were exposed. Some big companies, like the retailer Target, still use suppliers that employ prisoners.
Prison labor in the United States has its roots in the 1800's, when inmates worked for private companies without pay. After hundreds died on the job because of hazardous conditions, unions and prison reformers demanded a halt the practice.
In 1934, however, federal prison officials concerned about growing unrest in prisons lobbied to create a work program. Companies got involved again in 1979, when Congress passed a law allowing them to hire prisoners in some circumstances.
For most of the last two decades, the programs remained tiny. But the tough drug and sentencing laws of the 1980's helped increase the number of Americans behind bars by 80 percent, to two million, in a decade. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, was falling. "Now the economy is very good, and businesses are looking to the prison system for labor," said Noreen Blonien, an assistant director of the California Department of Corrections.
Officials at the federal Bureau of Prisons hope the same logic will enable them to expand their program, the nation's largest, to include private sector jobs like those at Donovan. Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, has offered a bill that would allow the bureau to do so, as long as the company hiring inmates could show it was not moving existing jobs behind bars. The jobs would also pay more than the 21 cents to $1.15 an hour that the inmates now in the program earn.
A competing bill, meanwhile, from Representative Pete Hoekstra, a Michigan Republican, could cause the federal program to scale back by forcing it to compete with private companies for the government contracts it now fills.
"What you end up with, in certain cases, is the federal government getting inferior products at higher prices," said Mr. Hoekstra, who has the support of both the United States Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
In recent weeks, the lawmakers' aides have discussed a combined bill that would both force state-run prison operations to compete with private enterprises and allow companies to hire federal inmates. "We're very close to a compromise," Mr. McCollum said. If they cannot reach one, the lawmakers say they will offer their bills separately.
Away from Washington, the debate over inmates working for private companies is less hypothetical.
One business employing inmates is C.M.T. Blues, the T-shirt company here in the country's southwesternmost corner, and it has been home to virtually every argument on both sides of the issue.
Five years ago, in nearby Chula Vista, Mr. Sleiman was running a business that imported clothing, and he was considering opening his own operation. He was looking to Honduras, he said, where workers earn about $1.75 an hour. "In our industry, all of the business is going offshore," Mr. Sleiman said. Then he heard about California's prison work program. Under it, Mr. Sleiman would have to pay the inmates $5.75 an hour, but he could make up some of the expense elsewhere.
For C.M.T.'s factory, Mr. Sleiman pays less than a fifth of what he would elsewhere in rent and electricity. He also receives a 25 percent discount on workers' compensation insurance and tax credits.
But he soon found out that setting up shop in a prison is no panacea. Delivery and pickup times must be scheduled precisely. Mr. Sleiman also trained many of the workers from scratch, he said. Then he had to convince them to work together.
"On paper, it looked very good," Mr. Sleiman said. In reality, he added, "it has been a tough road."
It has been even tougher for the inmates, according to a lawsuit filed last summer by two former Donovan prisoners. To work at C.M.T., inmates had to go through a 60-day "training period" for which they were not paid, according to the suit. It also says workers were given unrealistic production quotas and were told to replace "Made in Honduras" labels on some fabric with 'Made in the U.S.A." tags.
After the inmates, Charles Ervin and Shearwood Fleming, got in touch with a local television show and it broadcast their charges, they were fired, put in solitary confinement for more than 45 days and eventually transferred to another prison.
Mr. Sleiman said the length of training programs varies and that the accusations about quotas and the labels were untrue. A California Department of Corrections investigation into the label-switching charge was inconclusive, a state spokeswoman said. Prisoners understood the conditions of the training program when they applied to work at C.M.T., she added.
Whatever the problems, though, California prison officials said the private sector jobs remain far more popular among inmates than washing sheets or even building government furniture. At most state prisons where private companies operate, there are waiting lists to be hired.
"When we step through the gates and into the shop," said Allen W. Smith, 45, a T-shirt worker who is serving a 13-year sentence for robbery, "this is a company. This isn't prison." Guards still keep watch, but the atmosphere differs greatly from prison yards, the inmates said.
The private sector jobs also pay at least the minimum wage, although prisoners in most states keep only a fraction of their pay.
Compared with other jobs at Donovan, "it's great," said Frank W. Owen, 39, who was convicted of a 1982 murder and has worked for C.M.T. for four years. "I've been able to save some money."
Mr. Owen also said he hoped his record at C.M.T. would help him earn parole.
Mr. Sleiman, meanwhile, said C.M.T. was doing better now that he had learned how to operate in a prison. Over the 18 months, he added, he plans to triple his work force to 200.

The Sports Ethicists Come Out in Force. Let's Ignore Them, O.K.?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Call this the Era Between the Vinces. Big-time spectator sport is struggling to figure out how much of its market wants that old-time religion (as preached by Coach Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers) and how much wants the new-time sensations (as peddled by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation.)
In such a vacuum, there is always a call for ethics, those soft, wiggly rules that can be used to whip the unruly, tie up the weak or shake in the face of the willful. Should we suspend a rock-head pitcher for speaking his mind, however confused? Should we mike pro coaches so we can see just how seat-of-the-pants the game is, like our lives? Who should be allowed to subsidize the career of an amateur athlete? 
 So, just in time for March Madness, spring training, the hockey and basketball playoffs and football practice, the Sports Ethics Institute is opening its Web site (www. sportsethics. com), the editor of ESPN the Magazine explained all, a former Bobby Knight player blew a whistle and nosy people are sniffing around the St. John's star Erick Barkley, whose case which, if followed to its logical conclusion, will ruin western civilization. Those pillars, the church, the university, the news media and the sneaker companies, are all involved.
 I'm actually concerned about Barkley. He is only a sophomore but is already 22 years old, which is almost too old for the National Basketball Association these days. He has never had a really good new car. He seems to be a product of the worst kind of white colonialism practiced in America now, do-gooders making sure black kids get over through basketball. People at Riverside Church, a human rights fortress, are slapping their foreheads over this -- "My God, we had no idea" -- even though the Riverside Hawks have been storming through the country for years, in Nikes, winning amateur basketball tournaments. Did the church think the players were missionaries? Maybe they were.
So there will be an ethics committee meeting, and someone will be blamed. Maybe it will be Ernie Lorch, a nice white millionaire lawyer seemingly with no other life but the Hawks. He thought he was doing a good thing for those players, and he was. It's not as though the black community rose up to wipe out all those drug-money local playground tournaments that fed into the sneaker-money summer camps that fed into the white colleges run by presidents who answered only to their coaches who prepared their players for David Stern's global game, which is now undergoing an economic correction.
You think we need some ethics here?
Marcia Sage, a former San Diego lawyer who is now president and chief executive officer of the Sports Ethics Institute in Tampa, Fla., took a deep breath. "Moral philosophers don't take positions so much as explore the issue, offer considerations," she said last week. "It's not clear-cut. You can't just look at outcome. What are the virtues here? What is the greater good being performed by the church? Who is being hurt?"
Those ethicists are going to have to wear beepers all the time, carry cells, be permanently online.
 I went to hear John Papanek, editor in chief of ESPN the Magazine, who somehow never frontally addressed his advertised topic, "The Ethics of Promoting Sports Thugs." This was held last week in the parish house living room of the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation in Manhattan, as part of its series on ethics in media. It was the church's first sports-related forum.
Papanek said that "sports is entertainment, it's all about putting on a show," and that "parents need to teach their children that athletes are like actors, they are playing a role." I thought that was good advice, but later in the week wished Papanek could expand on that when I saw "CNN Newsstand's" excellent piece on Bobby Knight's abusive and humiliating coaching style at Indiana. What role could he be playing?
All the bleeps made it hard to understand what Knight was ranting about. One former player accused Knight of having choked him. Knight should either be committed for psychiatric observation or sent to the N.B.A., where he and Latrell Sprewell could choke each other.
As far as I can recall, Knight has never been the target of a full-scale N.C.A.A. investigation; it is always claimed that he runs "a clean program," and that most of the athletes who don't bail out of his teams early go on to graduate and lead productive lives.
Maybe we don't need more ethics or the N.C.A.A. Give the Erick Barkleys what they deserve, stretch limos driven by business majors with English majors in the back writing their term papers. The equivalent of soft money wouldn't have to be channeled through nonprofits like churches, so these players could go to prep school after high school so they could learn to read ESPN the Magazine on college road trips while they became physically ready for the N.B.A.
If we have to have ethics at all in sports, let's make sure those moral philosophers explore the right issues. Should Pete Rose wear his Phillies or Reds cap to the Hall of Fame? Was O. J. Simpson the greatest running back in history?

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls For New Pool Of Heating Oil For Northeast

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
President Clinton endorsed legislation today to create a new reserve of heating oil to cushion against future shortages in the Northeastern states, but beyond exhorting foreign nations to boost their oil production, he proposed no short-term steps to relieve rising fuel prices.
Instead, he urged Congress to focus on long-term efforts to reduce fuel consumption, including conservation tax credits and research spending, which Congress has rejected when he proposed them before. 
 "There's no overnight solution to this problem," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
He did not propose any emergency steps, like releasing oil from existing federal reserves, which are for emergency use, or lowering gasoline taxes. And he ruled out increasing domestic production in Alaska by drilling in protected wildlife habitats.
Mr. Clinton said that while the spike in fuel prices this spring was hard on people with modest incomes who must drive long distances to work, and on independent truckers (who have protested by driving their rigs through Washington), the overall economy remained strong.
Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent, said that he was "delighted" that Mr. Clinton had endorsed the legislation, which was sponsored by Mr. Sanders, to create a heating oil reserve for the Northeast. The bill already has 92 cosponsors in the House. "I think his support will give the impetus to get the legislation passed," he said. Mr. Sanders said he also favored immediate sales of oil from the federal stockpile to help bring prices down.
White House officials said the president's proposal envisioned a pool of some two million barrels of oil drawn from existing federal oil stockpiles, to be stored at existing facilities in the Northeast so that they could be released during shortages or to deal with transportation bottlenecks.
They said the administration would ask Congress to pass a new law establishing the program, so that conditions for releasing heating oil onto the market could be specified.
However, the president conceded that his other energy conservation ideas have received short shrift.
"For over two years, Congress has refused to pass common-sense tax credits I've proposed to promote fuel-saving cars of the future and energy-efficient homes, buildings and equipment," he said, urging Congress to reconsider.
"It's long past time for Congress to fully fund the more than $1 billion I've requested to accelerate the research and development of more efficient energy technologies," Mr. Clinton said.
The average price of gasoline, which was about $1.25 at Christmas, has risen in recent weeks to above $1.50, and the Energy Department now projects that it could reach as much as $1.80 this summer.
Crude oil and gasoline stocks in the United States are at "alarmingly low" levels not seen in decades, the agency said, and "as the gasoline season gets under way, stocks will plumb uncharted depths if they follow their usual seasonal pattern."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, a candidate for the Senate, said Mr. Clinton's proposals showed that "he has had a slight awakening from his nap," and urged the administration to sell oil from existing reserves "right now." He said the administration should also try to persuade Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to "break up the illegal cartel," a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement today that "it is critical that the United States make clear to OPEC, publicly or privately, that we stand ready to immediately release oil from the reserve if the OPEC ministers do not agree to a substantial production increase." Mr. Schumer is a close ally of President Clinton and a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate bid.
The White House said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who recently visited Middle Eastern oil states, would continue to lobby cartel members to increase production.

HEADLINE: India's Unwired Villages Mired in the Distant Past

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: HYDERABAD, India, March 15

 BODY:
Cyber Towers rises from the campus of a software technology park here, a sleek Internet-connected symbol of the new India that is feverishly courting foreign investment, selling its wares in the global marketplace and creating wealth at an astonishing rate.
But less than 50 miles away, in the poverty-stricken village of Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, the old India is alive and unwell. Illiteracy, sickness and hunger are the villagers' constant companions. Women and children work in the fields for less than 50 cents a day. The sole telephone -- an antique contraption of batteries and antennae -- almost never works. 
 Like most of the villagers, Muhammad Hussain, an unlettered field hand in a ragged loin cloth, has never seen a computer, but offered that he did once watch an office worker at a typewriter. "I saw the fingers moving, but I did not know what was being written," he said.
The chasm between India's educated elite and its impoverished multitudes worries economists, politicians and some software entrepreneurs.
Because of the extraordinary success of Indian engineers in Silicon Valley and the Indian software industry's sales to American companies, India and the United States have forged strong economic ties in high technology. President Clinton will acknowledge those links next Friday with a visit to Hitec City, where Microsoft, Oracle and Metamor are ensconced in the air conditioned comfort of Cyber Towers.
But during his five-day whirlwind tour of five Indian cities, the president will spend little time in the villages, where almost three-quarters of this country's billion people still live and struggle for the basic necessities.
At a time when India's software industry is creating a glamorous digerati and driving a dizzying escalation in stock values on the Bombay exchange, the boom has stirred a debate about the country's social and economic priorities, as well as the potential of high technology to transform the lives of the poor.
Some, like Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, whose capital is this bustling city, have an almost messianic faith in technology. Though fewer than one-half of 1 percent of Indian households now have Internet access compared with more than a third in America, the optimists believe that technology is coming that will make connecting to the Net cheap enough for a broader spectrum of Indians to afford.
"If a television in a school is connected to the Internet, you can hold literacy classes in the evenings," said Randeep Sudan, who oversees information technology for Mr. Naidu. "You can deliver the best of content to the worst of schools. Imagine the potential to revolutionize the educational process."
But others worry that the boom may be distracting the country from its chronic problems and fear that the last decade's more rapid economic growth -- spawned by India's loosening of restrictions on trade and investment -- is leaving the poor, and the poorer states, further behind, even as the size of India's middle class has doubled.
This is still a country where half the women and a quarter of the men cannot read or write; where more than half the children 4 and under are stunted by malnutrition; where one-third of the population, or more than 300 million people, live in absolute poverty, unable to afford enough to eat; where more than 30 million children 6 to 10 are not in school.
K. R. Narayanan, India's first president from an untouchable caste, sounded this alarm in a recent speech.
"We have one of the world's largest reservoirs of technical personnel, but also the world's largest number of illiterates," he said, "the world's largest middle class, but also the largest number of people below the poverty line, and the largest number of children suffering from malnutrition. Our giant factories rise from out of squalor. Our satellites shoot up from the midst of hovels of the poor."
Even those who believe that the importance of the $5 billion software industry is overblown acknowledge its contributions. It has generated 280,000 jobs for the educated and highly skilled. Those workers, in turn, are creating demand for housing, refrigerators and other goods that help the economy grow.
And there is potential for greater growth. A study by McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, forecasts that India's software industry could earn $87 billion and employ 2.2 million people before the decade is done.
The success of the industry has also stirred optimism about India's ability to compete in a global economy. It has offered capitalist, free market models in a country where government still plays a central role and has hastened the tendency of the country's best and brightest young people to choose careers in business rather than the civil service.
"Every country needs a major success story to lift the psyche and to be seen as a powerhouse in something," said Krishna G. Palepu, a Harvard Business School professor who is bullish on the industry. "This is India's chance. Suddenly, there's a sense of self-confidence and visibility internationally."
But there are also limitations on what high technology can do to increase the productivity of the entire Indian economy, at least for now. The industry itself still generates only about 1 percent of India's gross domestic product and about 1 percent of worldwide software exports.
The country desperately needs to attend to the fundamentals, most economists say, and some state leaders like Mr. Naidu concur. It must invest more in primary education and health care, build a working system of roads and power grids, reduce subsidies for power and fertilizer that go mostly to the better-off and generate higher rates of growth in agriculture and industry, which employ 8 in 10 Indians.
India has lagged behind China, for instance, in educating its children and increasing its exports of textiles, shoes and toys -- industries that employ huge numbers of less educated workers in China. By law, India has required those industries to remain small, typically employing fewer than 100 people per workplace -- putting them at a tremendous disadvantage with China, where such factories employ thousands.
In the garment trade, India and China started out in 1980 with about the same level of exports, but by 1996, India was selling $4.6 billion of its goods abroad, compared with China's $25 billion.
The Indian government is in dire need of revenues to tackle its daunting ills, but so far the software industry is contributing relatively little to the country's public coffers.
Income from software exports is generally exempted from the 38.5 percent corporate income tax. And unlike companies in other industries, high technology companies do not have to pay the 40 percent to 60 percent customs duties on computers and other technology items they import to operate their businesses.
"The software industry is making gobs and gobs of profits," said Anil Garg, an Indian and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who is setting up an office for Aristasoft, the new company he helped found, in Cyber Towers. "And yet there is this huge debate about whether it should pay taxes. I don't understand. Having taxes is a good problem. The roads here are broken, for God's sake. The schools are so bad. We have been the privileged class for so long. It's time for us to pay back."
The software technology park of Hitec City and the village of Sheri Ram Reddy Guda are separated by only a short distance, yet seem to come from different centuries, and to stand at opposite poles, emblems of the new and the old India.
Hitec City is a temple to modernity, with a soaring atrium, gargling fountains, an on-site A.T.M., basement car parking and Internet connections for all. The government has created an island where everything works. There are three separate power systems, ensuring that the lights will never go out. And the businesses do not need decent roads; they can deliver their products via satellite links or fiber-optic cables.
Sheri Ram Reddy Guda, population 400, seems ancient by comparison. No one here owns a car or even a scooter. The ox cart is still the primary means of transportation and word of mouth the main grapevine. There is no health clinic, no cable television. Raggedy children who should be in school play in the dirt with toys made from twisted wire.
The village is connected to the main blacktop highway by a narrow, mile-and-a-half-long dirt road, deeply gouged with ruts, that is nearly impassable in the rainy season.
Most of the villagers are from the formerly untouchable castes now known as Dalits, and they are grateful to Mr. Naidu's government for building 23 houses for them. But they say they desperately need a better road, reliable electricity and jobs.
The village gets only about eight hours of power a day, and that is often of such low voltage that it does not operate the irrigation pumps. When rain is scarce, as it is now, the fields lie parched and work is scarce.
"Chandrababu has not given us the current," said an old man, Baswapuram Yelleah, referring to the chief minister and waving his handmade hatchet as he gestured angrily with his hands. "Our eyes are filled with tears when we see our fields."
Yarrea Balamani is a widowed mother of five children, 7 to 18. She and her older children do farm work but lately there have been no more than 10 days of work in a month. "If there was some industry around, we could get work every day," she said. "That would be better for us. It's a very difficult life we are living."

HEADLINE: Paying More at the Gas Pump

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The problem is not high gas prices ("Countering High Gas Prices," editorial, March 16). People in the rest of the world pay much higher prices for gas, and have done so for years.
The problem is people jumping into their 15-mile-per-gallon sport utility vehicles to go a couple of blocks to the convenience store to buy a gallon of milk instead of walking. The problem is also the ridiculous sprawl that has engulfed the areas around our cities, requiring long commutes, most of the time with one person in each car. 
 We are a wasteful country, and it is time we realize it. We cannot expect the economies of other countries to suffer so that Americans can drive S.U.V.'s.

HEADLINE: Costa Ricans Fear Slaying of 2 U.S. Women Will Hurt Tourism

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PUERTO VIEJO, Costa Rica, March 18

 BODY:
Costa Rica has been called "the Switzerland of Central America" for its safety and stability, but some residents say they fear that the killing of two women from the United States this week may have damaged that perception.
The image has helped the country attract thousands of American retirees and an annual flow of almost $1 billion in tourism revenues and more than a million tourists, some of whom probably would not venture into the rest of turbulent Central America. 
 "The image now is that something crazy happened in paradise," said a tour operator, Ed Oliver, who moved here three years ago from Seattle. "Something like this, of course, it's going to hurt business."
The bodies of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., were found by a roadside on Monday in the Caribbean coast town of Cahuita, 10 miles northwest of Puerto Viejo. Both were 19.
The police said Thursday that they had leads, but that they had not made any arrests. The discovery of the bodies came just two weeks after an Austrian man who owned a local hotel was killed near Puerto Viejo.
Costa Rica has no army and played a peacemaker role in the Central American wars of the 1980's, creating a tranquil image that has proved a valuable asset.
An estimated 30,000 United States citizens live in the country. Many are retirees attracted by the climate and relative low cost of living. Tourism, with $900 million in annual revenues, is the second-largest industry.
Costa Rica is also a popular location for American university study-abroad programs, like the one in which Ms. Howell was involved at Antioch College of Yellow Springs, Ohio. So officials have hurried to point out that the killings were unusual. "Costa Rica has been and is a safe country," said Rogelio Ramos, the minister of public security. "This could have happened anywhere in the world."
The United States Embassy here says that Costa Rica "in general" is a safe country. "Our recommendation to tourists is that they take the same precautions that one would take going to a big city in the United States, such as New York or Los Angeles," an embassy official said.
But violence against foreigners is not unknown.
The best-known case may be the 1997 slaying of a rancher, Max Dalton, 78, who was shot during a property dispute in southern Costa Rica.
Last October, two elderly Americans were slain in their house in the northern province of Guanacaste. Robbery is believed to have been the motive, but no arrests have been made.
And the area around Puerto Viejo, which caters to backpackers, has been troubled by crime. Earlier this month, the Austrian businessman and a Costa Rican executive were killed in separate incidents.
"It makes me feel a little worried and nervous being here and going out all by myself" said Jamien Shields, a student from Colorado College in Colorado Springs who is studying the fishing and tourism industries on the coast of Limon Province.
Local businessmen and politicians say they fear that the killings could cause an economic setback for Limon, Costa Rica's poorest province.
Charlie Wanger, a Boston man who owns the cabin the slain women were renting, expressed regret both at the deaths and at the hardship the crime could cause local friends.
"You don't know how hard people around here have worked for years to promote the image of this zone," he said. "Ninety-nine percent of the people here depend on tourism."

HEADLINE: DECISION IN TAIWAN: THE OVERVIEW;
Taiwan Nationalists Ousted After Half-Century Reign

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 18

 BODY:
Chen Shui-bian, an opposition politician who long advocated Taiwan's independence, was elected its new president today, ending more than half a century of Nationalist rule and risking dangerous new tensions with mainland China.
Mr. Chen, a 49-year-old lawyer who served as mayor of Taipei and struggled against martial law in the 1980's, won with 39 percent of the vote in a bitter three-way race. The Nationalist candidate slumped to third place. 
 The opposition's victory, the first transition of power in Taiwan's young democracy, was made possible by a schism in the Nationalist Party that led one of its stars, James Soong, to mount an independent candidacy. Mr. Soong, a populist former governor of Taipei province, came in second with a strong 37 percent showing; Lien Chan, the Nationalist, got just 23 percent.
For years, Mr. Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party called for independence from the mainland, which considers Taiwan a wayward region that must return to the motherland. The president-elect, who will take office on May 20, succeeding Taiwan's first elected president, Lee Teng-hui, has recently moderated that position, saying no declaration of independence is needed because Taiwan is already sovereign.
But Beijing has called Mr. Chen deceitful and issued dire warnings against his election, with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji all but saying last week that it could provoke a war.
To reassure nervous citizens and governments abroad -- including Washington, which has pledged to help Taiwan defend itself if attacked -- Mr. Chen tried to reach out to the Chinese in his victory speech tonight.
He avoided inflammatory references to Taiwanese "statehood," and said he would seek deeper economic ties and "a permanent peace." He has promised that he will not declare independence or hold a referendum on the issue unless Taiwan comes under attack.
However, in a statement certain to anger Beijing, he also pledged, "We won't let Taiwan become another Hong Kong or Macao." Those former colonies have been handed back to China, which has granted them broad autonomy.
The initial reaction from Beijing tonight was terse and noncommittal. Page 18.
In Washington, President Clintonsaid he saw the election as a demonstration of the vitality of democracy and an opportunity for Taiwan and China to open a new dialogue. "The United States strongly supports such dialogue," he said.
Some 83 percent of Taiwan's voters turned out after a campaign dominated by worries over relations with China and public impatience with the corrupt political practices of the Nationalists.
Mr. Chen faces a legislature still dominated by the Nationalists, who have ruled firmly since Chiang Kai-shek retreated here from the Communist-dominated mainland in 1949. The country is in for a period of unprecedented political reshuffling and uncertainty, even as it faces a possible confrontation with China.
Speaking to thousands of cheering supporters, Mr. Chen declared that his success "is not a victory for the Democratic Progressive Party -- it is a victory for democracy."
In a subtle friendly gesture to China and to some of his fiercest enemies at home -- those who fled the mainland after the Communist victory in 1949 -- Mr. Chen gave his acceptance speech in Mandarin Chinese rather than in the Taiwanese dialect he often used in campaign rallies.
But Mr. Chen refuses to accept China's hallowed notion of "One China," and in answer to a question tonight he said China's "one country, two systems" formula for enlisting Taiwan as an autonomous region "would never be accepted by the Taiwanese people."
"We are determined to defend this island but we are also determined to seek peace and stability," he said.
In an effort to reassure foreign governments that he will not take reckless actions, Mr. Chen has promised to retain the current defense minister, top national security officials and the military chief of staff.
Mr. Chen, like 85 percent of the island's population and many supporters of his political party, is considered an ethnic Taiwanese, descended from people who immigrated from the mainland centuries ago.
Mr. Chen became involved in opposition as a defense lawyer for dissidents who favored democracy and independence. After martial law was lifted in 1987, he entered politics, he joined the Democratic Progressives who became the main opposition party. For many of the party's supporters, the victory tonight is an emotional culmination of decades of struggle.
The Nationalists, for their part, have been thrown into turmoil and their powerful chairman, President Lee, is now on the spot. Mr. Lee's feud with Mr. Soong helped cause the devastating defeat and the party could suffer a permanent split if the popular Mr. Soong tries to form his own party now, as he signaled tonight he would.
Already tonight, Huang Quen-huei, the secretary general of the Nationalists, offered his resignation.
Late tonight, a large crowd of Mr. Soong's supporters, most of then longtime Nationalists who felt Mr. Lee had betrayed the party by snubbing Mr. Soong, marched to Mr. Lee's official residence and his party's headquarters in central Taipei to shout for Mr. Lee to step down as party boss. Both buildings were surrounded by riot policemen and there were some scuffles.
Mr. Chen has called for disclosure of the Nationalists' multibillion-dollar investments and confiscation of any properties that should belong to the state rather than the party.
But Mr. Chen also said tonight that he bore no animosity toward his campaign opponents and that he hoped to work with the Nationalists to build a "cross-party alliance," though he did not offer specifics.
His ability to forge a coalition will be crucial to his success.
"Chen Shui-bian's immediate challenge is that he has to act as a president, not just a leader of an opposition movement," said Chu Yun-han, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. "Nearly two-thirds of the electorate didn't vote for him, and many are deeply suspicious of his approach to the mainland."
The defeated Nationalist candidate, Mr. Lien, had used scare tactics in the final weeks of the campaign, suggesting that Mr. Chen could bring disaster to the island.
Tonight he was more gracious in conceding, calling the transition a milestone for Taiwan's democracy. "I hope the new president will handle state matters properly, leading our country into a new era," he said before a crestfallen line of party leaders. "We can still regroup. From today we need to engage in self-examination and reform."
Mr. Lee remained silent and secluded in his residence, where he summoned the military chief of staff and the defense minister. There have been reports here of Chinese troop movements on the mainland, although no one expects imminent military action.
Mr. Chen's victory reflected, in part, a demographic trend that bodes ill for the Nationalists and also for China's hope of peaceful reunification: many younger people have no allegiance to the Nationalist Party their parents long served, and think of China as a distant concept.
Since the first presidential election in 1996, more than one million young people became eligible to vote, Mr. Chu noted. And fully half of them said in recent surveys that they were voting for Mr. Chen, who is seen as representing youthful energy and cleaned-up politics.
China's military threats do not intimidate such people. A typical example is Yang Jie-lung, a 27-year-old graphic designer. Approached this morning as he left the polling booth, he would not discuss his preferences until his mother, a lifelong Nationalist, was out of earshot.
"I hope Chen Shui-bian can win," he said. "He's the best one to clean up the problems left by the Nationalists, and as mayor he did a pretty good job."
As for the mainland's dark warnings, he said: "We are not obliged to take any advice from China. We are electing our own president."
Even in Mr. Lee's hometown of Sanchi, northwest of Taipei, voters rebuffed the president's plea to keep the Nationalists in power.
"Why should I listen to Lee Teng-hui?" asked Pan Yue-ching, 38, a homemaker. "I have my own opinions." The voters also appeared mainly unimpressed with the threats from China. "It's always the same between these two countries," said Lee Fung-lin, also 38 and an unemployed restaurant worker. "They just shout at each other."

HEADLINE: In Baltimore, Public Housing Comes Full Circle

BYLINE: By CHARLES BELFOURE 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE

 BODY:
FOR the second time, Baltimore has turned to its architectural roots to rebuild its public housing. A high-rise superblock that wiped out a row-house neighborhood in the 1950's has been razed and replaced with a newly appreciated Baltimore fixture, row houses.
The Terraces, with 303 row houses built at a cost of $60 million, has taken the place of Lexington Terrace, five 11-story towers with a total of 677 apartments. The 18-acre complex opened in 1959 and was demolished in 1996. Along with the new row houses, a four-story building with 88 apartments for the elderly has also been constructed, plus an office building with retail space on the ground floor. The site is on the western edge of downtown, across Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from the University of Maryland's Baltimore campus. 
 Lexington Terrace was one of the most crime-ridden and deteriorated housing projects in the city, and when it was demolished, only about half of its apartments were occupied. Along with five other city projects, it became a symbol for a failed housing policy that was championed by planners and architects in the years immediately following World War II. They favored mostly high-rise buildings on one gigantic block physically isolated from the rest of the community, not traditional attached houses.
John Torti of Torti, Gallas & Partners CHK of Silver Spring, Md., whose firm designed the Terraces row houses with TLBC Inc., a Baltimore architectural firm, said: "It's a big repudiation of modernist planning. We again understand the value of streets and row houses, with their front doors and stoops."
The Terraces is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Hope VI program. Its goal is to demolish or rehabilitate troubled buildings, replacing them with housing that includes people of all incomes. The first Hope VI project in Baltimore was Pleasant View Gardens, with 228 row houses completed in 1998. It replaced Lafayette Courts, a high-rise project. "A definite goal is to blend the new housing into the surrounding community," said Elinor Bacon, the deputy assistant secretary for public housing investments at HUD.
The Terraces achieves this effect by using many of the design elements of Baltimore's traditional row houses, like brick facades and porches. "I recently brought a group of people through the site, and their first reaction was that it doesn't look like public housing," said Daniel P. Henson III, a former commissioner of Baltimore's Department of Housing and Community Development. Mr. Henson, who left his position in December when a new mayor took office, is widely given credit as the driving force behind the success of the city's Hope VI projects.
Another important design decision for the Terraces was restoring the streets once cut off by the superblock. Now, Saratoga, Vine and Lexington Streets run through the neighborhood again.
Of the 303 row houses, 100 were earmarked for sale at market rates, and the remainder as rental units for low-income families. But in design, the two are virtually indistinguishable. "I dare anyone to tell which are which," said Mr. Torti, who is working on 22 other Hope VI projects across the country. The goal, he explained, was not to stigmatize public housing.
In fact, the only difference between the units is that the ones for sale have basements. All but 14 are two stories, with a total of 1,240 square feet containing three bedrooms and two baths. The 14 three-story houses have a fourth bedroom. All of the houses have central air-conditioning, washers and dryers and built-in computer desks, and all are wired for high-speed Internet access.
The 100 houses offered for sale were completed last year, and all sold in less than 12 months for $60,000 to $70,000. The remaining 203 houses -- appliances are being installed in the last of them now -- have been leased at rents averaging $300 a month. A majority of the rents are subsidized by the Baltimore Housing Authority. All the houses have fenced rear yards that lead to alleys, another traditional part of the Baltimore streetscape. The alleys, by request of the tenant groups who participated in the design process, have locked gates at both ends to prevent strangers from coming through.
FINANCING for the Terraces came from a variety of sources: $20 million of the project's $60 million cost came from the federal Hope VI program. A joint venture team of Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, a Baltimore developer, and Mid-City Financial Inc./Edgewood Management, a Baltimore company that specializes in affordable multifamily housing, won the competition to develop the site in September 1995. They completed the project using private mortgage money, state financing and tax credits for putting up low-income rental and elderly housing.
"An objective of Hope VI is to develop these sites through a public-private partnership," said Carl William Struever, the president of Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse.
Bank of America provided financing for the 42,000-square-foot office building, the Parren J. Mitchell Business Center, the first of its kind in any Hope VI development. Sharing the same parking lot is a stand-alone 11,000-square-foot store, which is being leased by Rite Aid.
Although the Terraces is technically a city public-housing project, it will be managed by two private companies, Edgewood Management and Cooperative Services Inc., an Oak Park, Mich., company that specializes in housing for the elderly.
Directly north of the Terraces is what will become the third site to be reconstructed, a vacant 15-acre parcel where the George B. Murphy Homes and Emerson Julian Gardens were demolished in last August.
At Heritage Crossing, as the new development will be known, 75 low-income rental houses will be built, along with 185 houses that will be sold at market-rate prices of $70,000 to $90,000.

HEADLINE: The Invisible Poor

BYLINE: By James Fallows; James Fallows is the author of "Breaking the News." He lives in Seattle.

 BODY:
The way a rich nation thinks about its poor will always be convoluted. The richer people become in general, the easier it theoretically becomes for them to share with people who are left out. But the richer people become, the less they naturally stay in touch with the realities of life on the bottom, and the more they naturally prefer to be excited about their own prospects rather than concerned about someone else's.
All aspects of the convolution now affect our politics and culture, in a form with no exact precedent. The last time the United States self-consciously thought of itself as rich, in the early 1960's, discussions of how the wealth should be shared were under way even before real prosperity arrived. Welfare programs, with all their subsequent mixed effects, were expanded. But so were Social Security benefits, which along with Medicare converted the over-65 age group from the poorest to the richest cohort of Americans within a generation. Before that, America's last significant wave of individual fortune-building, the original Gilded Age, a century ago, touched off decades worth of struggles over the distribution and domestication of that wealth: union battles, antitrust laws, muckraking exposes, the rapid growth of public education, laws establishing minimum wages and maximum hours and even the income tax. 
 Before, whenever we had wealth, we started discussing poverty. Why not now? Why is the current politics of wealth and poverty seemingly about wealth alone? Eight years ago, when Bill Clinton first ran for president, the Dow Jones average was under 3,500, yearly federal budget deficits were projected at hundreds of billions of dollars forever and beyond, and no one talked about the "permanent boom" or the "new economy." Yet in that more straitened time, Clinton made much of the importance of "not leaving a single person behind." It is possible that similar "compassionate" rhetoric might yet play a part in the general election.
But it is striking how much less talk there is about the poor than there was eight years ago, when the country was economically uncertain, or in previous eras, when the country felt flush. Even last summer, when Clinton spent several days on a remarkable, Bobby Kennedy-like pilgrimage through impoverished areas from Indian reservations in South Dakota to ghetto neighborhoods in East St. Louis, the administration decided to refer to the effort not as a poverty tour but as a "new-markets initiative."
What is happening is partly a logical, policy-driven reaction. Poverty really is lower than it has been in decades, especially for minority groups. The most attractive solution to it -- a growing economy -- is being applied. The people who have been totally left out of this boom often have medical, mental or other problems for which no one has an immediate solution. "The economy has sucked in anyone who has any preparation, any ability to cope with modern life," says Franklin D. Raines, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget who is now head of Fannie Mae. When he and other people who specialize in the issue talk about solutions, they talk analytically and long-term: education, development of work skills, shifts in the labor market, adjustments in welfare reform.
But I think there is another force that has made this a rich era with barely visible poor people. It is the unusual social and imaginative separation between prosperous America and those still left out. This is not the embattled distance of the "Bonfire of the Vanities" period, with its gated communities and atmosphere of urban armed camps. It's more like simple invisibility, because of increasing geographic, occupational and social barriers that block one group from the other's view. Prosperous America does not seem hostile to the poor, and often responds generously when reminded. But our poor are like people in Madagascar. We feel bad for them, but they live someplace else.
I recently worked for several months on a temporary project inside a large software company. During the business day I mixed with people who were generally younger and invariably richer than I was. I liked nearly all of them and soon adjusted to the view from the bottom of their economic ladder. I envied some of the things their money let them do or buy, but I rationalized that I was happy with the life I normally lived. Although I've wound up with more money than I ever expected when going into journalism, these surroundings allowed me to congratulate myself on the Gandhi-like antimaterialism I had displayed in making my career choice.
Because I had a long commute I often stayed late to wait out the traffic. Around 9 p.m. I'd hear a knock on the office door. A woman in her 60's, wearing a stiff-fabric vest with the logo of an office-cleaning company, stepped into the room to empty my wastebasket and collect Mountain Dew cans from the recycling bin. She would say something I could barely understand, and I would nod back. It seemed that she was Russian. She walked as if her feet hurt. She did not have the bounce of the people I saw during the day. She kept making her rounds until about midnight.
Eventually I started leaving the office to go home as soon as I heard her a few doors down. I was willing to read articles about the travails of the working poor or the adjustment problems of older, unskilled immigrants. I just didn't want to watch her limp.
The computer-financial complex, with strongholds in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and Seattle, and connections to New York, Boston, Austin and elsewhere, has been both principal source and spiritual symbol of this era of wealth. Relatively few Americans actually work in the "information technology" business, ranging from chips to computers to the Internet. But it has created the billion-dollar fortunes of recent years, and it has buoyed the stock market and therefore the wealth of mutual-fund America in general. Economists are now ready to concede that by cutting costs and raising productivity in "normal" businesses, from automaking to medical care, information technology has allowed the economy to keep growing without inflation, which in turn has lowered unemployment rates and created work for people who had not found jobs before.
Tech wealth has the same disproportionate, commanding-heights effect on today's culture as Wall Street's takeover-and-junk-bond complex had 15 years ago, and as the biotech-financial complex presumably will 15 years from now -- and as the mass-production economy had at the start of the 20th century, and as the boom in cars, highways and real estate subdivision had after World War II. Therefore it is disproportionately significant that for reasons of geography, personal background and working style the tech wealthy have very little sense that they live in the same country as anyone who is poor. The new millionaires are not a representative sample of the rest of the country, but they are a leading indicator.
The routes to tech wealth are more varied than they may look from outside this fevered economy. From Allentown or Cleveland it may seem as if 20-year-olds in Silicon Valley simply drive up to a venture-capital office and drive out with a carful of money. In fact, that's only one of the business models. Tens of thousands of people have become millionaires through what has been, at least for the decade, the most predictable path to wealth in U.S. history: they have signed on with Microsoft; earned their stock options; and assumed that by the time the options vested four and a half years later, they'd be worth a million dollars or more. The simplest way to figure out how much a Microsoft employee is worth is knowing when he joined the company, and therefore how many rounds of options-granting and stock-splitting he has been through.
This route to wealth presumably can't last forever, since it has depended on Microsoft's stock value doubling on average every 15 months through the 1990's. Yet while it has lasted it has not only created three of the five largest fortunes in the world (Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer), and several more in the billions, but has also allowed people to start thinking, quite early in life, about what they will do when they become rich. "A surprisingly small number of people expect to stay with the company in the long run," says Eric Fox, 27, a software developer who came to Microsoft straight out of Yale six years ago (and who says he has no plans to leave). "The standard thing is to say that you expect to be here two more years, or five more years" -- or until you hit "the number," the amount of wealth people have in mind as allowing them to quit. It is apparently not a matter of the work being unendurable, or even unpleasant, that causes so many Microsoft employees to talk about the time when they will leave; it is the near certainty of their having enough money, soon, to allow them to decide what they would "really" like to do. I have heard widely varying estimates of what "the number" typically is. A man in his 20's said $1 million, and a man in his 40's said $15 million.
The highly publicized wealth of Internet start-up companies has been less predictable than Microsoft's, and more like that of the Klondike era. Everyone is trudging up the mountain together, like the prospectors going over Chilcoot Pass in "White Fang," and some of them end up frozen and broke while others are stumbling across lumps of gold. In an upcoming book called "The Leap," Tom Ashbrook, who quit a job as deputy managing editor of The Boston Globe when he turned 40 to start a Net company, describes his night sweats as he wondered if he'd have to sell the family house, take on loan-shark debt and by implication drive his wife away in order keep his experiment going. (At the last minute he found nearly $25 million in venture capital, and now has more than 100 employees.) "This is not trickle down -- it's all or nothing, you get it or you don't," says one woman who lives and works in Silicon Valley, and whose husband is a prominent technology C.E.O. "You make your first million, then 5, then 10, and the numbers just get crazy. They're almost unbelievable. I remember being told about five years ago, if you don't have $25 million you're not a player -- now that number sounds very small. If you have $250 million, well, you need to be a billionaire. The ripple effect of this on a society is large and alarming. It's like looking at the robber barons, but thousands of them."
There are other routes to wealth too -- for instance, being a venture capitalist who places bets on 10 new companies, assuming that if even one succeeds the returns will be immense. These cultures and subeconomies of course are full of individuals with (nearly) as wide a range of philosophies and goals and outlooks as the rest of the world. But they have several things in common that mark the era and, I believe, have a spillover effect on the rest of American life.
For one: Money doesn't matter, at least not in the normal way. Estimates vary of when this effect kicks in, as you stop evaluating extra assets in terms of the leisure, possessions, choices or other things you can buy and instead think of them mainly as markers of how you stand relative to others at the top. One young software developer, new on the job, said that he thought $200,000 a year would be the level at which no conceivable choice could be constrained. A venture capitalist has jokingly introduced the concept of the Fundamental Economic Unit, or F.E.U. This is the amount of money you will spend without thinking about it, because taking the time to shop around would just not be worthwhile. For a commuter the F.E.U. might be $3.50 for a fancy espresso whose raw ingredients cost 25 cents. I have heard discussions among software millionaires about an F.E.U. of half a million dollars, for a home bought on a whim.
The founder of an Internet company says that every dollar earned up to $300 million is positive, but beyond that point, since it mainly becomes a gauge for comparison with others, it increasingly reminds you that others have more -- like coming in fifth in the Miss America contest. Rob Glaser, who is the founder of RealNetworks, an Internet audio company, and whose personal holdings are now valued at more than $2 billion, says, "For many of the people who have had the good fortune to achieve extreme wealth, it may now be a scorecard, or one of the things that sort of motivates them and helps them keep track, but it is more of an introduced phenomenon than an inherent one." That is, people who came into the business in the 1980's thought it would be interesting, and found that it made them rich. For many new arrivals, he says, sheer wealth are the draw.
A world where money is a marker and all comparisons are directed upward makes it hard to understand people for whom a million dollars would be a fortune, or those for whom $10,000 would be the difference between affording college or not, not to mention those for whom $246 is a full week's earnings, before tax, at the minimum wage. The titans of earlier eras were forced into an awareness that there was a proletariat. Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan had to consider at least the existence of a working class willing to strike over a dollar's difference in weekly pay. The financial-engineering wave of the 1980's also gave leveraged-buyout artists the same uneasy exposure to working America that bomber pilots have to the civilians below, since reorganizing a company often meant liquidating jobs. With the tech economy the connection is faint. "If you were manufacturing cars, you had no choice but to deal with a large blue-collar work force of comparatively uneducated people," says Charles Ferguson, a writer and consultant who founded a software company and sold it to Microsoft for well over $100 million. "If you are a Net entrepreneur, you don't have to give a damn."
A young man who had worked exclusively at one software company told me, "Speaking for myself, I really don't know people who aren't comfortable." He pointed out that no matter what country his workmates came from, they all had surprisingly comparable professional-class upbringings. "I've dealt with very few people whose position is different from mine." That is why, he said, when he saved up enough money he wanted to quit and teach high school.
"Because of the intensity of the work, you tend to operate in a cocoon," says Glaser of RealNetworks. Like other Americans, but even more so, people in fast-growing tech companies work long hours, are on the phone or in their cars when not working, largely socialize with those they know from work and are so desperate to make time for their spouses, children and friends that they feel they have very little left over for anyone else. "Inside that cocoon you tend to be oblivious to the role the surrounding ecostructure plays in your success. From inside the cocoon you see only the cocoon. It is unfortunate but understandable that people who have achieved these results have an insular view of why they have achieved it -- and why others haven't."
The tech establishment has solved, in a fashion, a problem that vexes the rest of America -- and therefore thinks about it in a way that seems to prefigure a larger shift. The hallway traffic in any major technology firm is more racially varied than in other institutions in the country. (It is also overwhelmingly male.) But the very numerous black and brown faces belong overwhelmingly to immigrants, notably from India, rather than to members of American minority groups. The percentage of African-Americans and Latinos in professional positions in booming tech businesses is extremely low, nearing zero at many firms. "Where I grew up in Missouri, I never met a Jewish person," says Reed Koch, 40, a manager at Microsoft. "Then I went off to college" -- Reed College, in Oregon -- and the culture was 40 percent Jewish. Suddenly I was exposed to something that was part of the national culture, but until then I'd had absolutely no awareness of." He drew the analogy to the racial situation in the rich tech world. "If you go 10 years and extremely rarely in your daily life ever encounter an American black person, I think they disappear from your awareness."
People in the tech world inhabit what they know to be a basically post-racial meritocracy. I would sit at a lunch table in the software firm with an ethnic Chinese from Malaysia on one side of me, a Pole on the other side, a man from Colombia across the table and a man born in India but reared in America next to him. This seems, to those inside it, the way the rest of the world should work, and makes the entrenched racial problems of black-and-white America seem like some Balkan rivalry one is grateful to know is on the other side of the world.
As the wealth has piled up and the original tech pioneers have aged, more of them have started to think about philanthropy. But the ones who proceed from the assumption that the new elite has something to "give back" turn out to be revealing exceptions to the general rule of emotional detachment. Almost all of them have some distinctive factors in their background that seem to have motivated them to feel tied to a culture many of their colleagues ignore.
Rob Glaser, who founded his Glaser Family Foundation nearly seven years ago, was reared by liberal activists in Yonkers, N.Y. Eric Benhamou, chairman and C.E.O. of 3Com, who has been involved in various civic efforts, was born in Algeria, reared in France and then came to the United States. Patty Stonesifer, a onetime Microsoft executive who now directs the world's largest pool of charitable assets, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, grew up in a family of Dorothy Day-style Catholic activists. Reed Koch began giving money early for care of disabled and retarded children. When he was growing up, as a Quaker, he spent summers working on a farm that cared for such children.
And then there is Paul Brainerd, 52, a tall, lean, Lincolnesque figure, with gangly limbs and a little beard. He started his working life as a journalist, but was eventually inducted into a computer-industry Hall of Fame for inventing "desktop publishing," through the PageMaker program of his company, Aldus. This program allowed personal-computer users to combine pictures, fancy layouts and text to create newsletters or journals without going to a commercial printer. Its success brought Brainerd well over $100 million when he sold the company -- a third of which he promptly plunged into his Brainerd Family Foundation, concentrating on environmental causes. He is now chairman of Social Venture Partners, an effort to coordinate giving by other recently wealthy people.
Brainerd grew up in Medford, a small town in southern Oregon where his parents ran a camera shop and most other people depended on either the lumber industry or the pear orchards. "You could really see it in a town like that, all the direct connections," he says. "Whenever interest rates went up, the mills would close, and the unemployment rate would go to 20 percent. Three or four hundred people had individual charge accounts at my parents' store, and when they were laid off they couldn't pay. My parents would take out a $10,000 loan to buy their inventory for Christmas, and they would sit down and tell us: if the season went well, we could take a vacation, and if not, we'd stay home as they paid off the loan. I feel fortunate to have had that experience to see all the bits and pieces that make up a community and how it works."
It sounds like Jimmy Stewart in "It's a Wonderful Life," but what Brainerd describes was something widespread in America about a generation ago: the ability to imagine large groups of people laid off for reasons beyond their control, an instinctive understanding of how the effects could ripple through a community, the idea that there was a community at all. The living memory of the Depression was the main vessel for this message. I grew up in the prospering 60's but amid constant reminders that my mother's family was ruined during the Depression, and that my father's felt blessed because my grandfather held onto his job. "You take a place like Microsoft, it's made of people who grew up not feeling part of their surrounding culture wherever it was, in America or France or India," says Reed Koch of Microsoft. "They're closer to each other than to anyone else."
The one political issue that deeply embroils the tech world is environmental protection. In part this is because the tech zone overlies some of America's most gorgeous scenery, from Puget Sound to the San Francisco Bay area to the central Texas hill country. But it is also because the most vivid link between the tech elite and the larger community is through the natural environment. A software engineer with $2 million in stock options can't really imagine being laid off. He can imagine ill-planned urban growth ruining a forest where he likes to hike.
What about the rest of America, denied the billion-dollar fortunes but riding comfortably in technology's lee through a decade of full employment and growing 401(k)'s? We're different from the tech elite, as long as we operate in the realm where money is still real rather than symbolic. Perhaps the very reality of money explains one journalistic oddity: I found it far easier to get people worth $100 million to talk about their wealth than the typical lawyer, consultant or recently promoted corporate manager. Professional models can talk with detachment about their beauty, because it's an established, independent entity -- like fortunes for the newly wealthy, and unlike economic standing for most of us.
Compared with the software elite, the professional- class American finds it easier to imagine financial ruin. Compared with technology employees, people who work in almost any other industry are brought into closer day-by-day contact with the ongoing tangles of black-white racial issues. And compared with the C.E.O.'s who start high-tech companies and the clever programmers and designers they employ, Americans of comparable intellectual power outside the industry spend more time thinking about public policy issues (which would not be hard, since the standard tech official spends almost none). But there is a great similarity between the view from the top and the view from the next few tiers: the increasing haziness and "Oh, yes, now that you remind me" nature of the view of the poor.
In part this is a matter of simple party politics. "During the Reagan years, at least you had an opposition party to draw attention to poverty," says Arianna Huffington, the syndicated columnist. "Because there has been a Democrat in the White House who is supposed to care about their issue, a lot of people on the Left have lost their voices."
Jamie S. Gorelick, vice chairman of Fannie Mae, notes an encouraging rise in volunteer social service but says, "I have a pessimistic view, we're not talking about poverty as much as we should be and we don't have the degree of public effort that we should have."
And Bill Shore, executive director of Share Our Strength, which works to fight hunger and poverty, echoes those thoughts: "In a perverse way prosperity hides poverty," he says. "During a recession or hard economic times, you'll read lots of stories about people out of work or homeless people. During a boom it seems unimaginable even if it's going on. Society at large is so consumed with how wealthy it is becoming that it leaves little mind share for anything else. "
To an even larger extent, it reflects either the fatigue or the maturation of thinking about policy. "Since so many people have been absorbed in the work force, the ones that haven't are relatively worse off," says Frank Raines of Fannie Mae. "A lot of the people who are not 'in' yet are having trouble dealing with society. You've got people in very rural areas, Indian reservations, central cities, who have almost no contact with the mainstream society. They don't know what the rules of the game are, how you interview, how you go about seeking a job, what you do if you're late. There's a huge socialization need to bring people into contact with the rest of the world."
Steven Rattner, a former deputy chairman at Lazard Fr<heart>res and a prominent supporter of Al Gore, says: "The people I talk with -- well, I guess I wish they thought and talked about it more than they do." But like most other people thinking and talking about the issue, he suggests that the only available remedies are indirect and long-term. "The one thing I'm sure of is that the way to solve the problem is not by taxes. First you understand the problem, which is a shift in the demand for labor. There have been huge increases in the demand for skilled labor, so wages have gone up, and falling demand for unskilled labor, so wages have gone down. Once you agree that that's the main problem, then the solution becomes fairly obvious: you have to train people to compete for better jobs, which will also reduce the supply of unskilled workers and force up wages at McDonald's."
And there is also the distance caused by politics in the deepest sense. "There is a historical puzzle to work out," says Michael Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard. "Today's accumulation of enormous wealth is unparalleled since the last Gilded Age. But the Gilded Age of a century ago brought in its wake a wave of progressive reform and public investment -- in parks, libraries, schools, and municipal projects. Today's gilded age, by contrast, hasn't generated any comparable resolve to ease the effects of inequality by strengthening public institutions."
Underneath all the incidental explanations, Sandel says, lay a shift in the conception of what a "nation" was and what might hold a national community together. "If you look back to the Progressive Era," he says, all of those public undertakings were consciously part of nation building. "Teddy Roosevelt spoke of a new nationalism. Government undertook to regulate big business and the effects of great wealth, in the name of the national interest. There were appeals to a sense of national community, and to the mutual responsibilities of citizens of the nation, that don't seem so readily available today."
And the root of the difference may be, he suggests, that the first Gilded Age attended the growth of a national industrial base and economy, whereas today's second wave largely reflects the emergence of a global economy with global markets. Its beneficiaries pay less attention to national borders when it comes to exploring markets, and seeking finance, and recruiting workers -- and feeling connection to other "citizens." "There is something very abstract and distant about the dependencies of the new economy," he says. "This may have something to do with the difficulty of summoning Americans to a sense of national community now."

HEADLINE: Clown Prince of the Emerald Empire

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
ON Jan. 19, 1934, a fleet of black Packards glided to a stop at the Arsenal at Fifth Avenue and 64th Street, the headquarters of the New York City Parks Department. Robert Moses and his lieutenants bounded out. Within minutes, Moses had fired virtually everyone, and within weeks, he had marshaled armies of relief workers, architects and no-nonsense bosses to begin changing the face of New York City's parks.
Each January, Henry J. Stern celebrates that event with a media splurge he calls State of the Parks. There is live music, a slide show, food and remarks from the second-longest-serving parks commissioner after Moses, namely Mr. Stern. It is a massively self-indulgent display that hints at the complexity of this unusual public servant. 
 Mr. Stern, 64, points out that he will have served only 14 years and 9 months as commissioner in the administrations of Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani (in between, under David N. Dinkins, Betsy Gotbaum held the job), presuming he and the mayor fill out their current term. (Moses was commissioner for 26 years.) If Mr. Giuliani leaves a year earlier to be a senator, Mr. Stern could leave too. In any case, the career of one of the city's most enduring, colorful and visible public servants is winding down.
The two commissioners share qualities beyond longevity, among them an ability to increase the amount of the city's parkland -- only Moses acquired more acreage than Mr. Stern -- and a willingness to use every trick in the book to accomplish their goals.
In the Koch administration, for example, Mr. Stern threw up environmental and other roadblocks to kill plans by Borough President Donald Manes of Queens to hold a Grand Prix road race in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, even though Mr. Koch had signed on to the idea. During the Giuliani administration, Mr. Stern deliberately did not ask the Art Commission for approval of the yardarms -- nautical flagpoles topped by three flags (American, city and parks department) -- that he yearns to erect in every park. Only a lawsuit forced him to grudgingly seek appropriate permission.
But the biggest similarity to Moses may be visible success. With none of the federal dollars Moses cadged from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Stern has unleashed thousands of welfare workers, made available by the mayor to do cleaning and maintenance. The parks are cleaner than they have been in years, thanks to a tough new rating system dreamed up by Mr. Stern. He has added more than 1,600 acres of parkland, more than he gained in the Koch administration and four times that acquired under Mayor Dinkins.
Mr. Stern has also quadrupled annual capital spending to $200 million to finance various projects, from a reconstruction of Foley Square in Lower Manhattan to a redo of the Orchard Beach bathhouse in the Bronx. Through complicated machinations, he has figured out ways to use money from the city's capital budget, which is intended for physical improvements, routine repairs and other operating expenses, thereby making up for cuts in the department's operations budget. The department can now replace the shingles on the roof of a parks facility without waiting for the entire roof to collapse and putting a million-dollar dent in his budget.
In addition, Mr. Stern has recruited more than 40,000 volunteers to help out in the local parks. He has passed out 10,000 cards making citizens members of the park family, and he is using events like cocktail parties to encourage young professionals to make city parks their first charity. A sense of belonging is the main objective, although financial contributions are welcome.
His most magical achievement might be planting beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers in 800 traffic triangles and street medians, something no one ever thought of before. His goal is to beautify a total of 2,001 triangles before 2001.
Today, Mr. Stern rules an emerald empire of 28,156 acres that includes 980 playgrounds, 614 ball fields, 35 recreation centers and 14 miles of beaches, staffed by 2,121.
Park advocates applaud the emperor's efforts. But they worry about a deeper, more insidious trend: the steady erosion of day-to-day support for parks. Mr. Stern has not fought the mayor on a succession of cuts in the department's expense budget, not even a $6.4 million slice proposed for the coming fiscal year, the biggest yet. Elizabeth A. Cooke, executive director of the Parks Council, a research and advocacy group, says the effects of these cuts are evident in the city's failure to perform tasks that unskilled welfare workers cannot do, like electrical work and tree maintenance.
Although she applauds Mr. Stern's efficiency and his outreach efforts, Ms. Cooke wonders why he has watched silently as what she considers basic needs go unmet. Is it because of his political loyalty? A bureaucratic mind-set? Her only answer is, "He wants to be commissioner very badly."
 
Captain Quirk Of the Parkship Enterprise
Although Mr. Stern has clearly accomplished a great deal during his tenure, his achievements are often secondary to stories of his eccentricities. In many respects he is a true New York character. He snacks on canned soup and cold peas, offering visitors tastes from his own spoon and appearing genuinely disappointed when they refuse. He falls asleep during phone conversations. He regularly prowls 99-cent stores.
"A lot of folks have the feeling he isn't always there," said David Lutz, coordinator of the Neighborhood Open Spaces Campaign, an advocacy group.
Certainly, Mr. Stern can seem obscure. He has devised a set of heretofore unwritten rules whose numbers he and his aides call out during meetings, to the bafflement of the unknowing. Many, like No. 20D, "the Don Corleone rule" -- "We've all chosen the business we're in" -- emphasize loyalty.
Sometimes the quirkiness has a sharper edge. Mr. Stern has been known to make racial and anti-gay jokes, often with little regard for who may be listening. More seriously, there have been a stream of employee complaints of racial discrimination. This is not uncommon in a large agency.
But now the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is investigating a complaint by agency employees that blacks and Hispanics are victims of a pattern of discrimination, including reprisals for complaining. The case is being handled by the same lawyers who represented the boxer Hurricane Carter in his fight to overturn a conviction for murder. A class action suit is expected to result. Department lawyers say they are cooperating with the investigation and will answer any questions about a suit if and when one is filed.
A lawyer, Lewis M. Steel, said it was extraordinary for 20 employees to come forward at the risk of losing their jobs. "The claim is that the tone is set from the top and that there are certain practices for which the commissioner himself is responsible," Mr. Steel said.
But to the public, such issues usually get lost as Mr. Stern's impish image relentlessly prowls the morning news programs. Perhaps only Police Commissioner Howard Safir gets more publicity than Mr. Stern and his endless publicity stunts, typical of which was an event that involved releasing wood frogs, quail and screech owls into parks where they might once have lived, despite ecologists' complaints that the original environments should have been restored first.
With Boomer, his golden retriever, at his side, Mr. Stern is likely to show up anywhere, anytime, in an odd costume, from matador to toy soldier. He once cut a roll of toilet paper instead of a ribbon to celebrate the first flush of a new restroom.
"What can you say about somebody who dresses up as a tree and brings his own dog?" asked Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, a friend and sometime critic of Mr. Stern's.
Mr. Stern's outrageousness was underlined by a remark to a group of Chinese children ogling Boomer: He told them they could pet him but not eat him. One of his oddest habits is bestowing "park names" (he is Starquest) on more than 6,000 people. Given Mr. Stern's generally acknowledged brilliance -- he started school as a third grader and at 22 was the youngest graduate of his Harvard Law School class -- this habit is viewed as a way of calming an overly active mind.
Mr. Stern can also be a fighter. He wrote a law describing the destruction of a tree as "arborcide," an offense that would carry a possible jail sentence, and pushed it through the City Council. He has waged pitched battles against leashless dogs. He is considering the imposition of $1,000 fines for repeat litterers.
 
A Political Pit Bull
First and foremost, Mr. Stern is a political animal. He is also intensely loyal to Mayor Giuliani, to the extent that people not in current favor with the administration may be excluded from ribbon cuttings, even for projects they helped get off the ground.
"I wasn't invited to events at parks I paid for," complained Ms. Freed, an outspoken Democrat. "My name wasn't even on the program."
Because of this loyalty, Mr. Stern also sidesteps some fights that park advocates wish he would address. In addition to meekly accepting the budget he is given, he has not said a word against the administration's attacks on community gardens, a stormy issue around the city. His explanation is that he only fights potentially winning battles and works behind the scenes to persuade the City Council to restore the mayor's cuts.
Of course, Mr. Stern's empire pales before the great Moses machine, which rolled out beaches, pools and playgrounds with ruthless efficiency. Instead, Mr. Stern has presided over a shrinking agency, which now has half the number of employees he supervised during the Koch Administration.
He had hoped for more. Early in his tenure under Mr. Giuliani, which began in 1994, Mr. Stern spoke of returning the parks' proportion of the city budget to 1 percent of the total from about 0.5 percent. He had raised the figure to 0.8 percent during the Koch administration.
He condemned the cuts in the department's budget that had been made under Mayor Dinkins, and said chopping further would be like "performing liposuction on a skeleton." He said the city could not ask private donors to contribute to parks if the government itself was in full-scale retreat. He dreamed of recovering some of the 13,000 acres of the Gateway National Recreation Area the city ceded to Washington in 1974 during the fiscal crisis.
But if he fought for more resources, advocates say it was a very quiet fight. His agency's share of the municipal expense budget stuck stubbornly at less than 0.5 percent of the $37 billion total, even as the municipal surplus swelled in the wake of Wall Street's biggest boom.
Increasingly, private money is sought to fill the gap, following the tremendous success of the Central Park Conservancy, which was created in 1980 by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers. Mr. Stern has tried to replicate the conservancy in myriad different forms, with particular success in Prospect Park but limited success elsewhere.
"The mayor's constant message is that park maintenance, operations and programming should be increasingly dependent on private money," Ms. Cooke of the Parks Council said. "I am sure Henry Stern is as sad as any of us at the degree to which hands have been tied in the Giuliani administration."
Others see Mayor Giuliani as simply continuing a tradition of candidates' giving lip service to parks, then refusing to support them after being elected. "The parks budget now needs to be doubled, yet every other claim on the city trumps park claims," said Linda Davidoff, who as an officer of Citizen Action, an advocacy group, is fighting to change the way parks are financed, probably by a referendum on the ballot.
Mr. Stern's response has been to do more with less, and seize every opportunity.
When Mayor Giuliani briefed commissioners on his workfare program shortly after taking office, Mr. Stern requested as many bodies as he could get. The result has been 4,000 to 6,000 "free" workers, each putting in 28 hours a week.
To compensate for the erosion of his operating budget, he has dipped into capital funds to finance routine repairs. For executive help, he regularly recruits at Ivy League universities and gets wave upon wave of eager, cheap brainpower.
"I can make the parks run pretty well," Mr. Stern said when asked to name his chief accomplishment. "That's what I've done."
Many agree. "He's going to be rated as one of the best," Ms. Rogers said. Anthony Dapolito, who has headed the Parks Committee of Manhattan Community Board 2 in Greenwich Village since the Moses era, terms Mr. Stern "great." Rudy Washington, the deputy mayor who oversees parks, calls Mr. Stern "the master of government."
The mayor declined to comment directly on Mr. Stern's record. But when members of the commissioner's youthful brain trust meet socially with their counterparts at City Hall and grill them about how their boss is regarded, a typical reply is, "The mayor thinks he's really whacked, but he always says he is one of his best commissioners."
Still, Mr. Stern is sometimes kept on a short leash. Mr. Washington personally oversaw the much-praised redesign of City Hall Park and is doing the same thing with East River Park, another mayoral priority. The idea of having the city's Economic Development Agency direct the City Hall Park renovation was seriously discussed, Mr. Stern acknowledged.
 
Stern at the Helm of His Vessel
On a recent Sunday, Mr. Stern spent a typical day wandering the city he has known and loved all his life. He began by starting a race in Central Park. An anxious man approached to talk about owls in the park.
He then climbed into a green Parks Department utility vehicle and headed north. En route, he recounted the story of a life that began with a childhood as the son of emigre Jews from Germany and Russia (his father and mother, respectively), tossing out delicious details about a city that is mostly lost except in cherished myth.
"In September 1940, as war clouds darkened, they sent me to kindergarten at P.S. 152," Mr. Stern said as the vehicle headed to his old neighborhood of Inwood in northern Manhattan, where his father sold tents to would-be urban campers. "Then a sort of strange thing happened. They figured out I could read and write."
Young Henry was put in a precursor to today's special education classes, for "kids who were odd in some way," he said, where a vital part of his personality began to flower. He was charming. "The teacher wanted to adopt me," he said.
So did others. "I hate to use the word mascot," said Solon Beinfeld, a boyhood chum. "But there was a bit of that."
Mr. Stern eventually enrolled in the Bronx High School of Science. His next step was City College, where he was vice president of the student government. He entered Harvard Law School at 19.
When he graduated in 1957, he wrote Robert Moses and asked for a job. "I thought he was the most significant public figure doing important things," Mr. Stern said, "and I wanted to be part of it."
Moses never replied. Mr. Stern believes it had something to do with his Jewish last name. "Unlike Moses, I'm openly Jewish," he said sardonically, alluding to a much-commented-upon issue in Moses's life.
Despite his degree, Mr. Stern didn't want to practice law, and in any case he believed that Wall Street and Park Avenue firms would not be interested in him because he was a Jew, though a largely secular one. One day he told his dentist he was looking for a job. The result was a clerkship with another patient, a state judge.
The judge was a member of the Liberal Party, which Mr. Stern had joined in college. The Liberal identification, to which he has clung through most of his career and which has served him well, helped him land a job in the administration of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who was eager for Liberal support as he fought the remnants of Tammany Hall.
As secretary to the Manhattan borough president, Edward R. Dudley, Mr. Stern attended community meetings every night and loved it. He became friendly with anti-machine Democrats like Mr. Koch, and the two went to Mississippi in 1965 to march for civil rights. Mr. Stern persuaded Mr. Koch to endorse John V. Lindsay for mayor, earning him a post in the Lindsay administration as executive director of the Parks Department.
In 1973, he ran for City Council, seeking one of two at-large seats. He won one and Robert F. Wagner Jr. the other. They shared an office, sold neckties for charity and delighted in opposing Democratic regulars.
As his vehicle bounced through Bronx neighborhoods near Long Island Sound, Mr. Stern repeatedly called headquarters to report graffiti, as he does roughly twice a day. A shabby traffic triangle was reported as a potential beautification site. Boomer sat at his side, watching everything.
At Orchard Beach, Mr. Stern presided over the annual icy dip by the Polar Bears, those intrepid cold-weather swimmers who once a year leave Coney Island for more northern waters. He seemed to know them all by name, and everyone petted Boomer. (For more than a year, Mr. Stern or an aide carried a clicker to record each pet. But four clickers wore out, press criticism grew and a dog in Virginia with 400,000 pets seemed unbeatable. The clicking stopped.)
His self-guided biography continued with his first stint as parks commissioner under Mayor Koch, who appointed him in 1983. Mr. Stern was not reappointed when Mr. Dinkins became mayor in 1990. Although Mr. Stern has expressed disappointment about that decision, he insists he did not have to be escorted from the commissioner's office to make way for his successor, Ms. Gotbaum, a story her aides tell. He says he just stopped by that day to pick up some things, although does not dispute that he kept a key to a city swimming pool for private swims.
During a subsequent stint as president of the Citizens Union, a good-government advocacy group then headed by Mr. Wagner, Mr. Stern began cultivating Mr. Giuliani, who had just lost the election to Mr. Dinkins. Mr. Stern also introduced one of his aides, Richard Schwartz, to Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Schwartz became one of his top campaign advisers and the architect of City Hall's workfare policy, and Mr. Stern returned as parks commissioner in 1994.
In his own way, he is now striving, or claims to be striving, for a more balanced life. He often arranges his cluttered days to include his wife, Peggy, a pediatrician who runs city health clinics in Harlem.
The Sterns have two sons, Jared, 22, a management consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Kenan, 19, a sophomore at Harvard. Friends tell of the time Jared returned from college and was picked up in a Parks Department vehicle by his father, who for some reason was dressed up like Louis XIV. After 15 minutes of silence, the young man asked, "Dad, why are you dressed like that?"
Mr. Stern says he would not presume to offer himself as a parks commissioner under another mayor after Mr. Giuliani leaves office. His goal, he says, is to be remembered as "a cheerful reformer." He particularly admires such 19th-century New York reformers as Andrew Haskell Green and Samuel Tilden. Why no 20th-century heroes? "Maybe because I know most of them," he said.
His last stop in the department vehicle was at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, where he visited his 100-year-old aunt, Dora, as he does every month. They time-traveled to a long-ago Stern household full of children and their friends, spirited music and even more spirited debate. Neither thought to mention Robert Moses, who was then bending the city to his dreams.
"Henry was always bright," she said, patting her nephew's hand. "My sister had smart children."

 BODY:

THE HOOK
 By Donald E. Westlake.
 280 pp. New York:
 The Mysterious Press/Warner Books. $23.95. 
 DONALD E. WESTLAKE'S new mystery is more than high concept; it is pretty much all concept, and its premise -- that two authors might be crazy enough to commit murder for the sake of a book deal -- may appeal to anyone who follows publishing. In the current conglomerate-induced state of paranoia, murderous thoughts are common.
"The Hook" has two antiheroes: Bryce Proctorr, a best-selling novelist who has a big contract but no manuscript to show for it, and his old friend Wayne Prentice, who has a manuscript but no publisher. Proctorr proposes that he submit Prentice's manuscript as his own; then they'll split the big advance. The only catch is that Proctorr is in the middle of a bitter divorce, and his estranged wife would grab up half his check, too, leaving him with nothing. So he imposes one condition: Prentice must kill Mrs. Proctorr.
The idea of killing a woman he's never met for a half-million dollars causes Prentice some little doubt, but he's been through rough times. His publishing career is at the mercy of the computer: small sales on one book mean a smaller print run on the next, which means yet smaller sales, and so on. He's resorted to publishing under a pen name while pretending to live in Europe, unavailable for editorial meetings and book tours, but now even his pseudonym's sales are falling. As the novel opens, he's investigating the possibility of college teaching -- a low point indeed, since it may land him in the Midwest,
far from his spacious yet economical Greenwich Village apartment. Even this reviewer, ensconced in a Midwestern university, feels his pain.
At a time when rumors about the real identities of some so-called first novelists float through the literary world, the novel's opening conceits are clever. Westlake doesn't play it for the satire, though: he concentrates on building suspense with as many twists and bends as a plot can endure. His characters are no-dimensional, so flat that the extent of their worrying about whether somebody deserves to be murdered can be measured by Prentice's line, "What if she turns out to be a nice person?" Later, getting closer to the bloody deed, he thinks, "There's good and bad in everybody." Maybe a truer thought has never been expressed, but it's hard to believe that this guy makes his living writing sentences. Perhaps to complement Prentice's unwriterly way with words, his wife works for a charitable organization but -- you guessed it -- she's not very charitable. There's no room for moral dillydallying in the Prentice household; it's off to the next plot points.
Some of the conceptual twists, especially those concerning popular writing, are very smart. Midway through "The Hook," you realize that you may be riding a new wave of pop fiction: meta-pop, the genre novel about the writing of the genre novel. One funny bit has Proctorr changing Prentice's word "winced" to "twinged" throughout the manuscript, which pains Prentice and reader alike. In an interview, Proctorr goes on at length about Borges's story "The Garden of Forking Paths," only to admit at the end that he's never actually read Borges, the master of the conceptual story. Book titles throughout -- Two Faces," "The Shadowed Other," "Double Impact" -- call attention to Proctorr and Prentice as psychological halves of one sinister reality.
But the sinister reality is not really explored (too many the concepts, too short the chapters). There are a couple of scenes that suggest what psychological issues are at stake: in one, without realizing he is about to do it, Prentice begins to beat a woman viciously; in the other, Proctorr follows a fan home and must decide whether to outdo his old friend in the woman-bashing department. Both are creepy and effective scenes that get for a brief moment into the heads of two men who have a slightly more serious problem than their latest book contract. In the best mysteries, moments like these resonate and make us contemplate not just the villains' capacity for violence but our own most frightening desires and dances with death.
But Proctorr and Prentice (proctor and apprentice?) have busy, glamorous, best-selling lives to live, and more narrative space is spent on their square footage, their furniture, their entertaining. New York is a concept city in this novel, bordered by Central Park West and the Village, with Connecticut lush on the horizon. A promising detective -- he has the makings of a real character, with at least two dimensions -- pursues the evil writer pair, but he is a working-class stiff and he fades away. Too bad: he's on to the really nasty stuff that can happen when ambitious men find their wives too grasping, too controlling. Donald Westlake is on to it, too, but he is very good at that concept thing he does, gliding along the story's icy surface, so that is mostly where he stays.

HEADLINE: Inspiring Taxi Drivers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The current shortage of taxis (news article, March 17) is a result of many factors, some of which can be alleviated. "Taxi crackdowns" by the police, license suspensions and revocations all take their toll. An applicant for a hack license must now take an 80-hour class that he or she must pay for while being unemployed -- and this includes veteran drivers who might want to return to the industry part time. 
 I drove a taxi full time for 12 years and taught hack license applicants, preparing them for their hack license tests. Were I to try to return to the industry I would be faced with this formidable hurdle. Issuing more medallions for taxis to sit idle is not a solution. Inducing workers to want to drive taxis is.

HEADLINE: $1 More for Middle Class

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A March 13 editorial calls for a "much-needed minimum-wage increase." You should define "need." In New York, those who will benefit have an average family income of $42,231 per year. The minimum wage is now a middle-class entitlement. Minimum-wage workers almost always live in homes with other wage earners. 
 If the $1 increase becomes law, the national minimum wage will have risen 45 percent over five years. Worse, Congress is mandating this national labor-cost increase without respect to local economic conditions.
Research shows that after a wage increase, and given price-sensitive consumers, employers seek applicants who have better skills and make fewer mistakes. One study found that teenagers and students, who are perceived as having better skills, crowd out low-skilled adults after such an increase.

Old-Line Law FirmLinks Up to the New Economy

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Anyone doubting the increasingly mainstream status of Internet start-ups need only hear two words: Bob Dole.
The former senator and 1996 Republican presidential nominee offered the opening remarks on Thursday evening at the coming-out party in Washington for EqualFooting .com, a dot-com that plans to create an online marketplace where small businesses would buy industrial supplies, like plumbing equipment and hydraulic systems, from national distributors. 
 What has any of this to do with Mr. Dole?
He holds the title of special counsel at the powerhouse Washington law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand. The firm represents EqualFooting and is making e-commerce a new focus. Last Thursday's party came after the firm's announcement earlier in the day that it was starting an Internet ventures group.
In the 10 minutes or so that he spoke, Mr. Dole praised EqualFooting and promoted the law firm's efforts to be part of the digital economy.
Indeed, the law firm's courtship of dot-coms demonstrates how little distance is left between the high-technology world, once staunchly unwilling to cozy up to Capitol Hill, and the inside-the-beltway elite, formerly dismissive of the Internet's role in the economy.
Marla P. Grossman, former minority counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee and now director of Verner Liipfert's Internet group, contends that her firm can wield its influence in Washington to help Internet interests "use the resources of Capitol Hill."
Technology companies "are realizing increasingly that Washington, D.C.'s influence really extends across the nation and its influence has a direct and significant impact on their bottom line," she said.
But while the old-style, old-economy law firm may know Capitol Hill, it may have to come up to speed itself to be a player in the Internet world.
Ms. Grossman cited as one of the firm's dot-com accomplishments the fact that it helped Angie Kim, the president of EqualFooting.com, get a speaking engagement at an e-commerce conference held at Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan. But just how much influence the law firm can exert may depend on whether it can reach beyond the heartland in Saginaw Valley to the heart of Silicon Valley. MATT RICHTEL

HEADLINE: Bracing Views From a Man Of Mysteries

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
There is a scene in the novel "Devil in a Blue Dress" that peeps at the place where Walter Mosley's politics and art meet. Easy Rawlins has been pressed into detective service by DeWitt Albright, a mysterious, sinister man who lures Easy with enough money to make the overdue mortgage payments on his beloved home. Easy is a Negro and DeWitt is white in the Los Angeles of 1948.
"I don't belong to anybody," Easy says to Albright's assertion that he paid him and thus owns him. 
 "We all owe out something, Easy," Albright replies. "When you owe out then you're in debt and when you're in debt then you can't be your own man. That's capitalism."
And so it is that capitalism is the theme of Mr. Mosley's first book of nonfiction, a slim, eight-chapter essay called "Workin' on the Chain Gang: Shaking Off the Dead Hand of History" (Library of Contemporary Thought). The book, published earlier this year, explores a range of issues, including race, culture and global politics.
The unifying thread is the moral and economic stranglehold of capitalism, as seen through the prism of the black American experience. His is a progressive rather than Marxist stance and offers different ways of looking at some old problems, rather than solutions.
"Chain Gang" begins with the idea that the millennium is an artificial marker of human progress. Mr. Mosley looks at such defining events as the enslavement of Africans in the New World, the Holocaust and the detonation of the atomic bomb and contrasts technological advances with our attitudes toward human life over the years.
He argues that although race is still a major problem in America and technology has far outpaced moral growth, the greatest malignancy is the juggernaut of capitalism.
"What black people have experienced as a group for centuries many whites now experience as solitary and alienated individuals," Mr. Mosley writes. "In their various groups white Americans might feel that they belong, that there is a group spirit that looks out for them. But individually they suffer the barbs of bureaucratic indifference and the vicissitudes of corporate whims like everyone else."
Publishers Weekly called the book "an ardent manifesto" and a "provocative declaration of intellectual and political independence." Kirkus Reviews crowned Mr. Mosley "a significant African-American thinker."
The final chapter of "Chain Gang" begins with Malcolm X's line, "You have been bamboozled," from a speech about American society that he made at a Harlem rally.
"And he was right," Mr. Mosley writes. "Black people had been fooled and lied to and broken over the promise of freedom. But the truth is that all Americans have been fooled and broken.
"Democracy and capitalism make strange bedfellows," the essay continues. "In this odd brew freedom becomes a commodity. A price is put upon our only asset, our labor."
Mr. Mosley, who is famous for his five Easy Rawlins mysteries, said he wrote the book to foment and prolong a dialogue about issues dear to his heart. He has always been political, he said, and a nonfiction book on a serious subject was another way to resist artistic pigeonholing.
Mr. Mosley said that he initially chose to write about race in the 21st century but that as he chewed on his thoughts the book turned into something more complex. That should not surprise anyone who understands his fiction, he said.
"I'm one of the only people in America writing now about black male heroes; that in itself is a political act, to see and cast black men in America in a positive role," Mr. Mosley said over lunch at a Greenwich Village restaurant that he frequents. At 48 he is loquacious, easygoing, discernibly smart.
"The other thing is, I write about very real social situations," Mr. Mosley said. "When I write about Easy Rawlins and he goes out to the desert and a guy turns a gun on him, Easy doesn't understand it isn't necessarily about race but because the guy thinks he is going to rob him. But race informs how the guy looks at him, too, and how Easy responds.
"Socrates Fortlow is completely political," he said of another recurring character. "He seeks redemption. He wants to form bonds and hope in the black community."
On the other hand, Mr. Mosley said, "I'm no more political than Mark Twain or Charles Dickens or Herman Melville."
Mr. Mosley, a Los Angeles native who lives in Greenwich Village, has written 11 books. "Devil in a Blue Dress" (1990), his first, created an astonished gasp of pleasure in the literary world and opened the door for other black mystery writers. It didn't hurt that President Clinton called him his favorite writer.
Since Easy showed up, Mr. Mosley's work has been translated into 20 languages and crossed over into movies. In 1995 "Devil in a Blue Dress" became a film starring Denzel Washington. In 1998 Laurence Fishburne starred as Socrates Fortlow in "Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned" on HBO. A television series based on the Easy Rawlins character is being discussed with ABC.
Mr. Mosley made his debut recently in The New Yorker with a short story about a young man on Wall Street. His first play, about three dysfunctional relationships, will be produced in Hartford in September. He is also working on a series of science fiction stories set in the New York of 2040, and HBO wants another screenplay based on the latest Socrates novel.
Characters like Socrates Fortlow, a 60-ish convicted rapist and murderer living a hardscrabble life in a Los Angeles slum, are imbued with dignity and insight. They seem to reflect Mr. Mosley's delight in subversion, in turning the expected into the unexpected.
He is, after all, the son of a Jewish mother and African-American father who married and made their home in Los Angles when such couples were considered eccentric at best. His parents stayed together until his father died seven years ago. They were crippled by the obvious inequities of being themselves in that time and place, he said, but they loved each other and loved him enough that he finally reached a place emotionally where he could be himself.
Mr. Mosley left behind a job as a computer programmer after the beginnings of a novel floated into his head. It became "Devil in a Blue Dress." That was only a decade ago. Like a lot of people, he said, he took a long time to grow up and discover his real affinities and talents.
"I feel myself as a real, everyday kind of American guy," Mr. Mosley said when asked whether his fiction fans might question his moral or intellectual authority to tackle "Chain Gang." "I can't tell you what to do. I can't answer the problem. I'm just somebody who thinks about it, and I came to the conclusion that our moral and technological potential is severely limited by how much we've bought into capitalism."
What happens, he said, is that people do not see common suffering brought about by economic constraints, but focus on their own victimization. And because blacks have historically been marginalized and many social ills have been presented as minority issues, the white skinhead and the struggling black mother fail to realize that their insurance companies or their bosses are giving them both the short end of the stick.
Mr. Mosley said he placed his hope for political and social change on a younger generation that seemed willing to make the leap to put black people in the center of the American drama.

HEADLINE: The Auction Hullabaloo Reverberates At Art Fair

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, March 19

 BODY:
When the doors to the European Fine Art Fair opened here on Friday afternoon, the 198 exhibitors were all smiles, eager to talk about the prized offerings they were placing before some 8,200 visitors who poured into the convention center where the fair is held every March.
But beneath the polite banter, the atmosphere at this, the world's largest art fair, was politically charged. Talk of the unfolding federal antitrust investigation of auction houses in New York was everywhere, and with it speculation about the increase that the biggest of the houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, plan to charge buyers. 
 The effects all this will have on dealers is uncertain. The negative publicity Sotheby's and Christie's have been getting is making the dealers look good, they say. Some already report that they are being offered more goods from collectors who once relied on auctions to sell.
"People are a little uncertain about selling at auction until things get sorted out," said Timothy Bathurst, a director of Artemis Fine Arts, a London gallery that specializes in old master and 19th-century paintings. "In some cases we're being offered things for sale that Sotheby's or Christie's would have normally gotten."
But the situation is double-edged. Amongthe many dealers who have traditionally relied heavily on buying their stock at auction there is concern that they will not be able to buy as much because the expensive commissions these auction houses are charging -- as much as 20 percent on the first $50,000 -- will eat too deeply into their profits.
There is also much speculation about the effects the investigation will have on the spring fine art sales, which are held in New York every May. While the dealers here are secretly hoping to benefit, officials at Sotheby's and Christie's maintain that the May sales this year will remain strong.
"While there are no single big estates like a Whitney or a Ganz, in terms of monetary value our main Impressionist and post-Impressionist sale will be as big as it has been the last few seasons," said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's Impressionist and post-Impressionist art department worldwide.
Officials at Sotheby's estimate their evening Impressionist and modern art sale this May will be impressive too, with $100 million to $135 million worth of art for sale.
In today's strong economy collectors are so hungry for good material they will buy wherever the goods are. "No dealer is publicly gloating about all that's going on," said Nicholas Hall, who runs the New York branch of Hall & Knight. The gallery, which also has a branch in London, specializes in old master paintings. "People are going to continue to buy art regardless of the behavior of the auction houses," he said.
Many of the estimated 70,000 people who will have visited the fair by the time it ends on Sunday are serious buyers. Within the first 24 hours dealers were reporting brisk business. While the fair has always attracted serious collectors because of the quality of its goods, this year's art, antiques and antiquities are particularly impressive. There is a staggering selection of every collecting category from old masters to textiles, jewelry and contemporary art.
Since its began 26 years ago, the fair has been known as the most comprehensive place to see old master paintings. It still is. Among the best is an early still life at Haboldt & Company, a gallery with branches in Paris and New York. Its title is more or less its full description: "Figs on a Tazza With Vine Leaves, a Basket of Grapes, Roses, Irises in a Glass Vase With Cherries, Pears, Plums, Cob Nuts, Peaches and Other Fruit on a Draped Table with Butterflies." It was done circa 1590-1600 by an artist known only as the Master of the Hartford Still Life.
"It is the beginning of still-life painting as we know it," said Bob Haboldt, the gallery's owner. "Perhaps the inspiration came from Caravaggio, perhaps the artist had met Bruegel the Elder, but it's a complete invention. It comes without any baggage of art history."
On a table draped with a white cloth is a well-balanced composition of fruits and flowers that are so alive on the canvas they almost seem in movement. Mr. Haboldt bought the painting in a small auction in Italy earlier this year. A slightly smaller and later version is in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.
Another rare painting that is attracting interest hangs in Jack Kilgore's booth. The painting, "Madonna With Child and Angels," circa 1607 by the Dutch master Hendrick Goltzius, features the Virgin clad in a bright pink dress gazing down at the child with angels hovering in the background.
"It's unlined and signed on both the back and the front," said Mr. Kilgore, who runs a gallery in Manhattan. "Goltzius was a graphic designer who didn't start painting until 1600 and he died in 1617 so there are only about 40 paintings by him." Mr. Kilgore said he discovered the painting in a German collection.
While the best works here tend to come from private collections, the fair always features many paintings bought in January at the important old master paintings sales at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York. Dealers buy them, have them cleaned and restored in time for the fair and then mark them up for considerably more than they paid for them. The London dealer Richard Green, for example, has a breathtaking Canaletto from the mid-1730's, "The Grand Canal, Venice, Looking East From Campo di San Vio." He bought it at Christie's in January for $6.6 million. He is asking $9.5 million.
French & Company also has its share of recent auction purchases. A painting by Giovanni Segantini, "Springtime in the Alps," for which the gallery's chairman, Martin Zimet, paid $9.5 million at Christie's in November, is for sale for $17 million. Mr. Zimet is also selling Arcimboldo's "Reversible Anthropomorphic Portrait of a Man Composed of Fruit," which is considered an ironic portrait of Emperor Rudolph II. His price is $7.5 million. He paid just under $1.5 million for it at Sotheby's two months ago. "Sotheby's called it an Arcimboldo but we have done extensive research on the painting," Mr. Zimet said.
Every year the fair's section of modern and contemporary art gets stronger. Leslie Waddington, a London dealer who has been the chairman of the event's painting's department, has been bringing in more top dealers from Europe and New York. "As word is getting out, more modern collectors have started coming here," he said. "They aren't people interested in icon-buying; they're educated collectors." On opening day Mr. Waddington said he had sold a painting by Agnes Martin, one by Van Dongen and another by Dali.
Furniture, decorative objects and antiquities were also getting lavish attention at this year's fair. Among the rarest treasures is a tapestry based on a 12th-century legend of the life of St. Anne, dated 1527, which is being shown at the Rudigier Alte Kunst, a Munich gallery. "There are only 11 tapestries of this kind," said Gertrude Rudigier, who added that she found it in a private collection in southern Germany.
Robert Bowman, a London dealer, discovered "Vases of the Titans," a pair of terra-cotta vases by Rodin, at a chateau in France. The vases, which are signed by A. Carrier Belleuse, the owner of the workshop where Rodin was working around 1879, come from the collection of Henri Ardant, who owned the Ardant porcelain factory in France. Each vase is held up by four crouching and intricately carved titans and has a Greek key pattern at the top. Similar examples are in the collections of the Rodin Museum in Paris and the Maryhill Museum of Fine Arts in Washington.
As the crowds poured in and out of Mr. Bowman's booth, he said he was having his best fair ever. "There are several factors that are making this a success," he said. "People are thinking the stock market could crash, and it's a good time to buy art. At the same time the public is beginning to realize that the auction houses are less concerned with expertise and more with making their commissions."

HEADLINE: Presidential Election Could Alter Shapeof Tribune-Times Mirror Deal

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
In the pending merger of the Tribune Company and Times Mirror, the fate of three of Tribune's largest television stations and three of Times Mirror's largest newspapers may ultimately depend on who becomes the nation's next president.
That is because Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic candidate, favors keeping the current restrictions on companies that own both television stations and newspapers. But Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican nominee, is tilting against the existing rules. Under Tribune's proposed acquisition of the Times Mirror Company, announced last week, Tribune would control newspapers and television stations in New York, Los Angeles and Hartford, once it completed the deal. 
 But a 1974 Federal regulation known as the cross-ownership rule prohibits a company from owning a newspaper and a television station in the same geographic market. Unless revised, that rule would require the companies to either seek a rarely granted waiver or sell the newspapers or stations when their broadcast licenses come up for renewal.
Despite years of lobbying by Tribune and top executives in the newspaper and broadcast industries, neither Congress nor the Clinton administration is expected to change the rule any time soon. Mr. Gore and other officials in the administration say they support the rule because it prevents too much media power from falling into too few hands. Congressional Republicans, including Senator John McCain, who have tried to have it repealed have been blocked by top Democratic lawmakers.
While Mr. Bush has not publicly articulated a position about the rule, his top economic advisers have said it is archaic and unnecessary. And some aides have quietly promised industry executives and lobbyists that a Bush administration would move swiftly to eliminate it.
"We have been assured through reliable channels that the governor would support repeal of the rule," said John F. Sturm, the president and chief executive of the Newspaper Association of America. Shaun Sheehan, Tribune's top lobbyist in Washington, said he, too, had heard that the governor's policy advisers had said Mr. Bush would repeal the rule.
Echoing the position of the broadcast industry's lobbyists, aides to the governor's presidential campaign say they believe the rule is out of date, now that consumers can now get information from a wide array of sources that include the Internet and cable and satellite television.
"There are now so many media outlets that it would make sense to relax it," said Timothy J. Muris, a professor at the George Mason University of Law and a former senior antitrust official in the Reagan administration, who is one of Mr. Bush's top advisers on economic and competition issues.
Although support and opposition over the rule now largely follows partisan lines, the regulation was first adopted by a Republican-controlled agency at a time of concern among antitrust officials about the power, particularly in smaller markets, of companies that owned both newspaper and television outlets.
After it was approved by the Federal Communications Commission a quarter-century ago, television stations in a dozen cities had to be sold. A few newspaper companies were permitted to keep their stations in some larger cities under a grandfather clause and a handful of other companies were treated leniently, as when Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation was permitted to buy The New York Post even though the company controlled a television station, on the rationale that the newspaper might otherwise fail. Nonetheless, regulators compelled Mr. Murdoch to sell another newspaper, The Boston Herald, because his company owned a television station in the same market.
During debate over the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Mr. Gore, as the administration's lead negotiator, managed to save the cross-ownership rule from being repealed. As one of the final compromises that led to passage of the legislation, the lawmakers and the administration agreed that instead of repeal, the F.C.C. would conduct reviews every two years to reconsider the need for the rule. The agency under the Clinton administration has shown no sign of changing its stance.
The different views between the Bush and Gore camps over the cross-ownership rule illustrates one of the many ways that the presidential race could determine enforcement of antitrust and competition rules in the coming years.
During the Clinton administration, antitrust and competition in telecommunications and other industries have been among the business issues subject to the fiercest litigation and lobbying efforts.
The administration has revived antitrust enforcement and brought some of the most significant cases in a generation, including prosecution of a vitamin cartel that resulted in record-breaking fines and, still in progress, the Microsoft case. Clinton antitrust officials have also challenged a series of large and smaller mergers that would have gone unchallenged in the Reagan and Bush administrations, killing many corporate deals and ordering extensive modifications of others.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have provided relatively few specific details about views on antitrust and competition. And while whoever is in the White House sets the overall tone and philosophy, antitrust policies are generally set by the top officials appointed to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department.
Nonetheless, the candidates and their advisers have begun to drop hints that they have significantly different views about the subject.
"I call it yin and yang," said Reed Hundt, a close friend of Mr. Gore and an antitrust expert who has discussed competition policies with the vice president. Mr. Hundt served as chairman of the F.C.C. from 1993 until 1997.
"The Al Gore view is to side with the following constituencies: small companies, start-ups, innovators, and attackers of incumbents," Mr. Hundt said. "The Gore view of antitrust follows in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt through Thurman Arnold and the current administration. George Bush's view is much more beholden to large companies and incumbents and sees little role for the government."
In his few public remarks about antitrust, Mr. Bush has suggested that he would return to many of the principles of the Reagan administration and the practice of selecting antitrust enforcers whose primary goal would be to combat price-fixing -- rather than to use antitrust laws to protect consumers in industries like telecommunications, transportation and energy that have been significantly deregulated.
"My own personal view is the application of antitrust laws needs to be applied where there are clear cases of price-fixing," the governor said in an interview with The Financial Times last month. Asked whether the laws should be applied to situations beyond price-fixing, he replied, "Well, no."
Aides to the governor later clarified his remarks to say that he was not ruling out other kinds of antitrust enforcement. But they also contended that the Clinton administration had stretched some antitrust laws beyond recognition and that a Bush administration would pursue a far more laissez-faire approach similar to that of the Reagan administration.
The differences were perhaps best summed up in a recent article by Professor Muris, the senior adviser to Governor Bush, about the F.T.C.'s enforcement of monopoly law. The article, which appears in the current issue of The Antitrust Law Journal, criticizes the agency for an overly aggressive interpretation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and has chapter titles that include "The F.T.C. Is Wrong on the Law," "The F.T.C. Is Wrong on Policy" and "The F.T.C. Is Wrong on the Facts."

Siemens and Mannesmann To Form Car-Parts Venture
Siemens of Germany said its car-parts unit was planning a partnership with Mannesmann's VDO auto-parts business in the face of mounting competition in the car industry.

The Method Behind Gladwell.com
The New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell operates his own Web site, which offers all his articles online and excerpts from his new book, "The Tipping Point." But Gladwell.com is not a promotional device.

Pan Am Workers Win Pension Ruling
A federal judge has sided with employees of Pan American World Airways in a case related to their pension plan and the way it was administered by a federal agency after the airline went out of business.

Insurers Tread Carefully With Web
Insurance companies have acknowledged the Internet's potential for simplifying the byzantine process of finding insurance quotes and applying for coverage, but they also note the downsides: consumers, they say, cannot use the Web to speak with real people in real time about the complexities of coverage; and by selling directly to consumers through their own Web sites, the companies risk an insurrection among the insurance agents who have been their bedrock source of revenue.

The Beltway Courts Dot-Coms
Bob Dole -- the former senator and presidential nominee as well as a "special counsel" at a powerhouse Washington law firm -- helped hold an event last week that introduced EqualFooting.com, a company that plans to create an online marketplace where small businesses would buy industrial supplies. The law firm's courtship of dot-coms demonstrates how little distance is left between the high-technology world, once staunchly unwilling to cozy up to Capitol Hill, and the inside-the-beltway elite, formerly dismissive of the Internet's role in the economy.

Advertising's Other Super Bowl
The Oscar presentation on ABC has traditionally been the second biggest day of the year for advertising, trailing only the Super Bowl.

HEADLINE: A Senior Statesman Is Facing the Threat of Youth

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., March 13

 BODY:
On a tour of low-income housing here, Leon N. Weiner, a prominent developer, turned to the senior senator from Delaware, William V. Roth Jr., and raised an increasingly familiar question.
"People ask me, 'Is Senator Roth, at his age, ready to make another six-year commitment?' " Mr. Weiner, who will turn 80 in May, said. 
 "I'm a year older than you are, Senator, and I wouldn't make it."
Without missing a beat, Mr. Roth, seeking a sixth six-year term this fall, shot back with a smile to his still-active constituent: "Knowing you, Leon, that's a lot of baloney."
As chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Roth would be in a position to shepherd some of Capitol Hill's hottest legislation this year, like a China trade bill, tax relief and changes in health care law.
The longest serving politician in Delaware history, Mr. Roth has made a career of getting things done by working with Democrats, like Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York, the panel's ranking member.
But at 78 (Mr. Roth turns 79 in July) and facing a stiff re-election fight from Delaware's popular outgoing Democratic governor, Thomas R. Carper, Mr. Roth has become perhaps the Republicans' most vulnerable Senate candidate in campaign 2000. Since last fall the polls have been showing Mr. Carper, 53, with a 10-point lead.
In this state of 750,000 people, which takes pride in its moderate traditions and civil campaigns, voters seemed conflicted over the choice between Mr. Roth's experience and influence and the younger, more dynamic Mr. Carper.
"I'm torn," said Mr. Weiner, a Democrat. "Bill Roth is a sincere, decent and honest guy. If he were a Democrat, I'd support . . . him. But what really bothers me are some of his Republican colleagues, like Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm."
Over a lunch of cream of crab soup and Caesar salad in Dover while on a daylong swing through the state, Mr. Roth defended his decision to run again.
"I think I can make a difference, both because of my seniority and chairmanship," said Mr. Roth, a mild-mannered legislator who revels in being low-key. "This is the most exciting, challenging time to serve. I can have a real, direct impact on those key issues."
He said he was fit, despite a spill he took recently at a White House meeting on China trade. "My foot fell asleep."
 Because the Republican party has term limits for Senate chairmanships, he would have to give up the Finance Committee in 2002, undercutting his argument for seniority. Mr. Roth, a former chairman of the less prestigious Governmental Affairs Committee, could head another panel.
Democrats have already been counting Mr. Roth's seat as theirs. "Clout is the political argument of last resort," said James Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Yet, from the banking hub of Wilmington to the farmlands of southern Delaware, the issues facing the Finance Committee resounded with residents here, underscoring Mr. Roth's pivotal role.
When the Senate returns on Monday from a weeklong recess, it will take up a popular bill that Mr. Roth supports that would allow most Social Security recipients, for the first time, to earn as much money as they wanted without sacrificing any retirement benefits.
After an awards ceremony at Beebe Medical Center in Lewes, Del., Peggy Paul, a 64-year-old technician, came up to the senator to urge the measure's passage. "I would have to cut back and I want to continue working," said Ms. Paul, who would lose nearly $8,000 in Social Security benefits under the current law when she turned 65.
The committee has also planned to begin hearings soon on legislation to grant China permanent normal trading relations, a vital step for Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization. Proponents were hoping a strong vote by the panel would build momentum for accord in the House, where the prospects were dimmer.
Under the agreement, lower Chinese tariffs would benefit Delaware farmers as well as the banks and international chemical companies in the state's northern reaches.
"A lot of people don't understand it doesn't affect our markets," Mr. Roth said. "They already have access to our markets. What it does is give us access to their markets. If we don't get access, then we're handicapping ourselves.
"It would be a major fiasco if we do not act on this," he said. "A vote on normal trading relations may not only be the most important vote of the year, but of the decade."
Answering critics of permanent trade status, Mr. Roth said opening Chinese markets would also enhance democratic values there. "The more they trade, the more they tend to be guided by rule of law," Mr. Roth said. "It's a gamble, but it's the best gamble we have available."
Mr. Roth, perhaps best known for the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981 and the tax-free savings accounts that bear his name, has been backing an array of tax cuts, even though their public appeal seems to be waning in the booming economy.
The senator has backed Gov. George W. Bush's proposed tax cut of $483 billion over five years starting in 2002. But House Republicans were able to muster backing only for a smaller package, and prospects in the Senate were unclear.
"Benefits are going to those who are paying the taxes, but a lot of our proposals have been intended to help the working people," Mr. Roth said.
Which was why Republicans this year were slicing up last year's big tax package into more targeted proposals. The Finance Committee would soon be considering a Republican-sponsored bill that would reduce taxes for married couples.
Cutting taxes has not resonated with all Delaware voters.
Ron Marcozzi, a 61-year-old delicatessen owner, said he liked Mr. Roth's three decades of experience, but he wanted to hear from "the other guy" -- Mr. Carper -- because he was frustrated that Republican tax cuts have
been skewed toward the wealthy.
"Whether it's Democrats or Republicans, a little guy like me pays a lot of taxes," said Mr. Marcozzi, a Republican. "It seems the poor can't pay and the very rich don't do their part."
Mr. Roth has also played an important role in forging coalitions on health care legislation. In June 1997 he presided over late-night back-room negotiations that produced a bipartisan agreement to create a new health insurance program for children in low-income families. It was part of a comprehensive budget legislation that the Finance Committee approved by a vote of 20 to 0.
And it has not gone unnoticed here that Mr. Roth supported an increase last year in Medicare's minimum payments for pap tests, to $14.60 from $7.15 a test, insuring greater access to health-screening for female patients.
"If Senator Roth was not the Finance Committee chairman, I don't think we'd have gotten the pap-smear issue resolved," said Dr. V. Raman Sukumar, chief of pathology at Beebe Medical Center, and a registered independent. "Just this one issue will make me think of voting for him."

HEADLINE: SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP;
Weighty Cases Crowd Last 3 Months of the Term

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
With more than three months to go in its term, the Supreme Court on Monday will enter a concentrated period of unusual intensity and potential import. The justices, back from a brief recess, will begin six weeks of hearing arguments in one blockbuster case after another, a series of high-profile appeals that appear drawn from today's headlines and that have already marked the term as a likely landmark.
These questions suggest the scope of what awaits the justices among the two dozen cases they will hear between now and the last week in April, the final building blocks of the 1999-2000 term: 
 Does public prayer before a high school football game violate the separation of church and state?
Are the Miranda warnings still required before the police can interrogate a suspect in custody, or has Congress effectively overruled the 34-year-old Miranda decision?
Can states put into effect their own views of foreign policy by withholding state business from companies that trade with disfavored regimes.
Can states, and by extension Congress, criminalize the surgical procedure that abortion opponents call "partial-birth abortion"?
Do the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay youths and men from leadership roles?
These cases and more -- on the legal threshold for winning an employment discrimination case, on constitutional standards for enhanced sentencing under hate crime laws, on congressional authority to make arson a federal crime, on whether political parties can be required to open their primaries to voting by nonmembers -- are all due for decision by the end of June, the court's goal for resolving all argued cases and finishing its term.
"It's just an amazing term, with no major area of constitutional law that doesn't have the potential for major change," Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said in an interview. Noting the high-profile nature of the court's docket, he continued: "I wonder whether the magnitude of this term, the prominence of these cases, will have the effect of making the court more salient as an election issue."
Given that some major cases that were argued three, four or even five months ago remain undecided as this new round of arguments begins, the prospect of an orderly, on-time conclusion to the term strikes many people who follow the court as wishful thinking.
Among the earlier cases that are still undecided are those on the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate tobacco products and on the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, as well as a major church-state conflict over federal financing for computer equipment in religious schools.
The justices have all but complete control over which cases to accept but relatively little control over the timing, generally considering new appeals in the order in which they were filed. So the unusual concentration of high-profile cases for the March and April arguments simply reflects the fact that most of them reached the justices' desks during the fall.
What follows is a detailed look at some of the cases the justices will hear in the coming weeks.
 
Football Team Prayer
The court will hear a Texas school district's appeal of a ruling that barred the practice, highly popular in the state, of student-led prayers at public high school football games. The March 29 argument in the case, Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, No. 99-62, is likely to focus on whether the students' prayer is truly private speech, and therefore presumably constitutional, as the district and state maintain, or whether the circumstances of the student's selection and performance make the event a form of public worship that the Supreme Court's precedents forbid.
 
Congressional Authority
Pursuing its inquiry into the limits of congressional law-making authority -- thought to be virtually limitless before the court reversed course five years ago -- the court will hear a challenge on Tuesday to a federal prosecution for burning down a private residence. The question in Jones v. U.S., No. 99-5739, is whether Congress intended the federal arson law to apply to a private home and, if so, whether Congress had authority to do so under its power to regulate interstate commerce.
 
Foreign Policy
On Wednesday, Massachusetts will defend its so-called Burma law, which in effect prohibits state agencies from doing business with companies that do business in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Dozens of state and local governments once aimed similar economic weapons against South Africa's apartheid regime. Those went unchallenged, but the federal appeals court in Boston, ruling in Natsios v. National Foreign Trade Council, No. 99-474, found the Burma law to be an impermissible state intrusion into the federal government's foreign affairs power.
 
Miranda
In 1968, two years after the court's ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, Congress tried to blunt the decision by reverting to the "voluntariness" test for the admissibility of confessions in federal prosecutions, with the court-specified warnings unnecessary.
Seven Republican and Democratic administrations refused to apply the law, known as Section 3501, while conservative law enforcement groups tried to bring it to the lower courts' attention. Finally last year, the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled that Congress was free to overturn Miranda and that it had, in effect, done so. The Supreme Court's conservative bloc has been notably lacking in deference to Congress, so one interesting question for the April 19 argument in Dickerson v. U.S., No. 99-5525, is what stance the conservative justices who have criticized Miranda will now take.
 
Abortion
A federal appeals court ruled last year that the phrase "partial-birth abortion" as used in a 1997 Nebraska law criminalizing the procedure "has no fixed medical or legal content" and was so ill-defined as to be potentially applicable to common techniques used for abortions early in pregnancy. That placed an "undue burden" on a woman's exercise of her constitutional right to abortion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held.
As the Supreme Court's first abortion case since 1992, Stenberg v. Carhart, No. 99-830, carries obvious political and emotional freight. One question for the April 25 argument is whether the justices will confine themselves to examining the deficiency the appeals court identified, or whether they want to make a broader statement about the constitutional status of abortion.
 
Boy Scouts
Although the effort of a gay Eagle Scout, James Dale, to regain his place in a New Jersey troop has positioned Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, No. 99-699, as a gay rights case, the court may well not see it that way. The question for the April 26 argument is whether the Boy Scouts have a right, under the First Amendment's protection for freedom of association, to define its own "expressive character" by excluding gay members.
In its most recent relevant precedent, the court ruled unanimously that the Boston St. Patrick's Day parade could not be required to include a group marching under a gay-rights banner. But in ruling for Mr. Dale, the New Jersey Supreme Court noted he wasn't carrying a banner but wanted to remain a Scout.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush Calls Himself Reformer; the Record Shows the Label May Be a Stretch

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 19

 BODY:
With the long march to November under way, Gov. George W. Bush is arguing that his record in Texas proves he is best suited to bring reform to Washington. He has even coined a campaign slogan: "A Reformer With Results."
Without question, Mr. Bush has been a popular governor, yet he is not widely viewed in Texas as a reformer. 
 Unlike Senator John McCain of Arizona, who bucked his own party on issues like campaign finance and tobacco legislation, Mr. Bush is not as confrontational, nor is he usually identified with sweeping change. His record is largely built on compromise and his ability to build coalitions with conservative Democrats.
Mr. Bush's boldest effort at reform -- his 1997 plan to overhaul the state's outdated tax code -- failed badly. The governor won plaudits for his courage but ultimately could not leverage the "political capital" he has promised to use if elected president; he could not win the support of enough lawmakers in his own party.
On other issues, consumer advocates complain that he often describes as reforms actions benefiting the powerful Texas business interests that have supported him, rather than consumers. On the campaign trail, for example, he has portrayed himself as a leader in reforming health maintenance organizations, yet he resisted two important pieces of patients' rights legislation. And his claims about the consumer benefits of tort reform -- a package of bills that sought to curb large jury awards in civil cases -- are disputed.
Even some of the party faithful seem unsure of Mr. Bush's reformer credentials. Only half of Republican voters in the Texas primary last week said public schools had seen significant reforms since Mr. Bush, who has made his education record a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, was elected, according to exit polls by the Voter News Service.
"He's an incremental-change specialist," said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas, "sometimes in a partisan way, like tort reform, which is a big business issue, sometimes in a bipartisan way, such as small changes in education."
To be sure, Mr. Bush has found success, particularly in his first legislative session, on initiatives he describes as reforms, like changes in tort laws, stricter welfare rules, a crackdown on juvenile crime and giving more local control to public school districts. Those efforts won Mr. Bush praise from lawmakers in both parties, but all were popular issues before he took office.
"Tort reform and all those things, we were already working on them," said Pete Laney, the Democratic speaker of the Texas House and one of the legislative leaders to forge a bond with Mr. Bush early on. "It was smart politically for him to take advantage of that," Mr. Laney said. "That was great politics for him to use those."
Mr. Laney added that "reform" meant different things to different people. Some of the 1995 tort reforms, for example, reversed changes made in the "reform" legislative sessions of the early 1970's, he said. "Reform is pillage and plunder if you're against it, and it's good government if you're for it," he said.
Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman, said the governor played crucial roles in the passage of reforms he campaigned on in 1994, as well as later reform initiatives. Some, like tort reform, might have died had Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, been re-elected, he said.
"He is able to reach across party lines to bring people together," Mr. Bartlett said, adding that reforms "are the main reason he almost got 70 percent of the vote for his re-election."
Mr. Bush declared tort reform an "emergency" when he took office in 1995. Business groups had laid the groundwork for the legislation but Mr. Bush's strong support was essential. And many of these groups were among the governor's biggest campaign contributors.
Lawmakers passed seven bills, including a centerpiece measure that reduced the punitive damages for which businesses and other defendants might be liable if a jury determined they had committed wrongdoing. At the same time, the bill raised the level of proof plaintiffs must show to win such damages.
Mr. Bush said the laws helped rid Texas of so-called junk and frivolous lawsuits, but others say the changes shifted the judicial balance.
Reggie James, director of the Austin office of Consumers Union, said, "While it was portrayed as a fight between honest businesses and greedy trial lawyers, the fight was really about businesses not wanting to be held accountable when they harm consumers."
Mr. Bush has credited tort reform with saving consumers and businesses nearly $3 billion in insurance premiums, with the biggest part coming from auto liability rates. But the mechanism for those savings has come not from Mr. Bush's proposals but from a provision introduced in 1995 by a Democratic legislator requiring state officials to adjust rates ahead of time to account for the effects of tort reform, like lower settlements for injury claims.
And some former senior Texas insurance officials contend that the $3 billion claim is false anyway, and that the biggest beneficiaries of the new laws are insurers.
"How they can continue to claim $3 billion in tort reform savings is baffling to me," said Birny Birnbaum, an Austin consumer advocate who served as the Texas Department of Insurance's chief economist during the administrations of both Ms. Richards and Mr. Bush.
Data from the state show that overall statewide premiums for auto liability insurance stayed flat following tort reform, before a slight dip in 1998. But insurers' profits soared because their annual incurred losses were, on average, lowered by more than $600 million through 1998, the most recent year for which figures were available. Five years ago, insurers incurred 70.1 cents in losses for every dollar in premiums; in 1998, losses were 58.2 cents.
Jose Montemayor, the current insurance commissioner and a Bush appointee, said better driving habits and safer cars had played a larger role than tort reform in raising insurance company profits. But he acknowledged that insurers probably had received some benefits from tort reform in 1996 and 1997, until rates were rolled back more the next year.
"We were a little timid on the front end of this in terms of the rate rollback because we really did not have a good feel for the effects of tort reform," Mr. Montemayor said. But he added that "we corrected that, and more than made up for that."
Two years after tort reform, Mr. Bush, arguing that the state taxing system was unfair and outdated, brushed away concerns that he could hurt himself politically and proposed the biggest restructuring in more than three decades.
Texas has property and sales taxes but no broad-based income tax, and while corporations pay a form of income tax, partnerships do not. Mr. Bush contended that the state's booming service-based economy was not paying its share, while homeowners and industries with heavy capital spending paid too much. He also wanted a more stable and reliable source of school financing.
His plan was to reduce property taxes, and pay for it mostly by raising sales taxes and establishing a 1.25 percent tax on a business's net income, depreciation and labor costs, minus its capital expenditures, with the first $500,000 exempt.
The plan drew fire from professional groups, including doctors and lawyers, as well as retailers and other businesses with high labor costs and low profit margins.
Among the expected winners were petrochemical companies, oil refiners and other capital-intensive industries -- not a surprise, perhaps, since Mr. Bush's new business tax tracked closely a proposal offered to the governor by Charls Walker, a former Washington lobbyist who ran a tax-advocacy organization financed mostly by capital-intensive industries that favored the Bush plan.
"It was essentially a hidden sales tax," said Dick Lavine, a senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research group in Austin representing low-income taxpayers. Over all, he said, the plan would take "an already regressive system and compound it."
And other, more powerful people were skeptical. The late Democratic lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, privately called the plan "dead on arrival."
State lawmakers junked the Bush proposal and assembled an alternative that the governor endorsed, but Mr. Bush was later unable to persuade enough Senate Republicans to vote his way as legislators tried to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions. Late in the session, Mr. Bush salvaged a $1 billion property tax cut financed by the state's budget surplus. In 1999, Mr. Bush made no effort to resurrect tax reform, instead seeking -- and getting -- more tax cuts.
"Bush could have put his political capital on the line" to get the tax plan passed, said Bill White, the former chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, noting that another governor might have threatened to campaign against dissenting legislators or made a broader appeal to the public. "But he didn't."
Mr. Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, said: "When times are relatively calm, it's difficult to persuade people to change. He understood that going in, and he was ultimately proud of what we did accomplish."
It is the tax cuts, not his failure at tax reform, that Mr. Bush mentions on the campaign trail. He has also taken to boasting about his role in reforming health care in Texas, a role that many in Austin say is greatly exaggerated.
One commercial for Mr. Bush says that while Congress deadlocked over health care legislation, "he passed a patients' bill of rights." But people involved in the process note that in 1995 Mr. Bush vetoed the first Texas patient protection bill, and two years later he considered vetoing the most groundbreaking H.M.O. bill that Texas lawmakers had debated.
"If he wants to say, 'I reformed the tort system,' then that's fair game," said Mr. James, the consumer advocate, "but if he wants to say he reformed health care, that's a different animal. The reforms happened despite him, not because of him."
The 1995 patient protection bill included provisions requiring annual report cards for health maintenance organizations and forced H.M.O.'s to provide necessary emergency-room care. Today, Mr. Bush says he vetoed the bill because of unfair exemptions it gave certain H.M.O.'s. But in his veto proclamation he also mentioned other concerns: "numerous new regulations on managed care organizations," including H.M.O.'s, and higher costs for employers.
Afterward, the governor instructed the insurance commissioner to draft rules that covered much of what the bill did. Consumer groups objected strongly to the veto, but they praised the commissioner's rules. The issue resurfaced in 1997, when the legislature codified those rules and passed an expanded patient-protection package.
The biggest battle, though, was over a bill to make Texas the first state to allow patients to sue for malpractice an H.M.O. that denies necessary care. Mr. Bush warned of a veto, and his resistance brought his staff into conflict with one of his staunchest Republican allies, Senator David Sibley, the bill's sponsor.
On the Senate floor, Mr. Sibley complained about the governor's staff, saying, "I can't make them happy no matter what I do, unless I completely gut the bill."
Mr. Sibley did not back away from that comment in an interview, but he described Mr. Bush as a leader on health care issues, saying he was supportive of the other patient-protection measures passed in 1997.
Some legislators involved have different recollections. Patricia Gray, a Democratic House member who sponsored a bill requiring H.M.O.'s to allow women direct access to their obstetrician-gynecologist without having to see a "gatekeeper" physician first -- a measure Mr. Bush has called important to H.M.O. reform -- does not recall the governor, or his staff, having provided any help on the bill. "I have no recollection of him being involved whatsoever," Ms. Gray said.
That bill's Senate sponsor, Florence Shapiro, a Republican, said Mr. Bush's office did weigh in while the bill was in a Senate committee, and that he was supportive.
In the end, lawmakers overwhelmingly approved the right-to-sue bill, and Mr. Bush, who might have faced an embarrassing override vote had he vetoed the bill, allowed it to become law without his signature. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush became more comfortable with the bill after provisions were added reducing the likelihood of a flood of new lawsuits, including a requirement that disputes first be reviewed by an independent panel.
Kim Ross, chief lobbyist for the Texas Medical Association, described Mr. Bush's evolution on health care issues as a "baptism by fire."
"He was on a steep learning curve," Mr. Ross said. "You have to give him credit for traveling a pretty far philosophical distance in such a short period."

Contrasting Elections

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The first great test of a new democracy is not only in the way its government tolerates opposition, but whether it is willing to transfer power to that opposition after a fair election.
The new United States faced that test in 1801, after the ruling party of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton had been beaten in the popular vote by Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Federalists. It was touch and go for weeks, as the stunned Federalists tried to make a deal with Aaron Burr to block Jefferson's presidency. Only secret patronage concessions, hotly denied, and Hamilton's personal hatred of Burr caused the party in power to turn over the keys to the Executive Mansion. 
 Taiwan passed the same test last weekend. The party in power ever since Chiang Kai-shek fled China was split by an insurgency. The opposition party, favoring independence, contended vigorously. China warned the free Taiwanese of "blood" in their future if they dared vote for the dissident Chen Shui-bian.
That attempted intimidation put Chen over the top. The old guard, to its credit, will transfer power peacefully. Taiwan thus proves its democratic strength.
Russia is proving the opposite. Late last year, the kakistocracy propping up Boris Yeltsin decided not to risk giving up power. To avert election defeat by the Primakov-Luzhkov party, the ruling Kremlin crew upset the constitutional schedule. Yeltsin suddenly stepped down and named Vladimir Putin, a K.G.B. apparatchik, to be acting president.
By staging this coup, the ruling party was able to have its candidate in office, with all its powers of patronage and media control, at election time. Its anointed new leader received a prestige boost from Britain's Tony Blair and America's Bill Clinton. A level playing field was averted.
To distract the Russian people from high-level corruption, war hysteria was whipped up. Chechens aching for self-rule were designated as threats to Russians in their homes. Power-starved Russian generals were encouraged to pillage at will.
In this way, the ruling clique not only changed its image from puffy Yeltsin to hard-eyed Putin, but changed the subject from venality and economic stagnation to a cost-free victory over the despised rebels.
Needed was only a symbolic bridge connecting fear of the Chechens to anger at truth-tellers in the Russian media. The ruling clique found that in Andrei Babitsky, a Russian Radio Liberty reporter who filed embarrassing facts from behind battle lines.
Babitsky was arrested and "exchanged" by Chechen quislings; when Western interest made his disappearance awkward, the reporter was brought to Moscow on trumped-up charges. Putin, as Election Day neared, then made the connection between the hated Chechens and the beleaguered Russian press by loudly branding the reporter a "traitor." This plainly implied that any pursuit of truth in a war zone is treason.
The Kremlin plan was to call a snap election to exploit war fever. That's how it could renew its power before the extent of Russian casualties became known and the surge of support for the militarist Putin ebbed. But Chechen guerrillas in the mountains have not cooperated; ambushes abound. Polls show Putin popularity beginning to erode, and a quick vote is in the power clique's interest.
Though the Kremlin's choice remains far ahead of his main opponents, the Communist Gennadi Zyuganov and the lonely democratic reformer Grigory Yavlinsky, Putin hopes to avoid a two-man runoff by winning over 50 percent of the votes on March 26. Even if he does, there's this wrinkle in the law: unless 50 percent of eligible voters show up on the first round to vote for all candidates, the election must be repeated.
The Kremlin clique will inflate next week's count by stuffing ballot boxes. But Harvard's Graham Allison reports from Moscow that apathy is rampant; even the Communists had trouble rounding up 150 bodies for a Red Square rally. Apparently many Russians are disgusted at the way they've been had.
We see what comes when rulers don democratic trappings but use every trick to avoid relinquishing power. As Taiwan's party of power bows to the will of a victorious plurality, Russia's party of power perpetuates a fraud on the Russian people. That's the difference between a successful and a failing democracy.

HEADLINE: DECISION IN TAIWAN: THE MAINLAND;
Deep Feeling That Taiwan Is China's Is Put to Test

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 19

 BODY:
Mulling over the shocking fact that Taiwan had chosen the independence party, if not independence, in the presidential election on Saturday, a common response of many Chinese in Beijing today was the nervous question: Do you think there will be war?
Many shook their heads at the possibility. Although Beijing's leaders have been silent about the victory of Chen Shui-bian and the state media have run only brief items, every educated Beijinger now seems to know the details from satellite TV and the Internet. 
 The idea that Taiwan will inevitably reunite with the mainland is probably the most emotional, deeply held belief of ordinary Chinese, from college students to retired factory workers. Last week, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji said 1.25 billion Chinese would be willing to "spill blood" to prevent its independence.
But Mr. Chen's victory forced many Chinese to reflect for the first time on the depth of their conviction, pitting their abstract belief that the return of Taiwan is manifest destiny, against their personal self-interest, since war would mean renewed hardship in a country that has only recently raised its living standards.
Late Saturday night the Chinese government issued its only reaction to the victory, a brief, moderate statement, which said in part, "We will listen to the words and observe the actions of Taiwan's new leader, and wait and see in which direction he takes cross-strait relations."
A government poll released last week showed that 95 percent of Chinese approved using military force if Taiwan seeks independence. But today, the emotions behind that figure were complex and contradictory. Although almost every Chinese will say they care deeply about Taiwan, many are personally ambivalent about fighting for the cause -- even if they think a fight is inevitable.
"We strongly believe that Taiwan should return to the motherland; after Hong Kong and Macao, it is the only one left," said a 20-year-old English major at People's University, who gave her name as Xuan. "But we don't support the use of force. That wouldn't be good for anyone."
Ms. Xuan, like many other Chinese, has seen the society change, as China has opened its doors to Western culture and business. Many people watch N.B.A. games and invest in stocks.
They know that a war with Taiwan -- which would almost certainly draw in the United States -- would mean a return to a more austere and isolationist life. Also with more information and even personal contacts with Taiwanese, many mainlanders find it difficult today to demonize the island.
It is hard for non-Chinese to understand the depths of the Chinese devotion to Taiwan, which is born partly of decades of Communist Party propaganda and partly of the humiliations of China's history, when Westerners carved up China for their economic advantage.
"China was divided when it was weak, and now that it is getting strong again, people's nationalist feeling rises and they feel strongly it is time to reunite the country," said Zhang Yunling, the head of South Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
As a result, there is a strong conviction here that countries naturally strive to keep every inch of land, no matter the cost. Chinese officials are wont to ask how Americans would respond if Alaska or Hawaii tried to secede. They seem disbelieving when the question is answered with an indifferent shrug.
And for many Chinese today, that deep emotional attachment still governed their views.
"Ordinary people just want to get on with their lives, and whether Taiwan becomes independent has no effect on them," said Wang Wei, a middle-age store manager, who said he watched Taiwan's election returns on a Hong Kong television station with some army friends.
"But," he added, "if Taiwan does take steps toward independence, we'll surely just have to give them a beating."
Others were less quick on the draw and hoped that their government -- most known for its unyielding behavior -- would make compromises.
"I think both sides will have to make adjustments to their policies," said a 22-year-old physics major at Beijing University, who refused to give his name. "After all Taiwan is democratic now, and the people have exercised their own right to chose a president."
Still, he too "accepted that war was inevitable" if Taiwan declared independence. He added:
"The idea of unity is very important to the Chinese people, and we treasure the idea. These ideas have sunk deeply into people's minds, and we just accept them and wouldn't think of changing them."

HEADLINE: DECISION IN TAIWAN: THE WHITE HOUSE;
The U.S. Scrambles to Keep a Lid on Tensions and to Rescue Its China Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Washington has urged Taiwan to let true democracy flower, knowing that it could eventually lead to the defeat of the Nationalist Party by pro-independence forces and put the island, and even perhaps the United States, on a collision course with mainland China.
But when the moment arrived over the weekend, administration officials conceded, the timing was singularly inopportune. 
 The victory of Chen Shui-bian, the opposition leader who until recently openly advocated Taiwan independence from China, sent White House and State Department officials scrambling today to prevent an escalation of tensions.
And it may well change the calculus for the administration's biggest foreign policy push in Congress this year, getting China into the World Trade Organization, a deal that is ultimately more about security and China's role in the world than about regulating trade.
"Two weeks ago we were focused on the domestic debate here, over the W.T.O. and arms sales to Taiwan," a senior administration official said. "But the landscape has completely changed. And now our primary focus is to manage the cross-strait relations -- and to keep everyone from doing something stupid."
The State Department's top official for Asia, Stanley Roth, and the American delegate to the United Nations, Richard C. Holbrooke, are in Beijing now. Their plan, administration officials said today, is to urge President Jiang Zemin to say little in public and reach out to Mr. Chen, rather than give in to hard-liners pressing to make good on China's recent threats. Their visit will be immediately followed by the arrival of President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, on completion of Mr. Clinton's trip to India and Pakistan.
At the same time, the White House searched today for someone to send to Taiwan with a similar message to Mr. Chen about the need to steer clear of statements likely to incite Beijing.
The most likely choice, officials said, is former Representative Lee H. Hamilton, a longtime China hand who now runs the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Under the bizarre diplomatic rules of Washington's "one China" policy, no senior American official can officially visit or consult with the island's leaders -- even as the United States gives Taiwan defensive weapons.
Even if an immediate crisis is averted, the ouster of the Nationalists greatly complicates Mr. Clinton's effort to give order to a messy relationship with the United States.
With only 10 months left in office, he wants to persuade Congress to give China permanent trading rights and a voice in the World Trade Organization. Earlier this month, Mr. Clinton argued passionately that the vote marks America's best chance to change China -- through the Internet and the opening of its market -- and to loosen Communist control.
But if Mr. Jiang and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, decide in coming weeks that Taiwan's new challenge mandates a response, administration officials say, the economic opening to Beijing may be doomed.
"Our hope is that Beijing will maintain the stance that it took immediately after the election on Saturday, a moderate tone," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, who is at the center of the W.T.O. debate. But if that tone changes, she said, "there's no telling where this could go."
The administration is already under pressure from conservatives to sell far more arms to Taiwan, to counter Beijing's growing missile threat to the island. Last month, the House voted overwhelmingly to approve the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which would establish direct military communications between Washington and Taipei and expand American training of Taiwan's military officers. The administration considers the legislation so provocative to Beijing that Mr. Berger referred to it recently as "the Taiwan Insecurity Act" and has recommended that it be vetoed.
Republicans, led by Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, chose it as the first major bill for the year precisely because it would challenge China. And if tensions escalate in coming weeks, it may be appended to the World Trade Organization legislation -- leaving Mr. Clinton with the agonizing choice of letting his major overture to China die, or outraging Beijing by linking its economic role in the world with support for an island it considers, now more than ever, a renegade province.
The long-term American concern is that the suddenly chaotic political landscape in Taipei could put the United States into the middle of a dangerous crossfire.
Washington has been committed to Taiwan's defense since the cold war. In 1996, Mr. Clinton sent two carrier groups to the end of the strait in response to China's firing several missiles into waters near Taiwan before elections that year.
Last week, Mr. Zhu warned that any move toward independence -- or even foot-dragging in talks about unification -- could prompt China to "spill blood."
America's response is to leave China with the impression that the United States would intervene if China made a military move. But that threat is of diminishing value. The Chinese know the American political landscape well -- and Mr. Clinton's aides, in private moments, wonder aloud whether Americans would risk war with the world's most populous nation over the fate of Taiwan.

HEADLINE: Maryland Hostage Siege Drags on Into Third Night

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: DUNDALK, Md., March 19

 BODY:
A former convict with a history of mental illness, hunted in a shooting spree that took four lives, maintained a standoff against the police today, crackling the air with warning gunfire as he held three hostages in this tense suburban neighborhood.
"Come on, Joby, pick up the phone," police officers pleaded over a loudspeaker from an armored car parked near the building where the suspect, Joseph Palcyzinski, known as Joby, had been holed up almost three days. 
 The fugitive's response was a burst of gunfire that shot out the tires of the armored car. Police officers retreated as they kept a four-block-square area of this bedroom community under siege and the standoff headed into a third night.
The 31-year-old suspect had been tracked by the police since March 7, when, the authorities say, he kidnapped a former girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and fatally shot two of her friends and a neighbor. Ms. Whitehead escaped unharmed. Police officers would not disclose her whereabouts.
In a subsequent car-jacking, Mr. Palcyzinski killed a woman and injured a small boy, according to the police.
Trackers lost him last week during a hunt through eastern woodlands until he invaded the home of Ms. Whitehead's mother, Lynn, in a burst of gunfire here on Friday night. His hostages include Lynn Whitehead, her boyfriend, Andy McCord, and his son, 10-year-old Brad McCord.
Mr. Palcyzinski, an unemployed electrician with a history of domestic violence and prison and hospital incarceration, has been obsessively following the siege on television, the Baltimore County police said. They asked broadcasters to refrain from inciting him with photos of estranged family members and other reminders of his grievances.
"He's responding constantly to television," said Bill Toohey, the police spokesman, as TV news producers promised cooperation. "Our main strategy is patience, patience, patience," Mr. Toohey emphasized as police officers in military assault gear blanketed the area and warned residents to stay off the streets.
Residents largely complied as Sunday quiet reigned through much of this blue-collar neighborhood. A few neighbors darted from backdoor exits on food-shopping missions.
Police officers have not commented on the question of some alarmed neighbors as to why the Whitehead residence had not been under police guard, since Mr. Palcyzinski was believed to have made threats to kill Mrs. Whitehead earlier this month.
One neighbor, Anna Day, heard gunfire after dawn today and swept up her baby, fleeing the area despite police warnings. "After I heard the gunshots this morning, I said I have got to get out of here," Ms. Day said as she headed to safety with her relatives.
At midday, about 50 people stood watching at the closest police cordon, four blocks from the siege, where the news media worked. The police said there would be no action that might risk the hostages' lives. At one point, some bystanders held hands and joined in prayer.
In an earlier police standoff after a domestic violence complaint in 1992, Mr. Palcyzinski kept the police at bay for 16 hours in Idaho before he surrendered in a tear-gas barrage.
According to Mr. Palcyzinski's friends and family, the fugitive suffers from bipolar disorder, a manic-depressive behavior they say resulted from a severe blow to the head in a school bus accident when he was a teenager. Since then he has served three years in mental institutions and two years in prison, plus several years' probation for incidents usually involving the beatings of girlfriends.
"I was like a bomb waiting to explode," he told one judge in a past hearing in unsuccessfully seeking to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. The fugitive reportedly is currently demanding to make an insanity plea as part of his conditions for surrendering.
The slayings this month occurred days after Tracy Whitehead, 22, pressed assault charges against Mr. Palcyzinski, who then was released on $7,500 bail. She had broken off their yearlong relationship on March 3 and later called the police after she said he bloodied her in a beating.
After making bail, Mr. Palcyzinski obtained a rifle and a shotgun illegally through a friend, according to the police, and went looking for Ms. Whitehead at an apartment where she was staying with her co-worker, Gloria Jean Shenk. Police officers said Mr. Palcyzinski broke into the apartment on March 7 and killed Ms. Shenk, her husband, George, and a neighbor, David Meyers, who tried to subdue the gunman. He kidnapped Ms. Whitehead, who subsequently escaped, and the authorities said he later fatally shot a motorist, Jennifer McDaniel, during a car-jacking as he fled the police.
In the siege here on Lange Street, Mr. Palcyzinski, who the police say stole three fresh weapons last week in a burglary in nearby Essex, has been demanding to talk to Ms. Whitehead. But the police have offered no indication of how negotiations with him have been proceeding. A motorized robot cart has delivered food and, according to some reports, a cell phone demanded by the fugitive.
Ms. Whitehead's sister-in-law, Donna Collins, told the police she talked by telephone with Mr. Palcyzinski in the early hours of the siege and he told her, "I've killed four already, and I'll kill these here, too."

HEADLINE: Power Authority Set to Choose Buyer of 2 Reactors

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The New York Power Authority is expected to choose today between two out-of-state companies fiercely bidding for the authority's two nuclear plants, setting the stage for what would be the largest sale of nuclear plants in this country.
In recent weeks, the proposed sale of the Indian Point 3 plant, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor, in Scriba on Lake Ontario, has attracted spiraling bids and counterbids, analyses and counteranalyses, from the two suitors, Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., and Dominion Resources, of Richmond, Va. While each company claims that its offer is superior, this much seems clear: the winning bid will amount to at least $806 million and also represent the largest sale of a public asset to a private buyer in New York State. 
 Entergy has long had the inside track; for months it was the only company negotiating with the authority for the plants, until Dominion made a bigger, unsolicited bid in February. Still, Michael A. Petralia, a spokesman for the authority, said yesterday that the board of trustees would weigh both proposals equally and choose one at a meeting today in Manhattan.
"We expect that the trustees will take action, absolutely," Mr. Petralia said.
Either way, the decision is likely to be subject to much scrutiny and second-guessing.
Last week, the authority released a brief analysis by J. P. Morgan stating that both proposals were excellent and that they "by far exceed any previous nuclear asset sale in the United States in terms of dollars per kilowatt of capacity."
But for months now, numerous state legislators and watchdogs of nuclear power have criticized the authority for failing to make the privatization process as competitive as possible. They say that after the recent radiation leak at Indian Point 2 -- Indian Point 3's privately owned next-door neighbor -- and given the swift deregulation of utilities, such a major decision affecting taxpayers and the environment should be made as prudently and openly as possible.
"This is so important because it is by far, by orders of great magnitude, the largest sale of a publicly held asset in New York State," Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said yesterday. Mr. Brodsky, who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, said, "There is no reason on God's earth that this deal should close tomorrow."
The New York Power Authority was never really supposed to be in the business of nuclear power; its original mandate was to foster economic development and improve energy efficiency. In the 1970's, though, it became involved in nuclear power after a struggling Consolidated Edison built Indian Point 3, in Buchanan, but sold it to the authority before it opened.
As a result, the authority and Con Edison, which runs Indian Point 2, have described themselves as "mom and pop operators." But in recent years, with utility deregulation taking hold, both Con Ed and the authority have sought to sell their plants to companies that are interested in accumulating nuclear plant sites -- like Entergy, which has five, and Dominion, which has two.
About two years ago, Entergy approached the Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency, about buying Indian Point 3 and the FitzPatrick reactor, said Jerry W. Yelverton, the chief executive of Entergy Nuclear. The two later began negotiations.
On Feb. 14, the power authority announced that it had tentatively agreed to a deal: $638 million for the plants, and $168 for nuclear fuel stockpiles, spread over seven years. In addition, the power authority agreed to pay for most of the costs of decommissioning the plants when Entergy officials conclude that they have reached the end of their useful, or profitable, life.
Yet controversy shadowed the deal. Mr. Brodsky, with fellow Democratic Assemblymen Paul D. Tonko of Montgomery County and Albert Vann of Brooklyn, criticized the Power Authority for not opening the process to competitive bidding. They said that the state, and by extension, all electricity customers, might not be getting the best price. In addition, the legislators, coupled with some nuclear power watchdog groups, complained about the power authority's failure to make public a detailed financial analysis of the bid.
Then came Dominion.
On Feb. 24, the company, which is the parent company of Virginia Power, made an offer for the two plants with an unsolicited bid of $686 million, and $171 million for nuclear fuel stockpiles, for a total of $857 million, or $51 million more than Entergy's offer.
As a result, the New York Power Authority gave the two companies until March 10 to submit new bids. So when March 10 rolled around, each company, naturally, proclaimed its offer to be the better one.
Dominion sweetened the pot by saying that it would pay a total of $946 million for the plants, an increase of $89 million. Dominion also offered its full corporate resources as collateral against any unforeseen decommissioning costs, unlike its competitor, which is relying on its Entergy Nuclear subsidiary, a limited liability corporation, and not the parent company in New Orleans, as collateral.
But above all, Dominion said that it was simply offering more money.
"What you ought to focus on is the dollars that the citizens of New York State receive," said Thos. E. Capps, Dominion's chairman.
Entergy did not change the cash component of its original proposal: $806 million. Instead, it announced a new bid of $1.12 billion through an increase of $314 million in projected benefits like paying more money to decommission the plants and selling more electricity at below-market prices to the authority.
In addition, Entergy said it should be rewarded for the substantial investments in money and time spent on putting together its offer.
"You have to look at the overall, broader package for the state of New York," Mr. Yelverton said.
In the last few days, the two companies have offered competing economic models and projections. The latest have Dominion saying it can provide $1.52 billion in cash and speculative benefits and Entergy up to $1.42 billion.
The power authority, meanwhile, has tried to stay out of the fray, releasing only the analysis by its consultant, J. P. Morgan. But one thing that should be noted, Mr. Petralia said, is that either offer would pay off the remaining $316 million in debt on Indian Point 3. (The FitzPatrick plant is paid for.)
"Whatever is decided is going to be a tremendous benefit to the state," Mr. Petralia said.
To date, few nuclear plants have actually changed hands, and when they do, it is usually from one private company to another. Moreover, out of the 100 or so plants still operating in the country, the power authority sale may well be the first one involving the privatization of a publicly run nuclear plant, said Edward Smeloff, executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project.
So the fate of the power authority's plants may well provide a road map on what may eventually happen with the two Millstone plants in Connecticut, as well as to the beleaguered Indian Point 2 plant.
"I think it's important because it gets New York State out of the business of owning a nuclear plant, and I think that, from a large policy perspective, is the right thing to do," Mr. Smeloff said.

HEADLINE: Shards of Misery, Not Far From Clinton Stop in Bangladesh

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: DHAKA, Bangladesh, March 19

 BODY:
The wretched squatter colony known as the Kawran Bazaar Bustee straddles Dhaka's main railroad line, the relentless iron wheels of the trains rolling within feet of the flimsy hovels of scrap metal, thatch and muslin.
The slum's only open space is the narrow lane between the two tracks, so working parents often think it wise to tie up their small children rather than to let them wander. Three months ago, Hanufa, age 3, was slow to heed the dangerous chugging of an oncoming engine. Her head wounds have since healed but her right hand was torn off at the wrist. 
 Asiya Khatun is the girl's grandmother. She has lived beside the trains for 20 years, making her home in a filthy lean-to barely a yard square. A small crowd huddled near her on a recent day as she assessed her life. "We have nothing, and we are nobodies," she concluded, with the others nodding in agreement as if they had just heard a concise rendering of perfect truth.
About a third of Dhaka's nine million people live in some of the world's most miserable slums, grafting themselves to empty patches of precious land. The Kawran colony is unusual in that it is not only near a busy railway but also within 200 yards of a five-star hotel, the place where Bill Clinton and the American entourage will freshen up when they arrive here on Monday. He will be the first American president to visit Bangladesh.
Except for televised images of its reiterating and incomparable floods, this nation -- the eighth-most-populous on the planet -- does not often come to America's attention. It is perhaps best known as the pet cause of George Harrison, the former Beatle, who in 1971 had a hit song with the unusually sober rock lyrics: "Bangladesh, Bangladesh/ Where so many people are dying fast/And it sure looks like a mess/ I've never seen so much distress."
That lament accompanied the country's difficult birth after a war of independence against Pakistan. Three decades later, Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest nations. The per capita income is $289. A million villagers each year lose their homes to fickle rivers that engulf their land. Democracy suffers prolonged malfunctions, in part because the two women who run the main political parties hate each other down to the bone.
And yet in most ways Bangladesh is now decidedly in less of a mess, with the poverty rate drifting down and economic growth rates inching up.
Indeed, many here fear that President Clinton is coming not just to shake hands but to make money. It seems that Bangladesh is sitting on a small fortune in natural gas.
"We're calling this the Persian Gulf East," said Forrest E. Cookson, an American economic consultant who has been involved in a study of the potential profits from the gas.
That is hyperbole, but initial exploration by foreign oil companies does show that Bangladesh may have not only enough gas for its own needs but a sizable surplus as well. The amount of the abundance is uncertain, however -- and that poses a problem. Big corporations are willing to bore more wells, but in turn they want guarantees that they can maximize profits by selling any oversupply to gas-needy India, the colossus next-door.
Bangladeshi leaders are wary of such deals. Their own experts guess the gas reserves to be modest. And if a glut does exist, they argue that it should be used at home, converted into fertilizer or electricity rather than sold to a neighbor thought to be overbearing. The United States government, it is presumed, sides with its oil giants.
"Colonial exploitation is a fact of our lives," said Serajul Islam Choudhury, an English professor and well-known social commentator. "People here think America is the new East India Company. Mr. Clinton is the company's big man."
American officials quietly insist otherwise, saying Mr. Clinton is simply making a day trip here while in the neighborhood in advance of five days in India and a short pause in Pakistan.
But the apprehensions are understandable. A recipient of $1.5 billion a year in international aid, disaster-prone Bangladesh is used to being treated as a beggar and not courted for its purse.
Mother Nature has exhibited the full arc of her mood swings in this country. On one hand, Bangladesh possesses the world's largest delta landscape with bountiful rivers that crisscross in lengthy braids. The earth is ever-enriched by alluvial silt. The greenery is lush. Farmers manage to feed 128 million people -- almost half the population of the United States -- packed into a country slightly smaller than Wisconsin.
But the water knows no master and is often a deadly conduit. Bacteria in ponds have been prolific killers. In response, the government and Unicef and other aid groups convinced villagers to sink tube wells to tap the underground aquifer. But that drinking water now turns out to be tainted with dangerous levels of arsenic. Millions of people are slowly poisoning themselves sip by sip, with the authorities confounded about what to do.
In the long, wet summers, snow melt from the Himalayas and monsoon rains hits the rivers with such force that it alters the contours of the channels, and then the Darwinian laws of real estate take effect. Where the poor once had homes, there is now river. And where there was once river, there is now virgin land, inevitably gobbled up by the rich.
"Look out there," said Abdul Ahad, a bony, bare-chested man covered from the waist down in a skirt-like wrap called a lungi. He was pointing into the brown calm of the Jamuna River at a spot about a quarter mile offshore. "Four years ago, that's where my home was, mine and 200 others and a school too. The river ate them."
His village is Jafarganj, a place with houses of thatched walls and cement floors located about 60 miles west of Dhaka. Each summer, the vagabond river swallows more of the village, although the size and timing of the bites are hard to predict. Some people who think they are safe for another year suddenly see their homes licked away by the current.
"Who wants to live with such uncertainty?" asked Rowshan Ara, a woman with three young children at her side. "But we cling to what we have for as long as we can."
Victims of the rivers take refuge with relatives or settle along the fringe of the dirt roads. Or they go to Dhaka, the capital, living in slums like the Kawran Bazaar Bustee, some clinging to deeds for land that has been submerged for generations.
Shirin, who uses only one name, says she was brought to Kawran when she was 6 months old. She is unsure of her own age, but her two daughters are 2 1/2 and 1. She lifted a blue plastic curtain to display a tiny cave of a home with walls of blankets and burlap. Flies were doing their primitive dance above a husk of coconut.
"I can sometimes get work as a maid," she said. "But when I am gone, I worry about my children. My cousin is here, but she is busy."
There is a fish market near the slum, and the odor of the rotting catch is powerful. For income, people sometimes buy a few fish, cut them up and try to sell the pieces for a profit. Others pull rickshaws, earning about $1 a day.
Between the train tracks, mothers cook over fires fueled with wood chips. Children play games of carom. There is water to fetch, but it is expensive at 4 cents a pitcher. The privacy of an outhouse costs about the same.
On Feb. 23, there was a police attack on the squatter colony, part of the government's occasional effort at slum clearance. "I asked them where they expected me to go," said Beauty, an old woman with a squint that made her eyes look like two brown peepholes. "They told me to go back to my village, but I am from Laskshmipur and everything there was taken by the river. The only thing left are small islands of sand. What should I do, eat the sand?"
Life is a day-to-day struggle, and yet many in Bangladesh are escaping poverty. The nation has become known for its plenitude of nongovernmental organizations, many made rich by foreign donors, which are credited with impressive gains in health care, population control and the empowerment of women. They have helped peasants buy income-producing farm animals.
The government itself has made sincere efforts, though most analysts say political leaders are easily distracted by self-interest. "You can say this is the kind of nice Islamic country that America likes -- doesn't host terrorists, doesn't force women to wear veils -- but the political parties are corrupt Tammany Hall patronage machines," a Western diplomat said.
"The purpose of the parties is to make sure their businessmen get the contracts and the loans -- and to make life impossible for the political opposition."
The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have little in the way of policy disagreements, and yet they steadfastly attack each other with profanity, street violence, general strikes and boycotts of Parliament.
"This country is accomplishing many things, and the future has such promise, but this is despite the politicians and not because of them," said Muhammad Yunus, the managing director of the Grameen Bank. "Our politicians are stuck with their own history and are always settling scores."
The leader of the Awami League is the current prime minister, Sheik Hasina, daughter of the nation's first elected leader, Sheik Mujibur Rahman. He was gunned down in his home by a handful of renegade army officers in 1975 along with his wife, brother, three sons, two daughters-in-law, a grandson and several other close relatives.
The leader of the Nationalists is Khaleda Zia, the widow of Gen. Ziaur Rahman, a military dictator who praised and rewarded the confessed killers of Mrs. Hasina's father. The dictator was assassinated by army officers in 1981.
After 16 years of military rule, democracy returned to Bangladesh in 1991. The Nationalists won that year's election, but Mrs. Zia's ability to govern was limited when the Awami League took to the streets in a prolonged campaign of agitation.
Mrs. Hasina became prime minister in 1996 and now faces the same tactics. The Nationalists and several smaller parties are boycotting Parliament. General strikes are enforced by thugs who pull people from their autos as they try to get to work.
"It's the politics of tit for tat, the country be damned," said Mahfuz Anam, editor of the English language newspaper, the Daily Star.
Mrs. Zia, 54, takes issue with such remarks, refusing to share any blame for the country's troubled governance. She is not a taciturn woman. Asked about the state of democracy in Bangladesh, she replied with a 67-minute filibuster against her opponents.
Later, she admitted to hating Mrs. Hasina, but stressed that this deep loathing was nothing personal. She disagreed with those who suggest the welfare of the impoverished nation suffers because of a private feud.
"My differences with Hasina are all political," she said, sitting before a huge portrait of her late husband. But then she thought a while longer. And anger rose in her throat.
"I went to her daughter's wedding when I was prime minister and I was not properly received," she said bitterly, waving her index finger. "She did not even come and sit with me."
Mrs. Hasina, 53, likewise declaimed the notion of a private grudge. "Why should I hate her?" she said, sitting in an office decorated with paintings of her father. Her government has successfully prosecuted many of her father's killers. She has renamed an extraordinary number of public structures in her family's memory.
"There is no personal clash or enmity with Khaleda," the prime minister repeated, sloughing aside the very suggestion. "I am the daughter of the father of the nation. Who can match that? When my father was head of the country, her husband was just a major."

HEADLINE: Clinton Begins Visit to India, But First Comes Bangladesh

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, March 19

 BODY:
President Clinton, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, but not by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, arrived to a low key welcome here tonight for a state visit that the administration hopes will set the foundation for a new relationship with India.
Before getting down to business here, however, Mr. Clinton is to pay a one-day visit to Bangladesh, the first by an American President to that country. 
 A 21-gun salute boomed as the president and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright walked down a red carpet on Monday to an arrival ceremony, where they were greeted by Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and President Shahabuddin Ahmed, The Associated Press reported from Dhaka, the capital. Thousands of people waving American and Bangladeshi flags lined Mr. Clinton's motorcade route.
Security concerns apparently led to an unusual last-minute change in plans for the Monday itinerary.
Shortly after the president arrived in New Delhi, the White House announced that because of "concerns raised by the Secret Service" he would not make a planned visit to the Bangladeshi village of Joypura.
Officials declined to elaborate on the statement beyond saying that for security reasons, the trip to the village 20 miles northwest of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, had been canceled. Bangladesh does not have a recent history of violent incidents.
Mr. Clinton was to have taken the presidential helicopter to the village, spending about 90 minutes there in a primary school for girls and meeting with women who have successfully started small businesses with loans from the Grameen Bank. The bank, which was founded in Bangladesh, has been seen as a world model for that type of tiny economic development loan. Mr. Clinton will meet with some of the women and children from the village at the American Embassy in Dhaka.
Mr. Clinton is the first American president to visit India in 22 years. The last visit -- by President Carter, who made some unflattering remarks about the government before an open microphone -- did not go so smoothly.
This time, and with those memories faded, each side appears determined to make a good impression.
Chaotic and congested New Delhi was being scrubbed and scoured today, with curbs freshly whitewashed and new red gravel laid on sidewalks. Lilies and dahlias were being hastily arranged at the gates of the memorial to Mohandas Gandhi, where Mr. Clinton will pay homage.
In public, Mr. Clinton and the Indian leaders are set to proclaim a friendship based on shared values of democracy and economic interests, a case the president will probably make most passionately in his scheduled address to the Indian Parliament.
In private, Mr. Clinton will attempt to walk the delicate line of letting the Indians know that the United States strongly disapproves of their nuclear weapons but without appearing to scold his hosts, who are sensitive to what can be perceived as big brother hectoring them.
The Indians got a taste of what was on Mr. Clinton's mind when he said at a nuclear nonproliferation conference in Washington last week: "There are those in the region who hope we will simply accept its nuclear status quo and move on. I will not do that."
The Clinton administration has pressed India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and Mr. Clinton will stress this again with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Clinton aides said. Indian officials say that the United States is hardly persuasive in demanding that India adhere to a treaty that the United States Senate failed to ratify last fall.
Mr. Clinton will also try, his aides say, to make headway with the Indians on Kashmir but without playing a mediating role, which the Indians reject. The president recently called South Asia "the most dangerous place" on earth, a conclusion drawn from the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan, two hostile neighbors with nuclear weapons.
Mr. Clinton will urge the government to consider a dialogue with Pakistan, and on Saturday he will give a similar message to the military government in Pakistan during his brief stopover there. At the moment, relations between the two countries are so sour that there is no official dialogue and scant contact between citizens, Clinton administration officials have said.
Much easier for Mr. Clinton will be his acknowledgment of the Indian the high-tech industry and the contributions it has made to the American computer world.
Mr. Clinton will also make note of the efforts by the Indian government to reform the economy, which has been choked by high tariffs and state-run management. The United States sees considerable prospects for American business in India. In the coming years, $250 billion will be spent in India on power-generating equipment and $100 billion on telecommunications, said a former American ambassador to India, Frank Wisner.
"The visit is a terrific opportunity for the United States to root itself in the region, to get some traction on the issues to create a privileged position for us as we go forward," said Mr. Wisner, who is now in private industry.
In a newspaper column welcoming Mr. Clinton, Uday Bhaskar, the deputy director of the Institute of Defense Studies and Analyses in New Delhi, was more cautious. He wrote in today's Sunday Times of India that India and the United States were moving "a bit gingerly, like two porcupines trying to be friends."
Expectations should not be too high, Mr. Bhaskar said. But if all goes well, he added, "the Clinton visit and the entourage that accompanies him will be able to realize the potential between natural but currently wary allies."

HEADLINE: Known as Poacher, New Jersey Is Faced By Rival to the West

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa.

 BODY:
After years of luring Manhattan jobs and companies across the Hudson River with promises of cheap real estate, lower taxes and tax breaks, New Jersey now finds that an interloper on its western flank is wooing manufacturers, distributors and back offices to the Lehigh Valley of northeastern Pennsylvania.
Dozens of companies based in New Jersey have moved at least some of their operations across the Delaware River to a 30-mile stretch of corn fields, turkey farms and dormant steel mills encompassing Easton, Bethlehem and Fogelsville. 
 Improving on a page from New Jersey's playbook, Pennsylvania state officials and the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation are offering even cheaper real estate, even lower taxes and even more tax breaks.
While New Jersey has chased blue-chip marquees from the New York Yankees to the New York Stock Exchange, the Lehigh Valley has opened its network of 42 industrial and corporate parks to all companies large and small, well known and obscure.
Fully one-third of the 216 companies that moved to Lehigh Valley or expanded there over the last four years were from New Jersey or New York.
"The hunter has become the hunted," said Linda Dow, a real estate consultant for Insignia/ESG who has advised clients like Aiwa America Inc. and Organon Inc. on moves to the Lehigh Valley. "Many Fortune 500 companies are now considering the Lehigh Valley as a true alternative, not just a stalking horse for a better deal in New Jersey."
The companies may not be as glamorous as Goldman, Sachs, and few companies are moving their headquarters from New Jersey, but they are moving other operations.
After scouring New Jersey for a new regional distribution center, Aiwa, the consumer electronics manufacturer based in Mahwah, N.J., took a look at the Lehigh Valley, where it found helpful officials and a less expensive deal.
The company moved into a new 407,000-square-foot building in Allentown in May 1999 and pulled out of three smaller distribution centers in its home state.
The Vertek Corporation, a software and computer network provider based in Murray Hill, N.J., opened a $6.5 million service center in Bethlehem in 1999 that is expected to employ 170 people. The company received $600,000 in job training grants and tax credits from the state.
Organon, a pharmaceutical company based in West Orange, N.J., opened a small distribution center in Allentown in 1986 and has expanded three times, most recently in 1999 when it added a packaging plant.
Russell Stanley, of Red Bank, N.J., opened a manufacturing plant in Allentown in 1999 for plastic drums used by the food and drug industries.
"We've targeted northern New Jersey and New York and specific industries," said Sara Anderson-Greer, vice president of marketing for the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation. "We're actively marketing the area, meeting with site advisers and building an infrastructure to accommodate them."
Welcome to the war between the states. It makes little difference that the governors of all three states are Republicans. Like their counterparts in California, Alabama and Minnesota, the governors and the local development corporations are chasing jobs and political glory.
No one has made a more concerted effort than Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and officials in the Lehigh Valley, where even the giant Bethlehem Steel works, where 30,000 steelworkers once labored over the coke ovens and steel furnaces, is being converted into a 1,600-acre office and industrial park.
The parks allow companies to build almost immediately after signing a deal for office space, a warehouse or manufacturing plant. Employers can then tap into a network of a dozen technical schools, colleges and universities in the valley for trained employees. Local economic development officials and the governor's "action team" aggressively court companies, acting as promoters and expediters.
Bill Bachenberg, founder of DBS International, which designs and supplies computer hardware for business customers, recently moved his company to Bethlehem from Flemington, N.J., after he received a $1.05 million low-interest loan from the state to buy an existing building. As it turned out, three-quarters of his staff already lived in Pennsylvania.
Like the owners of many small and medium-size businesses in New York and New Jersey, he had felt ignored by officials who were more interested in large employers with hundreds of employees.
"Here, the local government welcomed us with open arms," said Mr. Bachenberg, whose company has 30 employees. "We closed on the purchase of our building in the morning, we had a building permit by noon and they started renovations that afternoon. In New Jersey, we'd still be waiting for a permit."
For a variety of reasons, taxes, real estate and labor costs are lower in Pennsylvania. State officials have added further enticements or "tools," ranging from tax credits and job training to cash grants from the governor's discretionary opportunity fund.
Companies that move to one of the year-old Keystone Opportunity Zones, like the one in Lehigh Valley, may not have to pay any state or local taxes for up to 12 years.
According to local real estate executives, the state is close to deals for two major projects, offices for a major pharmaceutical company with about 350 jobs and an old-line insurance company, both based on the east side of the Delaware River.
"I think we've got a toolbox that's as good as anybody's," said Sam McCullough, secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. "We're doing our best to make sure Pennsylvania gets its share or more. We're trying to create an environment that makes it easier and much more profitable to move into Pennsylvania."
Gerald Janssen, senior vice president at the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Growth, was not fazed.
"We bump into them at different economic forums nationally," Mr. Janssen said. "They're aggressive, but all the states are aggressive and looking for their fair share of jobs. We don't see anything to be alarmed about."
He said the state had done very well with its own toolbox of incentives, which he said was one reason the investment banks from Manhattan had been building back-office space in Jersey City.
New Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program offered new and expanding companies steep rebates on employee income taxes, which are often worth millions of dollars, though many corporate executives complained that New Jersey did not offer subsidies to existing businesses with fewer than 300 jobs.
The Regional Plan Association, antitax groups and many economists contend that special tax breaks or subsidies are not a major factor in the decision of any company to relocate and are therefore a waste of resources. Aiwa, for instance, did not get any tax breaks. A company may move to be closer to its customers, its employees or a generally lower-cost environment.
"The subsidies can turn out to be giveaways," said James Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "In many cases, you're providing a bonus for someone who would've taken the same course of action anyway."
Some state officials agreed but argued that the competition for jobs was so fierce that they could not unilaterally disarm.
"Unless you can have an armed truce among all the states," Mr. Janssen said, "everybody has to continue to do it."
So, like big-game hunters, Pennsylvania and New Jersey officials swap tales about the trophies on their respective walls: Pennsylvania attracted 216 companies to the Lehigh Valley alone in the last four years, which accounted for 21,000 jobs and $1 billion in investment.
New Jersey counters with numbers showing that 116 companies moved to the state in 1998 -- 50 from New York and 17 from Pennsylvania -- and were expected to generate 10,600 jobs.
Many of the companies are remarkably similar to those moving from New Jersey to Pennsylvania: manufacturing and distribution centers, as well as the investment banking jobs in Jersey City.
Corporate border-hopping dates from the early 1900's, when silk manufacturers in Paterson, N.J., fled to Pennsylvania one step ahead of union organizers.
But the opening of Interstate 78 in 1989 provided a fast entryway to the Lehigh Valley, and when the economy picked up in the mid-1990's, New Jersey companies began barreling down the highway to Allentown and Bethlehem, where the industrial parks had been under construction for years. New York is 90 minutes away; Philadelphia, 60 minutes.
"I don't think the patterns of development would be a heck of a lot different if we abolished each and every subsidy," Mr. Hughes said.
Many builders expect even more interest from New Jersey companies when Pennsylvania extends Route 33 from Interstate 80 to Interstate 78.
"I consider the Lehigh Valley an extension of the New York metropolitan area," said Jim Petrucci, an industrial developer active on both sides of the Delaware River. "The ready land is the single most important economic tool. If you can come in and build quickly, it presents a tremendous opportunity."
Liberty Property Trust, a national developer, has built eight million square feet of space in Lehigh Valley, the horizontal equivalent of the World Trade Center, and more is on the way.
"I think the distribution market is going to continue to grow," said Peter Eppy, executive vice president of SJB Properties, a developer active in the Lehigh Valley as well as Jersey City and Parsippany, "and i think the office market will be a big growth area."

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK/Birute Galdikas;
Saving the Orangutan, Preserving Paradise

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

 BODY:
Of the three young women recruited in the 1960's by the paleontologist Louis Leakey to study great apes, Dr. Birute Galdikas, now 53, is the least known. Dr. Leakey's first disciple, Dr. Jane Goodall, who discovered that chimpanzees made tools, has become an international scientific celebrity, and Dr. Dian Fossey, who lived among the gorillas of Rwanda and was killed there in 1985, was played by Sigourney Weaver in the movie "Gorillas in the Mist."
But the story of Dr. Galdikas, who quietly devoted herself to the study and preservation of the Indonesian orangutan, remains largely unknown. 
 "That's because I have a name nobody can pronounce and because I've been in Borneo all these years, tracking an elusive and solitary animal," Dr. Galdikas, whose name is Lithuanian (pronounced bi-ROO-tay GALD-i-kus), said on a recent morning. She had come to New York for several days to take the middle of her three children, Jane Galdikas, 15, to museums and the theater.
Dr. Galdikas also is giving a lecture at 7 p.m. next Tuesday at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
Still a resident of Borneo, Dr. Galdikas recently became an Indonesian citizen because "the orangutans are Indonesian and because someone in the government suggested it would be helpful."
But she flies regularly to North America to teach at Simon Fraser University in Canada and to oversee her charity, the Orangutan Foundation International of Los Angeles.
Q. Give us a report on the state of the world's orangutans?
A. They are poised on the edge of extinction. It's that simple. We're still seeing orangutans in the forest; they are coming into captivity in enormous numbers. You just know that there can't be that many left in the wild.
Q. How did the orangutans come to be so threatened?
A. The main factor was that until 1988, Indonesia had a forestry minister who was a real forester. In 1988, he was replaced by a forestry minister who was an agriculturist, a promoter of plantations. That signaled a shift in government policy from selective logging to clear-cutting of the forest. For orangutans, clear-cutting is a policy of extinction. If you selectively log, some animals will survive. But with clear-cutting, the habitat is gone. If that weren't enough, in 1997, there were these horrendous fires that devastated the forests.
Moreover, the last three years have been a period of intense political upheaval: an economic crisis, ethnic strife, student riots, President Suharto's resignation. After President Suharto stepped down in 1998, there was a vacuum of power in the center. Once people in the provinces understood that, some felt they could do whatever they wanted. And what some of them wanted to do was log the forest. So throughout Indonesia, places that had, more or less, been protected, became besieged.
At first, only local loggers came in. When nobody stopped them, the bigger commercial loggers followed. Suddenly, there were no more protected parks.
 Q. Is this true too in Kalimantan, Borneo, where you have your research station?
A. Yes, though in the National Park where I work, we're doing what we can. We're trying to set up patrols of local men to go out with park rangers so that when they come across illegal loggers, they don't feel totally intimidated. We're working with the Indonesian government to set up new wildlife reserves at expired logging concessions. And of course, we're doing what we always have: saving wild-born orangutans who've been captured by humans.
We have a hospital for 130 orangutans. We have an orphanage for the babies. Eventually, they are released to the wild, though with the fast-disappearing habitat, it's always tough to find a safe place for them.
 Q. Tell us what you've learned about orangutans in the nearly 30 years you've been studying them?
A. Well, we've gotten a picture of a very long-lived primate who probably lives 60 to 70 years in the wild. They use a wide variety of foods in the wild, about 400 different kinds, because food is generally scarce for them. The males come and go. They're very, very competitive. Probably very few males are successful at actually impregnating females. And the females seem to get pregnant about once every eight years. Also, they're very smart. When orangutans have interactions with humans, they use tools at an incredibly rapid pace.
 Q. Based on what you've seen, do you believe that orangutans can learn language?
A. I think orangutans can learn how to use language at the level of a 3-year-old child. I had a student in 1978, Gary Shapiro, who came to Camp Leakey and he taught an adult female, Rinnie, sign language. He could not believe how fast she learned it. Rinnie took the tutoring personally. One day, Rinnie took Gary by the hand and tried to seduce him. Gary pushed her away. She thereafter lost all interest in signing. Interestingly, my son, Binti, who was then 2, picked up signing from watching Gary and Rinnie together -- though Binti thought that you could communicate with all orangutans through signs. For a while, he went around and signed with all the animals, even those who'd never been taught sign language.
 Q. Did Binti speak orangutan?
A. He could interpret what they meant. He moved it and he felt it. His whole body posture would be like an orangutan.
Q. Did Binti identify as an orangutan?
A. It was heading in that direction. A friend, a psychiatrist came to Camp Leakey in 1979 when Binti was 3 and said, "You know, you should get him out of here. He really needs to be with kids his own age and to go to pre-school." I knew that Jane Goodall's son, Grub, had been through something similar and they sent him to boarding school. So I sent Binti to live with my ex-husband, his father, Rod Brindamour, in Canada. Letting Binti go with his dad was very, very hard. But he had no people his own age and size at Camp Leakey. All he had were orangutans and gibbons. Binti's first friend was a gibbon and she really liked him. This was when he was a baby in a crib.
 In fact, Binti, right now is in Indonesia, working as a volunteer. He's 23 and doesn't want to do this work professionally, but he does want to help. None of my other kids -- Jane, 15, and Fred, 17 -- want to do this, either. They see how hard it is.
 Q. How did you meet your second husband and the father of your two younger children, a Dyak named Pak Bohap?
 A. He worked at Camp Leakey. The first time I laid eyes on him, I saw him in profile, and it was like I was punched in the stomach. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He was such a handsome man. I was driving and I almost went into a ditch. I was married at the time. After that, I avoided him. I just didn't want to go close.
 Q. How were you able to transcend the barriers of race and culture to make a marriage with a Dyak?
 A. It was possible because the Dyak are probably the most egalitarian people on the planet in the ways of men and women. This is what an anthropologist told me long before I married Pak Bohap. The astonishing thing to me is how comfortable we are. And the fact that we come from different religions and world views, actually keeps the marriage fresh and interesting.
Q. Are you still together?
A. Oh yes. He hates it that I travel so much.
 Q. What's your take on this revival of Darwinism in the social sciences?
A. I don't like the misuses of it. The interaction between environment and genes is so complicated that to use genetic arguments, one has to be careful. Like the recent thing about rape now -- where people are saying that human rape is not about violence, it's about sex, it's just a reproductive strategy -- that's baloney. Maybe it is about reproductive tactics, but it's also about social control.
Q. Orangutans rape, don't they?
A. In Orangutans, rape is about sex. That's all it is. I mean, they don't beat up the female. They don't kill her. Once it's over with, it's over with. Most orangutans that are raped are of childbearing age. With humans you have 90-year-old nuns and 3-year-old girls getting raped. So, there's something other than sex going on with humans.
Q. Getting back to orangutans, when you see what is happening to the animals you've spent your life studying, what do you feel?
A. I feel like I'm viewing an animal holocaust and holocaust is not a word I use lightly. The machine of extinction is grinding away. The destruction of the tropical rain forest in Borneo is accelerating daily. The consequences of this destruction for the orangutans will be final. And if orangutans go extinct in the wild, paradise is gone. And we'll never have it again.

Few movie directors have better captured their country's yearning for freedom than the Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda. Yet when freedom finally came to Poland a decade ago, the audience for his movies evaporated. He remained a cultural icon, a powerful witness to Communist oppression, but many Poles were now more worried about the future than the past. And, if anything, they preferred to be distracted by American films.
Mr. Wajda could of course afford to rest on his laurels, even finding time to serve as a senator in the first post-Communist government. His place in modern movie history had long been secured through such classics as "Ashes and Diamonds," "Kanal," "Man of Marble," "Man of Iron" and "Korczak," films made between 1957 and 1990 that variously championed the cause of freedom through the changing prisms of the Nazi occupation, Soviet oppression and the Holocaust. 
 At the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday, he will receive an honorary Oscar in recognition of his life's work as a director whose films, in the words of the academy's board of governors, "have given audiences around the world an artist's view of history, democracy and freedom, and who in so doing has himself become a symbol of courage and hope for millions of people in postwar Europe."
Yet now, at 75, Mr. Wajda (whose full name is pronounced AHN-dray VY-duh) has made an unexpected comeback. With his latest movie, already seen by six million people in Poland, he has just scored the biggest box office hit of his long career. Even more surprising, he has done so not with a tale of Poles' struggling to adapt to the market economy but with a screen adaptation of "Pan Tadeusz," or "Mr. Thaddeus," an epic poem written in exile in 1834 by the great Polish libertarian Adam Mickiewicz.
The venture was not without risks. Mickiewicz's hymn to patriotism and freedom is taught in Polish schools and, as such, is associated with required reading. While it touches on love, betrayal, land, murder and war, its plot is also immensely complex, revolving around a long-standing feud between the Soplica and Horeszko families, who in the end bury their differences in order to fight their common Russian oppressors. Furthermore, the film has retained Mickiewicz's rhyming verse.
But its success has demonstrated that Mr. Wajda is once again in tune with Poland's mood, this time with its new yearning for a national identity rooted in an idealized past.
"There is this feeling now that there is a paradise in our past, in our imagination," he explained through an interpreter during a visit to Paris. "On a daily basis there is the reality, the brutality of the free market, the difficulty of finding work, the importance of money. All this has created a need for people to plunge into another world, in our language, with our symbols. 'Pan Tadeusz' is a film of great nostalgia."
He said that many people who never go to the movies had lined up to see the film. "I was told of some old women who insisted on sitting in the front row so they could hear all the dialogue, as if they were in a theater," the director said with a smile. He was even more surprised by the turnout among young people. "I thought they might be put off by the verse," he said, "but I think it reminded them of rap music."
Whether a film with such powerful local roots can find a large audience outside Poland is more in doubt. It has been well received by Polish-Americans in the United States and, before its release in France this week, Mr. Wajda visited communities of Polish descendants in Lille and Lyon. But foreign critics who are unable to appreciate Mickiewicz's verse or respond to its romantic patriotism have tended to view it as a highly stylized costume drama.
Mr. Wajda seems unperturbed. He said he made the film principally for Poland. "I think I have things to say, but they are only important if I say them from Poland," he explained. "We cannot tell a story about a man and a woman without dealing with all our history. It would be nice to make a love story without all this history, but it's not possible."
One significant side effect of the movie's success has been to bolster Poland's confidence in its culture: last year, "Pan Tadeusz" and Jerzy Hoffman's "With Fire and Sword," a 17th-century epic, which has drawn seven million spectators so far, demonstrated that locally made films can compete with big-budget fare imported from Hollywood, even the likes of "Titanic" and "Star Wars."
"Under Communism, it was easier to have a big audience," Mr. Wajda said. "We had 3,500 movie theaters; today there are only around 800. In Communist times, cinema was like propaganda, so tickets cost nothing; now they cost the same as in Paris. Television, which used to be very bad, is now competition. There are several networks, plus satellite channels, so you can see almost all movies on TV."
While movie attendance in theaters tumbled, the American market share rose to close to 90 percent by the mid-1990's. And a Polish movie industry that had been producing over 100 movies per year went into crisis. "People wanted entertainment," the director said, sipping a cup of tea in a hotel near the Arc de Triomphe. "Young people were not interested in the past. For them, even 'Man of Iron' and the Solidarity movement seemed to be from the Middle Ages. I made films I had been unable to make under censorship, but there was little public for them."
But finally, it seems, Polish moviegoers tired of a single diet of American movies. And as the Polish economy grew, easing the daily struggle to survive and opening the possibility of Poland's membership in the European Union, Poles began to reflect afresh on their country's place in Europe. "Pan Tadeusz" fits into this pattern: in both the poem and the film, Poles are looking to Napoleonic France in the West to save them from czarist Russia to the East.
With the past no longer taboo, Mr. Wajda next plans to tackle the infamous massacre at Katyn Forest in the Soviet Union in 1940, when thousands of captured Polish Army officers -- among them, the director's father -- were taken to the area and murdered by the Soviet Army. "It will be not so much a war film as a film about a system of lies," he said. "For a long time, the rest of the world said nothing, and we were left alone with this 'secret.' "
If this film is made, it will represent another crucial piece of Mr. Wajda's cinematic history of Poland, one that began with his 1950's trilogy about World War II -- "Generation," "Ashes and Diamonds" and "Kanal" -- and subsequently covered Poland's struggle for independence in the 19th century and under Communist domination. "With my films, you can reconstruct the history of Poland from Napoleon to Solidarity," he said, referring to the political movement that began in 1980 with the Gdansk shipbuilders' strike, which he celebrated in "Man of Iron."
Mr. Wajda has been well placed to do this because, unlike his younger colleague Roman Polanski, he chose not to leave Poland. After World War II, when he played a role in the resistance, Mr. Wajda recalled a brief period of democracy that ended in 1948, "when it became clear that we were in a totalitarian regime that would last an eternity." By the time he emerged from film school in the mid-1950's, however, Stalin was dead and some artistic freedom was permitted. Until martial law was imposed in Poland in 1981, he learned to work in this twilight zone.
"I couldn't do everything I wanted," he said, "but everyone in Polish cinema was united, and we were good at negotiating with political authorities. They also needed our films because they won prizes in the West and showed there was political freedom in Poland. It was a game on both sides. And this game enabled us to make films that strengthened the national identity. The people who supported Solidarity were the same people who saw our films."
Between 1982 and 1988, with martial law enabling the Warsaw government to suffocate all freedom of expression, Mr. Wajda made some films in France and Germany, including "Danton," starring Gerard Depardieu. But he did not formally go into exile, and he avoided taking public political positions. "We were very defeated; we saw no future," he said. "It was in our heads from 1945 that the Soviet Union could only collapse through atomic war, so the Soviet Union could exist forever."
Thus, while the demise of Communism in Poland occurred through negotiations rather than sudden unrest, no one was truly prepared for it, not for the political freedom or for the inflation and unemployment brought by the market economy or for the invasion of American popular culture. For Mr. Wajda, this transition may be the final chapter of his history of Poland.
"The problem is that no one knows how to express it," he said. "Who should be the hero? Let me tell you an anecdote. There's an old soccer stadium which has become an open-air market for Poles and Russians. A Russian comes up to a stall where a Polish girl is selling notebooks. He says, 'How many do you have?' She says, 'How many do you need?' He says, '10,000.' She says, 'I'll have them tomorrow.' Now that is a dialogue that has never existed in Polish cinema. Today, she knows she can find them."

HEADLINE: To Adopt a Village

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The village of Sheri Ram Reddy Guda ("Unwired Villages Mired in the Distant Past," front page, March 19) is one of 500,000 villages in India whose poverty is too familiar. But now, when India has a rapidly growing middle class and a widening elite of the ultra-rich, we must wonder if there is an economic and moral mechanism that will bridge the gap between the ridiculously rich and the abysmally poor. 
 Is it simplistic to suggest that affluent individuals adopt individual villages like these and mentor them out of their misery? Might a well-publicized, successful example of such an adoption prompt similar efforts on a large scale?
"Wiring" is no longer essential when a wireless phone in every village is such a cheap option. And development of small, local, stand-alone electric generators would enable isolated, long-stagnant rural economies to be electrified without the staggering costs of global wiring.

Treasuries RiseIn Quiet Day Of Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury bond prices rose yesterday in thin trading as weakness in technology stocks encouraged some safe-haven buying in Treasuries while expectations of higher rates made shorter maturities less attractive, analysts said.
Dealers said a major Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting scheduled for today kept most traders on the sidelines. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32, to 103 15/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was unchanged at 6 percent.
Dealers said yesterday was one of the quietest days in recent memory, and price movements were exaggerated with so few players in the market.
"It's probably the quietest day we've had this year," said John Roberts, head of governments trading at Barclays Capital. "Tokyo was closed for Spring Equinox Day; London was quiet. It's been quiet here all day."
The Treasury Department said yesterday that it would buy back more government debt in the second half of April.
Buoyed by budget surpluses, the department said in January that it would buy back up to $30 billion of debt this year. It has already conducted two buybacks, each of $1 billion face value of bonds, focusing its repurchases on older 30-year bonds that pay higher coupons to investors.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:

HEADLINE: Slipping in Polls, Fujimori Courts Peru's Indians

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: PUNO, Peru, March 19

 BODY:
Slipping in the polls and besieged by international criticism over campaign irregularities, President Alberto K. Fujimori has been fighting off altitude sickness, putting on Indian garb and cutting ribbons across this Andean country in a flourish of pork-barrel politics.
Visiting this 12,000-foot-high city on Lake Titicaca today, Mr. Fujimori never asked the people for their votes, even though presidential elections are only three weeks away. But the message was implicit, and the photo opportunity was golden. 
 The Aymara-speaking Indians here shouted out their support as Mr. Fujimori removed his oxygen mask and strutted to the podium. Scores of officers from the national police smartly marched by, as row after row of new, shiny police vans rotated their emergency lights in unison to welcome the nation's leader.
"We Peruvians have had to travel a long, difficult road these last 15 years against terrorism and hyperinflation," Mr. Fujimori told the audience of 300 police officers and Indian residents. "With great pride and satisfaction, I hand over these vehicles so you can fight delinquency and we never have to go back to the days of insecurity."
In the last few weeks, Mr. Fujimori has raised the minimum wage 18 percent, to $118 a month, and handed tiny pieces of property to more than 150,000 peasants and urban squatters at bargain-basement prices. He has set in motion the procurement of 1,400 tractors for nearly 1,000 communities and begun a huge dike-building project to make the cragged highlands bloom.
And as he did here today, the president is distributing a new fleet of 1,700 Land Cruiser police vans across the country just in time for the presidential and congressional elections on April 9.
To soften his image, Mr. Fujimori recently lifted government emergency powers in the last remaining rural areas where, to fight terrorism the military had the right to detain suspects without bringing charges and to enter houses without search warrants. But for all his efforts, a growing number of political experts are saying the man who has in 10 years in power reduced a vicious and expanding Maoist guerrilla army to a mere band of marauders and a 7,500 percent annual inflation rate to single digits may not win an outright majority and avert a runoff.
In a nationwide poll of 1,505 people last week by Datum International, Mr. Fujimori was favored by 39.6 percent. Alejandro Toledo, the director of a business school, was second, and catching up, with 25.2. Seven others are running well behind.
Experts note that the 61-year-old president did much better than polls predicted when he won his first election in 1990 and re-election in 1995 and that he could still pull off a victory next month.
But Mr. Toledo, who has strong Indian features and promises to be "the president of the poor," appears to be the strongest opponent Mr. Fujimori has ever faced among the poor Indian voters. They have in the past been drawn to Mr. Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent, in part because they see his Asian features as similar to theirs.
Mr. Fujimori's image of invincibility has been damaged in recent weeks by the widespread perception that he has lost control of his campaign and that the election process is badly flawed.
After mounting evidence that Mr. Fujimori's campaign workers forged a million signatures to place him on the ballot, one of the four parties that is backing him withdrew from the campaign last week along with two congressional candidates allied to the president. As the scandal has grown, the national electoral commission dismissed a senior official to ward off contentions that the election was fixed.
With its extensive aid program here, what the United States says carries great weight. And the Clinton administration has been highly critical of the election process in recent weeks. When Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante met senior State Department and White House officials on March 7, he was warned that a fixed election would have grave effects on relations between the two countries.
Two days later, a spokesman for the State Department, James P. Rubin, made headlines here with a checklist of demands to clean up the campaign. He called on Lima to "implement a directive that makes clear that the misuse of state resources for electoral advantage will be severely sanctioned" and to "investigate reports of harassment of opposition candidates and domestic election monitors and take action against those responsible."
Since then, opposition candidates have been given additional television time, and the government has set up a telephone line for complaints about campaign irregularities. Still, several newspapers and television stations widely believed to take their direction from Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service continue to circulate scurrilous reports about the opposition candidates, particularly Mr. Toledo.
In an interview today on his presidential plane, Mr. Fujimori took a conciliatory tone and promised a free election. "Some of the critical observations have been correct," Mr. Fujimori said. "It's possible that there has been harassment and that vehicles of the state have been used to benefit official candidates. We need to correct that when it happens."
He conceded that it was possible he would not win an outright victory on April 9, adding, "It's up to the people to decide."
As Mr. Fujimori's caravan left Puno for a tour of the countryside, he ordered the local police to stay in the city and patrol in the shiny new vans.
With only a handful of aides and a couple of bodyguards, he stopped the caravan at an Indian village, Jechuyo Pamaya, to inspect a rudimentary dike system dug on a hillside under government direction. Mr. Fujimori's new pet project, designed to stop rainwater from flowing down the mountains and to create an underground reserve from which to grow high grasses and trees, is a throwback to Inca technology.
Between gulps of air from his oxygen mask, Mr. Fujimori climbed a rocky hill as 30 awestruck Indians whispered to one another in Aymara and put out their hands to touch the president. They threw confetti into his hair to celebrate the arrival of an honored guest.
"You see this grass, it is going to grow this high!" the president said as he reached to his waist. "Better grass means better cattle and better milk and better nutrition." The Indians nodded and pleaded for a tractor.
Seferina Quille, 60, a peasant woman who was wearing a purple hoop skirt and tall felt hat and carrying a blanket full of potatoes on her back, said she was thrilled by the visit. "I'm going to vote for the president," she said in Aymara, "because he builds roads and schools for us."

HEADLINE: What Now for Beijing and Taipei?

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, March 20

 BODY:
With a few tantalizingly parallel sentences today, the president-elect of Taiwan and the president of China captured the exasperating and probably intractable differences in their views of Taiwan.
"We can talk about 'one China' as long as it is not a principle," the victorious candidate, Chen Shui-bian, said to Taiwan reporters today. "As long as we are treated as equals, there is nothing we cannot discuss." His advisers regard the statement as a creative concession that may entice Beijing into talks. 
 In Beijing, President Jiang Zemin repeated the formula that his government sees as generous: "The one-China principle must first be recognized. Under this precondition, anything can be discussed."
On such wordplay are matters of war and peace decided across the Taiwan Strait -- or, more prosaically, the matter of whether the two sides can even sit together, as they have not done for years, to negotiate whether packages can be sent across without detouring through Hong Kong.
Around the world and among a decent share of Taiwan's people, there is fear that the election of Mr. Chen, who long advocated a declaration of independence from China but recently backed away on the ground that a formal declaration was not needed, could lead to a military attack by China.
Given all the concern, Mr. Chen and his advisers are surprisingly upbeat. They say he will not only avoid provoking a Chinese attack, but may also be able to coax China into a friendly dialogue as well as new agreements to deepen economic ties and perhaps even a peace treaty.
"I'm optimistic," Chiou I-jen, a top adviser to Mr. Chen who ran his presidential campaign and is the Democratic Progressive Party's representative to Washington, said in an interview. "If both sides can maintain a certain vagueness, then negotiations could carry on."
Mr. Chiou is going next week to Washington, where he will discuss Mr. Chen's strategy with American officials who are worried about possible tensions across the strait but who publicly hailed Mr. Chen's democratic election and the chance for, in President Clinton's words, a "fresh start."
Some experts question the assumption that China will want to seek any common ground with the chief of an independence-minded party.
"I think the optimism from the Chen people and the American government, this idea that they have a new beginning, is extremely dangerous," said Andrew Nathan, an expert on East Asian politics at Columbia University, who observed the election here. "The Chinese simply don't trust Chen Shui-bian. They think his ultimate goal is to cheat China."
Beijing knows that Mr. Chen is in a weak position at home, having won with 39 percent of the vote in a three-way race. He will also be overseeing a divided government, with the legislature still under the control of the Nationalist Party. And Mr. Chen's advisers and a leading opposition expert on cross-strait relations both said Mr. Chen could not even begin to pursue talks with China until he forged a broad consensus domestically, which at best will take many months.
In addition, Chinese leaders have little incentive to cooperate and make Mr. Chen look good, said Mr. Nathan, who predicts four years of serious cross-strait tensions after Mr. Chen becomes president on May 20.
Countering such pessimism, Mr. Chen is fond of evoking the opening to China by the arch-anti-Communist Richard Nixon, saying that perhaps he, too, could make a breakthrough where his predecessors could not.
Mr. Chen and his staff have been buoyed by the initial signs since his election on Saturday.
Mr. Chen has avoided provocative statements, deliberately not uttering, for example, the phrase state-to-state relations, which the outgoing president, Lee Teng-hui, used last summer to the outrage of Beijing.
He has offered to exchange visits with Chinese leaders and discuss removing Taiwan's restrictions on economic ties, a longtime mainland goal. He said he was resigning from the Democratic Progressive Party's executive committee -- a way, perhaps, to dissociate himself from contentious statements in the party platform and from the party's hard-liners.
Though the leaders in Beijing had to be dismayed by Mr. Chen's victory, they halted their pointed vitriol of the week before, so far saying only, "We will listen to your words and watch your actions."
In interviews and speeches in the last two days, Mr. Chen and key advisers have described a strategy that they think may be more attractive to Beijing than what Mr. Lee had to offer.
Essentially, it involves being willing, as Mr. Lee never was, to take up China's offer to discuss Taiwan's status under the principle of "one China."
Mr. Lee accepted in theory that Taiwan and China might loosely unite in the distant future -- after the mainland became a democracy. But he said discussion of such fundamental issues was premature and must be kept aside while practical matters like trade and fishing rights were discussed. For the last several years this impasse prevented any formal negotiations.
The problem is that Mr. Chen does not even pay lip service to a future political link, although he says he will discuss anything including reunification.
That general willingness, from someone who has zero interest in reunifying, is made possible by Mr. Chen's final condition -- the trump card that enables him to agree to almost any dialogue. Any important change in Taiwan's status that is proposed, he insists, must be decided by the democratic will of Taiwan's people.
"We insist on parity and that any ultimate resolution must have the consent of the people," said Mr. Chiou, the adviser to Mr. Chen.
Beijing has already rejected that condition. In February it issued a policy statement deriding the notion that one group -- like the residents of Taiwan -- should vote on a sovereignty issue concerning "all the Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots."
Still, Mr. Chen's advisers say that when Beijing is ready to talk and nurture better ties -- as it was for a time in the early 1990's, even though the meaning of "one China" was not quite agreed on -- the different assumptions can be played down.

HEADLINE: The Murky Tale of Taiwan: Island With an Unruly Past

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

 BODY:
While the United States, China and most countries around the world hold that Taiwan is a part of China, the connections across the Taiwan Strait historically have been tenuous.
Chinese officials often say that Taiwan has always been part of China, but in fact for most of history nobody paid much attention to the island, which was inhabited by non-Chinese peoples who are ethnically and linguistically closer to today's Indonesians than to Chinese. 
 Chinese fishermen and farmers settled along Taiwan's coastal areas in the 16th and 17th centuries but it was Holland that first established an administrative structure on Taiwan, which it seized from the native people in 1624. In 1683, Taiwan came under Chinese imperial rule but was mostly left to its own devices.
Only in 1886 did China declare Taiwan a province and begin to pay attention to the island. In 1895, Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan. Taiwanese leaders sought independence sought support from foreign powers, but no one responded.
It was the Japanese who built schools and modernized the economy.
As many elderly Taiwanese see it, Japan did far more for Taiwan than mainland China ever did. President Lee Teng-hui, for example, spoke Taiwanese as his mother tongue and learned Japanese before he learned Mandarin Chinese (schoolchildren all had to learn Japanese), and he still sometimes speaks Japanese with his wife. Indeed, President Lee has less of an accent in Japanese than in Mandarin Chinese.
The only time in the 20th century that mainland China ruled Taiwan was from 1945, when Japan gave up the island after World War II, until 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army was defeated by the Communists and fled to Taiwan. The memories of those four years are dominated by the Feb. 28 incident of 1947, when Nationalist troops massacred countless thousands of protesting Taiwanese.
The Nationalists, dominated by mainlanders who insisted that their exiled Republic of China on Taiwan was the legitimate government of all China, tried to remake the island in the mainland's image. The street names in Taipei are based on mainland cities and provinces, and children were forced to speak Mandarin rather than the Taiwanese or Hakka dialects they spoke at home.
But even now, Taiwan's culture bears a heavy Japanese influence and the Mandarin on Taiwan is modestly different from that of the mainland. There are even dictionaries to translate from Taiwan Mandarin to mainland Mandarin. Taiwan uses traditional characters while the mainland uses simplified ones, and a mainlander may have difficulty reading a Taiwan newspaper.
In the Shanghai Communique of 1972, the United States stated that "all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The U.S. Government does not challenge that position." That fell well short of the United States committing itself to the conclusion that Taiwan is necessarily a part of China. Over the years American officials steadily drifted from that formulation to simply stating that Taiwan is a part of China.

HEADLINE: Restoration In Search Of a Revival;
Furnishings Chain Hurt By Its Own Strategy

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
When the home furnishings chain Restoration Hardware was preparing for a public stock offering in June 1998, it appeared to be the rare case of a retail concept that could remake its market. Although the chain, with just 43 stores, was tiny compared with its competition, its founder, Stephen Gordon, was hailed as a new Ralph Lauren -- a man with an instinct for translating the aspirations of the moneyed into real stuff.
Instead of offering standard fare like taupe sofas and glass coffee tables, Restoration recreated products from an era before the mass market. Items like restrained beige-and-navy plaid Woolrich camping blankets and tarnished half-moon brass drawer pulls, it hoped, would evoke shoppers' nostalgia for a simple yet craft-rich and elegant past that they had never actually experienced. 
 "They created a mix of traditional plus whimsy that was really very unique," said Wendy Lieberman of WSL Strategic Retail, an industry consulting firm.
Despite its early promise, though, Restoration has had trouble becoming a mass-market player. Over the last year, sales in stores open a year, a standard measure, were flat. More worrisome, for the fourth quarter of 1999, which included the important Christmas season, sales in Restoration stores open a year or more actually fell 5.8 percent. Earnings are expected to be off 18 cents a share for 1999.
This unhappy performance has scared investors. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and the housing market cools off, the stocks of all manner of home products retailers have taken hits. But Restoration's woes have been particularly severe. Its share price has plummeted from a high of $37 in July 1998, to $5 yesterday, nearly one-quarter the initial offering price of $19.
The company's troubles may not be fatal, but they certainly have forced it to slow down. In hopes of putting matters right, it cut by half the number of stores it planned to open this year and rethought some of the basics of its strategy.
What went wrong? High on its own buzz, the company expanded at breakneck speed, more than doubling the number of stores, to 94, in the year and a half after the stock offering. That fast growth put a great strain on a company that was just feeling its way and on a not-ready-for-prime-time management team.
"Essentially this is a case study of a company coming to market too soon, a premature I.P.O.," said Shelly Hale, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. "The growth prospects the company had identified were way too aggressive. They just did not have the systems and people to support it."
Restoration is still small. In its last fiscal year, it did just short of $300 million in sales, while rivals like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pier 1 Imports and Williams-Sonoma, owner of Pottery Barn, each topped $1 billion.
Executives at Restoration Hardware are almost eager to take responsibility for the debacle. "Most of the wounds were self-inflicted," said Walter Parks, the recently appointed chief administrative officer and spokesman. "But when you are in the middle of the storm you don't realize that there might be some shortcomings."
The staff is also pleased to analyze its mistakes -- within limits. It sees the company's errors as part of the growing pains of a naive but solid operation, which in 1995 had only five stores, all in Marin County, Calif.
Company managers agree, for example, that Restoration's original inventory system, which called for all furniture to be kept at stores instead of at a central warehouse, was a disaster. The advantage of such a distribution system is that it allows customers to have instant gratification when buying a sofa, something very rare in the business.
Because of the bulk of the average item, logistics for furniture sales are a critical part of the business. The problem was that unless Restoration could gauge demand with precision, some items could accumulate where they were not needed while other items ran short. This was exactly what happened. The most popular stores did not have the merchandise they needed, while the least-trafficked ones were clogged with leather chairs and cherry dining tables.
Perhaps Restoration is willing to discuss its inventory problems in detail because last summer the chain finally moved to a centralized system, suggesting that such problems could eventually be solved.
But Restoration's most public misstep had less to do with inventory systems than with poor judgment. In February, it ran its first-ever real sale, steeply marking down its mission-style oak and cedar bedroom furniture. It knew it would lose money on each chest of drawers sold but thought of them as loss leaders, believing it would make up the revenue from increased store traffic.
The problem was that demand for these exceptionally popular items quadrupled. And instead of letting customers fight for the few pieces on hand, the company decided to fulfill every request, even if it meant placing special orders from the factory. Not only did that decimate profits for the duration of the sale, it put unanticipated demand on the factories, causing backlogs on other lines of furniture. "We probably will not do a sale again," Mr. Parks said.
But while the company may acknowledge that it was structured poorly, it does not concede that its staff was in over its head -- something that even its allies say is true. "They've really grown, and not everyone there could rise to the occasion," said a sympathetic Mitchell Gold, chairman of Mitchell Gold Inc., which supplies Restoration Hardware and many of its competitors with upholstered furniture. "Sometimes a staff that's comfortable ordering $1 million worth of goods freezes up when they need to order $10 million."
At Restoration's headquarters in Corte Madera, Calif., however, Mr. Gordon and his staff are fiercely loyal to one another, and no one has been dismissed. In Mr. Gordon's view, the problem was not that his people were in over their heads but that there were not enough heads to do the job. "We sure did have a year where we hit a wall in terms of having enough talent on board to execute to the level we had put ourselves up to," he said. "We were coming to the point where people were fracturing, coming apart."
Mr. Gordon's response has been, finally, to fill positions that most companies his size take for granted: executive vice presidents for merchandising, stores and administration. While analysts hope this will help, they still question whether it is enough. They argue that many executives, including Mr. Gordon, are taxed beyond their abilities.
Part of Restoration's marketing charm is the often semiautobiographical descriptions on each piece of merchandise. Juice glasses at Pottery Barn have tags that simply list style, size and price; at Restoration, juice glasses come with this essay:
" 'Pop,' my wife's granddad, was a pretty incredible guy. He worked hard, played hard, always remembered everyone's special occasions, still toiling away into his 80's . . . all-around a fine human being. We inherited Pop's juice glasses and use 'em at our house for all but the 'on the fly' breakfast. In tribute to him (and 'cause we think the glasses are swell) we've reproduced these spry 50's glasses for all the world's juice vessel needs. Pop, being a lover of free enterprise, commerce and the making of a buck, would be proud to oblige. Bottoms up."
Although his company is struggling mightily, Mr. Gordon still writes the copy for each and every tag himself -- nearly 1,000 the last year, by his own estimate. Mr. Gordon defends the practice. "From the outside," he said, "I could see how someone would worry, 'Do we have some guy holed up at home chain-smoking and writing copy?' Nothing could be further from the truth. But if you don't have a compelling product, you have an empty vessel."
But some would argue that even with its products, Restoration has not been smart enough. Competitors like Pier 1 and Crate and Barrel stock up on midrange $30-to-$40 items like pasta serving plates and matching bowls and table linens -- high-margin items that easily add up to entice $100 out of a consumer's pocket. Better still, such sundries change seasonally -- reindeer prints at Christmas, rosebuds in spring -- and give a mall browser reason to come in every few weeks.
Restoration, meanwhile, is skewed with products at the lower and higher ends. And the low-priced gimmickry -- retro items like Moon Pies, marshmallow sandwiches at $9 a dozen, or Mr. Bubble bubble bath, at $3.50 -- is also hurting. "People love to buy the tchotchkes, but when that is all they buy, they are not spending enough to cover the cost of labor," said Janet Kloppenburg, an analyst with Robertson, Stephens.
In addition, the chain's merchandise, while stylish, changes little season to season and year to year. The same batteryless Russian flashlight that made a splash two years back can still be found on Restoration's shelves, as can the mint-flavored tennis balls for dogs to fetch and freshen their breath. "They are more curators than sellers," sighed David Brooks, who wrote a laudatory article about the chain in The New Yorker in 1998 and subsequently become an unhappy stockholder.
While cognizant of these criticisms, Mr. Gordon is only partly moved by them. Although acknowledging that Christmas would have been better with more midpriced items, he insists that is not necessarily the key to increasing sales. He still trusts his instinct to pick a product that resonates with the consumer regardless of price. "When we see an idea that we love," he said, "we will go with it."
Mr. Gordon insists that the problem is not what his company is selling, but its failure to give customers what they want when they want it. And he insists that whatever logistical mistakes Restoration Hardware has made along the way, it has not lost its magic touch with the public. "The consumer is no less passionate today than they were in 1998," he said, "and ultimately passion for the brand is really what it is about."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Technology Shares Again Hit Hard; Nasdaq Loses 3.92%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Technology stocks suffered another broad, steep drop yesterday as the Nasdaq composite index fell for the fourth day in the last six sessions.
Biotechnology shares were among the biggest losers, though investors were not selling these or speculative Internet issues to get out of the market. Continuing a pattern of late last week, proceeds from the sales were redirected into blue-chip companies, including a number of time-tested technology producers, like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. 
 "The trend in the Nasdaq composite is definitely down, but it needs a pullback," said Kenneth M. Sheinberg of S. G. Cowen. "A retracement back to the 4,200 level would not be the worst thing that could happen."
By the close of trading, the Nasdaq index had settled at 4,610.00, its low point for the day, down 188.13 points, or 3.92 percent. Since March 10, when it reached a high of 5,048.62, the index has declined by nearly 9 percent. Even with the recent swoon, it is up more than 13 percent so far this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.01 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,680.24. Hewlett-Packard, Intel and AT&T were among issues that led the index higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 7.84, or 0.54 percent, to 1,456.63. Reflecting the drubbing of biotechnology and smaller technology companies, the Russell 2000 index slumped 25.57 points, or 4.45 percent, to 549.20.
Market breadth, too, depended on which sectors one considered. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues exceeded those advancing, 1,574 to 1,384. But on the technology-laden Nasdaq, matters were markedly worse, with 2,944 issues declining and 1,280 rising.
"The euphoria over anything virtual is being tested again," said Philip S. Dow, a managing director at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. "This is the year when competitive forces are going to show who the winners and losers are going to be."
There was no real news that led the market lower. Indeed, traders said that the week's most anticipated event -- today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee -- has already been taken into account by the stock market.
The widespread consensus is that Fed policy makers will approve another quarter-of-a-percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates.
Still, the traders said people are skittish about potentially bad news, particularly about first-quarter earnings. "We are in the nasty preannouncement period on earnings," said Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
Worries about what companies might say -- and what the news can do to stock prices -- were apparent early, after MicroStrategy, a highflying inventory-management software manufacturer, said it was restating its 1998 and 1999 financial results downward and that its current-quarter results would fall short of analysts' expectations. In an extraordinary plunge, MicroStrategy shares fell 140 yesterday, to 86 3/4.
"MicroStrategy affected the psychology, and injected a little more sense of urgency to sell some of these stocks," Mr. Molnar said.
Biotechnology issues, hit hard last week, were beaten down again yesterday. Amgen fell 5 1/8, to 58. Immunex lost 23 7/8, closing at 150. Genentech dropped 16 3/8, to 176 1/8. And Millennium Pharmaceuticals slumped 32 3/4, to 141 15/16.
But some companies that reported very good results were also punished. Lehman Brothers foreshadowed what is expected to be a good quarter for Wall Street firms, announcing earnings that were higher than estimates. But its stock fell 3 5/8, to 87 13/16. Other Wall Street firms scheduled to report this week also slumped. The Goldman Sachs Group dropped 3 1/16, to 113 7/16. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter shed 1 1/16, to 87 11/16.
Well-known semiconductor and computer stocks were among the technology-related shares that posted gains. Intel, which introduced two faster versions of its flagship Pentium III microprocessor yesterday, rose 5 1/8, to 135. Hewlett-Packard, another Dow component, was up 6 3/16, at 144. I.B.M. closed at 112 3/4, up 2 3/4. And Dell Computer climbed 1 1/4, to 57 11/16.
AT&T rose to 56 7/8, up 3 11/16.
Prices of oil service stocks fell sharply as the price of crude oil dropped to a three-week low. Schlumberger dropped 4 1/16, to 70 1/4. Smith International fell 3 3/4, to 65 5/8. And Halliburton dropped 2 3/16, to 36 3/16.

HEADLINE: Campaign Briefing

 BODY:

THE REPUBLICANS
 
BUSH REPORTS SPENDING -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas spent $13.1 million in February, more than half of it on television and radio advertisements in the crucial primary contests that helped him become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, the Bush campaign said yesterday. By the end of February, Mr. Bush had spent a record $63.2 million, more than double the amount spent by his main rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. The Bush campaign has raised a record $73.8 million from nearly 196,000 individuals. Although Mr. Bush himself did not attend any fund-raisers in February, the campaign raised $3.2 million and had $10.6 million in the bank on Feb. 29, the campaign said. Nearly all of that was spent before Super Tuesday, March 7. Don Van Natta Jr. (NYT)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE'S FINANCES -- Vice President Al Gore's campaign, meanwhile, announced that it had $4.1 million in the bank on March 1 and expected to receive $7.3 million more in federal matching funds in the next few weeks. Campaign officials said Mr. Gore would continue to raise money over the next several months until he reached the spending limit for the primary period, about $44 million. Mr. Gore spent $6 million in February, less than half of Gov. George W. Bush's total. But Mr. Gore's competition from former Senator Bill Bradley was much less acute than that posed to Mr. Bush by Senator John McCain. John M. Broder (NYT) 
 
A PITCH FOR McCAIN VOTERS -- At a rally of cheering students and Democratic Party workers this afternoon, Vice President Al Gore again exhorted Republican and independent backers of Senator John McCain to join his campaign. "John McCain was right, and George W. Bush was wrong," Mr. Gore told the audience at Lincoln Land Community College in Springfield, Ill. Mr. Gore said that he agreed with Mr. McCain that Mr. Bush's economic plan was "fiscally irresponsible" and that anyone who would propose such a plan did "not understand the role of the president of the United States." He added: "John McCain could add and subtract. He could also demonstrate the courage to advocate reform, as Bill Bradley did, as I did. The voice that John McCain made heard is a voice I want to honor in the remaining seven and a half months of this campaign." Jo Thomas (NYT)
 
THIRD PARTIES
 
BUCHANAN FILES COMPLAINT -- Accusing the two major parties of conspiring to keep a hammerlock on the televised presidential debates this fall, Patrick J. Buchanan filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, contending that a "grossly unjust" format is blocking the Reform Party from participating. Mr. Buchanan, who hopes to win the party's nomination, contended that the Commission on Presidential Debates acted arbitrarily in ruling that only nominees with at least a 15 percent popularity rating in five national opinion polls are eligible for the debates. "Our political opponents are the ones deciding our fate," Mr. Buchanan declared, noting that the debate commission is filled with major party appointees. Mr. Buchanan has said that he is not optimistic about redress from the election commission, which is controlled by major-party nominees, and that he expects to have to file a federal court challenge for a place in the debates. Francis X. Clines (NYT)
 
THE HOUSE
 
CHALLENGING BOBBY RUSH -- Representative Bobby L. Rush, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Chicago last year against Richard M. Daley, now faces a strong challenge as he tries to keep his seat in Congress. Mr. Rush, a former Black Panther leader who left the Chicago City Council for Congress in 1992, faces three opponents for the Democratic nomination in the Illinois primary today, including Barack Obama, a state senator who has won the endorsement of The Chicago Tribune. Mr. Obama, 37, a civil rights lawyer, was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. The other two candidates in the race are Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a retired police officer. Dirk Johnson (NYT)
 
ILLINOIS GOVERNOR OSTRACIZED -- Beset by scandal and criticized for taking liberal stands, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, is now being treated as a foe by some politicians in his own party. Bill Brady, who is running for the congressional seat left open by the retirement of Thomas W. Ewing, has run commercials tying his opponent in today's Republican primary, State Representative Timothy V. Johnson, to Governor Ryan. The governor has been beleaguered by a bribery scandal dating from his tenure as the Illinois secretary of state and has been attacked by conservatives for raising taxes, supporting gay rights and declaring a moratorium on the death penalty. Mr. Johnson ran an advertisement with a testimonial from a Republican governor -- Jim Edgar, who preceded Mr. Ryan in office. Dirk Johnson (NYT)

HEADLINE: Pataki Planning Tax Breaks for Some Web Companies

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
It has become a commonplace situation: a corporation threatens to move its headquarters out of New York City. City and state officials, eager to prevent the defection, hand out tax breaks worth millions of dollars.
In the last six years, about 50 major companies have taken advantage of the city's and state's retention incentives, receiving at least $2 billion in tax relief. 
 Now, however, the Pataki administration has proposed a new tax break, intended not for the blue-chip companies that have dominated the New York City economy, but for a vital segment of the fast-growing Internet industry.
Under the proposal, so-called Web-hosting companies that provide the infrastructure of the Internet -- the computers, the fiber optic cables, the climate-control equipment -- would be able to avoid paying a state sales tax on their costly equipment. Server computers, owned by the customers but maintained by the Web hosts, would also be exempt from sales tax.
The tax cut has been embraced by the Democratic leadership of the Assembly. But it has drawn criticism from tax policy analysts on both ends of the political spectrum, who say it is unwise to single out certain industries for favored treatment.
New York's Internet industry is expanding at a breathtaking rate. Today, it employs more than a quarter of a million people, more than double the 1997 level, according to a recent report commissioned by the New York New Media Association, a trade group.
Yet despite this explosive growth, officials of both parties say the sales tax exemption is needed to prevent the Web-hosting companies, also known as Internet data centers, and their customers from being lured to other states.
"Other states across the nation are competitive in trying to attract these jobs," said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget. "The governor wants to make sure that New York remains one of the most attractive states for new media companies to locate and expand."
As tax cuts go, this one is relatively small. The state estimates that it would result in an annual revenue loss of $9 million, Mr. Quinn said. And it is only the latest in a series of selective tax breaks given out over the years. Some, like the elimination of sales tax for the hardware used to design and develop computer software, have been aimed at certain sectors. And some have gone to individual companies.
But the Web-hosting tax break carries considerable symbolic value. For several years, Internet entrepreneurs complained that government officials had failed to recognize their contribution to the New York economy. Those days seem over, an indication of the new-media entrepreneurs' growing political influence.
In New York City, the Giuliani administration has not drafted special tax measures for new media, but it has ingratiated itself with the new-media industry by proposing several measures intended to help all small businesses, like the elimination of the commercial rent tax.
Industry advocates have also complained in recent years that New York's academic institutions have not played a big enough role in training the work force of the new economy. Moving toward that goal, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York recently created a program that would draw upon faculty members and students on all 17 campuses to help develop software to be used by Silicon Alley.
On the state level, the Pataki administration's proposed tax break would help offset the disadvantages of doing business in New York, where real estate and utilities are more costly than elsewhere, said Brian Horey, the president of Equity Growth Management, a venture capital company that invests in Internet enterprises.
The measure would benefit companies like Global Crossing, a telecommunications company that operates a Web-hosting center in Manhattan. The company estimates that the equipment in its center cost $60 million and that the value of the equipment it houses for its customers is $120 million.
But Frank J. Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research institution in Latham, N.Y., said that the success of the new-media industry in New York demonstrated that special tax breaks were not necessary. "This is a tax break for something that is going to happen anyway, that is happening," Mr. Mauro said.
If a company chose its location based on where tax policies were less burdensome, Mr. Mauro said, then the Internet industry would be flourishing upstate, not in New York City.
Some of these reservations are shared by Brian D. Backstrom, the vice president of Change-N.Y., a conservative anti-tax group. Mr. Backstrom said that while any tax cut was better than none, it would make more sense to lower taxes across the board rather than selectively.
"It's not the most effective job-creation policy," Mr. Backstrom said. He has philosophical objections as well. "Any company in any industry can now knock on the governor's door, threaten to move and virtually be guaranteed a tax break or economic development subsidy of some sort," he said.
Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who is a Democrat, agrees in part. "As an overall policy," he said, "if we weren't competing with other states, it would always be better to lower everything across the board." But he said New York needed the tax break to prevail in the intense battles for new-media business.
In Virginia, a state that has aggressively sought Internet business, America Online got $18 million in tax breaks last year in exchange for opening an Internet data center in Prince William County.
Michael Mazerov, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities in Washington, said that Virginia, in effect, paid AOL for something it would have done even without the incentive.
Theoretically, the Internet data centers could be anywhere, but most customers want personal contact with the people they depend on. Web-hosting companies offer them regular software updates, duplicate power sources and backup capabilities, protecting them from service interruptions. Mr. Mazerov said that while many states were eager to win Internet business, most were not offering tax incentives.
But New Jersey, which has poured millions of dollars into programs to attract and retain high-tech companies, has a $40-million-a-year tax incentive program for start-up companies, and has exempted telecommunications companies like CNBC from paying sales tax for its equipment. "Quite frankly, we would like to keep sales tax exemptions as limited as possible," said Bernard Kornmehl, the assistant New Jersey state treasurer for tax policy. "The more you have, the more you narrow your base, and that will result in less revenue."
Connecticut, which has been gradually lowering its corporate business tax, is no longer inclined to modify its tax laws for the benefit of specific industries, said Ellen R. Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services.
But Michael D. Freedman, Global Crossing's lobbyist, said that in the current climate, in which companies like his were besieged by incentives from other states, New York's tax proposal showed that the state was not tied exclusively to the old economy.
"New York," he said, "is standing out on the information highway and showing a little leg."

HEADLINE: Pondering Greenspan's Next Moves

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is all but certain to raise its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point on Tuesday, to 6 percent. That much Alan Greenspan has made clear in his public statements.
What is less clear is the central bank chairman's thinking about the forces that are driving him to tighten monetary policy. 
 In Congressional testimony and speeches, Mr. Greenspan has left economists and investors scratching their heads by seeming to assert that the increase in the growth rate of productivity -- almost universally considered to be the most unambiguously positive development in the nation's recent economic history -- is now to be blamed for causing inflation.
And although the riches generated by Wall Street's bull run have been reaped by relatively few people, Mr. Greenspan seems to have concluded that the stock market is the primary channel through which inflation is being transmitted throughout the economy. Never mind that even Mr. Greenspan cannot find much inflation.
It may be months or years before it will be possible to judge whether Mr. Greenspan is doing the right thing for the right reasons. Some economists think the Fed chairman is taking a straightforward situation -- an economy that is growing too fast for its own good -- and overanalyzing the causes.
Others think Mr. Greenspan is creating an elaborate justification for raising rates to mask a desire to bring down the stock market. And it is possible that Mr. Greenspan is deliberately sowing confusion to keep investors off balance and avoid a further run-up in stock prices.
The markets seem to have picked up his basic message that Tuesday's rate increase is unlikely to be the last, given the persistent strength of the economy. And while aspects of his thinking remain veiled, interviews with economists and Fed officials, as well as a close reading of Mr. Greenspan's statements over the last few months, help to bring his views into focus on critical issues including productivity, the stock market and the scale of the changes the economy is undergoing.
Yes, Mr. Greenspan sees the surge in productivity growth as a root cause of the imbalances that threaten the long expansion. By driving up profit expectations, productivity growth drives stock prices higher, leaving investors feeling rich and willing to spend. In the short run, at least, the growth in demand exceeds the growth in the economy's ability to provide offsetting increases in supply, creating the potential for inflationary bottlenecks.
But Mr. Greenspan has also tried to point out that the same productivity-driven forces that send stock prices and consumer spending up have a countervailing effect that helps dampen the economy.
Because increased productivity implies higher rates of return on investment, productivity improvements lead to a rise in demand for capital to take advantage of those returns. That in turn puts upward pressure on interest rates in the financial markets, slowing growth.
"Although Chairman Greenspan has taken a lot of flak for posing the inflation threat in the context of productivity's demand-side effects, the chairman's larger point often seems overlooked," economists at Salomon Smith Barney wrote earlier this month. "The most basic source of upward pressure on interest rates is the market itself."
That leaves the Fed in the role of validating what the bond market is already doing: making it more expensive for corporations and consumers to borrow money. Mr. Greenspan's favorite indicator of interest rates is not the yield on government securities, but the Standard & Poor's BBB corporate debt rate, adjusted for inflation expectations. By that figure, rates are up a full percentage point over the last year or so.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan, who is viewed as all but omnipotent by investors around the world, seems to see his role in the current climate as merely surfing in the wake of the debt markets rather than leading them. That implies that, barring a surge in inflation or a sharp drop in the unemployment rate, Mr. Greenspan is likely to stick to his preference for incremental quarter-point rate increases rather than grabbing the attention of the markets through half-point increases.
"Market forces, not the Federal Reserve, are driving up interest rates to close the gap between supply and demand for funds," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last month. "We at the Federal Reserve are acting in conjunction with the market and responding to it."
Mr. Greenspan sees the stock market as the mechanism through which productivity gains are transformed into wealth and increased demand. But if he is to be taken at his word -- and some investors have their doubts -- he does not seem to be worried so much about any particular market index as he is about aggregate wealth creation across the economy, including the substantial wealth being generated by rising home values. When they look at stocks, Fed officials tend to watch the Wilshire 5,000, which captures the broad movement of nearly all equity capital.
Mr. Greenspan has not shown much concern either about the way in which "old economy" Dow Jones industrial stocks and "new economy" Nasdaq stocks often seem to be moving in opposite directions, as they did again today, with the Nasdaq down sharply and the Dow up.
The Fed chairman seems to have concluded that the upheaval in the market represents a perhaps understandably confused effort by investors to determine where returns are highest at a time of mind-boggling technological change.
Investors in technology companies in particular, "not comfortable dealing with discontinuous shifts in economic structure, are groping for the appropriate valuations for these companies," Mr. Greenspan told a conference in Boston earlier this month.
More than most policy makers, Mr. Greenspan has a keen sense of history. In the last few years, he has frequently described the current combination of healthy growth, low inflation, low unemployment and surging productivity as "unprecedented in my half century of observing the American economy."
But lately, Mr. Greenspan has gone even further, stating that technology is driving the economy into a transformation so fundamental that there is nothing to compare it to.
This type of economy is "one that none of us has ever seen before, and indeed it may be unprecedented in our history," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last month.
"The type of policy we have to devise has to reflect the nature of how the new economy is working," he said. "A number of the old tools which we relied upon don't have relevance to this."
Translation: Even Mr. Greenspan is not sure that traditional monetary policy can be counted on to work as it has in the past, disconcerting, perhaps, to those who assume the Fed chairman has it all under control.

HEADLINE: Hall of Justice, Source of Conflict;
Dispute Rages Over Future of Vacant Bronx Courthouse

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
Yolanda Garcia wants justice. She also wants the massive 1914 Beaux-Arts structure that Justice, the statue, is sitting on.
The statue's seat is the historic Bronx Borough Courthouse, a hulking trapezoidal building that stands out like an oblique monolith in the Melrose neighborhood that surrounds it. 
 The building, with its ornate interior, terrazzo floors, marble staircases and granite facade, has gone through a couple of inglorious incarnations since it stopped serving as the hub of Bronx civic life in the 1930's: first and unofficially as an adjunct courthouse and sometime storage building, second and unofficially as a pigeon coop.
In 1978, it was abandoned by the city. Then, in 1993, the pigeons were chased out and the doors locked for good.
But when Ms. Garcia, the executive director of Nos Quedamos (We Stay), looks at the shuttered courthouse, she sees the center of Melrose's rebirth. Nos Quedamos, one of the grass-roots groups responsible for large-scale urban renewal in Melrose, has been trying to secure the courthouse as a kind of town center since 1993.
But the city has twice sold it to private developers, who never actually redeveloped the site. Now, the second set of private owners has put the courthouse on the market for $1.8 million, after buying it two years ago for $300,000.
The sale has triply infuriated neighborhood advocates like Ms. Garcia and Bronx political leaders, who maintain that the property, which was designated a historic city landmark in 1981, never should have been sold to private developers in the first place.
So Nos Quedamos has once again set its sights on reclaiming the building, hoping to persuade the landlord to sell it to them for about $300,000, which the group plans to raise privately. It wants to renovate the courthouse and reopen it as a community center to serve families returning to the neighborhood, with a public library, a small museum and community meeting rooms for various events.
In her battle to reclaim the building, Ms. Garcia takes inspiration from Lady Justice.
"If you look at her," Ms. Garcia said, "she's not standing, she's not blindfolded, and she doesn't have a scale. She holds a sword.
"She's in the Bronx, after all. She knew she had to defend herself."
For the city's part, Denise Collins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, said that it was not uncommon for the city to sell landmarks and that the courthouse was simply too costly to maintain.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, declined to comment on the building's status.
Henry Weinstein, secretary of Liberty Square Realty, a real estate development company based in Queens, which bought the courthouse two years ago, said his company had advertised the building for $1.8 million, but he was not yet certain if they would sell it. He said he was considering a variety of options, including leasing some of the space to television studios that have expressed "strong interest" in using it to shoot dramas based in New York.
"If we don't figure out anything else, we'll probably use it as a warehouse, clean it out and rent it to someone," he said.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, criticized both the Giuliani administration and Liberty Square for failing to make good on promises that the building would be restored and reopened.
"The administration made all of these big promises that this was going to be redeveloped," Mr. Ferrer said. "Now, he's trying to sell it. Why? Because he can't do it. It turns out this guy is nothing more than a speculator. Let's see -- should we give a real estate speculator a $1.5 million windfall for speculating on our property?"
Ms. Garcia said the last thing neighborhood residents want on the property is a warehouse. Nos Quedamos is building about 1,700 new housing units on 65 development sites on the 35 contiguous blocks as part of a sprawling urban renewal project called Melrose Commons. She envisions the courthouse, on East 161st Street and Third Avenue, near the eastern edge of Melrose Commons, as its hub.
So does Mr. Ferrer, who said that since the administration of Edward I. Koch, he had regularly asked the city to lease him part of the courthouse for his headquarters.
"If we got that back," Mr. Ferrer said, "that whole Third Avenue corridor would experience a revival: coffee shops, restaurants, dry cleaners, all the services people need in the area."
He said development of Melrose was the last frontier of revitalization of the South Bronx. The neighborhood was, in a sense, also the borough's first frontier. Since its conception, the Bronx Borough Courthouse has been a symbol of the borough's struggle for its own identity.
At the turn of the last century, Bronx residents had to travel to Lower Manhattan to settle legal matters, because the borough was not an independent county. But the borough president at the time, Louis F. Haffen, felt so confident that it would be granted county status that in 1905, he asked Michael J. Garvin, an engineer, and the Beaux-Arts painter and architect Oscar Bluemner to design a structure that might accommodate a county court system.
The gamble paid off. When Bronx County was finally born, on Jan. 1, 1914, the elaborate inaugural ceremony was held at the newly completed courthouse.
The courthouse quickly became a hub of Bronx civic life. But because it had only one courtroom, and the Bronx's population exploded rapidly, it was supplanted by a new court on the Grand Concourse and operations were transferred to other civic courts in the 1930's and 40's.
The building was briefly used as storage for Works Project Administration artwork, said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. It was also used as an adjunct courthouse. But throughout the 80's, it was vacant and became an enormous pigeon coop.
In the early 1990's, Nos Quedamos and other neighborhood groups pressured the city to seal the building's windows, repair its roof and bolt its doors to protect its interior.
Ms. Garcia said they then raised about $6 million to support a library, a small museum and after-school programs at the building, provided they could secure a lease. When the city ignored their pleas and put the building up for sale, Nos Quedamos joined the bidding, but lost out to Liberty Square.
Mr. Weinstein of Liberty Square said he was somewhat perturbed by Ms. Garcia's persistence. "They feel they have some divine right to that building," he said. "I know they live in that neighborhood, but people live in a lot of neighborhoods."
He said that he and Benjamin Klein, the president of the company, bought the building because they were enchanted by its architecture, just as they did with several other historic buildings they had bought in Brooklyn, like the Old Town Printing building and the Knox hat factory.
"We wanted to figure out some viable development strategy to bring the building back to its former grandeur," Mr. Weinstein said. In response to the accusation that he had purchased the building simply to make a profit, Mr. Weinstein laughed. "There are plenty of things I could have put my money into, like Microsoft stock, that I could have made more money from."
The company continues to seek retailers or other businesses that would like to develop the space, but has not had much luck.
Mario Procida, president of Procida Realty and Construction Corporation, has put money into the area -- enough to renovate 265 condominiums three blocks from the courthouse in 1994 -- and is working on another housing development, Plaza de los Angeles, 35 three-family homes with Peter Stand and Magnus Magnusson, and Nos Quedamos.
He said the perils of building in the neighborhood were no different today than they were two years ago, when Liberty Square bought the courthouse.
Mr. Weinstein said he would be happy to work with Nos Quedamos to come up with a development plan to suit both groups. "We're very curious, because we would like to work with them if there's some way of working with them," he said. "But I feel they're not taking legitimate steps to develop this building. If they want to develop it, I'm the one they have to come to, not somebody else."
Ms. Garcia said she had made at least 10 phone calls to Liberty Square since they advertised the property, and said she had given the owners the blueprints for their plan, but the company had not responded.
Ronald Shiffman, director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development and a former city planning commissioner who has been involved with the courthouse issue, said he was confident Nos Quedamos would get another shot at developing the property.
"It doesn't seem like anyone who buys it privately will be able to generate enough income to offset the costs of renovation," he said, "so eventually it will come back to the city's hands. And it will probably come back when there's a more sympathetic administration."
For the time being, the courthouse remains shuttered. On the back facade, three heroic French faces stare out across a barren highway leading to the Throgs Neck Bridge. The combined forces of pollution and rain have made black streaks like tears down the faces.
"It's one of the great tragedies of the world," said Michael Henry Adams, a historic preservationist who has studied the building. "It was intact and beautiful so recently. And now it's undergone this protracted neglect because people are squabbling, and the community is suffering and the building is suffering."

This Is a Test

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Four years ago, I pointed out that no two countries that both had McDonald's had ever fought a war against each other since they each got their McDonald's. I drew from that what I called "The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention," which stated that once your country became a McDonald's country, it meant your people didn't like to fight wars anymore; they preferred instead to wait in line for burgers. 
 The Golden Arches Theory had nothing to do with the power of burgers. I was simply using it to illustrate that while globalization and economic integration -- symbolized by the spread of McDonald's -- could not end geopolitics and war, they were clearly having a restraining effect on aggressive nations (in addition to classical military deterrence), because the costs of war for globalized nations were now so much greater.
Well, the Golden Arches Theory is now about to get its first real test: China versus Taiwan. These are two separate countries, each obsessed with asserting its own national identity, but each now woven to the other -- and to the rest of the world -- by a web of economic interests (and 578 McDonald's) so profound and far-reaching that if this web can't restrain them, then nothing will.
Consider the following: Some 40 percent of all Chinese exports go to the U.S. Over 25 percent of China's G.D.P. comes from foreign trade; Taiwanese companies have invested $40 billion in factories on Mainland China; China is fast becoming one of the most Internet-wired countries in the world. Taiwanese factories are the leading suppliers in the world of 13 key parts that go into every computer or Internet router. In many cases, Taiwan is the only supplier of certain key computer parts. The whole global computer supply chain would be disrupted by a war over Taiwan. (Bye-bye, Nasdaq.)
In short, it's hard to find two more globally, and mutually, dependent countries. But it's also hard to find two countries more viscerally committed to their own particular national identities and to the flourishing of their own particular roots and branches. Communist China covets Taiwan -- in order to complete the historic reunification of China now that Hong Kong and Macao have been reintegrated. And Taiwan's election has brought to power there for the first time a leader who represents the yearning of Taiwanese to govern themselves and to never again be ruled by others.
China can't shoot Taiwan without shooting itself. Taiwan can't pull away from China without pulling its own economy down. And any sharp move by either will destabilize the world. That's what globalization is all about. Think about it: Americans will not (and should not) stand by and watch Taiwan, a country shaped in our own image, be snuffed out by Beijing. A China that invades Taiwan is a China that can forget about selling goods in America for a long time. It's a China that can forget about joining the World Trade Organization.
Will rationality prevail? The problem with Beijing, Taiwan and Washington, says the China scholar Mike Oksenberg, is that "each assumes that economic rationality will prevail in the other two capitals, and that the other two will understand the political pressures in its own capital and therefore cut it some slack."
That's a dangerous assumption. China scholars note that when China's progressive prime minister, Zhu Rongji, threatened Taiwan last week against making any move toward independence, there was a certain pleading quality to it -- almost as though Mr. Zhu was saying: "Don't you guys understand? I'm sitting on a powderkeg." The whole scene echoed that day in 1989 when the Chinese leader at the time, Zhao Ziyang, went to Tiananmen Square and pleaded, with tears in his eyes, for the students to leave, because he knew what demons lurked inside his own Politburo.
Well, those demons -- those Chinese leaders whose motto is "When in doubt, use force" -- are still there. But China has become a real McDonald's country since. And this is a test of whose logic will prevail. There is a war just waiting to be fought in the Taiwan Strait. But there is also a Nobel Peace Prize just waiting to be won there -- waiting for the statesman who can persuade the parties that precisely because they can't live without each other, they have to find a new way to live with each other.
I repeat: This is a test.

HEADLINE: Carmakers to Alter S.U.V.'s to Reduce Riskto Other Autos

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 20

 BODY:
Acknowledging for the first time that sport utility vehicles pose special dangers to other motorists in crashes, automakers say that they are modifying the designs of these vehicles to make them less hazardous.
General Motors says it will make the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada, GMC Envoy and Chevrolet Blazer with steel rails up to 2 inches lower inside their underbodies than in current versions, to reduce the risk of their overriding cars' bumpers and doorsills. Ford Motor plans to do the same for its Explorer, Expedition and Lincoln Navigator over the next two model years. 
 DaimlerChrysler says it is making several changes to the Dodge Durango's front end for the 2002 model year to make it less likely to override cars in collisions.
Foreign automakers are also designing their sport utility vehicles to make them less likely to kill or injure occupants of other vehicles in crashes. When the Toyota Sequoia goes on sale this autumn, it will be equipped with impact-absorbing hollow bars below the bumpers to keep it from riding over cars in collisions. Ford recently added that feature to its huge Excursion as well.
Nissan has just reinforced the bumpers on the 2001 Pathfinder, with the goal of spreading the force of an impact over a wider area of the struck vehicle, and plans further changes in coming years. Honda and Mitsubishi say they also plan design changes, although they declined to release any details yet.
Some of the changes, like the bars on the Toyota Sequoia, are being made purely for the safety of other motorists. Engineers say some of the other changes are partly for safety and partly to improve fuel economy, ride and handling: midsize G.M. sport utilities like the Envoy, for example, will no longer share underbodies with pickup trucks, so they can be built with lower, lighter, less stiff frames that provide a more cushioned ride. Other changes are being made not to the sport utilities but to cars, like adding side air bags.
Even sport utility vehicles with the alterations will continue to pose risks to other motorists. They will remain considerably heavier than cars. And they will still have high hoods that cause more damage and injuries when striking cars from the side. Current sport utilities are almost three times as likely as cars to kill the other driver in a crash.
But after bitterly denying for three years that the design of sport utility vehicles made them unusually deadly to other motorists, auto industry officials now say that their designs cause up to half the extra deaths, and are swiftly making changes.
"As the vehicle mix between pickups, minivans, vans, S.U.V.'s and cars has shifted in the U.S., automakers have recognized the importance of vehicle-to-vehicle crash compatibility," the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the Washington-based trade group for domestic and foreign companies, said in a statement. "Tremendous progress has been made in a very short time."
The manufacturers' safety engineers say these changes will not affect the safety of occupants of sport utility vehicles. Mounting the heaviest, stiffest parts of sport utility vehicles lower in their underbodies, probably through new suspension designs, should make the vehicles more stable and less prone to rolling over, they say.
Sport utility vehicles have fewer impact-absorbing "crumple zones" and roll over more often than cars when they strike curbs, guardrails and other automobiles. So occupants of sport utility vehicles have roughly the same overall death rate as car occupants, despite faring well in head-on collisions with cars.
A federal study estimated last year that the designs of sport utilities were causing almost 1,000 unnecessary deaths a year in other vehicles. Dr. Hans Joksch, a longtime University of Michigan traffic safety expert who oversaw that study, estimated that the design changes now being made would eventually save 100 to 300 of these lives annually. But this improvement in safety will take time, he cautioned, because so many sport utilities have already been manufactured without the design changes and will remain on the road.
Automakers plan to mount the stiffest, heaviest, most dangerous parts of sport utilities' frames lower in the vehicles without affecting their ground clearance. This will require suspension changes, including adjustable-height suspensions in some models that will automatically lower the vehicles' bodies except when four-wheel drive is engaged at very low speeds. This could add up to $1,500 to the cost of models like the Lincoln Navigator, on which profit margins approach $15,000.
Maintaining ground clearance will allow off-road enthusiasts to keep using them for traversing swamps and mountain trails, and will insure that sport utilities continue to qualify for more lenient fuel-economy regulation than cars, using a regulatory exemption for off-road vehicles.
Automakers have concluded that small sport utility vehicles, like the Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee, pose less risk to other motorists, and are not changing them.
Automakers are also modifying pickup designs, with Ford and Toyota adding the same bars below the bumpers of the Ford Super Duty and Toyota Tundra that they are putting on the Excursion and Sequoia.
The auto industry's once-monolithic opposition to rules governing vehicles' overall design has shattered in recent months. Toyota, Nissan and Renault have begun calling for international regulations to make passenger vehicles more compatible in crashes. General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler say that some coordination of design is needed but that this can be done by forming industry partnerships, although G.M. and DaimlerChrysler say that there may someday be a role for government regulation, too.
If automakers start sharing information about the height, stiffness and shape of future models, without actually sharing the vehicles' design and appearance, more progress can be made in improving vehicle safety, said Terry Connolly, G.M.'s director for North American vehicle safety. "Some sort of long-term guidance is going to be necessary," either from an industry group or from governments, he said, adding that G.M. had recently finished extensive computer modeling and crash tests of what happens when sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and vans hit cars, and had voluntarily shared the results with many other automakers.
Shinichi Kato, Toyota's executive vice president for worldwide vehicle development and a powerful member of the Tokyo-based automaker's board, said regulations would make it easier for his company to decide how best to address the problem. "Compatibility is not something that is covered by vehicle regulation; eventually, it will be involved in regulation," he said in an interview.
Federal regulators, who performed their first crash test of a sport utility vehicle into a car in 1998, say they do not yet know enough about vehicle compatibility to draft regulations. But Dr. Ricardo Martinez, who was the nation's top traffic safety regulator for six years before stepping down last autumn, said that there had been an extraordinary change in attitudes in the auto industry, and that automakers could now be trusted to make design changes even without regulation.
Dr. Martinez said that when he began warning about the dangers of sport utilities in early 1998, "the industry was so upset you would have thought we shot their dog."
The auto industry is also helping the federal government pay for medical research into ways to care for survivors of crashes involving different types of automobiles, particularly car occupants hit from the side by sport utilities. Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein, the medical director of the government's Miami-based Crash Injury Research Engineering Network, said hospitals around the country were starting to report more injuries to the head, neck and heart during side-impact crashes because of the high front ends of sport utility vehicles and pickups.
Emergency medical teams in the Miami area are now being told to bring all survivors of serious side-impact crashes to trauma centers, particularly if they have been hit by sport utilities and even if the survivors, unaware of internal bleeding, insist that they are fine. Preliminary results from this experiment show that it is already saving lives, and it may be expanded nationwide, Dr. Augenstein said.
Design changes in sport utility vehicles reflect a recent effort by automakers to understand how vehicles of different sizes and shapes interact in crashes. During the Society of Automotive Engineers convention here two weeks ago, there was a full day of presentations of technical papers on the problem by researchers from all over the world. A similar number of papers was presented last year; by contrast, no such papers were presented as recently as the convention in early 1997.
Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and environmental engineering, said that with seatbelt use increasing and drunken driving on the decline, incompatibility between vehicles in crashes was one of the most serious safety issues still facing the auto industry, and could be addressed to a significant extent through design changes. "We have made considerable progress, and we will make more," she said.
Sales of sport utility vehicles soared through the 1990's, with growth peaking in 1996. Automakers have been more cautious in switching factories over to production of sport utility vehicles since 1997, when safety and environmental concerns began to be raised about the vehicles. The big vehicles' share of the market has been gradually leveling off since 1996 as a result, despite very low gasoline prices in 1998 and early 1999 that otherwise might have stimulated sales slightly.
Much higher gasoline prices this year have not yet slowed sales, mainly because sport utility vehicles are bought mostly by upper-income families for whom an extra $10 a week is not a big problem. Changing an automobile design takes at least one year and often two or three; the sport utility changes are a result of extensive research showing safety improvements are possible, rather than a response to rising gas prices, auto engineers said.
Engineers at the convention predicted that as designs improve for new sport utilities, concern would shift to the millions already on the road with less safe designs.
Alan Thebert, a retired G.M. safety engineer and chairman of the auto engineers' crash testing committee, warned at the convention that the problem of used sport utilities is "going to get worse, and we do have to be aware of it and do something about it."

HEADLINE: Student Drug Death, Arrests and Illnesses Shock College in Hartford

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 20

 BODY:
By 7:30 a.m. last Friday, the first day of spring break at Trinity College, a small private school atop a gentle hillside here, had already begun spinning terribly out of control.
The police had just picked up William B. Bachman, a Trinity senior, after he ran his car into a fire hydrant, and took him to a West Hartford hospital to be treated for possible drug ingestion. Within hours, Mr. Bachman's roommate, Joshua B. Eaves, arrived, also with what looked like a drug-induced illness, the police said. At 12:24 p.m., a third roommate, Josh Doroff of Harrison, N.Y., was carried unconscious by three friends into the hospital's emergency room, where doctors pronounced him dead. 
 In their dormitory room minutes later, the police found a fourth roommate, Clement Kaupp 3rd, lying unconscious, also apparently suffering from an overdose of drugs. After spending three days in critical condition perilously close to death, Mr. Kaupp regained consciousness today, and his condition had stabilized, the police said.
By all accounts, Mr. Kaupp, 22, of Mendham, N.J., is lucky to be alive. According to one of the three surviving roommates, the four had begun celebrating their weeklong vacation by taking various amounts of heroin and prescription drugs, including Xanax, an antianxiety medication; Valium; butalbital, which is prescribed for migraines, and sleeping pills, said Dr. Mary McCormick, the administrative director of the Connecticut Poison Control Center. The police say the men may also have been drinking.
"You take any one of those drugs and they will depress the central nervous system," Dr. McCormick said. "You introduce alcohol to that mix and you've got a pretty potent combination that could induce a coma."
On Saturday, Mr. Bachman, of South Natick, Mass., and Mr. Eaves, of Dowington, Pa., were arrested on felony drug possession charges, according to State Superior Court records. Mr. Eaves was released after he posted a $20,000 surety bond; Mr. Bachman, who was also charged with driving while intoxicated, paid a $25,000 bond in cash, records show.
Both men are to be arraigned on March 31 in Superior Court, a spokeswoman in the court clerk's office said. Mr. Kaupp, who was "up and walking around" by this afternoon, is likely to face felony drug charges, Sergeant Huertas said.
If the death of Mr. Doroff, a popular senior majoring in economics, stunned Trinity's 1,900 students, most of whom are now on their spring break, news of their drug-laden night of partying has left school officials issuing urgent calls to students to stay away from drugs and alcohol.
On Saturday, less than 24 hours after Mr. Doroff was pronounced dead, college administrators sent out urgent e-mail and voice mail messages to all students, and mailed letters to each student's home address, informing students and their parents about the incident, said Linda S. Campanella, Trinity's senior vice president.
Officials also sent employees Saturday to each of the college's 990 dormitory rooms to check on students, even waking them to ensure that they were all right.
The Hartford police and the Hartford state's attorney are investigating where and how the four students acquired the drugs. A weekend search of their living quarters, in a red-brick high-rise south of the Trinity campus, revealed residue of several substances, said Sgt. Norberto A. Huertas, a commander in the major crimes department of the Hartford police. He would not elaborate, but he did say, "Heroin was involved in this incident."
Today, in several interviews on and off the Trinity campus, students said drugs were a common ingredient at many parties.
"There's a lot of recreational drug use on campus," said Michelle Fabiani, 18, a freshman from Wallingford, Conn. "Trinity is kind of like a rich kid's school, so kids may have more money to buy drugs." Tuition is $31,380 a year.
Ben Fay, a former Trinity computer science student who is now a pharmacy technician in Hartford, said Ritalin, a stimulant, had long been popular at the school, either as a study aid or as a recreational drug. "They just sort of chop it up and snort it like cocaine," he said today.
Mr. Fay said that three years ago, when he was a freshman, he caught a student trying to sell Mr. Fay's cache of 100 five-milligram tablets of Ritalin stolen from Mr. Fay's room. The pills went for $5 apiece.
But Trinity officials, who have begun efforts in recent months to crack down on alcohol-related infractions on campus, said drugs had not been a problem among students, almost all of whom live on campus.
"A dreaded possibility became reality," Ms. Campanella said. "I don't want to sound defensive, but this is something that could have happened on any campus."
"I think other campuses and other towns will pay attention to this," she added. "Kids here and everywhere feel a certain invulnerability, and they take risks. These kids took a veritable cocktail."
Mr. Doroff is the second Trinity student to die in the last seven months. Last September, Herme Ortiz, 17, a freshman, died from head injuries after a fistfight with another student as they were leaving an alcohol-free party on campus.
The police said their investigation into how Mr. Doroff died had been frustrated by the refusal of his three roommates -- Mr. Bachman, Mr. Eaves and Mr. Kaupp -- to discuss what happened.
"We're not getting any cooperation from these kids at all," Sergeant Huertas said.
On Saturday, Mr. Doroff was buried in Mount Vernon, N.Y., said a spokeswoman for his father, H. Frank Doroff, an executive vice president for merchandising at Bloomingdale's in New York City.
Jeffrey Sherman, the president of Bloomingdale's and a friend of the Doroff family for a decade, described young Josh as polite, athletic and intelligent, from a close-knit family, and a man who did not, as far as anyone knew, dabble in drugs.
"In all of those years, I've never known this to be a problem with Josh," said Mr. Sherman, whose three sons attended the Rye Country Day School with Mr. Doroff.
"There clearly was no sign of any of this to me, he said. "Any parent would have been proud to have Josh as their son, which just adds to the shock of it all."

The World Trade Organization has agreed to set up a dispute resolution panel to settle Japan's complaint that United States antidumping penalties for steel imports violate global trading rules. The United States imposed penalties against Japanese hot-rolled steel imports, which Washington said were sold in the American market at prices so low they threatened domestic producers. Efforts by Japan and the United States to resolve the issue failed, and Japan asked for W.T.O. intervention. The panel will have six months to arrive at a finding. Elizabeth Olson

HEADLINE: U.S. Welfare Limit May Put Thousands in Albany's Care

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 20

 BODY:
As tens of thousands of welfare recipients in New York face the prospect of losing their eligibility for federal benefits next year, new figures indicate that many who remain on the rolls are unable to support themselves, meaning that the state may ultimately have to pick up the huge costs of providing for them.
More than 40 percent of the families on welfare in New York have been on the rolls for five years or more, the new state figures show, posing the most daunting challenge yet in the state's ambitious drive to push people off public assistance into self-sufficiency. 
 Many of those who remain, state figures show, also have serious problems, like poor education, mental illness, alcoholism and drug addiction, making them difficult to employ, even in these robust economic times.
Over the last five years, the state has achieved one of the sharpest caseload reductions in the nation, slashing the number of people on welfare by 539,000, or 42.6 percent, with a series of new policies intended to nudge them into jobs. Roughly 726,500 parents and children remain on the rolls. But now, with the most employable people already off the rolls, state officials are facing what they acknowledge may be the toughest test of the welfare policies championed by everyone from President Clinton on down to Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The emerging portrait of New York's welfare population comes at a crucial time. The national welfare overhaul adopted in 1996 limits recipients to no more than five years of federal aid. That means that tens of thousands of recipients in New York could lose their federal benefits starting in late 2001. Nationwide, there are 6.8 million individuals on the federal rolls, and they too face the same time limits.
The situation has led some state officials and experts on poverty issues to conclude that the most challenging task lies ahead in the overall effort to reshape welfare in New York. It also increases the prospect that New York taxpayers will have to pick up tens of millions of dollars in welfare costs once the federal time limits take hold, because state law says the state cannot simply let those people fend for themselves.
"New York has done an awful lot to help families get off the welfare rolls," said Karen Schimke, the executive director of the State Communities Aid Association, an advocacy group for the poor. "But the ones who remain on the rolls are very difficult to serve if the goal is to make them self-sufficient. The question is what is New York going to do about them."
It is not as though the state has not been preparing for this. Over all, the state is spending 21 percent more per case than it did in 1995; put another way, the state spends $11,300 a year on a mother and two children today, compared with $9,300 for the same size family five years ago. Much of the increase is for child care, a critical component in helping single parents obtain and keep jobs.
In addition, the state is providing other benefits to encourage recipients to keep working. For instance, in the past welfare recipients frequently lost their government subsidized child care after leaving the rolls, but now the state provides coverage for up to a year after their cases close.
The state is also permitting recipients to earn more money before being dropped from the welfare rolls. State records show that in late 1995, 6 percent of families with children who received federal assistance also had some earned income, but that now 15 percent have earned income. For those who were earning money, the average amount has risen to $629 a month now, from $476 in late 1995.
The state has also expanded its earned-income tax credit, so that low-wage earners can keep more of their income before beginning to pay taxes. In fact, New York has the most generous earned-income tax credit in the nation, according to the State Communities Aid Association, which is based in New York. State officials estimate that, when combined with a similar federal earned-income tax credit, the state's credit is worth $2 an hour for a person with a full-time minimum-wage job.
New York welfare officials say that these policies enable recipients to establish a firm footing in a job before they are removed from welfare and left to fend for themselves. "We are ramping people up into the economy," said Daniel Hogan, the executive deputy commissioner for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. "It used to be that when a recipient earned a certain level of income, they were dropped from the rolls and sometimes left on their own. But that's no longer the case."
All in all, New York's caseload continues to decline at a remarkable rate; an average of 2,600 cases, or 7,800 individuals, came off the rolls monthly in 1999. But state and local officials are increasingly seeing recipients with a variety of problems that make them difficult to employ.
The state cannot describe in great detail the scope and range of the problems plaguing those individuals who have been left on the rolls. That is largely because much of the information is supplied by the recipients themselves, who are often reluctant to talk about issues like domestic violence, drug abuse and alcoholism.
But the information state officials have gathered is troubling to many advocates for the poor. More than half of those on the rolls lack a high school education; 14 percent of those on the rolls got no further than completing junior high school. At least 25 percent of the total are estimated to have drug or alcohol abuse problems that could interfere with their ability to hold a job. And 8 percent of the total have sought treatment for mental illnesses, although state officials believe that figure does not reflect the prevalence of such problems.
It is recipients with such problems that will be the greatest test of the new welfare policies, especially over the next year and a half, as the federal time limit nears. In New York at this point, there are 226,000 families on Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, the main federal welfare program, who face the five-year lifetime limit on benefits. As a rule of thumb, each family represents three welfare recipients, typically a mother and two children.
Of those families, 52,000, or 23 percent, have been on welfare less than a year, according to state figures, and 79,000, or 35 percent have one to five years on the rolls.
Then comes the remarkable statistical bulge: 94,000 families, or 42 percent of the total, have been on welfare for five years or more, indicating a large problem. The federal law does allow the state to exempt 20 percent of its caseload from the five-year limit at the time they take effect in late 2001, but many experts say that will not be nearly enough.
In the end, New York does not intend to abandon needy people who exhaust their eligibility for federal assistance. Instead, it will place them in a locally and state-financed program known as Safety Net. But state and local officials worry about the future cost of that program, given that the caseload could ultimately increase. In 1999 alone, the program cost state and local governments roughly $500 million, paying benefits to 133,000 people.
The state acknowledges that it must come up with new ways of serving the more troubled recipients.
The governor, for example, has asked the Legislature for an additional $36 million a year for drug and alcohol treatment, which would bring the total amount the state spends on such services to $48 million annually. The state is also seeking to provide $125 million to help local caseworkers shift from the traditional job of processing welfare applications to a more complicated one: assessing what services they need to get jobs and stay off public assistance.
The state has even created a new agency that is charged with consolidating a host of benefit programs, from traditional welfare grants to child care and transportation. The goal is to replace handouts with programs for training and jobs.
Mr. Hogan, the executive deputy commissioner for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, summed up the state's task this way: "We have a philosophical and fiscal incentive to reduce the caseload. Not only is it the right thing to do, but we recognize that the federal support will be ending."

HEADLINE: Big Day Spoiled for Bangladesh Villagers

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: JOYPURA, Bangladesh, March 20

 BODY:
Of all the distant villages, in all the poor countries, in all the third world, President Bill Clinton was supposed to visit theirs.
And, sitting on a cane stool under a 150-year-old banyan tree, with songbirds trilling and the press taking notes, he was to talk with the peasants of Joypura. 
 It was to be Mr. Clinton's rare chance to hear from people of the Bangladeshi soil and, in turn, their implausible opportunity to rub elbows with a man of global power.
But at the last minute, today's visit was canceled -- and the villagers, plucked from obscurity only to be thrust back again, were crushed.
"It is terribly sad because we were expecting so much," said Rokeya Begum, a young mother. "We thought he would talk to us, and we would get to know each other. We thought he would hear our problems and he would tell us the solutions."
The bad news arrived before dawn as people were doing the final preening after weeks of preparation. Security was said to be to blame. The United States Secret Service had decided that the 28-mile excursion from Dhaka, the capital, by helicopter, would be dangerous. "We had specific information which led us to conclude that travel to the village was inadvisable," said Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser.
Mr. Clinton also canceled a stop to the National Memorial where world leaders traditionally pay homage to the three million people killed in Bangladesh's war of independence against Pakistan in 1971. Despite the American claims of security problems, Bangladeshis are likely to be insulted by the perceived slight.
This sudden shift in scheduling provided an ominous start to the president's five-day visit to South Asia. Bangladesh was supposed to provide an untroubled destination before the president went on to India, where he arrived tonight, and Pakistan.
But if Bill Clinton could not go to Joypura, the Americans enthusiastically counterproposed, Joypura could come to him. Buses with hundreds of villagers -- mostly women and children were brought to Dhaka. The people were happy for the journey, but it was not the same.
In the last few days, 10,000 people had flooded into Joypura -- four times the village's population. It was simply amazing for them all to imagine the president of the United States actually among them, walking beside the haystacks and the cow sheds and the duck ponds.
"I am so sad now," said Alam Ali, who was using a crowbar to tear down a modest grandstand that had been built near the banyan tree. "This whole area would have grown rich. Bill Clinton could have made this happen. He is a very great man, you know."
The president is presumed to be the bearer of the magic wand of American wealth. And, indeed, before the day was over, he announced several aid packages to Bangladesh, including $97 million for food and $8.6 million toward the reduction of child labor. People in Joypura seemed to believe that he would hear their hopeful words and see their hard work and come away determined to rescue them from the undertow of poverty.
Muhammad Yasin Sheik, 45, had trekked from a nearby village, holding the useless deed to his perished land. Last year, the mighty Jamuna River had changed course and swallowed his farm. He hoped that Mr. Clinton would take pity and give him money. "We are starving," he said plainly. "Bill Clinton can do something about that."
Unlike most others, who spoke only Bangla, Mr. Sheik knew some English. He pointed to the white prayer cap on his head, showing he was a religious man.
"We always pray to Allah that Bill Clinton remains in good health," he said eagerly. "And we also pray that his wife, who is in an election, wins a great victory."
Joypura had been selected for the president's first visit to Bangladesh because there were success stories here. This is a storm-ravaged nation of 128 million people with a per capita income of only $289. But the nation's war against poverty is not without its share of victories -- and many of them are owed to some of the world's most innovative strategies.
The Grameen Bank pioneered the idea of microcredit, small loans given to the poor without a demand for collateral. The amounts are usually $200 or less, and they are generally used to start up a simple home business like as the purchase of a milk cow.
Grameen began in 1983, the idea of a Bangladeshi economist, Muhammad Yunus. Today, it has 2.4 million borrowers, mostly women, in 39,000 villages. The repayment rate is 98 percent.
In 1986, Mr. Yunus was invited to Arkansas by Bill Clinton, who was then its governor. He wanted to set up a similar banking scheme in the state. The two became friends.
Joypura has several dozen Grameen customers, among them Nasima Akhter, who last borrowed $160 to buy a rice paddy, which she then sold at a $60 profit.
"I wanted to tell President Clinton of my success," she said, holding her 7-month-old baby in her arms and standing in a home with walls of corrugated metal.
The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee is one of the world's largest nongovernmental organizations -- and it too is busy in Joypura, starting a school.
The children had been eager for the president to visit so he could hear them recite, to watch how they were the first in their families going up the staircase to an education. The school had been scrubbed. A new toilet had been built with a shiny blue metal door. It was padlocked, yet unused, with a virgin urinal awaiting distinguished guests.
"I am very utterly disappointed that Mr. Clinton will not see all that we have done for our village," said Harun ur-Rashid, a gaunt, clean-shaven man. "We have installed electricity. We have become people of the world. Mr. Clinton should see this."
Indeed, it is Mr. Clinton's loss, for Joypura, like most Bangladeshi villages, is stunningly picturesque. The trees are what make these hamlets so special, the lush mix of bamboo and palms and mangoes and banana. Gauguin would have been inspired here.
Osman Ghani, a young farmer in a green shirt and skirtlike wrap garment, was another who bemoaned the fickle destiny that kept the president away. He had walked seven miles in the morning to be here when the big moment arrived. He had thought of little else for weeks.
"Bill Clinton is the most important man in the world," Mr. Ghani said emphatically. "It would been the most memorable event in my life to see this great man."
This remark led to an obvious question. What then instead would have to serve as unforgettable? The farmer thought this over until finally the answer came to him. He looked at the other villagers at his side as if they too knew his mind. He spoke with certainty.
He said, "For me, the most memorable event in my life was the day I walked seven miles and almost saw Bill Clinton."

HEADLINE: New York Power Authority Postpones Decision on Sale of Two Nuclear Plants

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
The New York Power Authority postponed choosing a buyer for its two nuclear plants late last night, saying that it was unable to resolve an assortment of tax and finance issues related to what would be the largest sale of nuclear plants in United States history.
The power authority has been weighing competing offers for the Indian Point 3 plant in Westchester and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor in Oswego County, on Lake Ontario, between Entergy Nuclear, of Jackson, Miss., and Dominion Resources, of Richmond, Va. Entergy had initially offered a package it said was worth $806 million, only to be upstaged by Dominion, which offered a package it valued at $857 million. 
 But last night, after an unexpected 11-hour marathon meeting in Manhattan, largely behind closed doors, the five-member board of trustees said, with a trace of fatigued frustration in their voices, that it would be best to postpone a decision until next Tuesday. Although members said that much progress had been made, they could not resolve one key issue: the tax consequences of transferring two publicly run facilities to a private company, particularly when the plants are decommissioned in the future.
"The potential exposure in taxes to the power authority is anywhere from $100 to $400 million," said Michael A. Petralia, a spokesman for the authority. "We're talking about a significant amount of money. Now you can see why this took 11 hours."
The drama last night was further heightened by the fact that Dominion had said that its offer would expire at midnight. Last night, the power authority asked for an extension, but Dominion was noncommittal.
"Right now, we're unable to comment," Mark Lazenby, a spokesman for Dominion, said after the meeting.
No matter what happens, though, it may be reasonable to expect that something unexpected is probably in the cards given the way things have played out to date.
On Feb. 14, the power authority announced that it had reached a tentative deal with Entergy for a package that Entergy valued at $806 million. But even before that announcement, state legislators and watchdogs of nuclear power had criticized the agency for failing to make the process as open or as competitive as possible.
Then on Feb. 24, in a surprising twist, the power authority received an unsolicited bid from Dominion for what Dominion said was $51 million more. So the stage was set for a bidding war.
In the next few weeks, Entergy and Dominion sweetened their proposals, highlighting statistical projections and economic intangibles on everything from the value of a new regional office in White Plains, to paying more money to decommission the plants.
Power authority officials had originally predicted that yesterday's meeting would go rather smoothly, just like most board meetings, which typically last an hour. Instead, what happened was that the board huddled in a series of private meetings to discuss legal and financial issues for about 11 hours -- leaving reporters, representatives from the two bidders and other interested parties waiting.
When the board finally met in public last night, members listened to a financial presentation from Harris Kretsge, a vice president at J. P. Morgan Securities, which acted as a consultant to the authority.
According to J. P. Morgan, Entergy was offering $647 million in present-value dollars, and Dominion $727 million, for the plants, nuclear fuel stockpiles and other guaranteed terms. But factoring in certain contingencies -- like possible revenue-sharing profits -- resulted in a maximum potential of $747 million for Entergy and $786 million for Dominion.
But most important, he said, the value of each proposal would be at least four times more than the value of any previous sale of a nuclear plant, based on the dollars per generating capacity -- or, to use a car analogy, the amount of value per horsepower. "Either transaction is terrific," Mr. Kretsge said.
Even so, the board hit an unexpected stumbling block over the issue of taxes and finances, particularly over the money needed to decommission the plants. The power authority is supposed to pay for most of the costs of decommissioning the plants when they are deemed to have reached the end of their useful, or profitable, life, and so far, that decommissioning fund is worth around $630 million.

HEADLINE: Realty Company Sues State For Blocking L.I. Land Deal

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The largest commercial land owner on Long Island has sued the state's economic development agency over the company's aborted attempt to buy a 655-acre property at the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Facility in Brentwood for $32 million.
The lawsuit by a subsidiary of the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville claims that the state agency led by Charles A. Gargano had abruptly and improperly scuttled the deal for the prime tree-lined parcel last November, nearly a year after selecting the company as the highest bidder for the land. During that time, Reckson said it had spent millions of dollars helping the state resolve myriad problems related to the site, the largest tract of undeveloped land on Long Island. 
 The lawsuit claims that despite years of planning, the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, had mistakenly included in the sale a power plant, a maintenance building, a day care center and a newly built outpatient center that were critical to the operation of the adjacent Pilgrim psychiatric hospital. Reckson was working to resolve the mistakes when the state suddenly killed the sale, amid complaints by losing bidders and an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney.
"We think we were used," said Donald Rechler, chairman of Reckson. "It cost us millions of dollars, while it enriched the state. They kept us on the hook for almost a year."
Reckson, which is seeking $20 million in damages, is also demanding that the state return its $3.2 million deposit without forcing the company to give up any legal rights.
A spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, Joanna Rose, said it was the agency's policy not to comment on lawsuits.
The Pilgrim land sale has been something of an embarrassment for the Pataki administration. In 1997, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mr. Gargano announced plans to sell 6,484 acres at 20 state psychiatric centers, including the Pilgrim site. The state eventually put only 12 parcels up for auction and sold fewer than four. Pilgrim was the largest and most valuable, because it straddles the Long Island Expressway and the Sagtikos Parkway and was ideally suited for housing, and retail and office buildings.
"It's a highly visible and very valuable piece," said David Pannetta, a vice president of Oxford & Simpson, a real estate broker on Long Island. 'It's unfortunate that it got tripped up the first time."
Earlier this year, the state put a smaller 460-acre parcel at Pilgrim up for sale. Real estate executives said the bids for the property, which are due in April, would be for far less than the original $32 million deal.
Several companies that made offers for the Pilgrim property the first time had complained last year that confidential bidding information had been leaked to a rival bidder, Louis R. Cappelli, then a partner in the Reckson bid. At the same time, the district attorney's office in Manhattan scrutinized the land sale as part of a broader investigation into allegations of political favoritism by Mr. Gargano and the Empire State Development Corporation.
In its lawsuit, Reckson said it had never sought, obtained or used any confidential information. The sale is still under investigation. Daniel J. Castleman, chief of investigations for the district attorney's office, said, "We don't comment on any allegations in civil lawsuits."
Mr. Rechler said he would probably submit a new bid for the property, although probably not with Mr. Cappelli. But two other bidders from the first round -- Jerry Wolkoff, a Long Island developer, and Margaret Miller, president of Miromar Development, based in Montreal -- were not sure about their plans.
"We're not happy about this whole thing," Ms. Miller said. "It should have gone to the second-highest bidder. And we were definitely the second-highest bidder."

HEADLINE: Cablevision Considers Rebuilding Madison Sq. Garden

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Cablevision Systems Corporation, which owns the New York Knicks and the Rangers, says it plans to demolish Madison Square Garden and build a new arena on the same site, or over the nearby rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.
The Garden, which is between Seventh and Eighth Avenues at 33rd Street, is the country's busiest sports arena. But Cablevision said that it needed a new fan-friendly arena like the ones in Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles that would enable the company to generate more revenues. 
 "We think that New York, being the No. 1 sports market in the U.S., deserves to have the very best, in terms of an arena," said James L. Dolan, chief executive of Cablevision and chairman of Madison Square Garden. "It has been the best, but it's beginning to age. We want to explore all the possibilities, but I do think we're going to end up with a new Garden."
Mr. Dolan said yesterday that he hoped to make a final decision on the fate of the 32-year-old Garden by the end of this year. If the company builds on the current site of the Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers could play at the Nassau Coliseum or the Meadowlands in New Jersey during construction.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani first broached the idea of building an expensive new Madison Square Garden. In a speech more than 14 months ago, the mayor suggested building a new Madison Square Garden and a football stadium over the rail yards near 11th Avenue and West 33rd Street that would be linked to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
The mayor said the project could be financed in part by Cablevision's selling the old property for a hotel and office towers, as well as with tax revenues from the new project. Since then, Cablevision has been exploring the idea of building a new arena, a proposal reported yesterday in Newsday.
Neither Mr. Dolan nor Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor for planning, were willing to discuss what public subsidies might be involved in the project. A new football stadium and a new Madison Square Garden have recently surfaced as elements of a proposal to hold the Olympics in New York City in 2012.
Although team owners have customarily demanded public assistance, Mr. Dolan said, "It's possible we'll be able to do it without any help at all."
Under a tax exemption, the Garden has not paid any real estate taxes for 18 years. Last year, Cablevision held 691 sports events, concerts and circuses at the arena and reaped $140 million in profits.
"It's the most active arena on the planet," said Mark Ganis, president of Sportscorp, a sports consulting company in Chicago. But it is not the most profitable, Mr. Ganis added, because Madison Square Garden does not have the same kind of premium seats and merchandising opportunities as do newer arenas.
"Economically, it is far from what it could be," Mr. Ganis said. "I believe Cablevision has made up for the deficiencies by jacking up ticket prices to ridiculous levels. A new arena should result in more corporate sponsorship and luxury revenues, thereby reducing the need to increase ticket prices beyond the astronomical levels they are today."
A front-row seat at a Knicks game costs $1,500. But even for lesser seats, it cost a family of four an average of $455.26 last year to attend a Knicks game, twice as much as in Denver, Orlando, Cleveland or Detroit, according to Team Marketing Report in Chicago. A Rangers game cost the same family $368.27.
In the last decade, demands by team owners for subsidized and increasingly profitable arenas and stadiums have reduced the life span of sports facilities. At Continental Arena in the Meadowlands, fans enjoy good sight lines and a well-run operation, but the team owners view the 19-year-old arena as antiquated because it does not have more luxury boxes or retail opportunities.
"It's all about profitability," said Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois and an expert in sports and government subsidies.
"These owners want every new revenue stream," he said. "The concern now is, what's the next new item that might render this current generation of stadiums and arenas obsolete?"
But Mr. Ganis, an owner of the Minnesota Vikings football team, said that Cablevision did not need a public subsidy to build a new Garden. "The primary reason for a new arena is to increase revenues," he said. "It's not like you have to build an arena to get a team, nor is there a compelling reason to build a new structure, as there is with Yankee Stadium."
Cablevision inherited a long-running tax break worth nearly $9 million a year in 1995, when it bought Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers from Viacom Inc.
In response to threats to move the Knicks and Rangers out of New York City in 1982, Mayor Edward I. Koch granted the owner of the teams at the time, Gulf & Western, what was described as a 10-year property tax break worth about $50 million. But the legislation did not impose a time limit on the subsidy, which has swelled to a total of $128.7 million since 1982.
Paramount Communications, which owned the Garden in the late 1980's, considered moving to the West Side rail yards but found that option too expensive. Instead, the company spent $200 million renovating the Garden and building a 275-seat restaurant and 88 luxury boxes.

HEADLINE: Herman B Wells, 97, President Of Indiana U. in a Crucial Era

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Herman B Wells, the president of Indiana University during 25 years of steady growth and social change, died on Saturday at age 97 at his home in Bloomington, Ind., not far off the campus of the university that was the center of his life for more than 70 years.
Under Mr. Wells's leadership, Indiana University's student body grew from 11,000 to more than 30,000 (it now stands at 90,000 students, spread across eight campuses). 
 Mr. Wells was quietly devoted to progressive causes. He ended a host of segregationist practices at the university and urged the basketball coach, Branch McCracken, to recruit Bill Garrett, who in 1948 became the first black to play a varsity sport in the Big Ten.
He defended Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey, the head of the Institute for Sex Research at the university, against calls for his dismissal, and argued for the right of scholars to pursue their quest for truth without harassment.
Mr. Wells, a stout, jolly man who loved to cook and entertain, was also determined to make the university a cultural center for the Midwest.
When the Metropolitan Opera Company first performed on a college campus, it was at Indiana University in 1942, performing "Aida" to a capacity crowd of 3,800 from 108 cities and towns in 5 states. Mr. Wells called the concert "an event without precedent in the cultural life of Indiana."
Herman B Wells -- the B was his entire middle name -- was born in Jamestown, Ind., on June 7, 1902, the only son of a banker, Joseph Granville Wells, and a former teacher, Anna Bernice Harting Wells. His parents gave him his extremely brief middle name because they wanted to keep a tradition in his mother's family of middle names beginning with the letter B but could not agree on which name to give Herman.
Mr. Wells enrolled in the University of Illinois but transferred to Indiana after one year and, he said, fell in love with the place. After graduating in 1924, he worked in a bank, then obtained his master's degree at the University of Wisconsin. He returned to Indiana as an economics instructor in 1930.
In 1935, he was appointed dean of the university's business school, and in 1937 he was named president.
After retiring from the presidency in 1962, Mr. Wells taught business administration, was named the university's first chancellor -- a largely honorary title that he kept until his death -- and served as president of the Indiana University Foundation, which oversaw fund-raising for the university.
Mr. Wells was also active in affairs of state. Near the end of World War II, he was a special adviser on liberated areas for the State Department, and he served as an observer for the Greek elections in 1946. He was a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly in 1957.
In 1958, Mr. Wells was the head of a national commission that produced a report, "The Contemporary Challenge to American Education," urging the United States to double its spending on education over the next 10 years. In 1964, he led a group that studied New York's state university system and advised the state Legislature to cut red tape and give educators a freer hand.
Mr. Wells, who did not marry, left no immediate survivors.

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Tuesday about Herman B Wells, former president of Indiana University, referred incorrectly to an athlete he had urged the university to recruit. Bill Garrett, who played basketball for Indiana in 1948, was not the first black player of a varsity sport at a Big Ten college. Conference records give that distinction to Julian Ware, who played basketball for the University of Wisconsin from 1900 to 1902.

HEADLINE: RETRO KITCHEN;
Sundays With Ravioli: Where Have They Gone?

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL; This article is part of an occasional series that focuses on writers' memories of food and drink.

 BODY:
IT may have been my first love -- before Clark Gable, before Bobby Sherman, even before Jonathan Mink in the second grade.
Meat ravioli. 
 My fixation began with a prototype more appropriate to a Jewish girl, meat kreplach, which my grandmother fried and served with applesauce. But growing up in the era of checkered-tablecloth Italian restaurants, I soon established a pattern of gluttony by ordering -- and finishing -- two portions of meat ravioli from the children's menu. By the time I was in first grade, my parents figured it was cheaper to pretend I was 21.
The last time I remember ordering meat ravioli was in the mid-80's at La Boheme in Greenwich Village. It was delicious, with its tomato and meat sauce and thin topping of toasty mozzarella, like ravioli and pizza in one.
I haven't seen it since.
"Have you noticed that no one serves meat ravioli anymore?" my friend, Suzanne, asked recently. A native Tennessean who moved to New York in the 60's and immediately fell in love with all things ethnic, she was the only one who shared my fixation, except for a Jewish friend whose parents took him for Italian on the rare Sunday nights they skipped Chinese.
I assured her I had noticed (it's been off the menu at La Boheme for years) and decided it was time to take action. I asked two Italian-American friends for recommendations, both of whom said they had grown up with cheese ravioli and looked askance at the notion of meat.
But meat's what I remember most vividly. We used to go out to dinner every Sunday, my mother's weekly emancipation, and when we went for Italian, we drove to one of a few places near where we lived in Passaic, N.J., either Bob's or Pompeii or Giuliano's. The last was a dark restaurant where my mother would order a cocktail, delivered from the even darker bar in the next room, while my brother and I each had Cokes (only one!) which we had to make last. My father drank wine and gave us a sip, but who wanted that when you could have Coke?
Then, as the adults started in on plates of antipasto filled with stinky anchovies and slimy peppers, they gave us quarters so we could each pick songs from the jukebox (Pompeii's was the coolest, boasting selections like "Pretty Woman"), and when we were done fighting over whose songs went first and got back to the table and still didn't drink our Cokes, my ravioli would finally appear. It came nestled in its individual silver pan, casserole style, and I would cut through the steaming layers with a fork, which felt like opening 10 presents at once.
There was no mozzarella on top then, just Parmesan cheese, if you wanted it, which I never did. It smelled awful, which was why I never ordered cheese ravioli, convinced it would smell the same. And anyway, I didn't want anything to interfere with the way the meat inside the pasta tasted different from the meat in the tomato sauce, and I made sure each bite had some of both, until, alas, the pan was empty.
And what that really meant was that the weekend was over and there was school the next day. And even though we got pennies to throw in the wishing well at Giuliano's, that was it. Finished. The meal, the weekend, all of it. We had no choice but to face the doom of school.
With the taste of those Sundays in my mouth, I sat down and called 52 Italian restaurants in Manhattan, looking for meat ravioli. Eight had it. Eight! Almost every restaurant had cheese ravioli. Some had pumpkin. Or butternut squash, shiitake mushroom or smoked salmon. I even found rabbit and venison ravioli in truffle broth. But old-fashioned meat ravioli in a tomato-based meat sauce? Sorry, Signora, no.
Not one of the eight restaurants was in Little Italy. I called every one I could find, with no luck. At Il Palazzo, a waiter told me that no one carries it anymore. "People don't trust meat filling as much as they did," he said. "Most restaurants buy it frozen, so I wouldn't order it unless it's a special. Cheese you can whip up quickly. Meat takes longer."
Andrew Raffetto, president of the Raffetto Corporation, a family-owned business in SoHo that supplies restaurants and stores with ravioli, said: "Everyone now wants pumpkin and lobster. We still make meat for our store on Houston Street, with my grandfather's recipe from Genoa. We sell a nice little amount, and around Christmas and Easter we sell 10 times as much. But it ain't what it used to be. Grandma passed away, the kids moved to the suburbs, and over the years we've sold less and less."
But I ate my meat ravioli in the suburbs. Where did it go?
I asked a few Italian chefs, who told me that meat ravioli, like other stuffed pastas, was originally a labor-intensive feast-day dish in certain regions of Northern Italy. First the stuffing is made, then the pasta, then the individual pieces are filled and cooked, and mixed with the sauce -- cooked separately -- that accompanies the dish.
But in America this tradition, like so many, changed to fit the immigrants' new circumstances, which meant a drastic shift in ingredients. Lidia Bastianich, who with her son, Joe, owns Felidia and Becco in New York and Lidia in Kansas City, is at work on a series about Italian-American cooking for PBS. She makes the point that, as with meatballs, which were not cooked with sauce in Italy, but began to be here to improve the flavor of lackluster tomatoes, ravioli was also transformed, from the festive to the ordinary.
"I think with ravioli, the idea of it sort of got switched here through commercialization," she said. Certainly, most Americans learned to think of meat ravioli as nothing more complicated than opening a can of Chef Boyardee.
In some Italian households, though, the dish became a way to use up odds and ends. As Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo and Po, said: "The classic meat ravioli of our childhood was based on the economics of the kitchen, using leftovers. That was how Grandma stretched the meat." Though Mr. Batali does not make a traditional meat ravioli at Babbo, he makes something called Angel's Pyramids, a larger variation that is filled with either braised lamb, pork shoulder or brisket, and served in butter and sage. "After braising it for days, I don't want to mask the nuance of the stuffing with a tomato sauce," he said.
I see his point, though I also agree with Tony May, the owner of San Domenico and Gemelli, when he says: "A standard recipe is no longer of interest. A chef who cooks ravioli standing on his head, that's of interest." (For the record, neither of his places serves meat ravioli, either.)
I began my search at Gino on Lexington Avenue at 60th Street, a restaurant I love. Michael Miele, the chef, assured me that meat ravioli was on the menu, though I'd never noticed it before. There it was, Homemade Ravioli, which I had always assumed was cheese. It was served on a plate, not in a pan, and I found it only ordinary. I spent most of the meal snitching the excellent sausage and peppers from my husband's plate, instead.
Next, I tried Gene's on West 11th Street, with dismal results. The ravioli were undercooked and had the consistency of cardboard, one step up from a school cafeteria.
Maybe this quest was hopeless, I thought, trudging back to the subway with heartburn. Here I am, trying to recreate a phantom taste from childhood with food my mouth might no longer crave. After all, everyone's tastes change. Maybe even the best meat ravioli wouldn't thrill me now.
But that night I went to Pietro's, the Italian steakhouse on East 43rd Street. Meat ravioli is available as an appetizer or entree, and it was quite good. The winy-tasting Bolognese sauce was more sophisticated than what I remember, but the dish was satisfying enough to order again.
My spirits rose. Until I went to Da Tommaso, on Eighth Avenue at 53rd Street. Ravioli there is made with a sauce of sun-dried tomatoes, peppers and white wine. Sun-dried tomatoes and meat ravioli? For heaven's sake! The ravioli themselves were tasteless, the entire enterprise misconceived and depressing. I quit halfway through.
My luck was not much better at Via Oreto, on First Avenue at 61st Street, or Nanni's on East 46th Street. Via Oreto made the ravioli to order after I called ahead, and it was adequate, though salty. Nanni's serves meat ravioli as a lunch special every Wednesday, but when I sat down at 1 p.m., I was told that all 20 portions had sold out by 12:15. I wasn't sure I believed it, and with flashbacks of sun-dried tomatoes, wasn't sure I cared.
At Villa Mosconi, on Macdougal Street at West Houston, the veal parmigiana was very good, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. My friend, Suzanne, couldn't have either. She came with me and hid her disappointment when the ravioli tasted like paste.
So I was relieved that she agreed to try again the following night when I discovered meat ravioli nirvana at Bravo Gianni on East 63rd Street. When I had called, the chef, Gianni Garavelli, answered the phone. I had asked my standard question, "Do you have meat ravioli on your menu?" and he said: "I am making once in a while on Sundays. I can make if you want."
I wanted. "The ravioli has a very particular taste," he said. "It's been distorted in the United States, where the press has encouraged people to sell invented dishes as authentic food. In Italy I learn the authentic way. I make for my family, but it's a very laborious dish."
That Sunday, Mr. Garavelli sat down at the table with us. "I learned this from my sister Clementina, who lives near Genoa," he said. "In the meat sauce there is also spinach, borage and Swiss chard, and you cook that with beef, veal, chicken gizzard, sausage, sweetbreads and brains."
He saw the look on my face.
"Knowing that might take away the poetry for many people, but that's the way it's supposed to be done," he continued. "And the dough is very thin. The beauty of ravioli is the most fine pasta, because the edge is double. The meat sauce with it is a ragu. Are you ready?"
It was too late to back out now. I smiled bravely. Bring on the brains.
The minute he presented a copper pan filled with ravioli, my bliss began. The smell was heavenly. The pasta was supple, almost springy, the filling divine. I didn't care what was in there; it was light and tasty, and I only wanted more. The sauce was old-fashioned enough to qualify as what I remembered, while revealing a complexity I could appreciate only after decades of eating and cooking. I suddenly couldn't remember the other taste; there was only this taste, the only one that had ever mattered. It was the romance novel of meat ravioli, the true love that had eluded me for so long.
Mr. Garavelli looked at us from across the room, and I saw him smile. This man had accomplished what I had assumed was impossible: the perfect adult rendering of a childhood memory, Cokes and wishing wells not required. When I realized I didn't have to go to school the next day, I thought I might cry.
After unabashedly stuffing myself, I took the scant leftovers home. The next morning, I woke up and devoured them before I even made coffee. I looked at the empty container for about two seconds before picking up the phone to make another reservation.
"Do you want to come into the kitchen before and see how I make?" Mr. Garavelli asked.
I considered it. "No, I don't think so," I said, finally. "But have you ever thought about getting a jukebox?"

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
The Joffrey Takes Leaps in a Battle for Survival

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 18

 BODY:
Mankind battles Fate with a capital F in "Les Presages," the epic ballet by Leonide Massine that the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago has just performed so magnificently as part of its season here.
As Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony rumbled to its climax, as happiness vanquished evil and temptation onstage, Massine's famed allegorical vision of 1933 became suddenly a metaphor for the Joffrey's own triumphant battle for survival. 
 Five years after severe financial problems pointed to the possible demise of one of America's most popular ballet troupes, its move from New York (involving a legal reorganization and name change from Joffrey Ballet to Joffrey Ballet of Chicago) offers a lesson in rescue strategy.
When the Joffrey took over rented studios and offices in downtown Chicago in October 1995, its $9 million budget had been cut to $5 million and its dancers to 30 from 40. It had repeatedly canceled seasons in New York, where it has not been seen since 1994.
Things look very different now. On the artistic side, not only performances but also a rehearsal of George Balanchine's "Square Dance" over the weekend reveal a stunning new perfection in classical style. Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey's artistic director, beams when asked if he and his ballet masters (Mark Goldweber, Cameron Basden and Charthel Arthur) have recently concentrated on toe work. But this is still the Gerald Arpino whose choreography has always been more concerned with spirit than steps. No, he suggests, technique is not the only goal. "I want them to dance from the inside," he says, pointing to his heart.
With typical Joffrey gumption and considerable help from an expanding group of supporters in Chicago with high-powered civic connections, the company has not only survived but acquired a presence here that it never had in New York.
"Chicago has embraced the Joffrey," said Lois Weisberg, the city's cultural affairs commissioner, noting that several factors worked in the company's favor. Bereft of a world-class ballet company that would match the reputation of its major arts institutions, the business and arts communities here have been energetic on the company's behalf. The Joffrey's new chairman is C. Steven McMillan, the president and chief operating officer of the Sara Lee Corporation.
The troupe was familiar to Chicago, having picked up a following here since it began performing here in 1957. "They were held in high esteem," Ms. Weisberg said. "They were not perceived as interlopers. It was not Joffrey Ballet of New York but Joffrey Ballet of the world."
Mayor Richard M. Daley attends performances and "is extremely interested in the Joffrey," Ms. Weisberg added. "He knew its reputation."
Interest at the top helps. The Joffrey is about to acquire a building in the downtown Loop area, a gift from Commonwealth Edison. The $20 million renovation for studios, offices and retail space is expected to receive some help from the city through its tax-increment financing program, by which the city provides incentive money for development in anticipation of being repaid with increased real estate taxes.
It is the Joffrey's good luck to arrive in this revitalized theater district in the Loop just as other arts organizations (including the Goodman Theater) also move in, along with a potential audience drawn by apartments recently converted from offices and factories.
"I'm a Chicagoan," Mr. Arpino, a longtime resident of Greenwich Village, said with a straight face and then added convincingly, "I gave up my apartment in New York."
Once dependent on touring, the Joffrey has identified itself with Chicago by working to increase its presence here. The company's budget has climbed back to more than $9 million, with no deficits. In New York the Joffrey could afford an orchestra at City Center, but even this weekend at the landmark Auditorium Theater the music was, for economic reasons, on tape. Nonetheless, the company's five-week "Nutcracker" season employs an orchestra and brought in $2.1 million last winter.
The company performs in the Chicago area for 10 of its 37 work weeks, which include rehearsal. There is also a concerted outreach program with middle schools in the city. Since 1997 the company has had a summer residency in Telluride, Colo., and has resumed international touring, with stops in Egypt, Turkey and Israel.
Despite significant progress, Mr. Arpino has no immediate plans for performances in New York. While the company is still rebuilding, intense scrutiny might not help. "What has happened is a miracle," he said. "We're a legend now and I'm holding back. In New York we would be expected to be what we once were."
These remarks seem to imply that the company is not at full strength in terms of repertory, number of dancers and finances. All true, which makes the high artistic level of the dancing and production values during the weekend's performances all the more surprising. In addition to "Les Presages," which was a major Joffrey revival in 1993-94, the program included its well-known staging of "L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" by Vaslav Nijinsky and the company premiere of Balanchine's "Prodigal Son."
What Mr. Arpino really means is what the company's staff and supporters here all insist upon: that the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago is a new company, and that its reason for being is to maintain the continuity of vision of the Joffrey Ballet, founded in 1956 by Mr. Arpino and Robert Joffrey, who died in 1988.
"We're trying to do in 10 years what other organizations do in 40," said Bruce Sagan, a regional newspaper publisher and businessman who has been president of the Steppenwolf Theater Company and has been prominent in supporting cultural groups in Chicago for decades.
"The first thing was to survive," Mr. Sagan said. "That meant we couldn't run deficits and that means you have to make choices and set priorities. I too would like an orchestra with performances, but that will come.
"The effort so far has gone into controlling the cost of everything so that Gerry Arpino can rebuild the repertory and get new dancers."
In 1995 few in the dance world would have bet on the Joffrey's future. The troupe was deeply in debt (with a deficit of $1.6 million) and it was perceived as a touring company based in New York.
Jack R. Lemmon, executive director of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago, credits the New York board of the former company with a strategic decision. "The company needed to reinvent itself," he said. "It was a touring company that occasionally performed in its home city. Now it is a resident company in Chicago that still does national and international touring."
Like Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, with which it had been ranked, the Joffrey had its home in New York. But whether New York could support all three companies was in question. The company did, however, have board members from Chicago and the Midwest, and it was this group that advocated a reorganized entity in Chicago.
On the artistic side, the turnaround has been even more significant. Predictions were dire after the 1993 Joffrey premiere of "Billboards," a rock ballet to music by the Artist (still Prince at the time).
Mr. Arpino remains unapologetic for "Billboards," and despite the occasional scorn of critics the ballet is credited in large part with saving the company and keeping its dancers performing.
Nowadays the repertory picture has changed. In addition to the return of Mr. Arpino's own works and of 20th-century classics previously performed by the Joffrey, there have been premieres by Laura Dean and young choreographers like Randy Duncan, formerly a dancer in the Joseph Holmes Company.
Last fall there was also the company premiere of "Frankie and Johnny," a landmark 1938 work by Ruth Page and Bentley Stone, pioneers of American ballet in Chicago in the 1930's and 40's. Other firsts for the company that Mr. Arpino plans to present are Antony Tudor's "Lilac Garden" and Martha Graham's "Appalachian Spring."
Mr. Arpino admits that "in the first year here when we had to survive, I let the styles go down." But a visit with the three former leading Joffrey dancers who have served as ballet masters in the last two or three years does much to explain why the company's 32 dancers now look so stylish and technically strong. Eleven are from the former company, with Deborah Dawn the senior ballerina, the best-known. But some who were relatively new to the company in 1994, like Calvin Kitten, Davis Robertson and Maia Wilkins, among others, have developed into strong and striking dancers.
The highlight on Thursday and Friday was certainly "Les Presages." Ms. Basden's staging, based on the original Joffrey revival by Tatiana Leskova, does a fabulous job of making a historical curiosity come alive to modern audiences.
The ballet's interest lies less in its allegorical duel between a generic hero and a gnomic Fate figure than in the movement choruses that Massine borrowed from German modern dance in the 1930's.
Ms. Basden does wonders not only in featuring the women's strong toe work but also in the clarity she has achieved in the swiftly moving contrapuntal patterns.
But now, as was not true before, the soloists in each movement give Massine's once-surprising Neo-Classical choreography a forceful projection. They included Ms. Wilkins, Ms. Dawn, Domingo Rubio and Leticia Oliveira, and alternating as Fate, Mr. Robertson and Guoping Wang.
"The Prodigal Son," although familiar at City Ballet and other companies, is atypical Balanchine, his last experiment in a Constructivist style. Mr. Kitten is too pure a classical dancer to adjust immediately to its grotesque aspects. But by his second performance on Friday, he made his very young rebel persuasive. Trinity Hamilton also did better as the Siren on the second night, preserving her marvelous loose-hipped cool.
When the Joffrey revived "Faune" in 1979 its minimalism and potent sensuality were mesmerizing. Against an approximation of Leon Bakst's woodland backdrop, lighted brilliantly by Kevin Dreyer, the Faune still eats his grapes, scares off seven nymphs and satisfies himself with a celebrated autoerotic climax. A new literalism crept into Mr. Robertson's performance at the end on Thursday. On Friday it was markedly toned down by Mr. Rubio. Both were marvelously intense. As in the good old days, a program at the Joffrey was unlike any other.

HEADLINE: Text of Fed's Statement

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:
The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to 6 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 1/2 percent. 
 Economic conditions and considerations addressed by the committee are essentially the same as when the committee met in February. The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion.
Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

HEADLINE: Three Firms Invest $40 Million In Times Company's Digital Unit

 BODY:
The New York Times Company, which plans a public offering of a new class of stock in its Internet business division this spring, said yesterday that three venture capital firms had invested $40 million in the division, Times Company Digital.
The investors are Flatiron Partners, Highland Capital Partners and Chase Capital Partners, a unit of Chase Manhattan Bank. The firms acquired three-year debt that will be convertible -- after the offering -- into the Times Company's new Class C shares, which will track the performance of Times Company Digital. 
 Details about the investment, including the interest rate to be paid on the debt and the conversion price for the shares, were not disclosed.
Jerry Colonna, managing partner of Flatiron Partners, and Daniel Nova, managing general partner of Highland Capital Partners, also agreed to join a new advisory board for the digital division, the Times Company said. Other members of the board from outside the company are Red Burns, the chairwoman of the interactive telecommunications program at New York University, and Mark Walsh, the chief executive of VerticalNet Inc.
The members of the advisory board from the Times Company are Arthur Sulzberger Jr., chairman; Russell T. Lewis, president and chief executive; Howell Raines, editorial page editor of The New York Times; and Martin A. Nisenholtz, the chief executive of the digital division.
The company filed a registration statement for the stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 28, but the offering cannot be made until it is cleared by the S.E.C. and approved by shareholders at a meeting scheduled for April 27.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Urge Letting Iraq Double Money For Oil Gear

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 21

 BODY:
The United States will propose doubling the sums Iraq may spend on spare parts for its decrepit oil industry, neglected during almost 10 years of sanctions, diplomats said today.
Under an American-sponsored resolution to be circulated for discussion among Security Council members in the next day or two, Iraq would be permitted to raise to $600 million every six months -- $1.2 billion a year -- instead of the current $300 million every six months. 
 The money is raised through the "oil for food" program, which allows Iraq to sell oil to meet the needs of its civilians. The increase was recommended by Secretary General Kofi Annan in a report to the council this month because the sanctions have left the equipment in such poor shape.
The plan, generally expected to be voted on by the council on Friday unless there are unforeseen objections, is being introduced as members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries prepare to meet in Vienna next week to discuss the possibility of increasing oil production so that record high prices will decline.
Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's, experts say. Since December, the Iraqis have been permitted to sell as much oil as they wish under the United Nations-supervised program. Some of the proceeds pay for goods needed by civilians, who have been living under sanctions since 1990, and for public services like water and electricity.
Today an official Iraqi newspaper attacked oil-exporting countries thought to be willing to increase production to ease costs for the United States and other countries. "The United States policy of blackmail must be rejected," said the paper, Al-Jumhuriya, which as with all Iraqi papers is government controlled.
Yet Iraq has been straining its pumping and pipeline operations to take advantage of the higher prices, although it cannot sustain such a high level for long, Mr. Annan's report said. It described Iraqi oil installations as hazards to the safety of workers and the environment.
The report was based on a technical survey of the industry requested by the council in December and carried out in January by an independent group of oil experts from Saybolt International BV of the Netherlands.
Diplomats are not concerned that allowing Iraq to double the money spent on spare parts for oil production will cut into the food, medicine or other purchases for the population because with oil prices high, income has also risen and if additional oil is pumped, additional civilian goods can be imported. In the last three years, Iraq has earned $20 billion in supervised oil sales, with a third of that going to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
But even with added money, Iraq says, it cannot upgrade its oil industry effectively as long as the United States and, to a lesser extent, Britain, block critical contracts for spare parts or related oil equipment in the Security Council sanctions committee.

HEADLINE: Trying a Stern Hand on a Mediocre School District

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
When Michael A. Johnson first visited Intermediate School 192 in southeastern Queens last month, he found students capering down hallways and shouting out of windows during class.
Every day, more than 100 students were late, and 15 to 17 teachers were absent. The fluorescent lights were dim. The computers were not connected to high-speed wiring. 
 Two weeks later, Mr. Johnson strode through the door again, wire-rim glasses flashing. An anxious deputy flitted out of the shadows with the good news: "Mr. Johnson, 38 students late this morning."
"How many teachers absent?" Mr. Johnson asked. "Two," came the reply.
A no-nonsense engineer turned principal, Mr. Johnson is now the acting superintendent of District 29 -- one of the first appointments made by the interim chancellor, Harold O. Levy -- and his job is to take one of the city's most middle-class black school districts and turn it around. The schools in District 29 perform near the citywide average on standardized tests. But considering its affluence -- it covers well-groomed neighborhoods of single-family homes like Rosedale and Laurelton -- it should be doing much better, Mr. Johnson said.
What is worse, he said, the longer students stay in the district's schools, the more their performance deteriorates.
A lot is riding on whether Mr. Johnson succeeds. If he improves the district, he could demonstrate that a single strong leader working with traditional methods of instruction can have an impact in neighborhoods bogged down in mediocrity. If he fails, he could add to the disillusionment over the promise of public education.
In District 29's case, mediocre scores have also put the district on the front lines of the war over school vouchers. It is the former Congressional district of the Rev. Floyd Flake, pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church, and Mr. Flake has used the district as ammunition in his campaign for vouchers.
In 1993, Mr. Johnson founded the Science Skills Center, a high school at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn. As principal, he offended his fellow school reformers by demanding that his black and Hispanic students, many from poor families, take the SAT's and Regents tests that are more commonly expected of upper-middle class children bound for college.
His students did well: 86 percent of his 11th graders passed the English Regents examination in 1998, compared with 40 percent of those in schools with similar economic and racial demographics.
"I came from a school that was just about all black and it was a high-achieving school," Mr. Johnson said. "There is a culture to good-schoolness. You can assert that in any setting, albeit superficially at first. But it will take root."
Mr. Levy knew of the Skills Center by reputation, and recognized a kindred spirit in Mr. Johnson, right down to his swashbuckling manner and a shared penchant for pinstripe suits and crisply starched shirts.
Mr. Levy appointed Mr. Johnson on Feb. 11, after suspending the elected school board because it could not agree on a permanent superintendent. Leroy Comrie Jr., the president of the board, said he believed the board had been suspended because it had opposed plans to build a junior high school on the site of Creedmore Psychiatric Center.
About 2 percent of the district's 27,000 students are white, 75 percent are black, 12 percent are Hispanic and 11 percent are Asian. Only 32 percent of the district's eighth graders passed the state's English test, compared with 36 percent for the city, and just 14 percent passed the math test, compared with 23 percent for the city.
Mr. Johnson says he is determined to avoid district politics and to focus on education. Two weeks ago, he took a reporter on a tour of three schools, to demonstrate his approach.
At I.S. 192, he told how he had taken walkie-talkies away from the assistant principals, who had been, he said with disgust, behaving more like police officers than educators. He brought in about 25 teacher trainers and administrators to supervise the staff. As he peeked into classrooms the other day, many of the regular teachers were sitting in the back of the room, while Mr. Johnson's staff modeled lessons for them.
At the next school Mr. Johnson visited, P.S. 131, one of the district's best, he asked the principal, Walter J. O'Brien, what he needed. Mr. O'Brien did not hesitate. Many of his immigrant students, he said, are bright enough to test out of English language classes very quickly, then "get clobbered" on the state's standardized tests. Mr. O'Brien asked for a summer-school program to perfect their English. Mr. Johnson was thrilled. "I can almost guarantee you'll get it," he said.
But at the next school, P.S. 36, Mr. Johnson was once again shaking his head in dismay. Through the door of one classroom, a teacher could be heard yelling "Zip it! Zip it!" to the children. Another teacher had locked the classroom door. In another classroom, the children were working in near darkness. The teacher said they had just returned from lunch and she had forgotten to turn on the lights.
The principal introduced the woman who heads the school's leadership team. "What are you working on now?" Mr. Johnson asked politely. The woman could not remember.
Mr. Johnson asked the principal, Cynthia M. Hunter, what she needed. She said she needed another paraprofessional to walk children to the bathroom. "How about academics?" Mr. Johnson prodded. The principal said 300 of the school's 523 students had received letters warning that they were at risk of being assigned to summer school. She expected 150 of them to have to go.
Mr. Johnson suggested that she send all 300 nonetheless. "I would have 150 in a program to meet the standards, and 150 in a program to push them above," he said.
The principal said she liked the idea, but would not be in a position to carry it out. She had "opted out" of summer school, she said, under a provision of her union contract. "Who will be taking over your school?" Mr. Johnson asked. "I don't know," the principal replied.

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
NETHERLANDS: 3 APOLOGIES -- The government apologized to Jews, Gypsies and Indonesians for a "chilly" official response in the past to their claims to property seized during and after World War II. Prime Minister Wim Kok said the government had to face up to "mistakes and shortcomings" made in the 1940's and offered $180 million, in addition to past restitutions, to the Central Jewish Congress. Gypsies received an extra $13 million. Indonesians who sided with the Dutch during Indonesia's fight for independence in 1949 were offered $110 million. Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
GERMANY: BERTELSMANN JOINS FUND -- Bertelsmann, the German media company that owns Random House, said it would contribute to a $5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era slave and forced laborers, but declined to say how much. The company is in the process of revising its corporate history in the light of evidence that it did not, as it previously contended, oppose Hitler's regime. Contentious talks on how the fund should be divided will resume here today. Roger Cohen (NYT) 
 
NETHERLANDS: CROAT HANDED OVER -- A Bosnian Croat accused of war crimes was handed over to the United Nations tribunal in The Hague, where he arrived with a psychiatrist and other medical personnel. Mladen Naletelic, 54, a former military commander, was indicted for persecution, torture and murder of Muslims in Bosnia in 1993 and 1994. The new Croatian leadership, in contrast to past governments, accepted tribunal doctors' findings that he was well enough to stand trial. Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
IRELAND: ORANGEMEN IN DUBLIN -- Northern Ireland's Orange Order, whose summer parades of men in bowler hats and orange sashes regularly plunge the province into turmoil, has been invited by Dublin officials to march there in May. "We have the right of free assembly here," Lord Mayor Mary Freehill said. A Sinn Fein spokesman compared Ms. Freehill's action to "the state governor inviting the Ku Klux Klan to march in Alabama." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CHILE: PINOCHET IN HOSPITAL -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, entered a clinic for tests after fainting in his residence outside Santiago. The clinic would not comment on the condition of the former dictator, who returned to Chile on March 3 after spending 16 months under house arrest outside London on a Spanish warrant charging him with human rights violations. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: REBELS BLACK OUT CITIES -- Power was cut to a huge swath of central and northeast Colombia, including the capital, Bogota, and at least six other cities, after a wave of sabotage attacks by Marxist rebels opposed to a selloff of the state power industry. At least eight of the country's 32 provinces, including oil-producing regions of the northeast, were hit by the cuts. The privatizations were ordered by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $2.7 billion loan deal. (Reuters)
 
MONTSERRAT: VOLCANO IS NEW THREAT -- The newly active Soufriere Hills volcano hurled glowing rocks high into the sky, setting off fiery avalanches and shot a thundering ash cloud as high as 30,000 feet, scientists said. The explosion sent a new coat of ash over parts of the island's northern "safe zone," where residents have been living since the volcano began erupting in 1995. Since then, 7,000 of the 11,000 residents have left for other Caribbean islands and Britain. (AP)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: EX-AIDE ADMITS HARASSMENT -- The former Governor of Osaka, Japan's second-largest city, admitted for the first time in court that he had groped a 21-year-old campaign worker last year. Until now, Isamu Yamada, a former comedian who still uses his stage name, Knock Yokoyama, had denied accusations of sexual harassment while agreeing to pay a large civil settlement. Mr. Yokoyama resigned after his indictment for sexual molestation. Calvin Sims (NYT)
 
PHILIPPINES: WAR ON REBELS -- President Joseph Estrada said he had ordered "all out" military action against Muslim separatist guerrillas in the south. He also announced on a visit to Kauswagan that the mayor would go on leave after accusations by residents that he fled when guerrillas of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front occupied the Kauswagan town hall last week in fighting that left at least 21 people dead. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: ALBRIGHT REBUKED -- In its latest response to Washington's decision to ease economic sanctions, the foreign ministry rebuked Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other officials for a "lack of honesty" and "ignorance of the geography of the region." The statement appeared aimed less at the moves announced by Dr. Albright than at remarks she made later in India that made note of divisions over policy toward the United States between Iran's democratic reform movement and a hard-line faction associated with the ruling clerics. John F. Burns (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
COMORO ISLANDS: COUP ATTEMPT FOILED -- The army foiled a coup attempt and a son of a former president was in custody, officials said. Shots rang out in Moroni, the capital, but no casualties were reported. Officials said they believed that the action, the 19th coup or attempted coup since independence from France in 1975, was led by two sons of the islands' first president, Ahmed Abdallah, who was assassinated in 1989. They said one son, a former agriculture minister, had been arrested. (Reuters)
 
ZIMBABWE: SQUATTERS STAY PUT -- White farmers whose properties were illegally occupied by war veterans in a demand for land reform said there was no indication that the police had acted to evict the squatters within 24 hours, as ordered by the High Court on Friday. The court said that if the squatters refused to leave, the police were to forcibly remove them after 72 hours, a deadline that expired late Monday. (Agence France-Presse)

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
An international design agency's name becomes a shadow of itself in a move to bolster its identity.

BYLINE: By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
A LOW-PROFILE international design and image firm, Desgrippes Gobe & Associates, which has high-profile clients like Air France, Coca-Cola and the Limited, is creating a new identity for a client it has known forever: itself.
The 29-year-old, 165-person agency, which had $25 million in revenue last year, will be renamed d/g* (the asterisk represents a star) effective April 4 as part of a campaign to heighten awareness of the agency's services. 
 The company, which has headquarters in Paris and New York and offices in Brussels, Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, has also created a logo made up of four symbols that represent its disciplines: a star represents its marketing and design expertise; a bull's eye with the letter "C" at the center represents the firm's consulting practice; a building represents its architectural expertise; and an eye represents its interactive capabilities. The campaign also includes a redesigned Web site at www.dga .com.
Marc Gobe, president of the New York office, said Desgrippes Gobe had decided to rename itself because it found that although its original name "reflected the identity of the founding designers, it was not always easy to pronounce or remember."
"It also failed to communicate our evolution into an international organization and our capabilities," he added.
Central to d/g*'s work is its concept of emotional branding, which involves analyzing the visual and emotional responses a good or service generates. For a brand to be successful, the firm believes an emotional bond must be developed between the buyer and the product. The agency uses its research to develop strategies that clarify or solidify the images of its clients' brands, which strengthen that bond.
Companies whose brands d/g* has helped revamp include Brooks Brothers, Reebok, Intimate Brands' Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch. Ann Taylor hired the agency to design its flagship store in Manhattan; among d/g*'s innovations were a dressing room fitted with business equipment and a central staircase in the front of the store, designed to create a homelike feeling. In addition, d/g* has done more traditional image consulting for companies like Coca-Cola. During the Atlanta Olympics, it designed a can for Coke that featured the word "always" in five languages.
One of the agency's newest image consulting clients is Ohio State University, for which it is developing a vision for a university of the future. And it is coming up with a new identity for Air France, involving aircraft interiors, uniforms and redesign of the airline's Web site.
Branding is also central to d/g*'s interactive strategy. Mr. Gobe, for one, expects that the Internet-driven economy will ultimately be driven by brands. "Consumers will be empowered to make their own decisions, set their own price, design their own product," he said. "They'll be able to create or break the reputation of a company, through chat rooms, in just five minutes. Word of mouth will become global, not local."
"Before, there was a delay between the introduction of a product and consumers' response to it," Mr. Gobe added. "Now companies will get immediate feedback."
Peter Levine, who heads up the agency's consulting practice, said the four main elements of traditional offline retailing today are entertainment, information, personal service and ease; he suggested all four would ultimately have to be "reconfigured and translated for the Web."
When this occurs, he predicted "bricks-and-mortar retailers will have to raise the bar as well, to make the live shopping experience more special."
The agency's branding theories, particularly as they apply to the Internet, generally won the support of Clive Chajet, a New York-based consultant who was once chairman of Lippincott & Margulies, a leading brand and corporate identity firm.
"There's no question that the future on the Internet belongs to established, recognized brands because the transaction between the seller and buyer will be direct," he said. "There will be no salesperson telling you how wonderful the product is. So all products will have to be presold. Brands will be known and understood for what they offer."
However, Jim Nail, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., questioned the d/g* emphasis on emotions in e-commerce. "Today, brands on the Web are all about how quick and easy it is for a consumer to find what he's looking for; d/g* is going about it backward," he said.
"Offline, you can't deliver an experience to someone until they walk through the door of your store," he added. "Emotional branding is used to try to draw people to the store in expectation of delivery of the brand's promise. But online, the delivery of that promise is one click away. So the emphasis has to be on delivering that satisfying experience first. Out of that experience comes the emotional connection to the brand."
Mr. Chajet questioned d/g*'s decision to change its name to initials, eliminating the names of its two founders. "Adopting initials as a corporate name is a passport to anonymity," he said.
Roger van den Bergh, a New York-based designer specializing in corporate and brand identity, also called this move risky because "in their 29 years in business, everyone knows them as Desgrippes Gobe.
"I'm not sure this will help their long-term name recognition," he added.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rises to Record $28 Billion

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Swollen by a huge bill for foreign oil and a voracious spending spree by prosperous American consumers, the nation's trade deficit jumped to a record $28 billion in January, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Exports sagged, breaking a streak of seven consecutive advances.
The latest deficit, $3.4 billion above the December level and 25 percent larger than the 1999 monthly average, suggested that the booming American economy is still overwhelming the forces that would narrow this imbalance, mainly a rebound in the economic performance of other nations that buy American goods. 
 "The U.S. economy continues to grow more quickly than its trading partners -- and oil prices have gone up a lot," said Catherine L. Mann, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The Federal Reserve yesterday announced its fifth interest-rate increase since June in an effort to prevent overly rapid growth, which ran at a 5.9 percent annual pace in the final three months of the year, from driving up inflation.
William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, said he had been prepared to raise his gross domestic product estimate for this quarter but decided after digesting yesterday's figures to stick with a still rapid rate of 5 percent.
The widening in the January gap between what the United States buys from abroad and what it sells there occurred on both sides of the equation. Imports jumped $1.9 billion, to a record $112.1 billion, while exports fell $1.5 billion after expanding every month since May.
Economists expressed no alarm about the results, which have repeatedly been weak for January in recent years, suggesting more than the usual imprecision in the way the Commerce Department adjusts the data for recurring seasonal swings. But they did express concern about the decline in exports, which if sustained, could cast doubt on the strength of economic recovery from the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. Japan, for example, slipped back into a recession in the October-December 1999 quarter and continues to show mixed signals about recovering in the current quarter.
The American deficit with Japan did shrink in January, to $5.6 billion from $7 billion, but the deficit with China climbed to $6 billion from $5.6 billion. Figures on trade with individual countries are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
With China back as the No. 1 source of the American deficit -- perhaps now on a sustained basis -- it may be a bit harder for the Clinton administration to persuade Congress to grant it normal trade relations on a permanent basis as part of a deal under which the United States would support China's admission to the World Trade Organization.
Falling exports and rising imports contributed about equally to the widening gap with China.
The deficit with Asia's newly industrialized economies -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- widened to $2.5 billion in January from $1.8 billion in December, while it narrowed with Western Europe to $3.6 billion from $3.9 billion.
The trade gap with Canada, the biggest United States trading partner, jumped to a record $4.3 billion from $3.4 billion, and the deficit with Mexico, the other member of the North American Free Trade Agreement, doubled to $1.8 billion, the report showed.
As for oil, the import bill leaped to a record $7.9 billion, more than double the $3.5 billion of January 1999, when prices had fallen so sharply that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries collaborated with non-OPEC producers to curtail production to raise prices.
Both the volume and price of oil imports rose for the month, with the per-barrel price put at $23.18, the highest since the eve of the Persian Gulf war in December 1990 when it hit $25.75. The December 1999 price was $22.67.
The administration has been lobbying intensely for a production increase by OPEC, which is to meet on Monday.
Besides importing $919 million more oil, the United States raised its purchases of foreign cars by $677 million and its purchases of computers, telecommunications gear and other capital goods by $207 million.
The Commerce Department, on revision, narrowed the overall American trade deficit for December by $900 million, to $24.6 billion from the $25.5 billion originally reported.

HEADLINE: US Airways Vows to Shut Down if AttendantsDisrupt Flights

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The 10,000 unionized flight attendants at US Airways are threatening an unusual walkout this Saturday, saying they will disrupt flights on 49 of the airline's busiest routes.
The flight attendants want to maximize pressure on the company with a strategy that they have called Chaos -- Create Havoc Around Our System. 
 In response, US Airways, the nation's sixth-largest airline, plans to take an unusual step of its own, saying that unless a contract is reached by Saturday, it will suspend all operations, rather than let the flight attendants whipsaw the company and its customers.
In a statement, the airline said, "Chaos by any name is Chaos, and US Airways will not operate under the threat of constant disruption."
Any decision by US Airways to halt operations, industry experts said, would be the first time that any airline closed itself down in the face of a job action.
Suspending operations would inconvenience the 150,000 passengers US Airways flies each day and would create the greatest disruption in the eastern third of the nation, where the airline controls 36 percent of the regional market. Such a shutdown would affect flights ranging from US Airway's New York-Boston-Washington shuttle as well as the company's routes to Europe.
In another unusual twist, the company has promised to continue paying its 30,000 workers who are not flight attendants for as long as is feasible during a shutdown.
The union is barred from taking any job action until a mandatory 30-day cooling-off period ends at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
The strike threat is already hurting the airline, with travel agents reporting that they are steering consumers to other airlines and that many US Airways passengers have switched their reservations.
"There are people who are completely canceling their trips," said Helene Singer, owner of Singer Travel in Reading, Pa. "We're advising people that US Air will not be flying, and people are rebooking on other airlines."
After seeking a refund on her US Airways flight scheduled for Friday night, Rita Gance, a nurse from Reading, Pa., reluctantly canceled a trip to visit her mother in West Palm Beach, Fla.
"I'm really disappointed," she said. "I looked at tickets at other airlines, but the prices were ridiculous."
Stephen M. Wolf, the company's chairman, and Rakesh Gangwal, its chief executive, have joined top union officials in Washington this week for intense negotiations, helped by the National Mediation Board.
Neither side was willing to predict the likelihood of a strike. But union officials said flight attendants, borrowing a page from the partial subway and air strikes often carried out by European transportation unions, were ready to disrupt the 49 routes by picketing or not showing up.
The union has listed the routes it says it will disrupt, saying it would not make every flight on those routes a target but would instead keep the company guessing about which flights would be affected. Among the routes listed are are New York/La Guardia-Orlando, New York/La Guardia-Tampa, Boston-Orlando, Pittsburgh-Chicago/O'Hare and Philadelphia-San Francisco.
Lawrence Nagin, the airline's executive vice president and general counsel, said the company felt compelled to shut its operations because it was worried that the union action would strand or delay thousands of passengers and that customers would lose hard-earned confidence in the airline. "We are not going to subject our customers to the uncertainty of chaos," he said.
Mr. Nagin said the 49 designated routes accounted for 21 percent of the airline's 2,000 daily flights, but would affect passengers on many other flights because of the airline's hub-and-spoke system. The union has indicated that it will expand its action beyond the 49 routes if the dispute drags on.
The company blames the Association of Flight Attendants for rejecting a contract formula similar to those accepted by the airline's pilots, mechanics and other main unions.
In an effort to reduce what industry analysts say are the highest costs per seat mile among major airlines, US Airways is demanding that the flight attendants accept a formula that would link the attendants' pay to the average of their counterparts at the nation's four largest airlines plus 1 percent.
But the flight attendants, whose contract expired in 1996, assert that the airline's version of a parity formula would cut their pay and fringe benefits by 5 percent. Union officials say the other unions had a chance to help define their parity formula, while the flight attendants have not been given that opportunity.
"People are pretty angry at the company," said Cynthia Kain, a union spokeswoman. "They feel these are good economic times and they're being left behind."
The flight attendants have not had a raise since 1996 and their annual pay ranges from $17,145 to $36,918.
The flight attendants are in a tight spot because many workers in US Airway's other unions are questioning why the attendants would refuse to accept the formula they accepted.
"All the employee groups represented by the other unions at the company have entered into an agreement based on this concept, and we think it's a fair solution and an important factor in enabling US Airways to be competitive in a very competitive industry," Mr. Nagin said.
The flight attendants' strategy has been carried out once before, when sporadic job actions forced the cancellation of a half dozen Alaska Airline flights in 1993.
In February 1999, a sickout by pilots created havoc for American Airlines. At the peak of the 10-day sickout, a fourth of the airline's 9,200 pilots called in sick, forcing the company to cancel more than half of its 2,250 daily flights.

HEADLINE: Ivan Hirst, British Officer Who Revived VW, Is Dead at 84

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
Maj. Ivan Hirst, the British Army officer responsible for getting the Volkswagen factory running again after World War II in what is now Wolfsburg, Germany, died March 10 at his home near Marsden, in Yorkshire, England. He was 84.
Without his efforts, Volkswagen probably could never have shifted from its failed dream of producing a people's car for the Third Reich into the economic powerhouse that built the Beetle, the symbol of German recovery. 
 "Anyone who drives a VW owes a lot to Major Hirst," said Ryan Lee Price, editor of VW Trends magazine, a publication for Beetle owners.
Ivan Hirst was born March 4, 1916, in Saddleworth, England. He studied at the University of Manchester and worked for a time in his family's optical instrument business.
He turned a youthful interest in motor vehicles into an assignment in the tank repair service for the British Army during the war.
Part of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, he was evacuated at Dunkirk after the fall of France in 1940.
Later transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, he returned to Europe as head of a tank repair group in Brussels.
It was from there that he was ordered in August 1945 to the former "Strength Through Joy" City, a sprawling forced-labor factory between Berlin and Hanover. The city was soon renamed Wolfsburg.
Captured by the Americans, the mile-long, bombed-out plant Hitler had built was then turned over to the British.
The plant's last wartime products were parts for V-1 rocket bombs and stoves for soldiers on the Eastern front. The work was done by about 15,000 slave laborers, prisoners of war and others.
Sent to the plant without orders, Major Hirst found the workers still there and on his own initiative decided to use them. In his repair and motor pool service, he found fearful ex-Nazi administrators, refugees from the Soviet sector 15 miles to the east and former slave laborers mingled suspiciously in an economy where the prime currency was American cigarettes.
The slave laborers were soon sent home.
Major Hirst recalled in a 1962 magazine article that he and his commanding officer, Col. Michael McEvoy, who had driven an early version of the Volkswagen in 1938, spray-painted army green one of the few Beetles around and drove it to their local headquarters.
In September 1945 the two officers persuaded the British military to place an order for 20,000 vehicles to serve local troops and officials.
Without that order the machinery in the plant would probably have been disbursed among the occupying powers and the factory shut forever.
Major Hirst scrounged steel and other rare materials to keep the plant going.
By 1946, 8,000 workers were producing 1,000 vehicles a month.
In January 1949, Major Hirst helped recruit Heinrich Nordoff to take over management of the company, and he led VW until 1968.
Major Hirst left in August 1949 when the company was set up as a trust run by the new West German government.
Mr. Nordhoff later said that "by one of the ironic jokes history is sometimes tempted to produce, it was the occupation powers who brought Hitler's dream into reality."
In another twist of fate, after 1945 the British motor industry proceeded to decline while the German automobile industry that Major Hirst helped revive flourished, leading the so-called German economic miracle of the 1950's.
Sir William Rootes, a longtime leader of the British auto industry, told Major Hirst his factory would collapse within two years. A formal engineering evaluation of the Volkswagen undertaken by the British military also found little potential, declaring "the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirements of a motorcar."
"It is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy," he continued, then added famously, "If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man."
"It was by no means a perfect car," acknowledged Major Hirst in a 1999 BBC interview, "But in its time it was a damn good little car."
In 1972, the original Beetle surpassed the Model T as the most- produced car ever; to date, about 22 million have been made and limited production continues in Puebla, Mexico.
William Bowman of St. Louis, a collector of old Volkswagens, was one of a group of Beetle fans who visited Major Hirst last summer.
"He was sharp as a tack and had wonderful stories," Mr. Bowman recalled of an evening spent with the major in a pub in Marsden.
"He couldn't understand why we thought what he had done was such a big deal," Mr. Bowman said.
A familiar figure at the pub, with his clipped white mustache, ascot and pipe, Major Hirst reminisced until nearly midnight.
After leaving the army, Major Hirst worked for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. He retired in 1975 and his wife, Marjorie, died some years ago. He had no children.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
The FedHas No Surprises and the Market Has a Reason to Rally

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The no-surprises Federal Reserve Board gave investors just what they were expecting yesterday: a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates. The full-of-surprises stock market delivered a smashing gain on the news, with two of the broadest indexes closing at new highs.
Before the midafternoon announcement that the Fed had pushed the Federal Funds rate to 6 percent, stocks had been adrift. After the news, they took off, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising 2.56 percent to end the day at a record of 1,493.87. The Wilshire 5000 index, which represents the entire stock market and is an index that the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly watches, closed at a high of 14,346.22, up 2.1 percent on the day. The Nasdaq rose 2.21 percent. 
 Strategists said the market's reaction reflected two things. First, investors were relieved that the Fed had not chosen to be more aggressive and raise rates by one-half point. In addition, investors seemed to greet the quarter-point rise as medicine the Fed must administer to keep the long economic expansion healthy.
"The conventional wisdom is rate hikes are bad for the stock market," said Jay Mueller, economics strategist at Strong Capital Management in Milwaukee. "But I think the market recognizes that good monetary policy means you sometimes have to raise rates. The Fed had to do this."
Nevetheless, given that the Fed is almost as concerned about excessive speculation in the stock market today as it is about a resurgence in inflation, the blistering moves in stocks probably disappointed Mr. Greenspan. The gains also indicate, to some, that the central bank is a spectator rather than an actor in the drama playing out in the financial market.
"The Fed's just not in control," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The economy is surging at a rate that is clearly excessive and while there's been some rather frenetic rotation in the stock market, wealth creation is still open-ended. The Fed in my view is staying incremental with a very blunt instrument, the Fed funds rate, that is inappropriate for dealing with the problems that it's facing."
Other tools available to the Fed that might cool things down include raising the initial amount of money that investors must put up to buy stocks on borrowed money -- known as the margin requirement -- or increasing the amount of reserves that banks must have on hand as a percent of their deposits. A higher reserve requirement means less money will be available for loans, which would slow economic growth.
Even as stock investors celebrated the Fed's vigilance against inflation, their enthusiasm made it more likely that the central bank will push through additional rate increases this year. Rising stock prices, said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, make it harder for monetary policy to bring the economy back down to earth. "The financial markets are not doing a lot of tightening for the Fed," Mr. Dudley said. "The logical conclusion is that the Fed will have to do more than people anticipate." Currently, the Wall Street consensus is that the Fed will raise rates another half point and be done with it, a view Mr. Dudley considers too optimistic.
For now, most investors applaud Mr. Greenspan's incremental moves even in the face of a rapidly growing economy. "The only explanation of why the Fed is moving so gingerly with these quarter-point moves is that either they see the signs of a slowdown already evident in the shape of the yield curve, the price of oil, the leveling of single-family housing starts, or they believe that the lag is long between the beginning of a monetary tightening and its showing up in the real economy," said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Company of the West. "Greenspan thinks he's on a glide path here to a soft landing and he doesn't need to take more aggressive steps."
Among the biggest beneficiaries of yesterday's move were some of the old investor favorites: General Electric rose $10.1875, to $151.125, and Microsoft advanced $5.375, to $102.75. Even bank stocks rallied, which is not normally the case when rates rise because such increases are a drag on profits. The Philadelphia Bank stock index rose 4.4 percent yesterday.
Even the bond market reacted favorably to the rate increase. Prices rose across the board, pushing down yields on the 30-year bond to 5.97 percent from 6 percent Monday.
Biotech stocks continued to decline with the American Stock Exchange biotech index falling 2.3 percent. It is down more than 35 percent from the peak set two weeks ago.
Yesterday's move in stocks did not surprise Mr. Dudley, who noted that historically, Fed tightening episodes have not been all bad for equities. "On average, since the 1960's, the stock market has gone up when the Fed tightens because the Fed usually tightens when the economy is strong," he said. "What ends up stopping bull markets is inflation because that causes the Fed to shift to a truly hostile stance. Stock markets fear inflation, not Fed tightening per se."

Fed Raises Interest Rates In Effort to Slow Economy
The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy, raising interest rates by a quarter-point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation. It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June.
The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints over the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until the economy slows. Page A1. 

The stock market shrugged off the news and moved higher. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The Nasdaq composite index rose 101.68 points, to 4,711.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 37.24 points, to 1,493.87. C16.
 
Profit Rises 67% at Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs Group reported that a surge in revenue from trading stocks, bonds, oil and other commodities pushed its fiscal first-quarter net income up 67 percent, easily surpassing analysts' expectations. The earnings were $887 million, compared with $532 million in the period a year earlier, when the firm was still a private partnership. Investors bid up the shares to $118.25, a gain of $4.8125.

HEADLINE: MORE INOCULATION AGAINST INFLATION

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve clamped down a bit more on the economy today, raising interest rates a quarter percentage point in an effort to prevent an outbreak of inflation.
The move was no surprise to economists and investors, who had heard repeated hints the last month from Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, that he intended to stick to his policy of raising rates in small, steady steps until he saw signs that the supercharged economy was throttling back. 
 The stock market, which some analysts consider Mr. Greenspan's main target in raising rates, shrugged off the news and moved higher after the Fed's announcement this afternoon. Apparently relieved that the central bank did not raise rates a half-point, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 227.10 points, to 10,907.34. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,711.68, up 101.68 points.
It was the Fed's fifth quarter-point rate increase since June, and it lifted the benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 6 percent, its highest level in almost five years.
The central bank also raised its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
The moves put immediate upward pressure on rates paid by consumers and businesses. Banks began raising their prime lending rates a quarter-point, to 9 percent, which will lead to slightly higher rates on many home equity and small-business loans as well as credit cards.
The Fed's decision had a less direct effect on mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, which are largely set in the bond markets. Those rates have moved up the last year as the Fed has tightened monetary policy and are likely to continue doing so as long as Mr. Greenspan remains on inflation alert. Yields on the 30-year government bond continued to fall, creating an unusual situation in which the Fed's short-term rates were higher than the market's longest-term rates.
In a statement, the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it had raised rates again for the same reason it had done so at its last meeting in February. It said, in effect, that growth was running stronger than the economy could sustain over the long run without creating inflationary bottlenecks.
"The committee remains concerned that increases in demand will continue to exceed the growth in potential supply, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's record economic expansion," the statement said.
The committee suggested that further rate increases were likely if the economy did not slow substantially by May 16 -- the next time it meets. The committee, the statement said, "believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."
There is little evidence so far of any broad-based surge in inflation outside of the sharp rise in oil prices.
But the economy has been growing at rates well beyond what most economists think can be sustained over the long run without generating inflation. The economy grew 6.9 percent in the last quarter of 1999, and analysts think growth in the first three months of this year could be about 5 percent. Consumer spending in particular remains robust.
Mr. Greenspan has traced the danger facing the economy to the stock market. His argument -- which is being questioned on Wall Street and in Washington -- is that the recent upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or output for each hour worked, is leading investors to expect higher corporate profits and therefore to bid up stock prices.
Higher stock prices, in turn, are leaving investors feeling wealthy and willing to spend, driving up demand for goods and services. In Mr. Greenspan's view, demand is growing faster than the economy can produce supply. The imbalance between demand and supply has been contained so far through two safety valves: declining unemployment, which is providing the workers needed to produce more goods and services, and imports, which are filling the gap between demand and what domestic companies can produce.
Mr. Greenspan's point is that the safety valves cannot be counted on much longer to absorb the strains being generated by strong demand and that interest rates must rise until demand falls to a level that the economy can meet.
Mr. Greenspan has warned repeatedly that at its current pace, the economy will soon run short of workers, putting upward pressure on wages and ultimately prices. The unemployment rate in February was 4.1 percent, just a touch above its 30-year low.
The Fed chairman has also warned that the nation is approaching the limit of how much it can afford to import. His point was underscored today by the release of monthly trade figures for January, showing a deficit of $28 billion, another record and well above what economists had projected.
Mr. Greenspan has insisted that the goal of monetary policy is not to drive stock prices down. But he has made clear that in his view the pace of wealth generation stemming from the long run-up in stock prices will have to be tempered if demand is to be restrained -- a distinction that is lost on many analysts.
"The whole issue of whether he is targeting the stock market is a hot question," said Bill Cheney, an economist at John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance in Boston. "It seems to me perfectly clear that he is targeting it, and he merely has to deny pro forma that he is doing so."
Mr. Cheney said he thought Mr. Greenspan was basically right that the wealth being generated by the stock market was the source of much of the excess demand in the economy.
Other economists think that Mr. Greenspan has it all wrong, or that he is focusing attention on the stock market to avoid being criticized in an election year for slowing the economy when there is no concrete evidence of inflation.
"If the Fed were to literally threaten to raise the unemployment rate and slow growth, it wouldn't be a great political posture to take," said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, an investment firm in Chicago.
There is also sharp disagreement among economists about how much momentum the economy has and how much more rates will have to rise to erase any threat of inflation.
"We're going to see some slower growth numbers pretty quickly, good numbers on inflation, and within three to six months, you'll start hearing talk about actual Fed easing," Mr. Wesbury said.
But other analysts said the slowdown could still be a long way off and that the Fed might have to raise rates sharply this spring and summer to bring the economy under control.
"Thus far, the core cost and price data have been so benign that the Fed has been able to conduct a gradualist policy, hoping to change behavior through a slow cash flow squeeze on companies and individuals," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. "But if inflation is beginning to accelerate, however slowly, Mr. Greenspan will at least have to consider taking more drastic action."

Jets Say Johnson Is No Longer on Trading Block

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA 

 BODY:
With an exchange of bluntly worded statements that offered a glimpse into an increasingly fractious relationship, the stalemate between the Jets and receiver Keyshawn Johnson solidified yesterday.
Coach Al Groh said the Jets would no longer listen to trade offers involving Johnson, at least for now. But Groh also said that the team would not renegotiate the disgruntled star's contract anytime in the immediate future. 
 Four hours later, Johnson's agent, Jerome Stanley, responded with a statement of his own, implicitly criticizing the Jets for using the news media to communicate their stand during the contract impasse. Stanley also said that the Jets should not blame their difficult salary-cap situation for their reluctance to give a more lucrative contract to Johnson, who has two years remaining on his current deal.
"Keyshawn Johnson has consistently avoided using the media as a tool to communicate on any contractual matter," Stanley said in a statement. "Despite the coach's comments regarding Keyshawn's contract, the kind of contract comment no Jet coach has ever made, Keyshawn will maintain his policy. He feels that the fans don't want to, or need to, hear about his contract.
"As for the Jets' economic duress caused by the salary cap, that duress will still be there in 2001 and beyond. Keyshawn would like to continue to help lead the Jets to his goal of winning a Super Bowl for the much-deserving Jets fans."
The Jets had no response to Stanley's remarks. If taken at face value, Groh's statement means that Johnson is off the trading block. But in confirming what National Football League officials have been saying for two weeks -- that the Jets have neither the room under the $62 million salary cap nor the desire to renegotiate Johnson's deal -- the Jets have also put the onus on Johnson to decide whether to end the impasse and report to the team's off-season workouts, which began Monday without him. It is highly unlikely that Johnson will report and has told one teammate that he would not.
Johnson, who has two years remaining on his six-year contract, makes about $2 million a year -- well below the going rate for a receiver of his caliber. He is believed to be seeking as much as $10 million a year, with a possible $15 million signing bonus thrown in.
Stanley has privately told the team that Johnson could hold out from summer training camp if he does not get a new deal.
The Jets traditionally have not renegotiated contracts that have more than one year remaining. The team reiterated that position yesterday, stressing that a reworking was not feasible without making wholesale changes to the roster.
"The Jets have reworked numerous contracts this winter to get under the salary cap and yet continue to be under extreme economic duress with regard to the salary cap and its affect on the overall roster," Groh said in his statement. "After due consideration and in light of the fact that Keyshawn has two years remaining on his contract, our organization remains unable to address the contract of Keyshawn in the near or foreseeable short-term future."
Groh also addressed for the first time the trade rumors that have run rampant since early in the month. The Jets, fearing a protracted and divisive holdout, had spoken to at least six teams about a deal involving Johnson, but the coach said yesterday that the team "will not entertain any trade offers at this time."
Groh's statement could represent an effort by the Jets to build leverage if they ultimately decide to listen to offers for Johnson at the coming owners' meetings, which begin Sunday.
The Jets, in insisting publicly that they are not interested in unloading Johnson, could be hoping to avoid a fire sale in which they would receive less than equal value for Johnson, a two-time Pro Bowl selection. Several teams have expressed interest in Johnson -- most notably the Baltimore Ravens, who hold the fifth pick in April's draft -- For a team that lost a high-profile coach during the off-season, the organization likely reconsidered what would have been a very unpopular trade.
In the statement, the Jets said they would address Johnson's contract situation "at the appropriate time," presumably when there is just one year left on his contract. But the Jets, in careful language, also seem to say that they were prepared to move on, with or without Johnson.
"Keyshawn Johnson's nonparticipation in the off-season program in no way affects our decision-making process involving fielding the most competitive team for the immediate and long-term future," Groh said.

HEADLINE: Suspect's Death Ends Siege; Hostages Are Safe

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
Three hostages were rushed to freedom tonight in a Baltimore suburb as the police broke in on a fugitive murder suspect and shot him to death, ending a harrowing four-day siege that terrorized the Dundalk neighborhood.
The fugitive, Joseph C. Palczynski, a former convict with a history of mental illness, was shot by the police who broke into the apartment after seeing two of the hostages run for freedom after the suspect fell asleep. 
 Mr. Palczynski had been the subject of a furious manhunt since March 7 when, the authorities say, he shot to death three people after he angrily confronted his former girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, for bringing domestic abuse charges against him.
Two of the hostages, Lynn Whitehead and her boyfriend, Andy McCord, climbed from a window in the darkness before 11 p.m. as the fugitive slept on a couch. Their 12-year-old son, Bradley, was left behind, asleep in the kitchen as Mrs. Whitehead, who is Tracy Whitehead's mother, rushed to find police assistance.
Within minutes, the police in paramilitary gear rushed the house on Lange Street and gunfire erupted. They rescued the boy and shortly thereafter announced an end to the siege.
"Joseph Palczynski is dead," declared a police spokesman, Bill Toohey, at the end of the siege, which had exhausted the working-class neighborhood as residents in a four-block-square area were trapped in their houses.
The 31-year-old suspect, accused of killing four people in the past two weeks, had been lost by police officers in woodlands until he invaded the suburban home last Friday in a burst of gunfire.
Mr. Palczynski, an unemployed electrician with a history of domestic violence and prison and hospital incarceration, had been obsessively following the standoff on television, according to the Baltimore County police. At the request of the police, news broadcasters had gingerly tried to avoid inciting him.
Soon after his death was announced, a television station released what it said were tape recordings of telephone calls that Mr. Palczynski had made during the siege in which he complained that the police negotiators had prevented him from talking to Tracy Whitehead. In a desperate tone, the voice described as Mr. Palczynski's says: "All I want to do is talk to Tracy. I love her dearly. I did not mean to kill those people."
The fugitive fatally shot two of Mrs. Whitehead's friends and a neighbor who came to their aid on March 7, according to the police, and then killed a woman during a car-jacking in his flight from the police.
Mr. Palczynski's friends and family said he suffered from bipolar disorder, a manic-depressive behavior that they say resulted from a severe blow to the head in a school bus accident when he was a teenager.
Since then he had served three years in mental institutions and two years in prison, plus several years' probation for incidents usually involving the beatings of girlfriends.
The siege ended after four anxious days in which the suspect repeatedly shot at armored police cars and into the air around the apartment amid sporadic negotiations with the police. He had been armed with at least three weapons, and as the siege continued neighborhood life was reduced to the breaking point.
Cheers could be heard from one corner of the neighborhood when the slaying of Mr. Palczynski was announced.
The Whitehead family was jubilant in the midnight rain as they rushed to the police headquarters to greet the hostages. At least four dozen police officers had been stationed around the apartment, with sniper scopes and listening devices trained on the scene.
Officials, pleased that the three hostages were not harmed, said the one casualty beyond Mr. Palczynski was a neighborhood dog that threatened the police and had to be shot.
"Bradley's looking forward to playing baseball," Mr. McCord told a relative as they celebrated the end of the siege.

HEADLINE: U.S. and India, Trying to Reconcile, Hit Bump

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Wednesday, March 22

 BODY:
The United States and India opened what they called an era "of new beginnings" on Tuesday in an effort to rebuild a relationship that President Clinton said had been neglected for more than two decades. But a series of encounters, including a sharp rebuke of the president in the evening, showed that the opening chapter was spiked with surprises.
Against a backdrop of a massacre of 35 Sikhs in the Indian-held part of Kashmir just before Mr. Clinton's arrival on an official visit, the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the president signed what they called a "vision statement." It defined their common interests while pointing out that they disagreed on India's possession of nuclear weapons. 
 In an address to the Indian Parliament today, President Clinton appealed to the government to give up its nuclear arsenal, saying that most of the world was moving toward the elimination of nuclear weapons.
Speaking forthrightly but with what he called "respect for the great nation of India," Mr. Clinton said, "Only India can determine whether it is safer today than before the tests." India tested nuclear weapons in May 1998, followed by similar tests conducted in response by Pakistan.
"Only India can know whether it can afford" such weapons, he told the Parliament. "These are questions that others may ask but only you can answer."
Then in a sterner tone, Mr. Clinton added: "In a nuclear standoff, nothing is so dangerous as thinking there is no danger."
During the cold war, he said, the former Soviet Union and the United States had come "all too close to nuclear war" despite a good understanding of each other's intentions.
Mr. Clinton then urged India to take the lead in starting a dialogue with Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
"I believe India has a special obligation to show its neighbors that democracy is about dialogue," he added. "Engagement with your adversaries is not the same as endorsement."
Mr. Clinton's address was received with some scattered applause but the impassioned plea about nuclear weapons was received with attentive silence.
After talks with Mr. Vajpayee on Tuesday, President Clinton said relations between the United States and India were "too important to ever fall into disrepair again." Thus, the two countries said, the joint statement was a device to lay the foundation of a relationship without letting precise issues slow the process.
But by Tuesday evening, the tensions inherent in forging an Indian-American friendship surfaced when India's president, Kircheril Raman Narayanan, rebuked Mr. Clinton in a toast at a state dinner.
Standing before Mr. Clinton at a long banquet table, Mr. Narayanan scolded him for his description of the Indian subcontinent "as the most dangerous place in the world today."
The president has publicly used that term twice in the last two months to describe a situation where India and neighboring Pakistan have nuclear weapons and are also at the edge of a conflict in Kashmir.
But Mr. Narayanan, in a rare display of blunt talk at a black-tie diplomatic affair, said that the description was "alarmist."
"It has been suggested that the Indian subcontinent is the most dangerous place in the world today and Kashmir is a nuclear flash point," he said. "These alarmist descriptions will only encourage those who want to break the peace and indulge in terrorism and violence."
Mr. Clinton did not reply to the chiding, sticking in his toast to his theme of friendship.
The president's day began here on Tuesday with a formal review of Indian armed forces assembled in the courtyard of the colonial-era presidential palace, Rashtrapati Bhavan, and then moved on to a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial to Mohandas Gandhi.
Mr. Clinton then drove through roads swept clear of people to Hyderbad House, a former princely residence, for his meeting with Mr. Vajpayee, whose policies on nuclear weapons, more assertive than those of Pakistan, have won growing respect among educated Indians. Mr. Vajpayee, the 72-year-old white-haired leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, and Mr. Clinton had not met before.
Because the Indian leader is not considered an easy conversationalist, there was some uncertainty among administration officials about how the talks would proceed. Afterward, an administration official said that the "tone was good but it would be misleading to say that there was a brisk and free flow of ideas."
The measured atmospherics in the encounter with the prime minister combined with the sharp comments by the Indian president seemed to underline the difficulty of Mr. Clinton's undertaking to improve relations with India without having the United States appear to be a lecturing superpower.
From the time India first tested nuclear weapons, Washington has tried to convince the government here that maintaining a nuclear deterrent is not helpful to peace in the region. But India, striving to be more than just a regional power, sees its nuclear weapons as the right of an emerging major power that is a neighbor not only to Pakistan but also to China.
At the ceremonial signing of the "vision statement," Mr. Vaypayee warned that India had limited tolerance for the violence in Kashmir, which it accuses Pakistan of masterminding. "We have the means and the will to eliminate this menace," the prime minister said.
The Tuesday statement itself included a summary of the differences on nuclear weapons, saying: "The United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its security needs."
"Nonetheless," it said, "India and the U.S. are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, we will persist with and build upon the productive bilateral dialogue already under way."
In elaborating on the statement, the Indian prime minister said he had repeated in the private meeting with Mr. Clinton India's commitment not to conduct further nuclear explosive tests and not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
In replying, Mr. Clinton recognized that India was not close to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a position that Washington has been urging on the government without success since the 1998 test. The president said he hoped that the "democratic process" in India would lead to the eventual signing and ratification of the treaty by India, just like, he added, "I hope the democratic process will ultimately produce a ratification of the test ban treaty in America."
The joint statement touched on two other nuclear issues with which the administration has had only limited success with the government here. In a round of talks with the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has failed to persuade the Indians to join international talks aimed at ending the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.
The statement said only that the two countries would "work together" for an early start of the talks. On the question of export controls for nuclear-related materials, the statement said that both the United States and India would "continue to strengthen" such controls.
The killings in Kashmir on Monday night, which American officials said appeared intended by Pakistani-backed insurgents to draw Washington into a mediation of the dispute between India and Pakistan, presented Mr. Clinton with an opportunity to emphasize his prepared message of restraint.
The president made clear before coming here that he was not planning to mediate the Kashmir dispute -- a role that the Indians reject but the Pakistanis want.
But Indian officials interpreted a statement by Mr. Clinton as an embrace of their position that Pakistan must stop infiltrating Kashmir with militant fighters before talks can start. Mr. Clinton sounded as though he was saying just this when, in his joint appearance with Mr. Vajpayee, he said that talks between India and Pakistan could not be expected "unless there is an absence of violence."
White House officials quickly tried to clarify Mr. Clinton's intent, saying that because the United States was not a party to any talks between India and Pakistan it could not set any preconditions.
But a senior administration official said the Indians should take heart from "the message of support" that Mr. Clinton delivered against the violence in Kashmir.
The president summarized his position on Kashmir in four points. Both sides, he said, should exercise restraint, show respect for the Line of Control, which is the de facto border dividing Pakistani-held and Indian-held Kashmir, renew their dialogue and "stand against violence."
In a limited economic gesture to mark Mr. Clinton's visit, the White House said a $25 million program to help reorganize India's financial markets, suspended with other nonhumanitarian aid after the 1998 nuclear tests, would be resumed.

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Lynnda Collins has a hunch that she lost her job of 12 years because of her age, 51, and weight, 325 pounds, even though her former employer, the Geac Computer Corporation of Canada, told her that she was just one of many employees in its Atlanta division laid off last summer.
Hundreds of thousands of Americans lose their jobs every year, but with unemployment at its lowest level since 1970, most bounce back quickly. For obese people like Ms. Collins, though, finding a new job is not so easy, no matter what their qualifications. They live in fear of rejection for their physical appearance, and they are generally less experienced in job hunting than their slimmer colleagues because they are less likely to test the market while they are employed. 
 Over the last 26 years, Ms. Collins, who is 5-foot-6, has held four jobs. "Once I get a job, I keep it," she said.
Since she lost her position as regional contract manager for Geac, Ms. Collins says she has had only a handful of interviews and no offers. Local recruiters who spot her resume online are enthusiastic about her prospects until they meet her, she says. "You can just see this wall come down," she said. "Their eyes get cold. They get formal and polite, ask general questions, then I'm out the door."
Recruiters say publicly that their companies have policies against discrimination of any kind, but they acknowledge privately that an applicant's weight does matter. "Appearance is always a consideration, particularly at higher levels," a manager of a national recruiting firm said. "Executives are always in front of big groups."
It is not as though the people doing the hiring are all that trim. One in five adults is obese, according to a telephone survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up from just one in 10 a decade ago. Other federal surveys put the figure at one in three. According to a study by Dr. James Rippe of Tufts University, an even higher portion of senior executives at Fortune 500 companies -- 36.5 percent -- are obese.
But management's attitude is sometimes based on the considerable health risks associated with obesity. Obesity is second to cigarette smoking as the leading preventable cause of death, and it contributes to an estimated 280,000 deaths a year, according to government statistics. Every week, millions of workdays are lost to illnesses that result from obesity; the cost to employers in lost productivity and absenteeism is more than $47 billion a year, one study says.
Costs are only part of the reason that employers discriminate against overweight job applicants, says Mark V. Roehling, an associate professor of management at the Haworth College of Business at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. "People are reacting negatively on many other levels," he said. "One is just the gut reaction."
Employers are more likely to discriminate against people because of their weight than because of their sex or their race, Mr. Roehling says, and they do so at every step, from hiring to setting compensation to firing. Moreover, he says, although state and federal laws forbid discrimination against women, ethnic minority groups, old people and the handicapped, they provide little protection against weight discrimination. Michigan is the lone state where weight is a protected characteristic under a fair-employment law.
Overweight workers are "the folks left behind" in the longest economic expansion in United States history, said Walt Winstrom, a lawyer who runs the Obesity Law and Advocacy Center in San Diego. Mr. Winstrom, who is 5-foot-10 and weighs 350 pounds, added, "We're dealing with an entire mind-set of which seeking employment is only part of how we deal with issues of discrimination every day."
Perhaps the most dreaded ordeal for an overweight applicant is the personal interview. A Midwestern marketing executive named David K., who stands one inch shy of 6 feet and weighs 350 pounds, recalled the humiliation he endured a few years ago as his chat with a potential employer in New York was wrapping up.
"The only chair that was available for me to sit in was an old chair with arms that would have been fine for someone with a waist size of up to maybe 44," said David, who asked that his last name not be used. "But mine was about 52. I felt wedged in. It made me very self-conscious. As the interview finished, I stood up and took the chair with me. I just wanted to get the hell out at that point."
In mid-February, Ms. Collins was asked in for an afternoon interview with Georgia-Pacific for a position similar to the one she had at Geac. On the big day, she slept in to make sure she would be alert. She ate a light brunch of cereal and toast, wary of the butterflies sure to come, and spent a leisurely morning at home with her 8-year-old dog, Sami, a corgi mix.
It was time to get ready.
"The whole time, I'm trying to think about other things so I won't get the jitters," Ms. Collins said later. She showered, applied a touch of makeup, put in contact lenses and ran a comb through her short, sandy-brown hair with hints of gray. As she slipped on her only suit, a gray wool with black shell from Lane Bryant, she let her mind wander. She thought about Sami, about the winter cold she was fighting off, about choir practice at church the next evening -- anything but the interview.
"If I allowed myself to think about the interview, I've talked myself into believing it would be a waste of time before I even get into the car," Ms. Collins said. "By the time I get there I'd be totally dejected."
At Georgia-Pacific, she was pleased to see that the woman who was to interview her was overweight. "I remember thinking, 'Maybe this is a place I might be judged on by my ability, not on my appearance,' " she said. The interview went well, but weeks went by and then the company told her it had hired someone else.
But all was not lost. Her part-time employer, a lawyer, recommended Ms. Collins to a colleague who was looking for a full-time paralegal. The position pays about half of her previous salary at Geac. Still, it beats the $300 a week she has been making. "I try to be hopeful," Ms. Collins said. "I go through spells when I'm hopeless and I cry a lot."
Meantime, her debt is mounting. As a single woman and the only child of deceased parents, she has no one who can come to her aid. Sometimes, she says, she can't bring herself to face the bills.
"I feel myself heading down a path that my credit rating is getting ruined," she said, her eyes welling up with tears.
"I'm scraping by. I can probably keep going for a while, but I fear that I'll lose everything."

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Workplace page on March 22 about the difficulties faced by overweight Americans who seek employment misspelled the surname of a lawyer who runs the Obesity Law and Advocacy Center in San Diego and misstated his weight. He is Walter Lindstrom, not Winstrom. He weighs 240 pounds, not 350.

Flat Panel Display Prices Are Expected to Drop

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Thin is in, again. After rising in 1999 in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis, prices for flat-panel displays are going to fall steeply this year and next as supplies increase, according to speakers at the DisplaySearch Flat Panel Display conference this week in Austin, Tex.
For example, said Ross Young, president of DisplaySearch, a market research firm, Dell Computer plans to cut the price of its 17-inch flat-panel display this spring to $1,799 from the current price of $2,299. The Dell 1700FP liquid crystal display monitor has a viewing area that is equivalent to a conventional 19-inch cathode ray tube monitor, but it takes up only a fraction of the desk space, consumes less power and does not emit harmful electromagnetic fields. 
 Even at the lower price, the 1700FP L.C.D. will cost about three times as much as Dell's best 19-inch conventional C.R.T. monitor.
Supplies of flat-panel displays fell in 1999 even as demand remained strong, in part because of reduced investment in manufacturing during the Asian economic downturn two years ago. But now many new manufacturers, particularly in Taiwan, are increasing production. That will lead to an oversupply of flat-panel displays later this year and rapidly declining prices until the market stabilizes, probably in 2003, Mr. Young said.
Meanwhile, demand for other kinds of flat-panel displays is growing, for notebook computers, cell phones, digital organizers like the Palm Pilot, Internet appliances, smart watches, medical devices, electronic books and even high-definition television sets, according to conference speakers.

Japan Remains at Odds With U.S. on Telephone Deregulation

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 22

 BODY:
After two days of meetings, the United States and Japan failed to reach any agreement today on further deregulation of the telecommunications market here and extended their talks to a third day.
Other areas of the Japanese economy are also under discussion -- drugs, medical equipment and construction, among others -- but it is the telecommunications debate that has become heated because its outcome has important implications for future economic growth here. 
 The United States contends that Japan is hurting itself economically by not creating the basis for more competition in its telecommunications market, the most expensive such market for users in the industrial nations. The Americans have successfully framed the debate as multilateral, affecting not only United States companies but their European and Japanese competitors.
Even the Keidanren, Japan's traditional business lobby, has sided with the United States, not to mention blue-chip Japanese companies like Sony.
"Persistence in the old ways threatens to transform Japan into a fading giant," Richard W. Fisher, a deputy United States trade representative, told journalists here on Tuesday.
Washington is demanding an immediate 41 percent reduction in the fees that telecommunications companies pay to hook up to the network owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the former government-owned telephone monopoly that is a member of the NTT Group. NTT controls more than 99 percent of local phone traffic.
The fees, according to the Japanese government, eat up as much as 40 percent of the revenue of NTT's competitors.
But the government says it can cut the fees only by 22.5 percent over a four-year period, contending that a more aggressive move would deal a crushing blow to NTT. The election year presents a further complication because the ruling party's popularity is waning, and NTT and its subsidiaries employ 224,000 voters directly and probably as many indirectly.
The United States is threatening to take the matter to the World Trade Organization if some agreement is not reached by the end of the month, an escalation of the dispute that the Japanese want to avoid in advance of a meeting of the leading industrial nations in Okinawa in July.
"There is a wide gap between the two sides on the so-called reduction rate," said Akitaka Saiki, a spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, referring to the interconnection fees. "I think the Japanese negotiators are trying to persuade their American counterparts of the difficult domestic circumstances surrounding NTT."
Mr. Saiki said the reductions demanded by the United States could force NTT to reduce employment and increase management turmoil at a company where opinions are divided over strategy. NTT has already begun an overhaul aimed at reducing the work force by 21,000 and curtailing investment over three years, but the job cuts are regarded by many as cosmetic since they will be achieved through attrition.
The Japanese government is having trouble making its case, however, because NTT is an extraordinarily rich company, owning controlling stakes in the NTT Mobile Communications Network, or NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, and the NTT Data Corporation.
The regulators are further hampered by their own efforts to make a case to politicians for supporting sharply reduced interconnection fees. Having convinced politicians that any further reduction in the fees would hurt NTT and its callers, the regulators are now unable to easily change their stance.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Abuses in Loans to the Poor

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, added his voice today to the criticism of a growing practice by some mortgage and home-equity loan companies of seeking low-income borrowers and charging them excessively high fees and interest without adequate disclosure.
The practice, called predatory lending by its critics, can damage poorer neighborhoods, Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to a meeting of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. 
 Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Reserve was concerned about "abusive lending practices that target specific neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the population and can result in unaffordable payments," loss of homeowners' equity and foreclosure.
It was the first time Mr. Greenspan had spoken publicly on the subject. Other federal banking regulators have criticized the lending practices recently, but the remarks by the central bank chairman raised the profile of the issue.
The Fed oversees many Wall Street investment banks that have raised money for consumer finance companies, but the lenders themselves are mostly regulated by the states. Legislation to curb predatory lending has been proposed in California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri and New York.
In some cases, consumer finance companies have taken advantage of people with low incomes or damaged credit histories, many of them minorities, who cannot obtain conventional loans and are desperate to become homeowners or raise cash by borrowing against their homes. Congressional hearings have indicated that aggressive sales tactics and excessively high interest rates are increasing.
"The Federal Reserve is working on several fronts to address these issues," Mr. Greenspan said.
Among other things, the Fed has convened regulators from various agencies -- including the Departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Trade Commission and bank regulatory agencies -- to develop methods to deal with predatory lending. The group is exploring options like stricter enforcement of rules and new legislation.
A consumer advocate welcomed Mr. Greenspan's remarks but said action was needed.
"Congress knows predatory lending is a problem. The Clinton administration knows this is a problem. Now the chairman of the Federal Reserve himself is saying this is a problem," said Frank Torres, the legislative counsel for Consumers Union. "So when are we going to see laws, regulation, and enforcement to put a stop to it? Actions speak louder than words."
Industry officials maintain that finance companies provide a valuable service to consumers who have low incomes and poor credit records that prevent them from qualifying for normal loans.
"I don't think any responsible person condones taking advantage of others," said James McLaughlin, the American Bankers Association's director of regulatory affairs. But, he maintained, it is difficult to determine at what interest rate loans become unfair. "This could have the effect of drying up credit in many of the areas that are seeking credit today," Mr. McLaughlin said.

THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: SMOKING BAN VOIDED
British Columbia's Supreme Court struck down one of the toughest anti-smoking rules in the country, a total ban on smoking in bars and restaurants. The court ruled that the provincial Workers' Compensation Board had not adequately consulted with the public before imposing the rule on Jan. 1. The ban resulted in hundreds of layoffs from bars and restaurants, and prompted one rural city to try to join neighboring Alberta. James Brooke (NYT)
 
MEXICO: U.S. MILITARY WELCOMED
The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, received an unusually warm welcome from the armed forces during a two-day visit. The defense minister, Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, decorated him with one of the country's highest military medals, saying he had "distinguished himself for his respect for our country and its men in arms." Mexico's military long regarded the United States as a potential invader, but in recent years the two countries have cooperated in the drug war. Julia Preston (NYT) 

EUROPE
 
BULGARIA: THOUSANDS PROTEST
More than 6,000 people from all over the country marched in central Sofia to demand higher wages and protest against rising unemployment. The protesters waved trade-union flags and carried banners reading "We want jobs, we want bread," "Unemployment, poverty, corruption -- how much longer?" and "We have already hit bottom . . . or have we?" Students dressed in black, above, joined the march, saying they were "mourning the plight of impoverished Bulgaria." (Reuters)
 
BRITAIN: 'HATE CRIME' ARRESTS
In a series of dawn raids, the London police arrested 62 people on "hate crime" charges ranging from bias-related assaults to the publication of racist material. A spokesman for the force, condemned in an official report last year as "institutionally racist," said, "Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who, because of racism or prejudice, wish to undermine communities and destroy the principle of justice for all, regardless of color, race, creed or sexual orientation." Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
CZECH REPUBLIC: CEMETERY POSTPONEMENT
The government postponed a decision about what to do with a 13th-century Jewish cemetery unearthed during excavations in Prague for an insurance company parking garage. The government said it was studying a new proposal from Prague's Jewish minority to preserve the graves on the site, building some kind of bridge over them and allowing the company to build above them. Steven Erlanger (NYT)
 
GERMANY: MAKING AMENDS TO GAYS
Lawmakers proposed making amends to a long-neglected group of Nazi victims: thousands of men sent to concentration camps for being gay. The governing Social Democratic and Green parties introduced a bill to acknowledge Nazi persecution of gays and ask the government to review whether to annul convictions under a Nazi-era anti-gay law that remained on the books until 1969. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
YEMEN: ARAB SUMMIT SOUGHT
President Ali Abdullah Saleh has sent out envoys in an attempt to convene an Arab summit meeting. Abdullah Ahmad Ghanem, the parliamentary and judicial affairs minister, has traveled to Syria and will also visit Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: U.N. WARNING
The Security Council, alarmed by a new rebel offensive in Congo and reports of "significant" rearmament and training on both sides, demanded that the combatants stop hostilities or face the possibility a peacekeeping force will not be deployed. The council will get a report next week from Under Secretary General Bernard Miyet, who has just returned from a visit there. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
UGANDA: FIRE INQUIRY
A senior police official said investigators suspect that the victims of a fire that killed hundreds of members of a Christian cult were not covered in gasoline, as first thought. The official told the state newspaper that they think an explosion or series of blasts ignited the fire that killed more than 330 people. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
 
MOZAMBIQUE: NEW PLEA
Facing a new flood surge after nearly two months of rains that killed at least 490 and caused hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, Mozambique appealed for $100 million for rehabilitation, as aid agencies flew assessment missions up three rivers expected to flood a third time. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
PHILIPPINES: A JOKE TOO FAR
President Joseph Estrada's newly named chief of staff, Aprodicio Laquian, apologized and resigned after making a joke about his boss's late-night drinking parties. He had said that as "the only sober person in the room" he could hide drunkenly signed decrees until "the beautiful light of the morning." Mr. Estrada accepted the resignation, saying, "I didn't find it funny." Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
NEPAL: NEW PREMIER
Girija Prasad Koirala was sworn in as prime minister, the fourth time he has headed the government since democracy was restored to Nepal in 1990. Mr. Koirala, left, took the oath of office from King Birendra at the head of a 25-member cabinet. He succeeds Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, who was forced to resign after a rebellion in his party. He had been prime minister since general elections last May. (AP)
 
MALAYSIA: ANWAR TRIAL ADJOURNS
The sodomy trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, which had resumed after a two-week recess, adjourned again as the judge continued to consider the politically touchy demand by the defense to call to the stand Mr. Anwar's most prominent accuser, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Seth Mydans (NYT)

Lively City Lets Ghosts of Deadman's Island Rest

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia

 BODY:
With bay views of sea gulls, seals and sailboat regattas, a wooded peninsula here named Deadman's Island seemed just right for luxury condominiums, tailored for one of Canada's hottest real estate markets.
Without any grave marker or historical plaque to raise questions, developers moved their blueprints through city channels, pleading ignorance about the colorful name attached to the two oceanfront acres. 
 Then a neighborhood group pored through old British Admiralty logs, concluding that Deadman's Island held the unmarked graves of almost 400 people, including 183 American prisoners from the War of 1812.
"How many people want to live with 400 ghosts in the basement?" asked Graham Read, who was elected to the Halifax Regional Council on a platform of stopping a plan to build 60 condo units at the site, now a piney knoll. Last month, the council voted to spend $140,000 to buy the disputed two acres for a city park. Luxury developments are being planned for nearby, off the tiny peninsula.
The fight is a reflection of the growing pains in Halifax, a booming city that is sometimes called Canada's Seattle.
In January, a $2 billion natural gas project went on stream in the province, injecting new jobs and big salaries into Halifax, an 18th-century British Navy port. With eight colleges and Canada's highest Internet usage rate, the city has a thriving service economy.
Housing prices rose 5 percent last year, Canada's fastest rate. On Deadman's Island, half-acre lots were to be marketed for $175,000. But to some neighbors the wooded lots were not empty.
With orange construction stakes already hammered into the soil, the Northwest Arm Heritage Association stepped into the fray (the Northwest Arm is the name of the secluded bay where the peninsula is).
British military records, the association found, indicate that about 400 people were buried on the peninsula. In addition to the 183 American sailors and soldiers captured during the War of 1812, there were 104 African-Americans who died of smallpox after escaping slavery at that time. There were also 9 Spanish and 66 French military prisoners from the Napoleonic wars and 37 Irish immigrants who died of typhus in 1847 after fleeing the potato famine.
As modern Nova Scotia diversifies from its English-Scottish roots, members of the ethnic groups buried on Deadman's Island now have powerful constituencies.
"Irish?" Mayor Walter R. Fitzgerald of Halifax spluttered to a local newspaper reporter when he first heard of the ethnic breakdown. Speaking of plans to make the peninsula a city park, he said, "I'll tell you, we're going to do it for sure now."
Support for preservation also came from the city's black community, which is largely descended from African-Americans who escaped Maryland's plantation system, arriving here on British Navy vessels during the War of 1812.
While Halifax's most prestigious cemetery is the burial site of Sir Robert Ross, who burned down the White House, few people today crow about victories in the War of 1812. Nova Scotians now like to cultivate good relations with their southern neighbors from what these Canadians call "the Boston states." Given the mild winters and pleasant summers, real estate agents peddle Nova Scotia's southern coast as "Cape Cod 50 years ago."
Last year Halifax, attracted a record 73 cruise ships, carrying 108,000 tourists. This summer, with 150 "tall ships" expected in July, the city expects cruise traffic will jump by 50 percent.
"Tourism is a big moneymaker," Mayor Fitzgerald said of an industry that brings almost $500 million a year to this 250-year-old city. "With the number of American tourists coming into Nova Scotia, Deadman's Island could be part of the tour."
Tour buses already take visitors to a cemetery that holds many steerage class victims of the Titanic. Less known, but equally chilling, are the accounts of American prisoners of war who were interned on Melville Island, which faced the burying ground.
Benjamin F. Palmer, a captured sailor, wrote in his diary of 1814, "This day we embark'd for Hell," referring to his confinement with 200 other Americans in a space measuring 40 feet by 40 feet. During a 31-month period, British Admiralty logs recorded the passage of 8,148 Americans through the prison.
At least once a week, prisoners would row a new corpse across an inlet to the improvised burying ground.
Military logs recorded causes of death: typhus, pneumonia, dysentery, smallpox, asthma, pleurisy, "infection of the lungs," consumption and "apoplexy."
"With the way they were jammed in here, most of the deaths were from contagious diseases," Guy R. MacLean, a neighborhood leader, said, strolling around the old prison island, now a yacht club. The unheated stone cells, which were used as late as World War I to hold German prisoners, now serve as storage lockers for local boat owners.
Few local residents had any illusions about the sinister history of Deadman's Island. Brian Cuthbertson, a historian, found that one owner of the land, Charles F. Longley, once dug up three skulls. He placed them in the basement of a dance hall he owned, hoping to scare thieves away from his liquor supplies. Instead, the skulls were stolen.
Generations of local boys used to dare each other to go digging on the peninsula. "Our mothers used to tell us, 'Don't go on that island, the ghosts will get you,' " recalled Al Chaddock, an artist and longtime resident.
Bill Piers, another resident, recalled: "A bunch of us went out there digging, up on the top part. One of the older boys found bones. We ran like crazy, afraid the ghosts were after us." Now 50, he added, "That was the last time I was on Deadman's Island."

HEADLINE: Start-Ups Raise Pay and Offer Options as Candidates Dwindle

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The anecdote, in its many forms, is already a part of Internet lore: An executive leaves a major company for a start-up, takes a large pay cut and hopes that stock options in the new company will instead bring fabulous wealth in the future.
But thanks to an infusion of venture capital and a shortage of executives, that kind of trade-off has become considerably less common over the last year. To an increasing extent, pay experts say, executives at start-ups are receiving not only potentially enormous option packages, but large salaries as well. 
 The average vice president for sales at a start-up now makes $165,000 a year in salary and bonus, according to a survey released yesterday covering 800 American companies that have received venture capital but have not yet gone public. The average chief operating officer earns $190,000. And the typical chief executive brings home more than $200,000.
The survey, published by VentureOne, a San Francisco research company, is the first extensive study of executive pay at private, venture-backed companies, pay experts said.
The study also found that chief executives in the Washington area typically make 10 percent more than those in California and the Northeast and that employee turnover is higher in California than in the eastern part of the country.
The survey reflects the raises of the last two years, as start-ups have grown frantic over attracting managers at all levels who can help them survive the increasingly competitive Internet economy. Over the last 12 months, executive salaries at private companies have jumped 15 percent to 20 percent, said Dee DiPietro, the chief executive of Advanced-HR, a Saratoga, Calif., company that sells compensation data.
"The days of people going in as C.E.O. with $100,000 a year and 8 percent of a company's stock are over," said Stephen A. Unger, a managing partner at Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm. "C.E.O.'s want to go in with $300,000 a year and 8 percent of the stock, and they're getting it."
Driving the salary increases is a flood of venture capital, which has created a plethora of cash-rich companies, many of them scrambling to be the first of their kind to go public. The shortened period before initial public offerings, in turn, has increased the importance of hiring experienced managers, said start-up executives and human-resource consultants.
In addition, the Internet boom of the last five years has made many more people aware of the benefits of stock options and more are now demanding equity. "Stock has become a scarcer and scarcer commodity, and that's when you have to resort to more cash," said Bill Mitchell, the vice president for marketing at Astral Point Communications, a Chelmsford, Mass., company that has been offering higher salaries over the last year.
Executives at larger companies still make more money, but the gap has narrowed. The top marketing executive at a typical large or medium-sized company made $178,000 in salary and bonus last year, according to William M. Mercer, a human-resource consulting firm. That is $27,000 more than the typical marketing vice president in Venture-One's survey.
The gap, particularly for chief executives, is still big enough to force start-ups to offer stock. "The reason people leave big companies is for the equity, not the cash," said Andy Rachleff, a general partner at Benchmark Capital who disagreed with most analysts that start-up pay is increasing rapidly.
 The high start-up salaries underscore why older companies are having to fight so hard to keep employees.
Recently, for example, law firms in Silicon Valley, New York, Boston and other cities have increased starting salaries by as much as 40 percent, to $140,000. And some consulting and accounting firms are giving their associates access to venture-capital funds that allow them to invest in Internet companies without actually working for one.
The salary increases do have a downside for the start-ups, however. Many Internet companies are continuing to run losses and to drain their available cash. Adding to their payroll could keep them unprofitable longer, analysts said. "Some companies are going to run out of money," said Mark L. Smith, a managing director of Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm.
For now, though, companies see little choice but to bid for the executives they want.
Consider Rick Wysocki, who spent 14 years at Computer Associates and last year found himself with his choice of executive posts at start-ups. To woo him, Artemis Ventures, a venture capital firm in Sausalito, Calif., offered him a large stake of Again Technologies, the company he would lead. But it also agreed to pay him $250,000 a year and to move the executive offices of Again from Silicon Valley to the East Bay area near Oakland to cut Mr. Wysocki's commute, he said.
In return, Mr. Wysocki brought along four other executives, who took control of some of Again's most important divisions. Initially, one of Artemis's managing directors, Christine Comaford, thought it was offering him too much. Now that it has four fewer executive searches to undertake, however, "I think this was one of the best decisions we've made," Ms. Comaford said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The golden formulafor Hollywood success. It only happens in the movies.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel 

 BODY:
AS Hollywood gathers on Sunday to heap Oscar praise on such surprise hits as "American Beauty" and "The Sixth Sense," producers and studio marketing heads are revamping their idea of what makes for box-office success. Action heroes, happy endings, special effects and high-concept synopses are out. Flawed protagonists, shock value, downbeat twists and hard-to-explain plots are in.
The formula movie is dead. Long live the formula movie. 
 Hollywood's eternal quest for formulas exasperates Arthur De Vany, professor of economics at the University of California at Irvine, and author of numerous papers on the economics of the movie business. "Here we go again," he says. "Hollywood is generalizing from a couple of data points. Trying to read into a handful of movies some deep property of audiences is bad science and bad moviemaking.
"The evidence is plain," he adds, "There is no formula."
Movies are, Professor De Vanysays, "a business of the extraordinary." Their statistical patterns do not fit the good old normal bell curve, with a predictable average and symmetrical chances of hits and losses. Like more and more products in a wealthy society, movies depend on subtle combinations of hard-to-articulate characteristics. Formulas, new or old, cannot capture what will make a movie appeal to an audience.
Studies by Professor De Vany and W. David Walls of the University of Hong Kong (available at www.socsci.uci.edu/mbs/personnel/devany/devany.html), examine the movies' strange statistics and the strategies studios use -- mostly unsuccessfully -- to try to reduce "the terror of the box office." Movie revenues (or profits) are not like people's heights, falling smoothly around an average with no one too far out on either end. They are like earthquakes, incomes or quasar pulses. The great majority are small, but a few are many, many times greater than the others.
The average revenue or profit of the business is determined almost entirely by those very few runaway hits. The rest of the movies are box- office duds whose negative returns are statistically swamped by the rare successes. The "average" movie does not really exist.
This pattern, which is called a Pareto law, is true not just for movies in general but within every subcategory: small budgets and big ones, action pictures and comedies, movies with stars and movies without stars, even Bruce Willis films. So making only star vehicles or only small-budget movies will not protect a studio from box-office flops.
What makes the movies so unpredictable? For starters, each is a unique product, and audiences have to try it to see whether they will like it. And this unique product is playing in a tournament against an ever-changing group of competitors.
To make matters worse, how audiences experience a movie depends on what they have already seen and how they reacted to those movies: Did the films whet their appetites for more, or create a desire for something different? After a decade of antiheroes, the good-vs.-evil plots of "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" were refreshing, even though those movies recalled earlier formula pictures. And novelty takes many forms. It would be wrong to conclude that today's audiences do not want to see heroes waging special-effects battle against absolute evil, despite overwhelming odds. "The Matrix" followed that mythic outline and was a hit. Its freshness lay elsewhere.
Movies succeed when audiences resonate to what is on the screen. Customer word-of-mouth matters enormously, not just for sleepers but for all hits. That is why Professors De Vany and Walls find that a good opening weekend does not matter that much, at least for the real hits. The big successes -- the extraordinary films that garner profits -- are the movies with legs. The hits take off as information spreads beyond the control of the studio. That is true for surprises like "The Sixth Sense" and for expected successes like "Toy Story 2."
The data suggests that stars have their main effect not so much by helping movies open as by extending their runs. But most stars do not really make a difference. Professors De Vany and Walls looked at movies released from 1984 through 1996 and found only 19 stars, including a couple of directors, who had a "nonnegligible correlation with hit movies" grossing more than $50 million domestically. The top two stars were not macho action heroes but Michelle Pfeiffer and Sandra Bullock. These actresses cannot guarantee success, however. To the contrary, caution the authors, "Every star has a sizable probability of making a bomb."
And the past does not predict the future. Based on the 1984-96 data, Bruce Willis was a loser. If the study ran through 1999, including the megahits "The Sixth Sense" and "Armageddon" as well as some less successful films, Mr. Willis would be a plus. You just never know. The only way to succeed in this business is to experiment and adapt. That is why Professor De Vany admires industry practices that react quickly to information once a movie is out. Unfortunately, he says, antitrust actions in the 1950's misunderstood the business and blocked some adaptive practices, like letting studios own theaters. But studios and exhibitors developed nimble new practices. Licensing contracts encourage exhibitors to extend the run of movies that are doing well, for instance, while dumping the ones that flop.
These practices recognize the fundamental economic facts of moviemaking: the audience is in control, and moviegoers cannot explain in advance what they want to see. They know what they like only after they have experienced it.
"The real star," Professor De Vany said. "is the movie."

HEADLINE: Hostages Fled After Drugging Captor's Tea

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, March 22

 BODY:
After four days as hostages, a couple escaped from a suspected killer on Tuesday night by putting a sedative in his iced tea and then slipping out of an apartment window as he dozed.
The police then stormed the small apartment to rescue the couple's 12-year-old son and fatally shot the murder suspect, Joseph Palczynski, when he was startled awake and made a "furtive gesture." The police said he had three guns within reach. 
 The gunfire ended a three-week episode of violence by Mr. Palczynski, an unemployed electrician.
He was arrested on March 4 on charges of beating his former girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead. After getting out on bail, the police said, he kidnapped Ms. Whitehead and killed three people who tried to help her. Ms. Whitehead escaped on March 8, but Mr. Palczynski killed a woman and shot a child in the face while trying to steal a car, the police said.
Mr. Palczynski, 31, eluded the police for almost two weeks.
On Friday night, Mr. Palczynski forced his way into the apartment of Ms. Whitehead's mother, Lynn Whitehead, and held her hostage along with Andy McCord -- her boyfriend -- and their 12-year-old son, Bradley McCord, in Dundalk.
Mr. McCord said he and Bradley barricaded themselves in a bedroom and escaped injury while Mr. Palczynski shot about 50 rounds through the door.
The 25-by-27-foot apartment grew filthy, the police said. The family dog was not permitted to go outside. Bradley was tied up for most of the time, the police said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Palczynski told Ms. Whitehead, "Today is the day you're going to die," Mr. McCord said.
So the couple came up with a plan. The police and Mr. McCord said Ms. Whitehead ground up two Xanax pills, a prescription drug used to treat anxiety, and slipped them into Mr. Palczynski's iced tea.

HEADLINE: Senate Backs End to Penalty On Earnings in Retirement

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The Senate voted 100 to 0 today to remove limits on how much money most Social Security recipients can earn without losing part of their retirement benefit, reflecting the politically potent combination of an aging population and a strong economy.
The Senate's action to repeal the Depression-era policy of discouraging the elderly from working followed a unanimous vote on the measure in the House three weeks ago. In a statement from India, where he is traveling, President Clinton restated his intention to sign the bill. 
 The bill amounts to an election-year benefit increase for about 800,000 current Social Security recipients who have been losing some or all of their benefits to the earnings limit. And it holds the promise of greater flexibility in working past normal retirement age for the tens of millions of baby boomers who will enter the ranks of senior citizens in the next few decades.
Under current law, people 65 through 69 years old lose $1 of their Social Security benefit for every $3 that they earn above $17,000. A 68-year-old woman earning $23,000, for example, would lose $2,000 in Social Security payments.
The earnings limit was already scheduled to rise to $30,000 by 2002, and it does not apply to people 70 and older. The legislation would abolish the limit altogether and make the change retroactive to the beginning of this year.
Members of both parties said the earnings limit might have made sense at the time that Social Security was established in the Depression, when the unemployment rate was 25 percent, many if not most jobs entailed hard physical labor, and life expectancies were much lower than they are today.
But they said it made no sense now, with unemployment so low that companies cannot find enough workers, jobs are generally less physically strenuous, and actuarial tables lead people to plan for long lives after normal retirement age.
"Coal mines were no place for 70-year-olds," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is retiring from the Senate early next year at the age of 73. "Computer terminals are. It is as simple as that."
Many Republicans have been pressing for repeal of the limit for years, saying it was unfair to deprive people of benefits they had earned simply because they chose to work or had to work to support themselves.
"This is not a group of greedy millionaires who are being impacted by the earnings test restrictions," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. "It is lower- and moderate-income seniors who need some relief from their government to be able to survive."
The measure will go to Mr. Clinton for his signature after the House and Senate work out technical differences in their bills over whether the changes should apply in the month that people turn 65 or in the year that they turn 65.
Some members of both parties said that while they wholeheartedly supported the repeal of the earnings limit, they were uncomfortable doing so at a time when Congress and the administration had failed to make any progress in addressing the long-term financial problems facing Social Security. Without any changes, Social Security will run short of money needed to pay promised benefits starting in 2033, according to the most recent projections.
"We have not done comprehensive reform of Social Security," said Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska. "People under the age of 40 are going to pay a terrible price for that."
The Senate vote masked some complexities of the issue. Although proponents said the measure would help the economy by encouraging more people to remain in the work force or to work more, evidence about its economic effects was sketchy.
While the measure would help people who are willing and able to work, it would do nothing for those who subsist entirely on their Social Security checks. The retirement age is rising gradually over the next two decades to 67, reducing the number of people who will be affected by the earnings limit. And few of the measure's backers pointed out that the reduction in benefits suffered by people who earned more than the limit was offset by higher benefits starting at age 70.
The change would lead the Social Security system to pay out $22 billion more in benefits over the next 10 years. But those costs would be offset in subsequent years because beneficiaries would not get the increases at age 70 they would otherwise receive.
The bill would also leave in place an earnings limit on people who claim early retirement benefits from Social Security. Under that provision, people 62 through 64 lose $1 of their benefit for every $2 they earn above the limit, which this year is $10,080.
The two parties agreed not to lift the earnings cap on early retirees -- in essence encouraging people not to take Social Security before age 65 -- because research has shown that people who take a reduced Social Security benefit at age 62 are more likely to end up in poverty. The problem is particularly acute among widows who rely on their late husbands' benefits after the men retired early.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Split Stalls Effort to Reap Gains From Jump in Gas Prices

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress would love to reap political advantage from the recent surge in gasoline prices, but they are so divided over what to do that they cannot act decisively.
The division was apparent today in the House of Representatives. After a debate that involved little more than finger-pointing, the House passed a toothless bill that would require the president to submit a report on which oil-exporting countries were fixing prices and then "undertake a concerted diplomatic campaign" to persuade those countries to lower prices.
The main reason for the high prices is that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and one major producer that does not belong to the cartel, Mexico, have limited production. The price of a barrel of crude oil is now about $30 a barrel, up from $12 a year ago. There are 42 gallons in a barrel. 
 As a consequence, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, about $1 a year ago, is now more than $1.50 and climbing. It is expected to reach $2 in some parts of the country by the summer.
As originally introduced, the bill before the House today would have required the president to cut foreign aid and military sales to countries that fix oil prices. Last week, the International Relations Committee voted to make the sanctions discretionary. And on Tuesday night, Republican leaders knocked the sanctions out of the bill altogether.
Asked what happened, the main sponsor, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican from upstate New York, said lawmakers from oil states who are satisfied with the high prices had exercised their clout. "They've done things to take the teeth out of it," Mr. Gilman said.
The bill was approved, 382 to 38.
In the Senate, several Republicans from oil states who have formed what they call the oil caucus gave speeches today advocating such steps as a reduction in the gasoline tax and tax breaks for oil wells that produce 15 barrels a day or fewer. There is general agreement in the Senate that neither of those measures will become law.
While the lawmakers were making speeches, hundreds of truckers were on Capitol Hill lobbying for relief from the high fuel prices.
Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, has been traveling around the globe this week meeting with officials of oil-producing nations -- countries that belong to OPEC as well as those that do not.
OPEC members will meet on March 27 in Vienna, and Mr. Richardson has said he expects them to agree to increase production. Jay Hakes, head of the government's Energy Information Agency, told a Congressional panel today that OPEC would have to increase production two million barrels a day to "move prices back into the normal level."
The debate in the House sounded like a "did so, did not" squabble.
Mr. Gilman accused the Clinton administration of being "asleep at the switch for the last 18 months."
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, declared, "This administration has no credibility in the world, and everybody understands that."
Mr. DeLay accused Mr. Richardson of "tip-cup diplomacy," begging oil-exporting countries to lower prices.
Democrats responded in kind. Taunting the Republicans for having offered such a weak bill, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, said, "This has them quaking in Kuwait, terrified in Venezuela."
In mock horror, Mr. Frank said, "A report is coming."

HEADLINE: Council to Call for Tax Cut Weighted to Help the Poor

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The City Council, answering Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's $2 billion tax cut package, intends to propose exempting poor people from the city's income tax and giving a much larger tax cut to the middle class.
The tax cut plan is to be released this morning as part of the Council's response to the mayor's proposed budget for the 2001 fiscal year. The plan comes as the Council has been challenging the mayor on several fronts, from welfare reform to management of the city public markets. 
 Citing higher revenue than the mayor had projected, the Council is also calling for $355 million in additional spending, first to restore money the mayor wants to cut from libraries, cultural institutions and parks, and to pay for new initiatives like enhanced police training, hot meals for the elderly on weekends and higher salaries for some city librarians. The extra revenue would help pay for a $37.2 billion budget, 1 percent more than the mayor's budget, and it would also be used to increase the city's budget reserve, for use in case of a recession.
"Everybody will benefit," said Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Council's finance committee. "But we have to do something extra to tell the taxpaying middle class that they can continue to live in the city of New York."
The Giuliani administration quickly called the Council's income tax restructuring plan unacceptable. Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said he thought it would never get the support of legislators in Albany, who would have to approve such changes.
"We already have a progressive income tax," Mr. Lhota said. "Why push for something that is politically impractical?"
The Council proposal, which comes in response to a budget plan Mr. Giuliani offered in January, represents one of the first steps in the Kabuki dance of sorts that occurs each spring as the two branches of New York City government try to compromise on how the city spends its money. The city is in an envious position, because this fiscal year should end with a surplus of at least $2.3 billion, money that can be used to help balance the coming year's budget and pay for the tax cuts.
The two tax cut packages would give back about the same total to city residents and businesses, starting at about $550 million in 2001 and climbing to about $2 billion by 2004. The biggest single chunk under both proposals -- about $800 million a year once it is fully in place -- would result from eliminating a 14 percent surcharge on the city's personal income tax, first added in 1991 during the city's fiscal troubles.
But the Council and mayor are offering drastically different plans for distributing this money. Under Mr. Giuliani's proposal, the 14 percent surcharge would be eliminated for all city taxpayers. A person earning $20,000 to $30,000 would save about $60 on average, and a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $500,000 to $1 million would get an annual tax cut averaging $2,977.
Under the Council's plan, those earning less than $10,000 would pay no city income tax. On the other end, taxpayers earning $500,000 to $1 million would see a cut of only 5.7 percent, or an average of $1,310 a year. And taxpayers with an income of $20,000 to $30,000 would get a 24 percent cut, averaging $97 a year. Over all, any taxpayer earning less than $150,000 would get a cut larger than 14 percent, and those earning more would get a smaller cut.
Mr. Lhota said the 14 percent surcharge should be removed the same way it was imposed. "It was imposed on all taxpayers at the start," he said, "and when we eliminate the surcharge everyone who is paying the tax should have it eliminated."
The extra spending the Council is advocating is possible because of its more optimistic revenue forecasts. The Council staff estimates that the current fiscal year will end with a nearly $3 billion surplus, instead of $2.3 billion. And the Council expects that an extra $1.2 billion will be available next year, mostly as a result of higher tax receipts.
With this extra money, the Council wants to restore $159 million in cuts proposed by Mr. Giuliani, including $42 million from libraries, $5 million from parks and even $3.5 million from the City Council budget.
Mr. Lhota criticized the extra spending, saying it was exactly what he would expect from the Democratic controlled Council. "It is unfortunate," he said, "that City Council believes that its sole purpose in life is to spend more and more money."

HEADLINE: Clinton Implores India's Legislators to Shun Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: AGRA, India, March 22

 BODY:
Before leaving politics behind and heading out to tour India's heartland, President Clinton laid out a picture of the world today in which this nation would have the "ability to shape the character of our time" by renouncing its nuclear weapons.
Making an impassioned argument to the Indian Parliament, Mr. Clinton laced his comments with respect for a country that is sensitive to being lectured to, but reminded its leaders that the United States and Russia are also planning to sharply reduce their stockpiles. 
 The president said that India, whose leaders told him during talks here that the nation was committed to keeping its nuclear weapons but would not carry out further tests, could make an immense impact with its choice.
"If India's nuclear tests shook the world, India's leadership for nonproliferation can certainly move the world," Mr. Clinton said to an audience that included Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, his cabinet and legislators. In talks on Monday, the prime minister told Mr. Clinton that India needed to maintain a nuclear deterrence for its security. India tested nuclear weapons in May 1998 and its neighbor Pakistan quickly followed.
The prime minister's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, has argued that its nuclear deterrence has kept the conflict from widening in Kashmir, the Himalayan territory claimed by both India and Pakistan where their forces clash along an uneasy cease-fire line. But Mr. Clinton pointed out that the massacre of 35 Sikhs in Kashmir this week reinforced the need for dialogue.
The president's speech in the circular Parliament chamber capped the official part of his visit to India. Immediately afterward, he took on the mantle of special tourist as he began a three-day tour of India. With his daughter, Chelsea, Mr. Clinton visited the Taj Mahal on the outskirts of this northern Indian town, posed against the majestic backdrop of the white marble tomb built by a 17th-century mogul in honor of the love for his wife, and then disappeared inside for a personal tour.
The complex at the Taj Mahal was closed early this morning in preparation for Mr. Clinton's arrival so that when he and Chelsea emerged arm-in-arm for their walk toward the mausoleum, the lawns and the building itself, usually teeming with tourists, were devoid of people. The president and his daughter stopped several times, and on the orders of photographers, looked this way and that for what was considered the hallmark image of his India trip.
The White House used the opportunity to make a political point at the Taj Mahal, where pollution is threatening the marble sheen of the dome and minarets. In an outdoor speech afterward, with the Taj as a backdrop, Mr. Clinton pledged to help India reduce greenhouse emissions and encourage energy conservation.
But nuclear weapons were the most intense subject of the Clinton visit. The public umbrage taken on Monday by the president of India, Kircheril Raman Narayanan, at Mr. Clinton's description of the subcontinent as the most dangerous place on earth, lent an extra tension to the differences between the United States and India as they tried to forge a new relationship. Mr. Clinton tried to defuse this strain by insisting in his address today that he was speaking as a friend who respected India's diversity, democracy and recent efforts at economic reform. And he posed the question that has often befuddled those who have just come to know India, and even those who have known it for ages.
"From a distance, India often appears as a kaleidoscope of competing, perhaps superficial, images. Is it atomic weapons or ahimsa?" he asked, referring to the message of nonviolence perpetuated by Mahatma Gandhi. "A land struggling against poverty and inequality, or the world's largest middle-class society? Is it still simmering with communal tensions or history's most successful melting pot? Is it Bollywood or Satyajit Ray? Swetta Chetty or Alla Rakha? Is it the hand loom or the hyperlink?"
The answer, Mr. Clinton said, was that "no single image can possibly do justice to your great nation." He praised India's embrace of information technology. "When Americans and other big software companies call for consumer and customer support, they're just as likely to find themselves talking to an expert in Bangalore as one in Seattle," he said to a round of applause. And he said he understood India's concern that the rules of the World Trade Organization advance "the cause of social justice around the world."
But Mr. Clinton tried hardest as he talked about India's nuclear strategy.
"I can only speak to you as a friend about America's own experience during the cold war," he said. Despite direct dialogue with the former Soviet Union, a fair understanding of each other's intentions and very good spies on both sides, "we came far too close to nuclear war."
One of Washington's major concerns about the standoff between India and Pakistan is the almost total lack of dialogue and the apparent belief in the two capitals, New Delhi and Islamabad, that possessing nuclear weapons is perhaps not all that dangerous.
"We learned that deterrence alone cannot be relied on to prevent accident or miscalculation," Mr. Clinton said, as the chamber listened to this part of his speech attentively but largely silently. "And in a nuclear standoff, there is nothing more dangerous than believing there is no danger."
The only passages of Mr. Clinton's nuclear appeal that won applause were his deference to India and the choice before the nation: "Only India can determine its own interests. Only India can know if it truly is safer today than before the tests." He added: "I do not presume to speak for you or to tell you what to decide."
Indian government officials have often chided the Clinton administration for what it calls its hypocrisy in telling another nation to give up nuclear weapons when the United States maintains a vast arsenal.
Trying to deal with it head-on, Mr. Clinton said he was aware he was speaking on behalf of a nation that has possessed nuclear weapons for "55 years and more."
But, he said, the United States has dismantled more than 13,000 nuclear weapons since 1988, helped Russia to dismantle its nuclear weapons and agreed to an outline of a treaty with Moscow that would reduce the remaining arsenals by half.
Mr. Clinton followed his appeal on nuclear weapons with another appeal: for India to cast aside its misgivings and to take the initiative in beginning talks with Pakistan over Kashmir. "I share many of your government's concerns about the course Pakistan is taking," the president said, referring to the military government that took power in October.
But he suggested that India could afford to take the high road because unlike Pakistan, it is a democracy.
"A special opportunity" awaited India to "show its neighbors that democracy is about dialogue," he said. "It does not have to be about friendship."

HEADLINE: Oil Producers' Loan Program Falling Short On Takers

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
A federal panel designed to offer subsidized loans to independent gas and oil companies whose business suffered when prices were low has received nearly two dozen applications for loans, the Department of Commerce says.
The program, created by Congress last summer, would offer guarantees on private loans totaling as much as $500 million for qualifying oil and natural gas producers and small oil-field service companies. The government would promise to repay 85 percent of the amount borrowed, up to $10 million per company, if they failed to repay the loans themselves. 
 At the end of last month, the deadline for filing for loans, 23 applications were received by the Emergency Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Board totaling $68,173,972. The deadline had been extended twice before February.
Charles E. Hall, the executive director of the oil and gas loan board, said the number of loans requested was "significantly lower than anticipated." The board would determine how to manage the remaining money, including the possibility of considering another round of applications later, Mr. Hall said.
The loan requests come at a time when gas and oil prices are rising sharply. The price of a barrel of crude oil was more than $30 this month, up from $12 a year ago.
"The operating dynamics are better today," Mr. Hall said, "but there are still fundamental problems entrenched in the industry. A couple of months of good oil prices are not enough to rectify the situation."
Over the last few years, hundreds of small oil and gas producers have been struggling with record levels of imports that had been hitting the market at low prices, resulting in thousands of American workers losing their jobs.
Independent oil and gas companies qualify for the loans, as outlined by the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program, if they have experienced layoffs, production losses or financial losses since the beginning of the oil import crisis, during which oil prices began to drop severely in 1997.
The goal of the program was to encourage lending to companies that could not otherwise obtain credit. All loans guaranteed under the program must be repaid in full by Dec. 31, 2010.
A similar program was also created for steel companies, and they have applied for loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Scott Espenshade, the vice president of economics for the Independent Petroleum Association of America in Washington, said that more companies might have applied if less paperwork had been required.
"We are dealing with small businesses here of 20 employees or fewer, often family owned," Mr. Espenshade said. "They typically do not have this kind of financial reporting."
From December 1997 to the middle of 1999, Mr. Espenshade said, the oil and gas industry lost roughly 65,000 jobs. And despite some recovery, the industry has made up only about 7,000 of the jobs.
"This program has been good for the industry, but it is not necessarily the cure," Mr. Espenshade said. "We certainly hope that changes are made to the plan to help the industry get back on its feet."
The loan guarantee board is reviewing the applications and should have recommendations by April, Mr. Hall said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Lifts Nasdaq and Pushes S.& P. Over 1,500

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Irrepressible optimism about high-technology propelled the Nasdaq stock market to its biggest gain in almost three weeks yesterday and lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index above the 1,500 mark for the first time.
But investors resumed their general disregard for smokestack and other blue-chip shares, sending the Dow Jones industrial average, down as much as 118 points at one stage. It closed with a 40.64-point loss. 
 "It is a fever that has gripped the country," said Harry Cohen, manager of the Smith Barney Appreciation Fund, referring to demand for computer and other high-technology stocks that has generated huge wealth and added urgency to the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool off the supercharged American economy so inflation remains in check.
Noting that the Fed, headed by Alan Greenspan, raised interest rates again just the day before, Mr. Cohen added: "The market is spitting in his eye."
Robert Harrington, head of listed equities trading at PaineWebber, pointed to Micron Technology as a catalyst for the latest rally in technology. It jumped 8 1/4, to 139 1/2, as investors reappraised the memory-chip company's quarterly report, which included a profit shortfall, after the market's close on Tuesday.
"The whole chip sector is just on fire," Mr. Harrington said. Intel, which climbed 5 5/8, to 144 1/16 on turnover of 26.8 million shares, made the biggest positive contribution to all the major averages. The shares are up 75 percent so far this year.
Cisco Systems, which supplies much of the infrastructure for the Internet, jumped 333/64 , to 1441/16 , lifting its market capitalization above $500 billion and making it the first company based in California's Silicon Valley to break that ceiling. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., and General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., are the only other companies valued above that level.
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 153.07 points, or 3.25 percent, its biggest gain since March 3. At 4,864.75, the index is up 19.6 percent so far this year but is still 3.6 percent below its peak on March 10.
The S.& P. 500 rose 6.77 points, or 0.45 percent, but that was enough to push it to 1,500.64, setting a record for the second consecutive day. For the year, the index is ahead 2.1 percent.
As for the Dow industrials, only 12 of its 30 components managed gains as the 0.37 percent loss left the average at 10,866.70, down 5.5 percent for the year.
The biggest drag came from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, down 47/16 , to 86, and Honeywell, down 37/16 , to 46 1/4. Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil each lost more than 2.
While investors in technology basked in further good fortune, apparently also fueled by rumors of a settlement of the Microsoft antitrust case, some of those who concentrate on beaten-down industrial stocks took some comfort from the announcement of a second buyout of such a company in two days.
An investment group led by the management of U.S. Can offered to buy the maker of plastic and steel containers for $21 a share and the stock leaped 415/16 , to 1913/16 . Cameron Ashley Building Products was bid for on Tuesday.
Values have fallen so far that they invite takeover or privatization, said Andrew M. Brooks, a top trader at T. Rowe Price.
Nasdaq's national market industrial index surged 3.9 percent yesterday, an exceptionally strong performance but still far less than the 9.2 percent surge for Philadelphia's index of semiconductor stocks or one comprised of biotechnology companies. The Wilshire 5000 gained 1.2 percent.
On the New York Stock Exchange, volume edged up to 1.08 billion shares; 1,661 stocks rose, and 1,338 fell. There were 69 new 52-week highs and 40 new lows.

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Reuters) -- Long-term Treasury bond prices rose modestly yesterday, their eighth consecutive session of gains, as investors took advantage of attractive yields after the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates on Tuesday and hinted that incremental rate increases would continue.
Five-year and 10-year notes saw the most activity, traders said, while the 30-year bond rose 2/32 , to 1033/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.96 percent from 5.97 percent.
"All in all, it was a day of relief following the F.O.M.C. meeting from yesterday," said Charles Reinhard, market strategist at ABN Amro. He was referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, which increased the federal funds target rate a quarter percentage point, to 6 percent, and lifted the discount rate the same amount, to 5.5 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.L.O., Long in Eclipse, Regains Some Prominence

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 22

 BODY:
Marginalized by decades of obscure work and a lack of enforcement power, the International Labor Organization has recently gained some renewed prominence for a possible future role in helping police the way nations protect workers' rights.
In the rush of public concern over globalization, the organization, a United Nations specialized agency, has found that its work to promote basic labor rights in all countries is suddenly relevant. Part of the reason is a debate in both the rich and poor nations over whether minimum labor standards can or should be linked to trade. 
 And unions are pressing for stronger worker protection in global trade pacts, an idea resisted by developing countries.
The debate comes as the organization is striving to change under new leadership. The agency is also trying to improve ties to the United States, which once considered it a toothless and irrelevant bureaucracy that ignored Soviet bloc labor violations. Indeed, the I.L.O. has been out of the limelight for so long that scholars may be among the few who recall that it won a Nobel Prize in 1969 for its work on labor injustices.
Juan Somavia, a Chilean diplomat elected a year ago to run the labor agency, has promised to modernize its bureaucracy -- one so steeped in old ways that a significant part of its staff cannot use a computer.
At the same time, the Clinton administration has been giving the agency significant financing for its campaigns against child labor and for basic workers' rights. Last spring, Mr. Clinton became the first American president to address the I.L.O. annual meeting in Geneva.
"With globalization, its essential mandate has come into prominence," said Andrew Samet, the top official in the Labor Department on international labor matters.
Just a few days ago, the I.L.O. work to curb child labor was underlined as Mr. Clinton visited Bangladesh, a country once notorious for the number of young children toiling in its garment industry. I.L.O. monitors have helped Bangladeshi authorities remove thousands of children from garment sweatshops in recent years, and Mr. Clinton announced $8.6 million in aid to Bangladesh to help expand the effort.
The I.L.O. sets guidelines covering areas that include female workers, working hours and migrant workers. Governments, workers and employers have equal voices in how the guidelines are formulated.
Critics say this structure is ineffective because it relies on consensus among three often-competing groups. "The I.L.O. may have the competence, but its procedures are a bit cumbersome and slow," said Giampiero Alhadeff, head of Solidar, a Brussels-based alliance of nongovernmental organizations associated with the trade union movement.
Mr. Somavia says he wants to update the agency, which has a two-year budget of $481 million. Friendly and energetic, Mr. Somavia walks through the agency's Geneva headquarters and pops unannounced into offices, a contrast with his predecessors' formal style. But he faces a work force of 2,200, with entrenched rights; dismissals are nearly impossible and layoffs are costly.
In the labor-standards area, the organization's biggest weakness is a lack of enforcement power. It can examine compliance by its 174 member countries but has no authority to punish violators. A case in point is Myanmar, formerly Burma. Opponents of the government contend it uses 800,000 forced laborers on public works and army projects. Last year, the I.L.O. barred Myanmar from technical assistance and agency meetings. But the country cannot be expelled or fined.
Mr. Somavia, interviewed recently in his office, said penalties were not the point. "I would not be in agreement that unless you have them, there is nothing you can do," he said. Mr. Somavia argued that labor conventions and treaties have an important role. "When countries ratify such conventions, they become national law and are enforceable in national courts," he said.
The strength of the I.L.O. is that it "can mobilize shame against a country," said Dan Cunniah of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. But to be effective, he said, the agency needs stronger tools against violators. Proposals to tie I.L.O. standards to trade have been floated over the last few years, but advocates are reluctant to push them too aggressively. They want to avoid alienating developing countries that fear enforcement of labor standards because it would hurt their competitive advantage.
Labor standards, argued Pakistan's trade negotiator, Munir Akram, are "a new protectionism" that threaten to "bedevil all future trade negotiations."
Under a possible compromise, the I.L.O. and the World Trade Organization, which does have some enforcement power, would share jurisdiction over such labor issues. American officials have urged a joint committee to examine how international trade relates to basic labor standards -- that would mean prohibitions on child labor and forced labor, and the right of workers to form unions and bargain collectively. "The growing reality," Mr. Somavia said, "is that a global economy needs a social floor and that can be found in the work the I.L.O. has done previously."

HEADLINE: Campaign Memo;
Gore, Mum on Reform, Raises $700,000

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Perhaps it was best not to call attention to the incongruity. Vice President Al Gore has been trumpeting his "passion" for overhauling the campaign finance system, even while scooping up money and emerging from the primary season as the richest candidate in the race.
But today, while holding perhaps his most successful fund-raising session, he refrained entirely from mentioning his newfound "priority" of eliminating the large, unregulated contributions known as soft money. 
 It might have been a tad awkward had he made that pitch. Here he was in the St. Regis Hotel, sitting down to two lunches in adjacent rooms and taking in more than $700,000 from about 75 people for the Democratic National Committee in one hour.
Over the next two days, with a lunch in Cincinnati, two receptions in Detroit and two in Houston, Mr. Gore is expected to raise at least $1 million more for the party, which has a goal of $100 million this year.
Rather than tell his listeners that he did not want their money, Mr. Gore told them how well the economy is doing. The booming economy, or "unprecedented prosperity," as he calls it, has been his central theme for months, and he devoted his comments today to underscoring how the Clinton-Gore administration had retrieved the nation from what he has called the "mess" of the "Bush-Quayle recession."
He also gave an audition of sorts to one of the people who has been mentioned as a potential running mate, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, the 45-year-old freshman who, like Mr. Gore, is the relatively centrist son of a relatively liberal senator and who grew up mostly in Washington.
Mr. Bayh is honorary chairman of the Democratic Business Council, which is made up of about 100 business leaders who give at least $15,000 a year to the party. The group sponsored today's lunches.
Mr. Bayh introduced Mr. Gore, calling him "one of the principal architects of this economic renaissance" and hailing him for his "courage" on fiscal management, in favor of free trade and in favor of overhauling the welfare system.
"What this election really boils down to," Mr. Bayh said, "is, in the small hours of the night when the chips are down, while America may be sleeping, the stakes are high in the White House -- who do you trust?"
Mr. Gore took the microphone and said, "Evan makes a great speech, doesn't he?" as the knowing audience chuckled. Mr. Gore went on to praise Mr. Bayh's record as governor of Indiana and called him a national leader on fiscal responsibility and education reform.
Later, Mr. Bayh demurred when asked if he felt he was trying out for the part. But he did suggest that he has been thinking about what is involved in a national campaign.
"It does take a lot of energy," he said. "I remember from my father's run for the presidency in 1976, I took a semester off from Indiana University and went to Iowa and New Hampshire. And as I recall, it's almost as much of a physical endurance contest as anything else, and you've got to have a certain amount of stamina. When you're dog tired, you have to be able to still think quickly and speak coherently."
Among those in attendance at the fund-raiser were Terry McAuliffe, President Clinton's fund-raiser in chief; Mitchell Delk, an executive at Freddie Mac; James Free, president of the Smith-Free Group; Cliff Hudson, president of the Sonic Corporation; Justin W. Dart Jr., the industrialist and advocate for people with disabilities; John Hechinger, retired co-chairman of the Hechinger home-supply stores; Pepper English, executive director of BellSouth Corporation; Trish Vradenburg, a freelance writer, and Jeff Modisett, former attorney general of Indiana and now executive director of TechNet.

HEADLINE: Gentlemen, Merge Your Manufacturers;
Consolidation Hits on Virtually All Cylinders

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 22

 BODY:
The consolidation of the global auto industry has reached a full-throttle roar as automakers around the world respond to the changing economics of the business.
The list of companies partly or entirely acquired by other manufacturers in the last two years was impressive even before the frenzy of the last two weeks: Chrysler, Volvo Cars, Nissan, Saab, Fuji Heavy Industries, Suzuki, Daihatsu, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley and Rolls-Royce. Since the beginning of last week, General Motors has agreed to buy a fifth of Fiat; Ford Motor has agreed to buy Land Rover from BMW; and DaimlerChrysler has moved close to taking a one-third stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Daewoo and Samsung are both up for sale in Korea, with deals likely later this year. 
 The consolidation, which is forcing consumers to choose from an ever-dwindling number of automotive groups, is driven by three broad trends: strong brands are increasingly important; manufacturers need to enter difficult markets; the cost of technology keeps rising.
Though the strategies of the leading manufacturers sometimes overlap, Ford and Volkswagen have mainly tried to acquire internationally known brands; DaimlerChrysler and Renault, of France, have mainly sought to enter new markets like Japan and Korea; and G.M. has mainly pursued ways to acquire new technology and parts more cheaply.
Some independent automakers are being driven into the arms of rivals by financial distress, as in the case of Nissan and Mitsubishi, but more are compelled to act by the steeply rising cost of technology, particularly for developing new, low-pollution engines and alternative propulsion sources like fuel cells. Automakers that cannot afford to develop vehicles with cleaner engines, better performance on the road and improved safety features risk being shut out of the European, United States and Japanese markets, either by regulation or by competition from cars designed by more financially solid rivals.
Though big automakers have long wanted to acquire their smaller rivals, only recently have many smaller companies been interested in deals as they face rising technology costs, said Alan G. Perriton, the president of G.M. Korea and G.M.'s executive in charge of new business alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Until recently, among smaller companies "there was a greater sense of, 'I could do this myself and in my own fiefdom,' " Mr. Perriton said. "That has come home to a sense of reality, that you can't do that."
Higher gasoline prices have also made smaller manufacturers slightly more attractive because they tend to be strong in small, fuel-efficient cars.
Nine years of economic stagnation and recession have turned most of Japan's once proud automakers into takeover targets, rather than acquirers. Two exceptions, Honda and Toyota, have stayed financially sound through their robust performances in the United States but have for the most part shied away from international deals for fear of cultural clashes.
Vibrant economies. meanwhile, have given manufacturers with most of their sales in Europe and the United States the financial means to lead the consolidation. Executives at these manufacturers deny, however, that the simple pursuit of ever greater size is what motivates their deals.
"We think the consolidation is inevitable," said Jacques A. Nasser, chief executive at Ford. "It isn't about getting bigger -- that is not why we do it -- because it is about being better and quicker and making sure that what we're doing fits into an overall strategy that makes sense."
Consumer advocates have been watching the consolidation with varying degrees of wariness, while expressing concern that the biggest remaining companies not merge with each other.
Jack Gillis, the auto expert at the Consumer Federation of America, said that with so much competition among divisions at each automaker, as well as competition among different automakers, there was little opportunity for raising prices beyond what the costs justified. Ford's acquisitions of Jaguar and Volvo, for instance, have benefited consumers over all, he said, by allowing Ford to improve Jaguar's quality and to adopt Volvo's safety technologies across a much wider range of vehicles.
"The consolidation we've seen in the auto industry in the last year and a half is positive for the consumer," Mr. Gillis said. "If it continues, however, we may need to be concerned about the creation of some mini-monopolies."
But AAA, formerly the American Automobile Association, has worried that car buyers might end up paying for today's mergers with higher sticker prices for blandly similar cars. "It really dilutes creativity and presents a temptation to raise prices," said David Van Sickle, director of automotive and consumer information for AAA, which has 42 million members.
Ford and Volkswagen, which used to share reputations for inexpensive, even utilitarian cars, have pursued independent but strikingly similar strategies. Both have sought to escape the narrow profit margins and overcapacity of the mass market by moving upmarket.
They are buying luxury brands -- Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin for Ford, and Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini for Volkswagen. And they have tried to expand sales and reduce costs for these brands by investing heavily to increase production and by combining orders with other divisions for deep discounts from auto parts suppliers. Ford, for instance, is quadrupling sales of Jaguar cars through such steps as introducing the S-Type, which is based on the same underbody as the new Lincoln LS. The S-Type sells for $43,000 to $48,600, much less than other Jaguar models.
DaimlerChrysler and Renault have stressed instead the need for geographical diversity, mainly to limit their exposure if Europe ever suffers the kind of prolonged recession that Japan has endured. Daimler-Benz made itself a huge player overnight in the United States market by buying the Chrysler Corporation. It may be about to do the same in Japan if, as expected, it buys a third of Mitsubishi; the Japanese company's board gave its president broad authority today to negotiate a foreign alliance for the company.
Renault has made itself a big player in Japan and has indirectly re-entered the United States market by taking what has turned out to be a controlling stake in Nissan. Now Renault is seeking to buy Korea's insolvent Samsung Motors, which produces a Nissan-designed car at a Nissan-designed factory in South Korea and would allow Renault and Nissan to compete in Korea's virtually closed market.
"The only way to get into the Korean market is to become a Korean manufacturer," said Louis Schweitzer, chief executive at Renault.
G.M., a company run by finance executives more than marketers since its formation in 1908, has characteristically looked for ways to use corporate alliances less for marketing than for reducing expenses, particularly the soaring cost of engines, transmissions and other sophisticated pieces of machinery. As a result of this strategy, of the five big automakers leading the consolidation, G.M. is the only one motivated by the same rising technology costs that are causing smaller automakers to want to be acquired.
Some of the biggest economies of scale are found these days in engine production. Assembly plants tend to become too big to manage efficiently if they produce more than 250,000 or 300,000 automobiles a year. But engine factories are designed to churn out 500,000 or more engines a year.
With engines accounting for a tenth of the cost of a vehicle, part of Fiat's appeal for G.M. was its unusually efficient, highly automated engine factories, which will now produce engines for G.M., too. G.M. also surprised its main technology partner, Toyota, by agreeing this winter to buy certain low-pollution V-6 engines from Honda, which makes better engines at lower cost than practically any other company in the world.
"It is a much less expensive strategy to acquire, when technology is available, than to develop it yourself," said Mr. Perriton of G.M.
Building engines at a competitive cost depends not just on having immense, highly automated factories but also on spreading the research and development costs across as many vehicles as possible. These research costs are now soaring, partly because governments are imposing much tighter tailpipe emissions standards.
Family automobiles in the 1950's, for example, produced three or four grams a mile of smog-causing nitrogen oxides. To keep ahead of the rising number of miles driven, United States regulators have required that large sport utility vehicles emit only 1.1 grams a mile in the 2001 model year and that cars emit only 0.2 gram -- a difficult task that automakers struggled to accomplish. But in December, President Clinton signed a new rule that all family vehicles, cars and sport utilities be limited to just 0.07 gram a mile by the 2009 model year -- a herculean task.
Most easy gains -- from simply cleaning the exhaust by adding catalytic converters and other such technologies -- have already been made. So, manufacturers are now working on sophisticated, computerized systems for managing engine performance and fuel flow, with the goal of making the exhaust much cleaner even before it goes into the catalytic converter. Other governments around the world are following the United States example of ever stricter regulations.
At the same time, new propulsion technologies like fuel cells are starting to show so much promise that auto executives are compelled to invest huge sums. Such are the costs of this research that the biggest automakers have already formed research alliances. G.M. is allied with Toyota, and Ford has formed a partnership with DaimlerChrysler and Ballard Power Systems Inc., a fuel cell company in Vancouver, British Columbia. The existence of huge research blocs makes the future even murkier for relatively small, family- controlled companies like BMW and Peugeot, both of which are frequently cited as possible targets for acquisitions.
Even the proudest, most independent companies, including those that have resisted marketing alliances, have acknowledged that they cannot go it alone in responding to environmental regulations and technological changes. "Environmentally friendly cars will soon cease to be optional," Fujio Cho, president of Toyota, said in an interview. "The costs of developing environmental technologies are well beyond the reach of any single company."

Mexico to Raise Oil Output, but Tells U.S. Not to Be Pushy

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 22

 BODY:
Joining the frenetic jockeying before an oil producers' meeting next week, Energy Minister Luis Tellez said today that Mexico had decided on an oil production increase of less than 325,000 barrels a day starting in April.
Picking his words carefully, Mr. Tellez cautioned the United States not to be too blunt in pressing the oil nations for increases in output, warning that heavy lobbying could backfire by stirring nationalist political opposition. "The big players of the oil market have already said there needs to be more oil," Mr. Tellez said. "The message has gotten through. The facts are there. I think a proper decision will be taken." 
 Some American lawmakers -- their constituents paying soaring prices for home heating oil and facing the prospect of continued steep gasoline prices -- have sought to press the producers to pump more oil. Senior members of Congress have called on the Clinton administration to take antitrust action against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Mr. Tellez said President Clinton had "achieved a very fine balance" with his relatively mild suggestions to speed up production.
Since Mexico is not a member of OPEC, Mr. Tellez said he would not attend its oil ministers' meeting that begins on Monday in Vienna, but would send a deputy. He has been on the phone in recent days, telling many of his counterparts that Mexico has decided to raise output and encouraging them to do the same.
Mexico will disclose the final figures for its increase as soon as OPEC makes it announcement. Starting in March 1998, when demand was lagging and prices down, Mexico responded with cutbacks that amounted over time to 325,000 barrels a day. The reductions were part of an agreement with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela that expires on April 1. Mr. Tellez said the new increase would not completely erase that cutback. Mexico, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, now pumps 2.9 million barrels a day.
With a presidential campaign under way in this country, the government's opponents have accused Mr. Tellez of deferring to the United States and sacrificing Mexican interests by favoring larger supplies of oil to bring down prices. A newspaper cartoon depicted him as receiving credentials as "the second ambassador from the United States."
But Mr. Tellez argued that continued high prices could slow the world economy and eventually depress growth in Mexico. "We are most interested in having a dynamic world economy," he said, adding: "What we want is a stable, profitable price. For that, we need a stable supply of oil."
A government poll shows that most Mexicans, despite their strong patriotic attachment to the nationalized oil industry, agree with him. In a nationwide survey, 75 percent approved of raising production to bring down prices.
In December 1998, Mexico was getting less than $8 a barrel for its crude oil. Today, after price increases powered by OPEC's cutbacks as well as the continued economic boom in the United States and the rebound of some Asian nations, Mexican oil is selling at $24.26.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Are Rising, but Not the Tempers, Yet

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
This is not the gasoline shortage of the 70's.
True, the per-gallon cost has been going up so fast that the price placards at the curb seem to flip over as fast as the digital readout on the pump. A gallon of regular in the New York metropolitan region cost an average of $1.44 last month, up from $1.06 last year. Prices in the city itself are even higher. 
 Some bus and courier companies have applied surcharges to compensate. Some motorists are buying regular instead of premium, or using the car only at night or taking public transportation to work. But no one, it seems, is going out of business.
And instead of the fistfights and fender-benders that marked the long gas lines of the early 70's, drivers are grumbling but bearing it. After all, at least there's plenty of gas to buy.
But some people are cutting back.
Mary Szumski, a cabdriver from Brooklyn, limits herself to $12 worth of premium at a time for her personal car, a gas-guzzling 1981 Jaguar, and rides the bus when she goes to Manhattan to shop. But she is not even thinking about getting a more efficient car. Like many people, she does not expect the high prices to last more than a few months.
"It's only for a short time, so it's O.K.," she said as she pumped $1.79-a-gallon premium gas into her tank at a station in Red Hook, Brooklyn. "And you've got to pay it. You have no choice."
Dmitri Serebryakov, a limousine driver from Brooklyn, said that having to pay more to fill up twice a day "hits me right in the pocket" since he has to absorb his fuel costs. So whenever he is in New Jersey, where gas prices are lower than in New York, he makes a point of gassing up.
But in southern New Jersey, Ed Crane, of Medford, said he was commuting to Philadelphia only in his Ford Taurus. "Our other car is an S.U.V.," he said, "and we don't take that out at all these days because of the prices."
If the spike in prices does indeed prove brief, the local economy is not expected to suffer seriously, forecasters say. Most expect prices to rise to as much as $2 a gallon by summer and then begin dropping by fall.
"As long as it doesn't seem as if prices are going to continue to go up," said David Wyss, the chief economist at the market forecasting arm of Standard & Poor's, "we're in good shape."
Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization, said most businesses did not alter their strategy based on short spurts of price increases. "Clearly, there are places where the impact is more immediate," he said, "but across the board, I don't see a big, big change out there."
Bravo Messenger Service in Teaneck, N.J., is one of the businesses that has been seriously affected, and its customers now pay a 5 percent surcharge. "Most of them are pretty good about it," said Jeff Levy. The higher fuel costs have actually been good for business, Mr. Levy said, because people are more likely to consider hiring his service for office errands.
For more than a month, Essex County commuters traveling on the DeCamp Bus Lines have been charged 30 cents more per ride because of the rise in diesel fuel costs. But diesel prices, which are tied to the demand for home heating oil, are beginning to decline. If that trend continues, said Gary P. Pard, a vice president at DeCamp, the surcharge may be eliminated by April 30.
But there will be no surcharge -- or service reduction -- on buses operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which expects to spend an extra $9.2 million on diesel fuel this year, said Albert W. O'Leary, an authority spokesman. Though unwelcome, the additional expense is a relatively small part of the agency's $3 billion operating budget, he pointed out.
As for cabs, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission is in the "initial stages" of examining whether a surcharge is warranted, said Diane McGrath McKechnie, the commission chairwoman.
Usually, when delivery costs go up, the prices of goods and services also go up. But John L. Wieting, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics' regional commissioner for the New York metropolitan region, said there was no indication that other prices were rising -- not so far, at least. "We have yet to see a surge in prices outside the energy sector," he said.
Mr. Wieting speculated that many businesses might be reluctant to pass on the costs in so competitive a marketplace. "There's a great deal of resistance on the part of consumers to higher prices," he said.
And there's no question that despite the robust economy, many people will go out of their way for a bargain. The Wawa market on Route 70 and Eayerstown Road in Medford, N.J., has been mobbed ever since a local news program reported that it had the lowest prices in Burlington County, said Jen Garron, the manager. "It just gets a little more hectic every day," she said.
In New York, officials said, the citywide average for a gallon of regular gasoline is up to $1.65. But they urged consumers to shop around, since prices vary. According to a survey by the Department of Consumer Affairs, the Gasland station at 425 Vanderbilt Avenue on Staten Island charges $1.57 a gallon for regular gasoline, the lowest in the city. (The highest is $1.74 at the Mobil station at 1132 York Avenue, in Manhattan.)
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has seized on surging gas prices as a major theme for his Senate campaign, said "ivory tower" economists have underestimated their effect.
"They don't have to pay the bills," he said.

HEADLINE: New Systems for Controllers May Ease Air Traffic Woes

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, March 16

 BODY:
A red warning on a screen told an air traffic controller here that two west-bound passenger jets, flying 100 miles apart over Tennessee and Alabama, were on courses that would intersect 250 miles ahead, setting up a possible collision over Arkansas.
Jim Ashe, a flight controller in Memphis, quickly set a new course for American Airlines 843, ensuring that it would get no closer than five miles to United 1801 -- and, as a bonus, shortening its route. The warning turned from red to yellow. 
 It might seem that in the digital age such computerized procedures to pre-empt conflicts would be routine. But they are not. Until now, a controller would not have detected collision courses until two planes were already in the same narrow sector, and he would quickly have had to bark orders to the pilots.
But the new computerized system used by Mr. Ashe at the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center enables a controller to study a much broader swath of sky and to test new routes with a few clicks of a mouse.
As the Federal Aviation Administration and the airlines prepare, with some dread, for another busy summer when there are more planes in the sky and more thunderstorms to skirt, they are counting on this new system and similar measures being introduced gradually around the country to help avoid the widespread problems and delays of last summer.
Potential collisions pop up dozens of times in an air traffic controller's shift. "Memphis is like the corner of Hollywood and Vine; it's all happening here," said Rick DeSantis, Mr. Ashe's partner, who was running a sector called Conway High. Traffic for Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and Denver continually crisscrossed overhead, seeking higher altitudes for better fuel economy or lower ones to avoid turbulence, and always asking for more direct routes.
"This is a tough one," Mr. Ashe said as he studied the intersecting routes of the American Airlines jet bound for the Dallas-Fort Worth airport from Cleveland and the United plane headed to Denver from Atlanta. But it seemed simple as he used the mouse and keyboard.
The F.A.A. sees the prototype of the software Mr. Ashe was using, called Conflict Probe, as the beginning of a revolution and a contrast to the agency's troubled modernization efforts.
Earlier this month, Congress passed a $40 billion, three-year aviation investment bill, and President Clinton announced a new program of collaboration among the airlines and the F.A.A. to reduce delays.
But the real hope for decongesting the system, experts say, is in software tools like Conflict Probe.
The goal is to have all five computer programs in place by 2002, by which time, if it does not get help, "the system will have serious constraints" and will "be near gridlock," said Charles Keegan, director of Free Flight, the F.A.A. effort that developed the software.
Free Flight is a break from the last 40 years of air traffic control, during which planes have been dispatched like trains, following fixed tracks through the sky and sometimes, impossible though it seems, running short of space up there.
Under Free Flight, the same kinds of advanced computers that already let airlines list 30 different fares for seats on the same plane or let a pilot fly thousands of miles with a few keystrokes are coming to the air traffic control business. The F.A.A. is now using computers to choreograph planes, instead of to simply organize data about them. Building radar mosaics and attaching data tags to each blip, the controllers know which plane is which and can now organize the traffic itself.
After wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on failed modernization projects that would have replaced the basic air traffic tools, the agency is having more success with its Free Flight strategy, which uses stand-alone systems that represent more manageable technological leaps.
The new software, for example, gathers data from the main air traffic control computers, but does not use the processing power of the computers themselves, which is already fully taxed. It does something no human could manage: it looks at hundreds or even thousands of flights and, like a master chess player, figures out where each will be much later in the game.
For years, the F.A.A. has made the system simple enough for controllers to handle by chopping it into smaller and smaller sectors. The computer can assemble the big picture by looking across many sectors.
The system allows corrections much earlier in a flight path, which means that turns are gentler and altitude changes are less frequent, with the plane staying closer to the altitude that is optimum for fuel efficiency. It may resolve a conflict by calculating that one plane should slow down by 10 or 20 knots, something controllers cannot often calculate in their heads with sufficient precision to prevent a conflict.
On average, the system at the Memphis center shortens the route of each airplane by about 1 mile, saving some 6,000 miles a day.
By the end of 2002, the system will be installed in another 7 of the 19 other Air Route Traffic Control Centers around the country, F.A.A. officials say.
The agency says a system for managing runway use will also soon be expanded beyond its use in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The Dallas-Fort Worth airport has four runways, each controlled by a different controller. The system, called Passive Final Approach Spacing Tool, recommends which planes should go to which runways, sorting them by size and other characteristics so they can get as close as is safe.
With the spacing tool, "you don't miss assigning a turn to someone because you are worrying where the seventh guy in line is going to have to go with a runway assignment," said Bill Blackmer, safety and technology representative at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. "It buys the controller time," he said. "A lack of time is our enemy."
The new system has allowed controllers to land an extra two planes during each of the 12 rush periods at Dallas-Fort Worth.
A related system, the Traffic Management Adviser, figures out how to merge airplanes arriving from three or four different directions into a single line that is evenly spaced.
Another new tool tells an airline what everyone wants to know: exactly when is a flight going to arrive? The question is important for the airlines because if the delay is too long, the plane will be diverted to another airport. Sometimes the delay turns out to be manageable but the airline does not know that, so it diverts because of uncertainty.
The last system, called Collaborative Decision Making, announced by Mr. Clinton on March 10, involves conference calls every two hours among the F.A.A. and the airlines.
But in Conway High, a sector which tracks planes at altitudes from 24,000 to 34,000 feet, the route adjustment Mr. Ashe had made with Conflict Probe went sour. The American plane picked up a stronger tailwind than expected, and the warning turned red again. So Mr. DeSantis turned the United plane by 20 degrees to the right, to make it cross well behind the other flight's path. Without the early intervention, he said, he would have had to turn the United plane by 40 degrees.
Then the two controllers used the new software to determine that they could direct the United plane straight to Garden City, Kan., saving a left turn and cutting several minutes off the flight. The system also informed all the other controllers who needed to know.
What is more, by evaluating whether the system can accommodate the altitude and route changes pilots ask for, the new procedures have a side benefit of spreading out the traffic and reducing conflicts.
This is essential to keep up with all the flights, said Mr. Ashe, who added that traffic handled by Memphis had roughly doubled in the last 15 years.
Mr. Ashe, who was appointed by his union to help develop the new tool, said that while some controllers were initially reluctant to use it, "now, people don't want to do without it."
And increasingly they will need it. "The aircraft numbers are going to go up, regardless," Mr. Ashe said.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Saddam's Sudan?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
What do you do with a disturbing national security tip from a usually reliable source? You check it out, of course, with intelligence operatives who have no ax to grind.
But what do you do when those analysts say that they pondered the report at interagency meetings and doubt its accuracy -- but it could be true and bears watching? All I can do is pass along the disputed report with appropriate caveats. 
 It was first hinted at six months ago in a paragraph by the well-connected Bill Gertz of The Washington Times: "A Pentagon intelligence agency reported earlier this month that North Korea offered to sell the government of Sudan an entire factory for assembling Scud missiles."
That didn't seem to add up, because Sudan is nearly broke and doesn't need long-range missiles to fight its civil war. Where would the money be found to finance the missile factory, and who in that area wants the Scuds?
Enter Amir Rashid, Iraq's oil minister and Saddam Hussein's chief procurer of ballistic missiles.
Two years ago, I'm told, Rashid paid a secret visit to Pyongyang and saw North Korea's missile marketer, Chon Byong-Ho. Saddam's man also visited the Chang Gwang Sinyong Corporation, a key world source of illicit arms.
Topic A was Scuds, many of which were secreted by Iraq in Sudan to escape U.N. detection. A year later, Iraq's chief engineer, Ra'ad Ismail Jamil, received a North Korean delegation in Baghdad.
Only five weeks ago, says my informant, two delegations arrived in Khartoum, capital of Sudan. One was a group of North Korean technical experts; the other was a military research mission from Baghdad.
Their project? The Koreans are said to be working on building a ballistic-missile plant near Khartoum, with Iraqi financing of $475 million. Pyongyang gets a big chunk of that for turnkey construction and expert staffing; Khartoum a smaller percentage for acting as cutout, site protector and smuggler; and Baghdad gets its old missiles refurbished and new, longer-range missiles built.
If true, such conspiracy among three rogue nations would spell big trouble. So I rattled some American intelligence cages; had they heard of this three-pariah missile deal?
All had. The story (without the recent Khartoum meeting) has been bruited about for months, including the $475 million figure. It was the subject of two interagency meetings; the White House was briefed.
The current U.S. assessment is that any Iraqi-financed missile factory "cannot be confirmed," although there is no doubt that North Korea has been peddling arms in Sudan. "The report is impossible to stamp out," says a frustrated doubter. Another derogates the story that won't go away as "rumint" -- merely rumored intelligence.
Their logical reason for skepticism is that Sudan is heavily infiltrated by Iranian operatives, who might sabotage or publicize any Iraqi plant. Another is that newly secure Pyongyang is now in the midst of a charm offensive, which will soon include the first visit to Washington by a high-level diplomat since the end of the Korean War. This huge weapons deal would run counter to that opening.
On the other hand, there is reason for skepticism about the spookery's skepticism. Eighteen months ago, on indirect evidence later questioned, President Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack at the Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant. Our spies may now be super-cautious.
On the third hand, I am inclined to take the rumint seriously because this method of outsourcing his secret weapons development to a rogue-state neighbor so neatly fits Saddam Hussein's interest. Also, if true, a secret Sudanese missile plant financed by Iraqi oil sales would argue cogently against efforts to appease Saddam by lifting economic sanctions, so avidly desired by the Jiang-Putin-Chirac cabal at the U.N.
Wait -- this just in. Porter Goss, chairman of the Permanent House Select Committee on Intelligence, is willing to go on the record: "We have been concerned with the development of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems in Sudan, as well as Sudan's ties with North Korea. The matter is receiving our attention."

S.& P. 500 Tops 1,500 On Appetite for Technology
Optimism about high technology lifted the Nasdaq composite index 153.07 points, or 3.25 percent, to 4,864.75, its biggest gain in almost three weeks, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose above the 1,500 mark for the first time, closing at 1,500.64, up 6.77 points.
But investors resumed their general disregard for blue-chip stocks, and the Dow Jones industrial average, down as much as 118 points at one point during the session, closed with a 40.64-point loss, to 10,866.70. Page C12.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cracks Down on Rise In Appalachia Moonshine

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: ROCKY MOUNT, Va., March 16

 BODY:
Grinning seditiously, a prominent citizen of this Blue Ridge foothills town takes from his kitchen refrigerator an illegal gift from a moonshiner friend: a syrupy red liquor in a quart jar packed with grapelike damsonberries. He offers a taste to his visitor. It is a brandy, sweet and silky.
"Damson's the best," he says. 
 Next he selects a half-gallon jar of heart-stopping white lightning, as clear as vodka. Shaking it, he points to the "bead," or head. Bubbles that form a thick, beery bead indicate toxic contamination from sleazy stills that use old car radiators to condense the vapors from cooking and fermentation. But this bead is wafer-thin. "Look," he says. "No lead."
It might all seem a quaint act of hospitality merely appropriate to this town of 4,400 that likes to boast of being "the moonshine capital of the world," here in a southern Appalachian region that over the last two centuries has produced more moonshine than any other in America.
But to a task force of state and federal agents brought in to fight it, the illicit whiskey of Rocky Mount and the surrounding area is little other than the work of big-time criminals -- a new generation of moonshiners who in many cases have transformed the smoky little woodsmen's stills of legend and song into efficient distilleries, some capable of producing thousands of gallons of liquor a week.
The task force, applying the muscle of federal law rather than weaker state anti-moonshine statutes, made its first arrests earlier this month. Three people were charged with illegally distilling alcohol, and many more arrests are expected.
Rocky Mount is the hub of the trade, which investigators say operates here in Franklin County, in three or four nearby counties in south-central Virginia and just over the line in North Carolina.
Most of the illicit brandy is the work of exacting hobbyists, and seldom leaves the area. But moonshine whiskey, mass-produced at as much as 150 proof or even more and with little attention to health or safety, is growing as a product of interstate commerce. Even after a decade of unmatched national prosperity, resilient pockets of poverty provide ready markets -- in this case, throughout much of the East -- for a low-priced, illegal high.
Once a sideline of dirt-poor farmers who made whiskey in 50-gallon stills to get by, moonshining is now carried on here with 800-gallon stills, sometimes 5 or 10 linked like railroad cars, in a well-organized, high-profit business. Government investigators say hundreds of thousands of gallons of moonshine a year flow over the highways from Virginia and North Carolina, free of all state and federal taxes or regulatory scrutiny.
Moonshiners produce whiskey for as little as $3 a gallon, the investigators say, then package it in six-packs of gallon plastic jugs, a thicker-gauge variation of milk containers, and sell it, unlabeled, for $10 or $12 a gallon to nip joints, shot houses and the back rooms of bars in Philadelphia, Richmond, Washington and Baltimore. The bars then sell it for as little as $1 a shot, much less than the price of lawful whiskey.
Though the investigators do not know how much the moonshiners as a whole earn from their activity, the business here has grown big enough to draw a response from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
About two decades ago, the bureau, turning more of its attention to the control of guns and explosives, largely abandoned its pursuit of untaxed liquor, an effort that had dated from the 1920's and Prohibition, when organized crime delivered vast amounts of moonshine to the nation's speakeasies. Two years ago, however, the bureau was called in by the alcoholic beverage control agencies of Virginia and North Carolina, bodies long frustrated by public tolerance of bootlegging and by local courts that treated moonshining much like speeding violations.
Together, the bureau and the two state agencies organized Operation Lightning Strike, to fight moonshiners unlike those of decades past.
"What you've seen over the years," said Bartley H. McEntire, the federal agent in charge of the investigation, "is a shift in how they operate." Rather than selling their liquor themselves, Mr. McEntire said, "these organizations use hired hands and hired transporters," or bootleggers. "They aren't your good ol' boys." Wily and resourceful, this new breed of moonshiner tends to be armed with night-vision goggles and two-way radios to help stay a jump ahead of the law.
Federal agents' past efforts to fight moonshining in cooperation with state regulators have been largely fruitless. But this time, said Sharon Burnham, assistant United States attorney in nearby Roanoke, the investigation is much broader and tougher: for the first time, federal money-laundering statutes will be used as a weapon against moonshiners.
"Under the federal liquor laws, they're facing up to five years in prison," Ms. Burnham said. "Under the money-laundering laws, they're facing up to 15 years."
In Operation Lightning Strike's first arrests, early this month, the agents charged a man with operating a 1,000-gallon still. Also seized were his two employees: a Mexican couple, both illegal immigrants who lived and worked at the site with their three young children.
Profits from moonshining can be serious money here in Franklin County, where a waning of the textile industry and a decline in tobacco and dairy production have cursed the economy. Those profits have been a boon, too, investigators say, for a few enterprising and newly land-rich families whom the government has named, though not yet charged, as leaders of the local moonshine industry.
For the most part, residents of moonshine communities see still operators as good people, said Allen G. Hudson, deputy director of the Virginia alcohol agency's Bureau of Law Enforcement. "It's an awkward situation," Mr. Hudson said. "They are good for the economy. They hire people locally and buy materials locally. We don't get a lot of cooperation, because they see them doing more good than we can do them."
William G. Davis, a former assistant United States attorney in Roanoke, is the area's leading defense lawyer for people charged with moonshining. Like many others in town, he acknowledges that illegal liquor is produced here. But the government, he says, has exaggerated the extent of it.
What is worse, Mr. Davis said, is the investigators' manner. "To me, it's the hobnail-boot approach," he said. "They're riding roughshod over people, calling them liars. They are mean."
In one instance, agents shut down the Helms Farmers' Exchange, a farm and garden business that was one of Rocky Mount's biggest retail and wholesale concerns. It was owned by Ramsey and William Helms, brothers in their 50's, and it included a warehouse two miles outside of town on busy Route 40 West and an imposing red-brick store on Main Street downtown, just a block from the county courthouse and the sheriff's office. Agents say the brothers had a sideline in moonshine supplies that dwarfed their legitimate commerce.
The government confiscated from the store and the warehouse 9,648 one-gallon jugs, 32 100-pound bags of sugar, 4 bags of rye and 14 boxes of Mason jars, and from Ramsey Helms's home a gun, radio scanners and a family photo album. Nine days after the raid, Ramsey Helms put a gun to his chest and killed himself. Since then, the agents have frozen $86,442 in William Helms's checking accounts and made a claim on 113 acres of his land, in effect a lien so that the government can sell it if Mr. Helms is charged and found guilty of ill-gotten gains.
Stripped of their money, business and personal vehicles, and livelihood, William Helms and his wife, Bonnie, are living on the charity of friends, Mr. Davis says. In answering the government's court requests to search and seize property, the Helmses told the court that all the property ultimately taken from them had come from inheritances and from income earned through legitimate commerce.
But the investigators' leading targets are 60-year-old Ralph D. Hale and several members of his family. The agents say that from 1990 through 1998, Mr. Hale and his wife, Judy, filed tax returns showing annual joint income ranging from $21,149 to $33,139. Yet, the government maintained on March 6 in an affidavit related to its request for a search warrant, Mr. Hale is the person code-named Hat Man in the journals of the Farmers' Exchange. According to the journals, Hat Man bought 17,925 100-pound bags of sugar, paying close to $700,000, and 2,710 bundles of one-gallon containers for which he paid $42,000. With the sugar, the affidavit said, he could have produced 179,250 gallons of illegal liquor, worth $1.8 million at $10 a gallon.
The Hales have also amassed many assets, including land on which illegal stills have been found. Holdings that the government has frozen are mostly in Mrs. Hale's name, with the rest in the names of family members other than Mr. Hale. They include nearly 400 acres worth $681,900, $59,405 in mutual fund accounts and $54,991 in bank accounts.
 Mr. Hale, reached by telephone on Monday, declined to comment.
Though choosing not to comment on those figures, Mr. Davis, who expects to represent the Hales in any criminal case, said, "A whole lot of that information" is "incorrect." The allegations attempt to portray the Hales as "monsters," he said, "and it's not true."
In fact, in the minds of some, even admitted moonshiners are far from monsters, instead little more than a link to a proud tradition. Even as the government crackdown continues, Rocky Mount's business people are divided over whether to shun or celebrate the area's historic bond with moonshine. Brian G. Duvall, executive director of the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, says one contingent has proposed building a moonshine museum and even producing boutique liquor, in a legal still.
Ultimately, though, "we need to get away from it," said David Furrow, a prominent lawyer here. "It would be nicer if it were in the past, and we could say we used to be the moonshine capital of the world."
 
Whatever the Word, It's Against the Law
Hardscrabble farmers and mountaineers, primarily in the forested hills of lower Appalachia, have been making whiskey illegally since the earliest days of the Republic, when the government began taxing it.
Tax collectors call this illegal whiskey non-tax-paid liquor. Those who produce and consume it call it white lightning, rotgut, skull cracker, happy Sally or stump, but most often moonshine.
Of unknown authorship, the word "moonshine" has applied for more than two centuries to whiskey produced in the light of the moon, out of sight of government agents.
The Oxford English Dictionary traces its etymology to 1785, citing a reference that says, "The white brandy smuggled on the coasts of Kent and Sussex is called moonshine."

The episode was one of those that have led some of the area's people to accuse state and federal agents of a "hobnail-boot approach." In another raid, last spring, a Virginia agent helped destroy illegal stills. (Bonnie Helms)(pg. A18)

HEADLINE: No More 'Pssst!' For Iranian Rugs, But Who Cares?

BYLINE: By CHRISTIE BROWN 

 BODY:
THE 13-year-old import embargo on Iranian rugs is lifting, but that doesn't excite anyone at the Bloomingdale's store in Manhattan.
"Embargo?" said a rug salesman, referring to an open secret at department stores nationwide. "We've always had plenty. We buy them from two vendors on 34th Street." Ranging from $500 to $50,000, brand-new Iranian rugs -- "we just got a shipment last week," he said -- are even on sale this week. 
 Smuggled carpets from Iran have been pouring into the country ever since the United States imposed a ban on Iranian products in 1987 in response to clashes in the Persian Gulf. They come mainly from Canada, with bogus paperwork to pass customs. "The quantity of Iranian carpets coming into this country will not change," said Leslie Stroh, publisher of Rug News, a trade paper in New York. "Just the statistics will. Yesterday they were smuggled rugs; tomorrow they'll be 'legally entered' rugs."
The government's decision to restore legal access to Iran's fabled rug market -- whose time-honored traditions have defined both connoisseurship and opulence -- is mostly drawing yawns all around. One big reason, aside from the porousness of the American border, is that while Iran long dominated the industry, it has spent the last 13 years sitting in the penalty box. In the interim, India, Pakistan, Turkey, China and Egypt have increased production of their handmade rugs, which are now often considered better than Iran's. "The whole business has flip-flopped," said Graham Head, president of ABC Carpet & Home in New York. "The goal of Indian carpet makers 15 years ago was to look like the Persians. Now Iran's goal is to copy the Indian carpets."
Prices have reversed position as well. As an example, Mr. Head mentioned a carpet currently all the rage: a classic Persian Heriz design made by Afghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan, that sells for $12,000. He said the same basic design, made in Iran, would be priced at only $2,000, and would still be a tough sell because of bad dyes, bad washing and boring execution. "It's just incredible the amount of junk they've produced," he said. "They look like machine-made carpets." It is not only the countries making the rugs that have changed, but American tastes as well.
"What I think of as the classic Persian rug -- vivid colors, high knot count, intricate design -- is not what's selling," said Rosalind Rustigian, owner of Rustigian Rugs in Providence, R.I., and president of the Oriental Rug Retailers Association. "What I'm selling are soft colors, flowing designs with a patina of age and texture."
Buyers are turning their noses up at the traditional Iranian Tabriz and Sarouk styles, full of Oriental flower power or heavy red and blue, reminiscent of Grandpa and Grandma's parlor. Now the fashion is for muted colors. The top of the heap are Oushak and Agra designs. Originally derived from designs made in Turkey and India, respectively, they are now copied by weavers from Egypt to China, and are notable for their big geometric patterns and bland colors -- salmon, cream, orangey brown and moss green.
All this borrowing of designs across borders has made the country of origin almost irrelevant to buyers who once turned their noses up at anything not labeled Persian (so called because of the famous weaving centers in Persia, in the time before Iran formally existed as a nation).
"What matters now is color and design, not country of origin," Mr. Head said.
The New York interior decorator Kitty Hawks agreed, saying that she foresees no stampede to Persian-made rugs by her customers. "My clients couldn't care less where a rug comes from," she said. "On a purely aesthetic basis we've gotten used to the Oushaks and Agras. They're much easier to use than a formal-garden carpet that can take over the whole room."
Almost alone, auction houses are eagerly awaiting the end of the embargo. They will now be able to sell in America the expensive antique Persian rugs that have long been languishing in Europe or elsewhere, off limits to collectors. (Purchases made abroad were denied entry into this country.)
In the interim, prices have risen steadily for America's inventory of rarities: 16th- and 17th-century Persian carpets (ranging upward from $50,000), small tribal rugs from the Caucasus mountains and the newly popular antique Turkish Oushaks and Indian Agras that routinely fetch more than $50,000. A large 19th-century Agra rug that sold at retail for $90,000 around 1990 brought $240,000 at Christie's in 1997.
Yet the middle of the antique market, made up of many Persian rugs woven between 1870 and 1930, has declined about 50 percent in the last decade. Lumped in here are the ubiquitous red and blue Sarouks and garden-variety Tabrizes.
AN example is an intricately woven 4-by-6-foot Kirman rug that was made in Iran around 1900 and is up for sale at Christie's next month. Featuring a cartouche on an ivory field covered with twisting flowers, it should bring $3,500 to $4,500, by Christie's estimate. "Ten years ago it would have brought $6,000 to $8,000," said Elisabeth Poole, the head of Christie's rug department. "It's just very Persian taste, and that's completely out of fashion now."
Brand-new Persian carpets have also dropped steadily in price as a result of devaluations in both currency and quality. "Iranian carpets are now half to one-third the price they were in the early 1980's," said Steven Peykar, one of three Iranian brothers who own the Nourison Rug Company in Saddle Brook, N.J. The company, which is the country's largest importer of handmade carpets from China, Pakistan and India, sells to department stores, including Bloomingdale's and Macy's.
Before the 1987 embargo, the total wholesale value of Oriental hand-knotted rugs imported to the United States was $500 million, said Mr. Stroh of Rug News. (That's about $750 million in current dollars). Iran had the biggest share of that market, 28 percent, followed by China and India. When Iranian imports show up in the statistics next year, Mr. Stroh said, they will probably place fourth or fifth -- about where they have been all along during the embargo.
No one expects to see Iran back on top of the rug pile any time soon, except perhaps at the "going out of business" sales held at airports and hotels, which are prime arenas for cheating consumers. As Ms. Rustigian put it, "The lifting of the ban is a heyday for the G.O.B.'s, where the consumer is just determined to buy an Iranian rug and doesn't know the difference between one worth $3,000 or $30,000."
Both now and in the long term, industry experts agree, Iran faces tough competition. Iranian weavers will have to adjust their designs and colors for a share of the American market. There is interest among buyers in the possibility that the Iranians will make the changes, but no high hope.
Mr. Head, of ABC Carpet, is planning to fly to Tehran next week to look at rugs. "I'm ready to be very disappointed," he said. "They need a fresh, new approach and fresh, new designs that others will want to copy." And, he said, they will need money from joint partnerships with Americans. "Then -- in two, three, four, five years -- you'll see wonderful things being produced."
"After all," he added, "there wouldn't have been a Monet if there hadn't been people to sponsor the arts."
But India, Pakistan, China and Turkey may not be easy to push to the background again. "The quality has been degraded so much by the smuggled goods," Mr. Stroh said. "That's what's upsetting. There should be a premium for rugs for Iran, but there's not. Iran will never dominate the market again."
 
Trade Secrets
IF you plan to buy an Oriental carpet from any of the dozen or so rug-producing countries, from Iran to India, China to Pakistan, the professionals say there is a quick way to tell a bad dye job, which is the carpet equivalent of a lemon:
Rub a damp rag lightly over areas where the colors seem too deep or vivid to be true. Excess dye will come off on the rag, indicating that the carpet will bleed when it is cleaned.
Trust your eyes: if the colors seem ugly and harsh -- even to the untutored eye -- chances are the dye job is bad.
To test for bleaching (which is done to give rugs "instant age"), separate fibers at the carpet's base. Just as with a bad hair job, the roots will be darker. CHRISTIE BROWN

HEADLINE: MG's Faithful Get Hopes Up Again

BYLINE: By ROB FIXMER 

 BODY:
HOPE springs eternal among American MG owners. It has to. Only an incurable optimist would drive a car that hasn't been built since Jimmy Carter was president -- and that, even when new, was not particularly safe or reliable.
Yet British sports car enthusiasts on this side of the Atlantic seem downright skeptical about last week's announcement that Rover, the bleeding dog of British automakers, was about to be transformed into the MG Car Company by a group specializing in corporate turnarounds, Alchemy Partners. 
 "Alchemy -- turning base metal into gold? These guys better have a clue!" said John H. Twist, a prolific author and guru to MG owners, who has made University Motors in Ada, Mich., a mecca for enthusiasts. "We all want to believe that the new owners can succeed where BMW failed, but we've had our hopes raised and dashed before."
Indeed, when BMW Group took over Rover and MG five years ago, there was widespread speculation that the Germans would create a new MG for the American market. But BMW, which was introducing its own open-top two-seater, the Z3, never re-engineered the existing MGF for the United States. BMW said the economics didn't work, but disappointed MG fans said the Germans were afraid that the well-regarded MGF would steal sales from the Z3.
Alchemy faces a daunting challenge. Rover and MG, which still use the outdated Longbridge plant in Birmingham, England, are rent by labor strife and hemorrhaging red ink. BMW will keep the Mini, which is being redesigned, and Land Rover, which is Rover's only profitable operation. BMW has agreed to sell Land Rover to Ford.
But anyone reading discussions on Internet bulletin boards in the last week would think that the only question facing Alchemy was whether to return to the United States with the MGF or with a new MG it has promised to turn out within 18 months.
A writer calling himself John Z of Ann Arbor, Mich., noted that Alchemy had said it would build 100,000 cars in the first year. "The 100,000 unit 'limit' still means no MG in the States," he wrote. "It tells me that the new owners are not interested in us."
Alchemy Partners declined a request for an interview.
Americans have at least some reason to claim a vested interest in the MG brand.
From 1929 until 1980, the octagonal MG emblem was virtually synonymous with British sports cars. But while MG's were designed and built in Abingdon, England, a majority were sold in North America, a fact that heavily influenced engine design, emission controls, safety features and eventually styling. Of the 512,243 MG's built from 1962 to 1980, when production ceased, 349,503, or 68 percent, were made for North America, according to an MG historian, Anders Ditlev Clausager, in his book "Original MG."
The MG was the first foreign car to win American hearts. Beginning with a trickle of the two-seat, soft-top TC roadsters imported after World War II by returning GI's, MG sales in the United States peaked in the 1979 model year at 22,753 -- more than 10 times the number sold in Britain. A year later, MG closed its doors at Abingdon, having fallen victim to poor management and labor strife among parts suppliers.
But even after MG folded, appetite for the car wouldn't die. Rights to the brand changed hands several times over the years, ending up with Rover, which in 1992 offered a half-hearted domestic revival -- the MG RV8, basically a classic MGB roadster body with a Rover V8 engine. In 1995, Rover introduced the MGF, a midengine roadster that was a break from past MG's but a continuation of its design tradition.
That car has not made money, causing the online forums to buzz with questions about Alchemy's game plan. Was Alchemy, which is best known for turning around Parker Pen, simply planning to leverage MG's reputation by slapping the MG octagon on existing Rovers? Or would the partners live up to the promise of their announcement and "focus on developing a state-of-the-art, British-built product range worthy of the sporting heritage of the MG name"?
Whatever path Alchemy takes, how does it plan to succeed where BMW failed?
"You know, I thought the Germans would, and could, make a go of the MG name," Mr. Twist said. "How in the world will British ownership make things better?"
On the other hand, he allowed, "How could it make it worse?"
By continuing to ignore the American market, many MG enthusiasts would respond. Alchemy has so far remained resolutely mute on that point, but it is clear from sales of the Z3 and Mazda Miata, as well as from strong demand for the Honda S2000, that Americans have a strong and growing appetite for roadsters. The MGF sells for about $35,000 in Britain, where cars cost more than in the United States.
"Today everybody is looking for ways to spend," Mr. Twist said of the United States market. "Technology stocks into the stratosphere -- a perfect market for the MGF."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
German Chosen Managing Director of I.M.F.

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Horst Kohler of Germany became managing director of the International Monetary Fund today just as the Clinton administration and members of Congress were discussing how the agency might be improved.
Mr. Kohler, 57, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was unanimously endorsed by the 24 members of the I.M.F. board, ending an awkward episode in which he became Germany's choice for the job after its first failed to garner broad international support. Mr. Kohler succeeds Michel Camdessus of France, who retired. 
 Mr. Kohler said last week that his goals for the 182-nation organization included making it "a cornerstone for promoting growth and stability" around the world and having a better relationship with Congress.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers talked about those very things today before the House Banking Committee, where he defended the core missions of the I.M.F. and its sister institution, the World Bank.
"Countries that are helped to succeed economically are much more likely to become democratic, and their people more likely to avoid debilitating disease, to learn to read and to work with human dignity," Mr. Summers said. "From the experience of Germany in the 1930's to Bosnia and Africa in more recent times, history teaches us that conflicts are most likely in situations of economic distress, when populations turn their frustration to nationalist leaders because of a lack of a sense of economic opportunity."
The I.M.F. and the World Bank were created in the mid-1940's to promote economic stability and lend money to developing countries. Congressional critics say the institutions have sometimes distributed money unwisely. A Congressional panel headed by Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, has recommended sharply curtailed roles for both institutions.
Recent I.M.F. loans to Ukraine proved embarrassing after it was disclosed that officials there might have manipulated foreign exchange reserves to create a deceptive picture of the country's financial condition. Mr. Summers said the administration found that affair troubling and had pressed the I.M.F. to put new lending safeguards in place.
Mr. Summers also used the hearings to promote his own proposals to introduce changes in the way the I.M.F. and the World Bank work. He has suggested that the I.M.F. focus more on making short-term loans to countries that have financial crises and less on long-term lending and development assistance. He said the World Bank should ensure that its loans did not crowd out money that could be provided by the private sector and should also limit assistance to countries with poor records for using development loans effectively.
Mr. Summers also said that the Meltzer panel's most drastic recommendations would hobble the I.M.F. and the World Bank to the point that they "would no longer be able to advance America's core values and interests around the world."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Japan Phone Deregulation Talks Fall Flat

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 23

 BODY:
Talks between the United States and Japan over deregulation of the telecommunications market ended in failure here today.
Although negotiators had extended their discussions for one day on Wednesday, they failed to reach an agreement on the magnitude and speed of reductions in the fees that the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation charges for access to its local network, to which 99 percent of the phones in Japan are connected. 
 Further deregulation of the telecommunications market here is fast becoming the most contentious trade debate since United States and Japanese negotiators struggled over opening the Japanese automobile market in the mid-1990's.
The United States contends that Japan's refusal to move more swiftly to allow unfettered competition imperils the future of the Japanese economy. "This is not the U.S. against Japan," said Richard Fisher, deputy United States trade representative, at a news briefing. "This is Japan against the future."
He said Japan's resistance to further deregulating telecommunications was costing Japanese consumers and businesses by making them pay high prices for service. He contrasted the rate his daughter pays to cruise the Internet in the United States, which is less than $9 a month, or about 900 yen, with what one of her Japanese friends is paying -- 7,830 yen a month.
"Why should a Japanese girl be at such a disadvantage to an American girl?" he said.
The United States sought an immediate 41 percent reduction in fees, which eat up as much as 40 percent of the revenue of NTT's competitors, while Japan offered to cut rates 22.5 percent over four years.
Japan says that the American demands threaten 70,000 jobs at NTT, the former government telephone monopoly in which the government retains a 59.1 percent stake.
But Mr. Fisher countered that while it was a government's responsibility to worry about issues like layoffs, opening the market to competition would create jobs. He noted that in the last four years, 90,000 jobs have been created in telecommunications in the United States.
"Who governs Japan?" he said. "The elected people, the Diet, the government or a monopoly?" The Diet is Japan's parliament.
Japan is worried that the United States will take the matter to the World Trade Organization before the meeting of leaders of the top industrialized nations, in July in Okinawa. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi considers a successful summit meeting critical to the success of the ruling party in parliamentary elections that must be held by mid-October.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
France Telecom Buying Big Stake in German Rate-Cutter

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 23

 BODY:
France Telecom scored a rare strategic victory today in the jockeying for advantage in the European telecommunications industry with a $3.6 billion deal to acquire a substantial stake in MobilCom A.G., an aggressive provider of low-cost phone service in Germany.
The deal ends a series of setbacks for France Telecom that had left it largely isolated and in a single stroke provides it with access to the big but fiercely contested phone market in Germany, Europe's largest economy. 
 In acquiring 28.5 percent of MobilCom, the French company also gets a strong partner to help bid later this year for a German license in the newest generation of wireless phone service, which is expected to flourish as European countries develop wireless systems geared to the Internet.
France Telecom will pay 201 euros, or $195, each for 18.6 million new MobilCom shares, with an option to increase its stake in MobilCom in 2003.
Michel Bon, France Telecom's chief executive, said the deal was "perfectly in line with our ambition to become a leader in the convergence of fixed, mobile and Internet services in Europe." He said France Telecom expected strong growth in the German market for wireless phone systems with Internet capabilities.
The deal was a significant setback for the Stuttgart-based cellular phone provider Debitel, which had an arrangement for a joint bid with MobilCom when Germany auctions licenses this summer for the next generation of wireless phone systems. Debitel said today that it would withdraw from that arrangement.
Coming only a few weeks after the successful hostile bid by Vodafone AirTouch of Britain for Mannesmann, Germany's biggest cell phone provider, the France Telecom-MobilCom deal illustrates the kind of maneuvering under way in Europe's flourishing mobile communications industry. The biggest competitors are hastening to assemble Continent-wide wireless networks, given common European transmission standards, and are spending billions to expand into markets where they are not yet present.
A major prize for France Telecom is the Internet portal that MobilCom established in December, Freenet, which has signed up about a million customers, making it No. 3 in Germany after T-Online, which is operated by Deutsche Telekom and America Online. But some analysts say that Freenet has the potential to overtake AOL.
Gerhard Schmid, MobilCom's founder and chief executive, who will own 40 percent of his company after the French purchase, said the deal would give MobilCom vast new resources to develop operations on the Internet.
France Telecom, a former state monopoly, remains 63 percent-owned by the French government. It was largely cut out of Germany last year after it abandoned a decade-old partnership with Deutsche Telekom, the dominant German phone carrier, because of the Germans' surprising though unsuccessful bid to acquire Telecom Italia, another former government monopoly.
Later, France Telecom suffered still another setback in Germany after its plans to acquire the cellular phone provider E-Plus were thwarted by BellSouth, which teamed up with Royal KPN of the Netherlands to outbid the French.
MobilCom is the unlikely creation of Mr. Schmid, a 47-year-old former health resort employee, who started it in 1998 and built it on a shoestring budget, mostly with phone lines he leased from Deutsche Telekom. MobilCom now has about 1.9 million cellular phone customers, or 8 percent of the market, and 603,000 fixed-line long-distance users, or 9 percent.

HEADLINE: Fed Committee Was Unanimous As It Raised Rates in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee was unanimous in its decision to raise a key interest rate by a quarter of a point in February, minutes of the meeting showed today. However, some members had urged that the rate be pushed even higher.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which includes the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, voted 10 to 0 to raise the federal funds rate -- the interest that banks charge one another on overnight loans -- to 5.75 percent, according to the minutes. 
 It was the fourth increase in the federal funds rate since June 30.
On Tuesday, the Fed increased interest rates by another quarter-point. That action pushed the federal funds rate to 6 percent. The minutes of that meeting are expected to be released in May.
Even though there was no dissent on the February increase, the minutes said that before the vote, a few unidentified members expressed a preference for a half-point increase "in order to provide greater assurance against a buildup of inflationary expectations and inflation over coming months."
And other members acknowledged that the Fed "might need to move more aggressively at a later meeting" should the rapidly growing economy generate a pickup in inflation pressures.
In the end, the minutes said that all members agreed to the quarter-point increase for a number of reasons, including uncertainties about the outlook for growth in demand relative to that of supply, the economy's response to previous rate increases and somewhat unsettled conditions in financial markets. Members "saw little risk in a gradual approach," the minutes said.
Policy makers were also united in expressing their concerns that inflation could spoil the economic good times the country is enjoying.
Members unanimously agreed that future risks to the economy were "weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
New Apartments in TriBeCa, but Luxury Rentals, Not Condos

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
As the conversion of old manufacturing buildings to loft condominiums marches on in TriBeCa, the 16-story structure nearing completion at 95 Worth Street is breaking from that trend as one of the few new luxury rentals to be built in the neighborhood in the last decade.
Leasing for the building's 147 apartments begins today, but more than 100 people have already put their names on a waiting list, said Laurie Zucker, a partner in the Zucker Organization, which is developing the building. Financing for the project is coming from the developer's own money and a construction loan from Fleet Bank. 
 The building, called the Saranac, will have 122 one-bedroom apartments, 20 two-bedrooms and five three-bedrooms, including the two penthouses, ranging in size from 550 to 1,870 square feet.
Initially, monthly rents for most of the smaller apartments will be $2,085 to $3,615. Some larger two-bedroom apartments as well as the three-bedroom units on the 14th and 15th floors, which include fireplaces and washers and dryers, will rent for $3,815 to $5,100 a month, while the penthouses, with private terraces, will start at $8,000 a month.
There will also be 6,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, with an entrance on Broadway, and a parking garage for 114 cars in the building. It marks the first foray into the TriBeCa residential marketplace for the Zucker Organization, a 40-year-old Manhattan-based development company, which has built mostly rentals, and owns and manages 3,500 apartments in the city.
"We look for land at a reasonable cost in locations that are established or are up and coming," said Ms. Zucker, whose father, Donald Zucker, is a partner in the organization. She added, "We are not pioneering here."
Still, the project is rising in the easternmost stretch of TriBeCa, hard against an area of municipal and court buildings, reflecting how development is moving farther out from the heart of the neighborhood as developers look for available buildings to convert or sites to redevelop, residential brokers said. The Saranac occupies a site that since the mid-1970's was used as a surface parking lot.
"Our parking lots just keep disappearing," said Judy Duffy, assistant district manager of Community Board 1, which helps guide growth in TriBeCa. "I keep thinking we have maxed out, but development keeps coming." She estimates that this year, as in each of the last five years, about 400 apartments will be produced in the neighborhood.
Most of those have been and continue to be condominiums. A major reason, said Andrew J. Gerringer, a senior vice president at Douglas Elliman, the Manhattan brokerage, is the rising price of buildings to convert or land to buy. Buildings in TriBeCa suitable for conversion cost $200 to $250 a square foot, and costs for prime land are estimated at $100 to $120 per square foot of the building that zoning rules would allow to be constructed. Those prices make it difficult for the economics of a rental project "to pencil out, so you haven't seen a lot of them," Mr. Gerringer said.
Ms. Zucker said her company "prefers to develop rentals because it wants to retain ownership in what it builds." And in the case of the Saranac site, which the company acquired in the fall of 1997 for nearly $7 million, or $55 a square foot, the economics make sense, she said.
As for it being on the neighborhood's eastern fringe, she said, "It may be at the edge, but it is still in TriBeCa and brokers are always saying there is a demand for more luxury rentals."
Andrew Melnick, vice president of the rental division at Tabak Real Estate, a residential brokerage in TriBeCa, agreed, saying that "rentals are a scarcity these days, especially those on the higher-end side."
Most individual apartment owners, he said, "are selling rather than renting out their properties, which is another source of the supply drying up."
Mr. Gerringer of Douglas Elliman said that with the imbalance of supply and demand, rents in TriBeCa have risen about 10 percent over the last year to an average of $45 a square foot annually. That translates into an average monthly rental of $2,100 for typical 550-square-foot one-bedroom apartments and $3,750 for two-bedrooms with 1,000 square feet, Mr. Gerringer said, noting that newly constructed units could rent for $45 to $50 a square foot.
People would be willing to pay that premium even in a less-than-prime location in TriBeCa if they felt that they were getting a good value, he said, adding that "renters tend to decide with their feet, knowing they can leave when their leases expire."
At the Saranac, the average rents per square foot for the apartments, with 9- to 11-foot-high ceilings and open layouts, come to $50, Ms. Zucker said. With the majority of the units one-bedrooms, she said, the building is being marketed to young professional singles and couples. But families are expected to be drawn to the larger apartments as well as to the fact that the building is in the school district that includes the highly rated Public School 234, she said.
The Saranac will be clad in red brick and will feature brick detailing and a variegated roof line, ranging from angular to curved to rounded, to "mitigate its bulkiness," said Stephen B. Jacobs, who designed the building and heads the Manhattan architectural firm bearing his name. Just for whimsy, gargoyles will be added, he said.
In addition to the parking garage, for which tenants will pay an extra yet-to-be-determined monthly cost, amenities include a fitness center and laundry room as well as a second-floor outdoor recreation area atop the garage. And the Adirondacks-inspired lobby with its large stone fireplace, wood beamed ceiling and bluestone floor, will reveal to tenants the reason for the building's name.
Occupancy is set for May.

HEADLINE: Buying on Margin Becomes a Habit;
Investors Turn to Credit in a Bull Market

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Borrowing money to buy stocks has become immensely popular among individual investors today. And who can blame them? When stock prices are rising, the biggest gains go to those who buy shares on borrowed money.
When stock prices are falling, however, borrowing to buy stocks is an expensive and highly risky business. While recent tremors in some formerly hot market sectors may have awakened some investors to this unhappy reality, market regulators are growing concerned that the recent surge in investor indebtedness, which has been greatest at online firms, reflects the participation of many people who do not understand how dangerous stock market debt can be. 
 "I am troubled by the apparent ease with which real neophytes are going online these days all by themselves and trading on margin," said Bradley Skolnick, the Indiana securities commissioner and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association. "A lot of people are purchasing rather speculative, high-risk stocks with borrowed money and that's a source of concern for me. In a volatile market, trading on margin can find you in a whole lot of hurt very quickly."
Lael Desmond, a medical school student in Indiana, learned the hard way how risky borrowing on margin can be. In late 1997, Mr. Desmond, who was then 26, opened an account at Ameritrade; by June 1998 he had roughly $30,000 in his account. An investing novice, he began borrowing money to buy shares of Amazon.com, Dell Computer, Excite, America Online and Yahoo.
Mr. Desmond, who was to begin medical school the following fall, did not fully understand what investing on margin meant. Yes, when stocks go up, an investor can double his gains by borrowing from his broker, paying a relatively modest interest rate for the opportunity. But if the stock -- which serves as the asset backing the loan -- declines in value, the customer will be asked to put up more money to make up for the shortfall. This is known as a margin call. When an investor chooses not to put up more money, his shares are sold but he usually still owes money to the broker.
Mr. Desmond, according to his lawyer, Jeffrey V. Gery at Maddox, Koeller, Hargett & Caruso in Indianapolis, thought his margin borrowing was like a mortgage or bank loan. He had no idea that he could lose money on it.
Then, in the late summer of 1998, stocks took a dive because of the Russian debt crisis. On Friday, Aug. 28, stocks began to fall and continued their descent the following Monday, generating margin calls of roughly $12,000 to Mr. Desmond. By Tuesday, the call had grown to $21,000, which Mr. Desmond did not have. So he took out cash advances on credit cards in the amount of $13,000 and borrowed $8,000 from his brother. Nevertheless, by the time the funds were wired to Ameritrade the afternoon of September 1, the firm had already sold Mr. Desmond's holdings.
In Mr. Desmond's arbitration case, decided last January, he won $40,453 from Ameritrade. Although the arbitrators did not give the reason for their award, it is clear they believed Ameritrade sold Mr. Desmond's holdings too quickly.
Mr. Gery, one of two lawyers who represented Mr. Desmond, said of the case: "It's been our impression that a lot of online firms think they are Web sites first and brokerage firms second. But they are brokerage firms first and they have a duty to maintain very high standards."
It is investors like Mr. Desmond, trading through online brokers, who are most responsible for the jump in margin debt. Steven Galbraith, an analyst at the investment firm of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimates that margin debt as a percent of market value has soared 459 percent at online brokers since 1995.
Growth in margin debt at firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange, by comparison, has gone up 190 percent during the same period. The value of the market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 has risen 139 percent during that time.
Some online brokerage firms have recently increased their margin requirements.
Dan Hubbard, a spokesman at Charles Schwab, said the firm required a greater down payment than the 50 percent minimum set by the Federal Reserve on 270 securities its executives feel are too volatile or illiquid.
Michael Dunn, a spokesman for Datek Online Holdings, said his firm had a large number of stocks where it refused to extend margin, while 227 others required higher down payments. T. D. Waterhouse requires higher than normal deposits on around 300 stocks, and Ameritrade, while not supplying details, said it required higher initial deposits on some stocks. Officials at E*Trade did not return a phone call seeking information about their current margin requirements.
But brokerage firms make big money lending to investors so it is perhaps not surprising that many still lend freely. Mr. Galbraith estimates that margin interest paid by investors accounts for 20 percent of a typical Internet brokerage firm's revenue. In a recent study, he found that even the most volatile highfliers -- including such stocks as Red Hat, Doubleclick, Broadcom, Inktomi and the Internet Capital Group -- were marginable at one online brokerage firm or another.
Indeed, as the market's gyrations become more pronounced, borrowing to buy stocks becomes positively treacherous. A stock that falls only 10 percent, for example -- not a big move in today's wild market -- could set off a request for more money from an investor who has borrowed the maximum amount.
If the investor does not have the funds to add to his portfolio, the shares are sold, possibly weakening an already sickly stock. This is why excessive investor indebtedness can add to downward moves in stocks.
Perhaps because falling stocks always seem to bounce back these days, investors remain unworried. Margin debt on the New York Stock Exchange has surged 75 percent in the last 12 months and now exceeds $265 billion, a record. Debt ballooned almost 9 percent in February alone and now accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the Big Board's total market value, also a peak.
Even more troubling is how fast margin debt is growing as a share of overall consumer credit. According to Mr. Galbraith's research, margin loans now account for 16 percent of total consumer borrowings, up from 7 percent in 1995. Numbers like these prove that the explosion in margin borrowing is coming from individual investors, not institutions, he said.
"They've supplanted buying a washer-drier with debt with buying Qualcomm on margin," Mr. Galbraith said. "If you think of the volatility of the asset being financed it is probably more dramatic than I suspect many of the people deploying leverage think about."
More investors seem to be discovering that margin trading has pitfalls. The Securities and Exchange Commission says investor complaints in that area have risen significantly in recent weeks.
The Federal Reserve Board, which has set the margin requirement at 50 percent since 1974, recently expressed concern over the outsized growth in margin debt. Yet in January, when the explosive growth in margin debt became evident, Alan Greenspan rejected calls to increase the initial amount required of investors when they buy stocks on margin. He argued that an increase in the margin requirement would be unfair to small investors because they would be unable to secure credit even as institutional investors could tap other sources of funds.
Still, the damage that heavily margined investors can sustain in a downward move in stocks is great enough that some observers question Mr. Greenspan's inaction. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, "It's the little guys who are going to get unduly hurt when the market goes down, so I think there's nothing wrong with it."
The senator has been urging Mr. Greenspan to reconsider his reluctance to raise the margin requirement. "He has not closed the door on it," Senator Schumer said. "And right now the Fed is undergoing a study of margin debt."
Richard Sylla, a professor of financial history at the Stern School of Business at New York University, called Mr. Greenspan's small-investor argument inconsistent. "He's worried about the market being too high, but his argument that a margin requirement increase would make it harder for small investors to participate is in some sense saying, 'I don't want to spoil the party for them,' " Professor Sylla said.
Some regulators fear that investors are also borrowing from sources other than their brokers to buy stocks, including credit cards or second mortgages.
"I'm worried not just about the margin but about people borrowing on other assets like homes and the double-dip effect that would have in the event of a market decline," said Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "If we have a market decline then that would play out not just in terms of lower security values but also in lower real estate values."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A new marketing effort tries to raise FT.com's U.S. profile.

BYLINE: By Courtney Kane 

 BODY:
FT.COM, the Internet venture of The Financial Times, the London-based financial newspaper, is embarking on its first consumer marketing campaign to raise its profile in the United States.
The advertisements, with the theme "The world doesn't turn on a dime," emphasize the importance of a global perspective in today's business environment. The $35 million campaign features Dan Aykroyd in a series of humorous television commercials, in addition to print, outdoor and online ads. 
 The campaign, which begins on Sunday, is the first from BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, since the agency was awarded the account in November. The commercials are the first that Mr. Aykroyd, the actor known for his work in the early years of "Saturday Night Live" and in many films, has done, the agency said.
The humor in the commercials, said Paul Waddington, marketing communications director for FT.com in London, "helps us to get away from any perhaps connotations of stuffiness that the parent brand has."
In the first commercial, Mr. Aykroyd portrays Mr. Kopeky, the chief executive of a leading American foam rubber company, who is negotiating with three Italian businessmen over the sale of his company. After intense price negotiations being passed back and forth on paper, Mr. Kopeky thinks he has pulled a fast one on the Italians by agreeing to sell his company for what he believes to be the astronomical price of 11 million lire, which a subtitle notes is just $5,741. After shaking hands to seal the deal, the three Italians raise their glasses to Mr. Kopeky and offer felicitations in Italian that are translated in a subtitle as 'idiot, moron and chowderhead.'
Subsequent commercials with Mr. Aykroyd portray him in similar predicaments where his ignorance of global business also hurts him.
Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer at BBDO New York, noted that this sort of inept businessman has always been part of Mr. Aykroyd's repertory, "so, it seemed like a natural fit and you get more spin and noticeability of having a celebrity of his stature."
The use of a celebrity, in addition to the campaign's quirky humor, is indicative of many Web publishers' attempts to attract attention in a media category that has quickly grown cluttered.
"They're late to the party," said Sue Haxager, senior vice president and senior account director on the FT.com account at BBDO New York. "There are already a variety of business news services and the dot-com noise in general."
"From our perspective," she added, "we are trying to say that we are a dot-com and that FT, which has a very conservative image, is doing something radically different, and we felt if we approached it to somberly the 'Internetness' of it wouldn't come across."
The Web site, which was introduced in 1995, was revamped last month and is now being offered as an international business portal with news, views and archives. The target is a broader business audience in middle management ages 25 to 54.
FT.com says it has 1.2 million users every month. About 12 percent of those users come from the United States; 56 percent come from Britain; about 20 percent from Europe, with the remainder from the rest of the world. It competes with several financial Web news sites, including MarketWatch.com, TheStreet.com and WSJ.com, among others.
"We want to build upon the growing reputation of the newspaper in the U.S. and broaden it to increase the audience for the Financial Times brand over all," said Stephen Hill, group chief executive at FT.com's parent the Financial Times Group unit of Pearson P.L.C. in London. "What we want to is get people's minds to integrate the two services of the Financial Times Group."
Toward that end, the 11 print ads for FT.com use the distinctive salmon-pink color of The Financial Times as the backdrop. One headline proclaims: "Greeks, Chinese, Germans, Russians, Italians, Uzbeks, Namibians, Turks, Japanese and Americans all speak the same language. Money." Another ad directs readers to FT.com's Markets and Portfolio channel by promising, "Learn so much about Charles Schwab, you can call him Chuck." A third headline states, "Phrase often heard by FT.com users: Cha-ching!" And, "When your company does business in countries you can't spell."
Newspaper and magazine ads will begin appearing next week in publications including The Economist, Forbes, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. The online advertising portion of the campaign, created by @tmosphere in New York, a digital branding agency started by BBDO New York last year, will be on various media properties including MSNBC.com, MSN.com and Hotmail.com.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Climbs Over 11,000 In Wide Rally

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks soared again yesterday as investors poured into technology and financial shares in a bet that the Federal Reserve is almost finished raising short-term interest rates. Similar optimism fueled the Treasury bond market, as the price on the 30-year bond rose to its highest level since August.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped above 11,000 for the first time in six weeks, gaining 253.16 points, or 2.3 percent, to 11,119.86. It was the 10th time since the beginning of February that the Dow has gained or lost more than 200 points, a level that once was eye-popping but has become almost routine. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set its third consecutive record, rising 26.71 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,527.35, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 75.86 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,940.61.
The market's gain was fueled by Microsoft, whose shares surged yesterday on reports that it might be close to a settlement with the Justice Department that would keep the company intact. Both The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported that talks between the government and Microsoft had intensified. Shares of Microsoft gained $8.625, to $111.875, adding almost $45 billion to its market value and 43 points to the Dow.
With very few companies having issued earnings warnings for the first quarter, and interest rates dropping, investors are hungry again for equities. Notably, the biggest, most liquid stocks were the biggest gainers. Shares of companies like Microsoft, General Electric, and Cisco Systems, which all have billions of shares outstanding, gained more than 6 percent yesterday as investors jumped into the megacap stocks that have performed so well for the last decade.
Bond prices also gained, with the price of the benchmark 30-year issue rising 26/32, to 104 25/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.91 percent from 5.96 percent on Wednesday. The rally in bonds came as a fight brewed yesterday between the Treasury Department and two government-sponsored companies that help finance home mortgages. Some analysts said safety-conscious institutional investors had bought Treasury bonds and sold bonds of the two companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helping the Treasury market.
Investor nervousness about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was not confined to the companies' bonds. Shares in both companies stumbled in morning trading yesterday, with Fannie Mae falling as low as $58 and Freddie Mac as low as $42.75.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant tax and regulatory advantages over commercial and investment banks, and Gary Gensler, a Treasury under secretary, urged a Congressional committee on Wednesday to consider stripping the companies of many of those benefits.
A bill pending in the House of Representatives would repeal a conditional line of credit that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have with the Treasury. While the amount of money available is relatively small compared with the size of the companies, Mr. Gensler said that its repeal would make clear to investors that the government does not stand behind the debt of the companies.
But the two stocks ended the day higher after investors decided that the odds were against Congress's significantly changing the way the companies do business. Fannie Mae ended the day at $62.50, up 64.0625 cents, and Freddie Mac finished at $47, up 56.25 cents.
Kenneth Posner, who covers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said Congress was unlikely to pass legislation that would raise borrowing costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because those increased costs would probably be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage rates.
"The reality is, it's hard for me to see politically what support this bill might have," Mr. Posner said. "If legislative momentum develops to make home ownership more difficult in the United States, maybe Fannie and Freddie are at risk."
But Bert Ely, who co-wrote a paper released two weeks ago by the American Enterprise Institute that argued against continuing the subsidies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said investors would be wise not to dismiss the prospect of Congressional action. As Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac grow, with Fannie Mae alone now issuing about $900 billion in debt, the controversy will increase, Mr. Ely said.
"The problem that Fannie and Freddie have is the bigger they get, the bigger a target they become," Mr. Ely said. The hubbub from Mr. Gensler's comments "will probably die down in the short term, but there will be long-term repercussions from it," he predicted.
Other market movers yesterday included General Electric, which was up $9.125, to $160 Cisco, up $5.625, to $77.8125 after a split; and American Express, which rose $8.125 to $155.875.

Home Equity Lender Files For Bankruptcy Protection
First Alliance, a nationwide home equity lender facing a host of lawsuits accusing it of deceptive sales practices, announced that it had stopped making new loans to homeowners and that it had filed for bankruptcy protection.
The mortgage company, which had offices in more than a dozen states, including New York, New Jersey and California, said that it has closed its loan offices and laid off 85 percent of its work force. Page A1. 

Morgan Stanley Profit Up 49%
Riding a surge in trading of stocks and bonds, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter reported that its first-quarter net income rose 49 percent, making it the fourth big investment bank to post stronger-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley benefited from investors' seemingly insatiable appetite for the securities of companies in technology and telecommunications industries. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose $4.50, to $94.75. C2.
 
Kohler Becomes Head of I.M.F.
Horst Kohler of Germany, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, became the International Monetary Fund's managing director just as the Clinton administration and members of Congress were discussing how the agency might be improved. The election put an end to an awkward episode in which Mr. Kohler became Germany's second choice for the job after its first failed to garner broad support. C4.
 
No Phone Accord Reached in Japan
Talks between the United States and Japan over deregulation of the telecommunications market ended without an agreement on the magnitude and speed of reductions in the fees that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone charges for access to its local network. C19.
 
Ukraine Transactions Scrutinized
An executive of Credit Suisse, the European banking giant, testified before the House Banking Committee that his institution engaged in unusual transactions on behalf of Ukraine's central bank, but he maintained that all of them were legal. Credit Suisse's activities in Ukraine have come under scrutiny after the International Monetary Fund revealed last week that Ukraine's central bank secured I.M.F. loans by misleading the fund about the country's financial health. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who also testified, said the Treasury department would review audits of the transactions in question before he supports further I.M.F. lending to Ukraine.

HEADLINE: Smuggling of Iraqi Oil Is Rising, U.N. Is Told

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 23

 BODY:
Steeply rising oil prices have brought a huge increase in the smuggling of Iraqi oil, the American coordinator of the international fleet that patrols the waters off Iraq told a Security Council committee today.
The coordinator, Vice Admiral Charles Moore, told the committee on sanctions against Iraq that much of the oil passes through Iranian waters, diplomats said after the closed briefing. The admiral coordinates a small fleet from more than a dozen nations that polices the Persian Gulf, looking for ships that violate an international embargo on Iraq. 
 Admiral Moore and his team from the Pentagon told the committee that a political or diplomatic overture to Iran was necessary if the smuggling was to be curtailed, according to the representative of the Netherlands, Peter van Walsum, who is chairman of the committee.
"We have not discussed anything of that sort yet," Mr. van Walsum said after the meeting. He said the subject could be raised at the panel's next meeting, for which no date has been set.
Western diplomats said that Admiral Moore, briefing the committee the day before a debate on the sanctions, reported that at current rates of oil shipments, Iraq could earn up to a billion dollars this year in illegal sales. Diplomats said the profits go directly to Saddam Hussein or those he chooses to reward.
"The rate of smuggling is at record levels," a Western diplomat said. The oil, often bought and sold by private brokers using ships with fraudulent papers, goes to many destinations, including Iran, Pakistan and India.
Iranians skim part of the profit, diplomats said. It is not known whether the Iranians enriching themselves by allowing tankers to use their territorial waters are backed by the government in any way. But twice in the past -- in March and September of 1998 -- the Iranians were able to shut down the trade, diplomats say.
According to Western diplomats who heard Admiral Moore's briefing, Iraq was able to illegally export 1,868,466 barrels of oil in 1996, 10,497,000 barrels the following year, 13,296,000 barrels in 1998 and 7,557,838 barrels in 1999. Smuggling began to increase again in September, and record levels of smuggling were reported in December, January and February.
If current prices stay high, it is estimated that Iraq will sell about 33,590,390 barrels of illegal gas oil -- akin to diesel fuel -- this year.
"If the trend continues," a diplomat said, "more oil will be smuggled out of Iraq this year than the total smuggled out in the last four years."
Diplomats said that the oil comes from fields at Basra and is exported on vessels from the Iraqi port of Abu Flus. This port is not authorized for exports by the Security Council.

At $4 a Gallon, Finding Joy on the Road Not Taken

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WEISKIRCHEN, Germany, March 21

 BODY:
When Uwe Olzem finished filling the tank of his Nissan coupe, he could only envy Americans.
Faced with paying about $3.65 a gallon for regular unleaded -- about double the price in the United States -- Mr. Olzem said he is spending about $50 a week just to commute to his job. 
 "I don't blame Americans for being upset at the higher prices," said Mr. Olzem, a soldier in the German Army. "But they have a very good deal."
As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries prepares to consider raising oil production quotas next Monday at a meeting in Vienna, Americans are fretting over the prospect of $2-a-gallon gasoline and fill-ups costing $50 or more for some big sport utility vehicles.
But in Europe, where prices have approached $4 a gallon for years, most drivers only wish they had it has bad as the Americans.
"It would be wonderful," sighed Carica De Hoere, a teacher from Harelbeke, Belgium, as she stopped here with a small group of friends en route from a skiing vacation in Austria. "But of course, it couldn't happen."
Gasoline prices have jumped at least 20 percent in many European countries over the past year, compared with more than 50 percent in the United States. Prices in Britain -- closing in on $5 a gallon -- are even higher than those in neighboring countries because the value of the British pound has climbed sharply against most other currencies. But there have been few if any diatribes against OPEC, nor grousing about the lack of gratitude for rescuing Kuwait from Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
Nor are European officials emulating the United States secretary of energy, Bill Richardson, who has been on a whirlwind tour of oil-producing countries pleading for a sizable increase in production.
Even in Germany, a country of carmakers and car lovers and the legally enshrined right to drive the autobahn at speeds of 100 miles an hour -- few seem worried that their way of life is in danger.
"OPEC is the least of our problems," said Hermann Otto Solms, who oversees economic policy issues for Germany's Free Democratic Party, which has pushed for cutting taxes. "Our problem is that our own gasoline taxes are too high and are still going up. If OPEC reduces production, that is merely an additional problem."
Gasoline taxes are at the heart of the difference between American and European gasoline prices and attitudes. If American drivers are addicted to cheap gasoline, European governments are addicted to gasoline taxes.
Taxes total about three-quarters of the price of a gallon of gas in most European countries. Beyond paying for road construction and maintenance and public transportation, gasoline taxes have become a major source of government revenue and are increasingly used to offset cuts in social security taxes and other levies.
"We are the cash cows of the nation," complained Mr. Olzem, the German soldier. "I'm not bothered by what OPEC does. What bothers me is that the government is taking 75 percent of the money I pay for gasoline and putting it into its own pocket."
That has had a number of effects. Because the cost of oil makes up a smaller portion of the price of gasoline, prices here have climbed far more modestly.
Energy experts and economists contend that Europe's high gasoline taxes have also reduced its exposure to oil shocks. Though European oil imports have risen in recent years, both individuals and companies have invested heavily in ways to reduce energy consumption.
More important, Europeans have consistently been able to get by with less gasoline than Americans.
On average, Europeans drive less than half as many miles each year as Americans do, according to studies by the International Energy Agency, a publicly funded research institute in Paris. The standard explanation is that distances between cities and even within cities are so much greater in America than in Europe.
But that is only part of the story. In a study last year, the Paris agency reported that the length of the average car trip in the United States and Europe was virtually the same -- 8.7 miles versus 8.1 miles -- but the big difference was that Americans made nearly twice as many trips.
"Americans believe it is their God-given right to have as much cheap gasoline as they want," said Gary N. Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry consulting firm in New York.
"Because of this addiction -- and addiction is a good word -- Americans drive almost 50 percent more than Europe, and its cars are less efficient," Mr. Ross said. "It has cost the United States dearly."
Even Europeans who want to reduce gasoline taxes, like Mr. Solms of the German Free Democratic Party, admit to being amazed when they visit the United States.
"In most cities, except perhaps New York, people can't understand why you would want to walk a short distance rather than drive," he said.
Europeans have long driven cars so small and fuel thrifty that they would be laughed off the American road by any self-respecting owner of a sport utility vehicle.
Lately, Europeans have developed a taste for heavier and more powerful models, but European automobiles over all get better mileage than American cars -- averaging about 27 miles per gallon compared with about 24 -- according to estimates by the International Energy Agency.
What's more, the gap is widening. According to the German government, the average fuel efficiency of cars on German roads has improved to about 27 miles per gallon from about 25.8 since 1992. By contrast, the fuel efficiency of American cars has not improved. In fact, since the sport utility craze in the United States began, new car and light-truck mileage has declined, to 23.8 miles per gallon last year from 25.4 in 1992.
The upshot is that European drivers have become inured to high gasoline prices and have learned to economize.
"You get used to high prices," said Freek Vlieger, a mechanic from Woerden, the Netherlands, as he filled up his tank on the way home from a ski holiday in Austria. "For us, it's not so much of a problem, because we don't use the car that much at home."
That is not to say people are happy about their lot. In the Netherlands and several other countries, people angry about gasoline prices are trying to organize a strike on April 1, in which drivers will refuse to drive or buy gasoline.
But if people are angry, they are more angry about gasoline taxes than the machinations of oil-producing countries. When Germany's Free Democrats campaigned against the ruling Social Democratic Party's plan to raise gasoline taxes in January, they arranged to sell gasoline tax-free for one hour at a station in Berlin.
The result led to mayhem, with thousands of drivers clogging the streets around the station to try to buy gas at 25 percent of the normal price.

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.
 
Classical Music
 
MARTHA ARGERICH. This superb and dynamic pianist has not played a solo recital in New York since 1981, undoubtedly in part because of her battle with melanoma. Here, in a benefit for the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, Calif., where she was treated, she plays Bach's Second Partita, Chopin's Barcarolle, Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata, Schumann's Piano Quintet (with the Juilliard String Quartet), Ravel's "Valse" (with the pianist Nelson Freire) and, the announcement says, more. More? The treatment was obviously a success, and amen to that. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $23 to $101; sold out but returns may be available (James R. Oestreich). 

CZECH PHILHARMONIC. This wonderful orchestra has fallen on hard economic times as the Czech Republic labors through a transition to a market economy. It can still play with the best of them, however, as should be apparent here in the first of three programs, Hans Krasa's Symphony and Mahler's Seventh Symphony, conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy. The Sunday concert is part of Lincoln Center's Prague Festival, which begins tomorrow with a symposium at 10 a.m. in the Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, 10th floor; with Michael Beckerman presiding, it promises to be lively. Performances are tomorrow at 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100; tickets: $42 and $56; $39 and $53 for the elderly; $12 for students; $8 for Long Island University students; and on Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500; tickets: $25 to $47 (Oestreich).
 
ENSEMBLE SOSPESO. The outstanding Jeffrey Milarsky conducts a fine group of musicians in two weird, wonderful and comic scores produced by Gyorgy Ligeti in the 1960's: his "Fragment," for an ensemble of low instruments and percussion, and his Cello Concerto. The program is completed by his Horn Trio from two decades later, a piece just as astonishing and witty but with more bite and variety, dreaming of Brahms amid tricky Caribbean rhythms and breaths of central European folk music. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $15; $7.50 for students and the elderly; $5 for Columbia students (Paul Griffiths).
 
PHILIP GLASS ENSEMBLE. The composer Philip Glass has devoted himself increasingly to film music over the last 20 years, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music has recently shown several of them, with their soundtracks performed live by Mr. Glass's ensemble or by the Kronos Quartet. This week BAM has been offering a retrospective of Mr. Glass's film work, again with live performances by the Philip Glass Ensemble. Tonight's offering is "Powaqqatsi," the second of Mr. Glass's collaborations with the filmmaker Godfrey Reggio. The performance is to be followed by a discussion with Mr. Reggio. Tomorrow evening and Sunday afternoon the ensemble will perform Mr. Glass's score for the 1931 "Dracula," with Bela Lugosi, a work that had its premiere at BAM earlier this season. Today and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Fort Greene. (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $17 to $48 (Allan Kozinn).
 
SIMON KEENLYSIDE. The excellent British baritone Simon Keenlyside is currently singing the role of Marcello in Puccini's "Boheme" at the Metropolitan Opera. But this dashing actor and robust vocalist is also a probing and communicative recitalist. He gives his only New York recital this season on Sunday, with the in-demand pianist Malcolm Martineau. The program offers songs by Schubert, Strauss, Debussy and Faure. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall. Tickets are $30. Call CenterCharge: (212) 721-6500 (Anthony Tommasini).
 
LIONHEART. The problem with those questionable birth dates from earlier eras is that they make awkward hooks for anniversary celebrations. So here it is, the 700th-birthday year of Guillaume de Machaut, more or less, and the Cloisters is presenting a series of concerts and lectures centering on Machaut's music and poetry. This acclaimed male vocal ensemble offers love songs and poetry drawn mainly from the "Remede de Fortune." While welcoming these events, it is hard not to look beyond and hope that the Cloisters will finally become the heavy hitter in early music that it has sometimes seemed on the verge of becoming. Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $32 (Oestreich).
 
MOSCOW STRING QUARTET. The concert room at the Frick Collection is a comfortably intimate place to hear chamber music and recitals, and its offerings include everything from early music on period instruments to the conservative side of the modern repertory. It is host this week to an ensemble formed at the Moscow Conservatory in 1975 and now resident at Colorado University in Denver. The program includes the Borodin Quartet No. 1, the Ravel Quartet and Stravinsky's Three Pieces for String Quartet. Sunday at 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan. (212) 288-0700. All tickets to the concert, which are free, have been distributed, but a waiting line for last-minute tickets will form one hour before the performance (Kozinn).
 
MOSCOW VIRTUOSI. The centerpiece of an attractive program by the violinist and conductor Vladimir Spivakov and his crack ensemble, the Moscow Virtuosi, is Mozart's "Coronation" Mass, for which the Russian ensemble is joining forces with a New York chorus, the Dessoff Choirs. Also on the program is one of Mozart's loveliest but most underplayed symphonies, No. 29 in A, and two works by Alfred Schnittke: the Sonata for Violin and Chamber Orchestra (Mr. Spivakov is the soloist) and "Five Fragments Based on Paintings of Hieronymus Bosch." The vocal soloists in the Mozart Mass are Inva Mula, soprano; Rinat Shaham, alto; Michael Lockley, tenor, and Robert Osborne, bass. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500; tickets: $45 (Kozinn).
 
MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO. The names of the younger players may not be familiar (though that of Todd Phillips, the violinist, is), but the name Marlboro is a solid assurance of quality. After the inevitable Haydn string quartet to start (here the D minor, Op. 9, No. 4) come bigger works: Reger's Clarinet Quintet and Mozart's String Quintet in C (K. 515). The composers are vintage Marlboro fare, and no doubt the players are already thoroughly steeped in the idioms. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $25 (Oestreich).
 
ANTHONY NEWMAN. It wouldn't be a Bach year, 250th anniversary of the composer's death or no, without a substantial contribution from this provocative organist. Mr. Newman was rushed through an unusual performance of Bach's "Goldberg" Variations on organ last year in Purchase because of overambitious scheduling of other events. Here he is on his own, in two separate programs including many of Bach's big solo works. Well, almost on his own; he is joined in some numbers by Mary Jane Newman, a harpsichordist, and Amy Butler, a soprano. Sunday at 4 and 7:30 p.m., Purchase College Performing Arts Center, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; tickets: $20 for either part, $32 for both; discounts for students and the elderly (Oestreich).
 
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. The Russian conductor Valery Gergiev's concert with the New York Philharmonic last week was not always tidy technically. But in works by Beethoven, Scriabin and Prokofiev (a thrilling Third Piano Concerto with Leif Over Andsnes) Mr. Gergiev elicited ardent, bold and imaginative music making from the orchestra. This weekend's program is greatly anticipated. Two works are offered: Hindemith's Horn Concerto, with the orchestra's principal hornist, Philip Myers, as soloist, and Tchaikovsky's "Manfred" Symphony. Tomorrow the tireless Mr. Gergiev will conduct the program with the Philharmonic in the afternoon (and then cross the plaza at Lincoln Center to conduct Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" at the Met in the evening). Today and tomorrow at 2 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall; tickets: $32 to $64. For ticket information, call CenterCharge: (212) 721-6500 (Tommasini).
 
VOGLER QUARTET OF BERLIN. This group, founded 15 years ago, has won awards and acclaim elsewhere but is still relatively unfamiliar in New York. Here, in its Weill Recital Hall debut, it starts -- as what quartet doesn't, these days? -- with Haydn, a G major work (Op. 76, No. 1), but proceeds slightly less predictably, with Wolf's Italian Serenade and Beethoven's B flat Quartet (Op. 130) along with the "Grosse Fuge," the gnarly movement that originally ended the work. Tonight at 8, Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $36; sold out, but returns may be available (Oestreich).
 
WILLARD WHITE AND JOYCE DiDONATO. The two singers offer a short program of songs and arias, accompanied by Craig Rutenberg. Ms. DiDonato includes two numbers from Handel's "Alcina" and cycles by Honegger and Michael Head. Mr. White's contributes songs by Aaron Copland and Vaughan Williams, as well as Gremin's aria from "Eugene Onegin." There will also be a discussion with George Jellinek and James King. Sunday at 4 p.m., Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008. Limited tickets: $40, $30 for members (Griffiths).
 
Opera
 
"LA BOHEME." Franco Zeffirelli's lavish production of Puccini's "Boheme" is so popular with Metropolitan Opera audiences that who is actually singing the opera can seem of secondary importance. But "Boheme" fans should welcome the promising cast tonight when the production returns to the Met. Leontina Veduva, a fine Romanian soprano in her Met debut, will sing Mimi, a role she recorded with the tenor Roberto Alagna before a certain other Romanian soprano became his Mimi of choice (Angela Gheorghiu, his wife). The sweet-voiced tenor Luis Lima is Rodolfo; the vibrant soprano Ainhoa Arteta sings Musetta; the elegant baritone Simon Keenlyside will be Marcello. Marco Armiliato conducts. Metropolitan Opera House; tonight at 8. Standing-room-only tickets at $12 and $16; (212) 362-2000 (Tommasini).
 
"LA CLEMENZA DI TITO." Like "The Magic Flute" -- alongside which it was composed, in the last year of Mozart's life -- "Tito" is an opera of love and friendship under trial, and of music triumphant. This new City Opera production is conducted by Harry Bicket, who has done such good work in the past here with 18th-century scores, and directed by Stephen Wadsworth. The cast includes Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Sextus and Kurt Streit as the Emperor Titus. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $22 to $95 (Griffiths).
 
"LADY MACBETH OF MTSENSK." Graham Vick's updated production of the great tragi-satirical opera by Shostakovich is a triumph. He daringly mixes riveting imagery -- westernized, modern, industrial, decadent, garish, comic book -- anything that will give an emotional and dramatic edge to the story of a bored, childless wife of a prosperous manufacturer in 19th-century Russia and the murders she is driven to commit. In the title role, the soprano Catherine Malfitano, trading beauty of tone for dramatic intensity, gives an unforgettable portrayal. The cast is excellent. You would think the Met Chorus was a company of character actors. And Valery Gergiev conducts a gripping performance. Metropolitan Opera House, tomorrow at 8 p.m. Remaining tickets, $180 and standing room, $12 and $16. $170 to $26; (212) 362-6000. (Tommasini).
 
"PORGY AND BESS." George Gershwin's grand and often sublime adventure into opera returns by way of the New York City Opera. The cast I heard on opening night was mostly first-rate; casts alternate. John DeMain conducts. The production, a survivor of the 1980's, does its job. New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tomorrow at 1:30 and 8 p.m. Limited tickets, from $22 to $95; standing-room tickets on the day of the performance, $8 (Bernard Holland).
 
"TOSCA." Mark Lamos's spare, modern production of Puccini's "Tosca" for the New York City Opera gives the work a 1930's Fascist look. Some of the staging ideas, and occasional gestures from the singers, recall that the mannerisms of traditional verismo opera are at odds with the directorial concept. But the cast is strong, with the admirable soprano Amy Johnson as Tosca, and the stirring baritone Mark Delavan as Scarpia. The tenor Alfredo Portilla takes over the role of Mario Cavaradossi. Small flaws aside, this is an evening of compelling musical theater. New York State Theater, Tonight at 8. Tickets are $95 to $22; (212) 870-5570 (Tommasini).
 
 Dance
 
ARTHUR AVILES TYPICAL THEATER. Arthur Aviles is up to something special at his new uptown headquarters, the landmark former American Banknote building, where he creates and presents dance that could only have come from a New Yorker, from the South Bronx to be specific. Mr. Aviles's choreography is as unassuming and simple as good folk art. But it is also funky, political and gaudily irrepressible as it addresses issues including gender, homosexuality and children's stories, in this case "The Wizard of Oz," retold for adults as "Super Maeva de Oz." Today and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7 p.m. Tickets: $10. Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point section of the Bronx; (718) 842-5223 (Jennifer Dunning).

Eliot Feld's high-energy ballet troupe bounds through its spring season with a large repertory that includes the premieres of Mr. Feld's "Coup de Couperin," to the Baroque music of Francois Couperin, and "Nodrog Doggo," to a score by Michael Gordon. (Hint: spell the first word of that odd title backward.) Among the many revivals are five works with music by Steve Reich. And Damian Woetzel, of the New York City Ballet, is appearing as guest artist in all performances of Mr. Feld's "Mending." Today at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 4 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800.

FLAMENCO EXTRAVAGANZA. The cast may change from performance to performance, depending on which guest artists turn up at this intimate club to sing, dance or play flamenco guitar. But the star of the evening is Carmen La Sala, featured with performers like La Conja, Paco Ortiz and Juan Amayatoday and tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. "Scheherazade's Tales," an evening of belly-dancing, may be seen on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., and there is a variety show on Wednesday Thursday at 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $25 for the flamenco program and $15 each for "Scheherazade's Tales" and the variety show.

GUY KLUCEVSEK AND FRIENDS. Guy Klucevsek, a composer-accordionist whose witty, joyous music has helped propel many a dance, will perform in "Squeezeplay," a shared program with choreographers and performance artists who include David Dorfman, Dan Hurlin and Victoria Marks. Today and tomorrow (and Wednesday through Saturday next week) at 8 p.m. Tickets: $20. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793, extension 11.

LA MAMA EXPERIMENTAL THEATER CLUB. You could spend the entire weekend at La MaMa in its multitudinous little spaces.

Once more this former Erick Hawkins dancer is presenting work created with her longtime collaborators Eleanor Hovda, the composer; Anthony Candido, who made the costumes, and Blu, the lighting designer. In this program of new and recent pieces, Ms. Meehan may also be expected to present non-narrative dance that is serene, continuously in motion and beautiful, as Anna Kisselgoff put it in this newspaper, for "the naturalness of its sophistication." Today through Sunday at 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $15; Theater Development Fund vouchers accepted. Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 674-8194 (Dunning).

HEADLINE: House Narrowly Passes Spending Plan With $150 Billion Tax Cut

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, March 24

 BODY:
The House adopted a Republican budget plan this morning that would cut taxes by at least $150 billion over the next five years, provide more money for the military and education and cut spending on most other programs.
The vote was 211 to 207, largely along party lines, and came after Republican leaders had scrambled to avert defections by a bloc of conservatives who said the plan would allow too much spending. 
 Republicans said the plan, a nonbinding blueprint that sets the broad parameters for tax and spending bills, was a balanced approach that provided enough money for national priorities while restraining the overall growth of government and returning a substantial portion of the projected federal budget surplus to taxpayers.
The measure, which because it is not a law is not subject to veto, calls for total government spending authority next year of $1.85 trillion, an increase of 3 percent over this year. It would increase Pentagon spending by 6 percent, to $307.3 billion, and would effectively require cutbacks in most other categories of general government operations after taking account of inflation.
"The question is whether we're going to advance the reform agenda in Washington," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, picking up a theme from his party's expected presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
Democrats said that the plan would force unacceptable cuts in programs from Head Start to the Drug Enforcement Administration, that it did nothing to secure the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and that it also risked plunging the budget back into deficit.
"The Republican budget sacrifices fiscal responsibility on the altar of massive tax cuts," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader.
Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director, said in a letter to congressional leaders that the Clinton administration believed the House budget was "fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable economic plan."
The House defeated five alternative budget plans, including one backed by the Democratic leadership and another offered by a group of conservative Republicans.
Both parties supported using the surplus generated by the Social Security system -- estimated at $2.3 trillion over the next decade -- only to reduce the part of the national debt held by the public in the form of Treasury bonds.
But in many ways the debate was a replay of last year's budget battle, when Republicans passed a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut that was vetoed by President Clinton. And just as they did last year, Republican leaders in the House struggled to hold their slim majority together for the vote.
Fiscal conservatives said the measure did too little to guard against end-of-session surges in spending. Republican members of the appropriations committees that draw up spending bills warned that the spending levels in the budget might be unrealistically low.
The internal problems Republicans faced in the House were mirrored in the Senate, where a group of conservatives led by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas continued to block a vote in the Budget Committee on the Senate's own version of the budget. Mr. Gramm wants the budget to contain less spending and more tax cuts.
Republicans in the House also found themselves in the awkward situation of passing a budget that calls for a smaller tax cut than the one advocated by Mr. Bush in his presidential campaign.
Mr. Bush's plan would cut taxes by $483 billion over the five years starting in 2002, and by about $300 billion during the five-year period, starting next year, covered by the House budget plan. The House plan calls for at least $150 billion in tax cuts, and as much as $240 billion if the projected surplus continues to grow.
Democrats used the unwillingness of the House leadership to embrace the Bush tax plan to buttress their argument that the Texas governor's proposal is excessive even by the standards of his own party.
Much of the partisan wrangling was over the one-sixth of the budget that goes to general domestic spending outside of Social Security, Medicare and the Pentagon. The Republican plan would hold that so-called nonmilitary discretionary spending to $289.2 billion next year, less than a billion dollars more than this year and not nearly enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. Democrats proposed $309 billion in nonmilitary discretionary spending.
The Republican plan would increase spending in a few categories, like education, where spending would rise to $56.8 billion next year, an increase of 27.6 percent. But there would be cuts in most other categories after accounting for inflation.
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the Republican plan would hold nondefense discretionary spending $114 billion below what is needed to keep pace with inflation over the next five years. And he said the entire Republican approach was unrealistic because it failed to acknowledge that even the Republican-led Congress had ultimately passed spending bills each year that increased spending above the rate of inflation.

HEADLINE: India Needs The Bomb

BYLINE: By John J. Mearsheimer; John J. Mearsheimer is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Despite its huge population, booming economy and growing nuclear arsenal, President Clinton, like his predecessors, refuses to show India the respect it deserves. He thereby perpetuates a needless estrangement between two natural allies.
This disrespect is most apparent on the nuclear front. In his address to the Indian Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton acknowledged many of India's concerns, but he did not give up his call for India to abandon its nuclear weapons. The administration wants India to sign both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
 India, however, refused to sign the nonproliferation treaty when it took effect in 1970 and refused again when the treaty was extended in 1995. India tested nuclear weapons in 1998 and has made it clear that it intends to build powerful nuclear forces.
The Clinton administration should stop opposing these moves and recognize that India is not going to give up its nuclear arsenal. India did not acquire these weapons for frivolous reasons, like misplaced pride or domestic politics, as some Americans believe. Rather, India, like the United States, had sound strategic reasons for wanting them.
Nuclear weapons are an excellent deterrent against aggression, and India lives in a dangerous neighborhood. Since gaining independence in 1947, it has fought three wars with Pakistan and has come close to war with Pakistan three other times. India also fought a losing war with China in 1962 over the still-contested Sino-Indian border. Moreover, both Pakistan and China have their own nuclear weapons, and over the next two decades, China will move to develop a much larger arsenal. India would be foolish to allow China to gain a nuclear advantage over it.
The Persian Gulf war of 1991 and the Kosovo war in 1999 also hardened India's determination to possess nuclear weapons. The United States easily beat Iraq and Serbia by exploiting its enormous advantage in conventional arms. Had either foe possessed nuclear weapons, the United States might not have gone to war. This lesson was not lost on India.
Finally, as President Clinton acknowledged on Wednesday, American hypocrisy on nuclear issues rubs Indians the wrong way. The United States allows itself to have nuclear weapons for its own security but says India should not have them for the same purpose. We expect India to sign the test ban treaty even though the United States Senate rejected it.
The Clinton administration should reverse course and recognize that India is a legitimate nuclear state, like Britain and Russia, not a dangerous nuclear rogue like North Korea. It should allow India to keep its nuclear weapons and sign the nonproliferation treaty, with all the attendant rights and obligations.
As a start toward closer political ties, the administration could support India's membership in the United Nations Security Council. At the same time, however, the United States should not one-sidedly favor India against Pakistan when Pakistan has legitimate concerns. Instead, the United States should strive to be a fair broker when disputes arise.
A more realistic policy toward India would benefit both Asia and American interests.
First, the United States could do more to resolve the conflict between India and Pakistan over the territory of Kashmir. India adamantly refuses to allow the United States to mediate that 53-year-old conflict because it has long felt that Washington favors Pakistan. But if the United States demonstrated even-handedness, showing greater sensitivity to India's interests, India might conceivably welcome constructive mediation.
Second, a more realistic policy would promote nuclear stability on the subcontinent. For example, by dropping its prohibition on nuclear weapons, the United States could provide India and Pakistan modern command-and-control technologies that would make their arsenals safer and more reliable. It could also share valuable safety lessons it learned from its competition with the Soviet Union.
Third, in the not-too-distant future, the United States may need other Asian countries to help it contain China. It would be difficult to fashion an effective coalition of Asian countries without India as a central pillar.
Fourth, with its increasing economic power, especially in software and pharmaceuticals, India is becoming an important player in international economic groups like the World Trade Organization. The United States has an interest in making India a cooperative rather than a disruptive force in those institutions.
India and the United States are the world's two largest democracies, and they are both multicultural democracies to boot. It only makes sense for them to be on the same side. It is thus not only in America's economic and strategic interests to become closer to India, but fully in line with its principles and ideals.

HEADLINE: WORLD BRIEFING

BYLINE: Compiled by Terence Neilan Compiled by Terence Neilan

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
FRANCE: NEW PROTESTS BY TEACHERS -- Tens of thousands of teachers marched through Paris to demand more spending on education and the resignation of Education Minister Claude Allegre. Similar demonstrations took place in Marseille, Toulouse and Toulon. The protest movement, which closed most public schools for a day last week, has added to pressure on Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to shake up his cabinet. Marlise Simons (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: AGENT ACCUSED OF TREASON -- Officials said an agent of the domestic Federal Security Service, arrested last week on charges of passing political information and names of Russian agents to Britain, had been charged with high treason. The unidentified agent was arrested as he left for Estonia, whose own officials, the Russians charged, had joined Britain in recruiting the spy. The British declined to comment. Michael Wines (NYT) 
 
BRITAIN: SECRETS STOLEN -- The police revealed that a laptop computer with confidential information about Northern Ireland was stolen from an officer of the M.I.5 secret service on March 4 when he put it on the platform of a London subway station momentarily to help passers-by. The police asserted there was no threat to national security because the information was heavily encrypted, and there was no evidence the thief knew the machine belonged to M.I.5. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BOSNIA, CROATIA: TRAIN PACT -- The two countries agreed in Sarajevo to get trains rolling across their border again. Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnian multiethnic presidency, said there was no starting date for re-establishing the railway, which stopped in 1992, soon after the Bosnian war began. But he praised the new Croatian president, Stipe Mesic, speaking of a "new spirit" between the two countries. (AP)
 
YUGOSLAVIA: SERBS MARK BOMBING -- In a defiant but smaller than expected display of anti-Western sentiment, thousands of Serbs rallied across Yugoslavia to mark the first anniversary of the start of NATO airstrikes. Opposition parties, and some Belgrade residents, said the rallies were in bad taste given the severe losses the country suffered during the conflict. (AP)
 
EUROPEAN UNION: NEW GOAL -- Leaders of the 15-member group approved a range of reforms to join the technological revolution and make them better able to compete with the United States. At the end of a two-day meeting in Lisbon dedicated to the economy, the 15 countries set themselves "a new strategic goal for the next decade" to promote growth and cut unemployment. (Reuters)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: PRESSURE ON PARKS -- Visits to Canada's national parks will double in 15 years to 28 million, according to a government study. Faced with growing pressure from tourists, Sheila Copps, the minister responsible for the country's 39 national parks, vowed "no new ski hills, no new golf courses" and proposed limits on fishing, hiking, camping and snowmobiling in the most popular parks. Ms. Copps has fought to limit development in Banff National Park, the crown jewel of the 115-year-old system. James Brooke (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
PHILIPPINES: DEATH PENALTY SUSPENDED -- President Joseph Estrada has suspended the death penalty until the end of the year "in deference to the celebration of the Catholic Church's Jubilee Year," a palace statement said. The reprieve will be reviewed in January. Amnesty International called the move a breakthrough for rights in the Philippines, where seven people have been executed since 1994, when capital punishment was reintroduced. (Reuters)
 
SRI LANKA: REBELS SKEPTICAL -- The separatist Tamil Tiger rebels called for an internationally monitored cease-fire and a troop pullback before entering Norwegian-brokered peace talks, a Tamil paper reported. A rebel leader called the government's willingness to talk a bid to buy time to modernize the army. (Agence France-Presse)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: CLERIC WARNS REFORMERS -- A prominent member of the conservative Muslim clergy warned reformers who won a landslide victory in February elections not to try to ease Islamic social taboos. "It is not like the new deputies can pass any laws they like," Ayatollah Muhammad Yazdi said in a sermon at Tehran University. "The young people who you think voted for you have no right to demand laws to allow them to dance in the streets, or the annulment of any Islamic mandates." John F. Burns (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: POLICE STILL DEFIANT -- The police continued to defy a court order requiring them to remove black squatters who have invaded hundreds of white farms. The police said they needed specific instructions from the government before moving against the squatters, who are led by veterans of Zimbabwe's war of independence from Britain. President Robert Mugabe has spoken out in support of the squatters. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
NIGERIA: CEASE-FIRE PROCLAIMED -- President Olusegun Obasanjo announced that communities at war over land rights have agreed to a cease-fire, ending hostilities in which at least 80 people have died. "The police will enforce the cease-fire," the president said. The long-running feud between the two communities in Ife and Modakeke, both from Mr. Obasanjo's Yoruba ethnic group, erupted anew on March 3 and involves a dispute over land ownership and local politics. (Agence France-Presse)
 
BURUNDI: GUERRILLAS JOIN IN -- The leader of Burundi's second largest Hutu guerrilla army said he would join peace talks in Tanzania along with the head of the largest Hutu group, who agreed to take part on Monday. Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, who is acting as mediator, has consistently attributed the lack of progress in the 21-month-old talks to the absence of the Hutu rebels who are fighting the Tutsi-led army. (Agence France-Presse)
