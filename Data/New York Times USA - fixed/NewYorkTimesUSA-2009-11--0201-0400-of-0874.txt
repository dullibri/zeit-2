HEADLINE: House Democrats Seek Allies for Health Care Vote

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democratic leaders worked furiously on Thursday to secure the final votes for weekend approval of a sweeping health care overhaul as President Obama threw his weight behind the lobbying effort and Republicans dug in against the health plan.
 Democratic vote counters, working as thousands of conservative protesters chanted ''kill the bill'' outside the Capitol and later swarmed through Congressional office buildings, said they did not yet have the necessary 218 confirmed supporters. But they said they were confident they would exceed that total in time for a landmark vote set for Saturday on the $1.1 trillion, 10-year health plan that many Democrats have sought for years.
 Readying for the first floor test of legislation months in the making, top Democrats appealed to undecided lawmakers while trying to quell resistance from Hispanic House members worried the measure was too punitive regarding illegal immigrants and anti-abortion lawmakers who fear that public money could be funneled toward abortions.
 ''We have a historic opportunity for us to, again, provide quality health care for all Americans,'' said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. ''It's something that many of us have worked our whole political lifetimes on.'' 
 Mr. Obama, who was expected to make a trip to the Capitol on Friday for a final personal appeal, made a surprise public appearance at the White House on Thursday to tout endorsements for the House measure from the American Medical Association and AARP, the senior advocacy group.
 He noted that the endorsements covered viewpoints from two distinct sides of the debate: elderly Americans fearful that a health care overhaul could cut into Medicare, and the nation's doctors and medical professionals.
 ''We are closer to passing this reform than ever before,'' the president told reporters. ''And now that the doctors and medical professionals of America are standing with us, now that the organizations charged with looking out for the interests of seniors are standing with us, we are even closer.''
 While Democrats sought to build support, Republicans engaged in an equally determined effort to block the measure, with House Republicans lining up to address thousands of conservatives gathered at the West Front of the Capitol. No House Republican is expected to vote for the measure, meaning its entire support has to come from within the 258-member Democrat caucus.
 At the rally, initiated by Representative Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, those attending were encouraged to press their lawmakers to vote against the bill. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, called it the ''greatest threat to freedom that I have seen in the 19 years I've been in Washington.''
 ''Let's get to work,'' Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, exhorted the crowd. ''We've got a lot of work to do between now and Saturday.'' 
 Arriving from around the country, the opponents were imbued with conservative principles and skepticism of the federal government's ability to administer health care programs. 
 ''The government couldn't even get the shots out,'' said Karen Ambrose of Sunbury, Ohio, ridiculing the government's efforts to vaccinate people for the H1N1 virus as an example of what government-run health care would look like. ''Let's just get the government out of all this.'' 
 After the rally, the Capitol police arrested a dozen protesters on charges of causing a disturbance at offices of Ms. Pelosi in the Cannon Building.
 Some Democrats from more conservative districts, like Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma, Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia and Representative Bobby Bright of Alabama, made it clear they would oppose the measure. 
 ''The worst thing we could do in a recession is raise taxes, and this bill does just that,'' said Mr. Boren, who also said he feared the proposal would lead to a single-payer national health care system. ''Finally, I do not believe that the possibility for taxpayer-funded abortion has been clearly and emphatically removed from this legislation.''
 Several others, including Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania, remained undecided. Mr. Altmire, a centrist Democrat from a district west of Pittsburgh, said he had been courted heavily in recent days by members of the Democratic leadership and their emissaries seeking to nail down his vote.
 ''They are trying to get you any way they can,'' said Mr. Altmire, who also met for an hour on Thursday with conservative constituents who traveled to Washington to take part in the rally. ''I am doing the best I can against competing interests.''
 Democrats picked up one enthusiastic vote on Thursday as John Garamendi of California was sworn in as a representative after his victory in a special election on Tuesday night.
 ''This is something I have worked on for more than 35 years,'' said Mr. Garamendi, a veteran state official, of the health care plan. ''This time we will get it done.''
 Bill Owens, a New York Democrat who also won a special election Tuesday, is expected to be sworn in Friday, adding another vote to the Democratic tally. 
 Others were also coming on board.
 ''I'm getting there,'' said Representative Zack Space, an Ohio Democrat who won a Republican seat in the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006.
 In an effort to attract votes, House leaders revised their bill to help certain doctor-owned hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people on Medicaid.
 The change was intended to win support for the bill from Democrats like Representative Harry Teague of New Mexico. He has not said how he will vote, but aides said he had been trying to put language into the bill that would improve the situation for a doctor-owned hospital in his district.
 Democratic leaders said they expected to face a series of unusually difficult procedural votes before the vote on the bill itself. Party leaders said they were trying to shape a preliminary vote to allay concerns of anti-abortion Democrats demanding that public money not be used to pay for abortions or go to insurance plans that cover abortions. 
 The American Cancer Society joined AARP and the American Medical Association in backing the bill.
 Dr. J. James Rohack, the president of the medical association, said the House measure ''is not the perfect bill,'' but ''warrants support to keep the process moving.'' It ''goes a long way toward expanding access to high-quality, affordable health coverage for all Americans,'' Dr. Rohack said.
 While the House prepares for a vote, no bill has been moved to the floor of the Senate, where Democratic leaders say they are awaiting cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.

HEADLINE: Yankees' Challenge Now Is Time

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
It was never as easy as the Yankees made it seem the last time they were champions. They won four World Series in five seasons, from 1996 through 2000. They did not win again until Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
 ''You forget how good it feels after the final out,'' said the captain, Derek Jeter, after the clubhouse celebration early Thursday morning. ''But I appreciated the last ones we won. I knew it was very, very difficult to do. If it was easy, people would be repeating every year. No one's done it since we did.''
 The Boston Red Sox won twice this decade, but not consecutively. The Philadelphia Phillies won last season, but the Yankees vanquished them in six games this time. The St. Louis Cardinals won two pennants, but only one title.
 The Yankees tried to spend their way back to a championship, with nothing to show for it. Their total payroll in the eight years without a title was more than $1.3 billion, by far the most in baseball. They have the most fans and the grandest tradition to uphold, and they never apologize. 
 They won a lot from 2001 to 2008, just not when it mattered most. The Yankees led the majors in regular-season victories over those seasons, with 775, about four more per season than the Red Sox. The capricious nature of the three-tiered postseason continually tripped up the Yankees, who bowed in the first round four times.
 Yet it was not simply bad luck that knocked the Yankees from their perch. They were old, and age will be the biggest challenge in cultivating another dynasty. The team's first test comes immediately, a clash of sentiment and practicality involving two of their best players in the World Series.
 The hit that broke open Game 6 was a two-run single in the third inning by Hideki Matsui, 35, who batted .615 in the World Series and was named the most valuable player. Johnny Damon, who turned 36 on Thursday and hit .364, strained his right calf muscle while scoring on the play.
 Both were on the bench for the end of the series, Damon out with the injury, Matsui because he was used exclusively as the designated hitter this season. Damon, a speedy left fielder with a weak arm, has said he loves the occasional day as a D.H. Both players' contracts have expired.
 Ideally, the Yankees want the flexibility to use the designated hitter spot for players like Jeter, 35; third baseman Alex Rodriguez, 34; and catcher Jorge Posada, 38. But Matsui and Damon are freshly minted World Series legends, clearly still capable of producing.
 ''They've been huge for us,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said on the field after Game 6. ''Those guys have always been big for us. We haven't had our meetings; we haven't done that type of stuff. Now's not the time to deal with that. We're going to celebrate. The business side will kick in soon.''
 Cashman reflected on his first clinching game as general manager, in 1998, when his thoughts turned to the pending free agency of Bernie Williams, Scott Brosius and others, even before the final out.
 In the celebration after the Yankees won, Williams received an ovation at City Hall, the crowd roaring for him to return. It could be that way for Matsui and Damon after Friday's parade, as the city toasts another victory. 
 Inevitably, a warm afterglow gives way to cold business. In 1998, Williams negotiated with the Red Sox before the Yankees re-signed him for seven years. He played one more year after that contract expired, and then Cashman let him go. It was an unpopular call, but Williams was 38 and limited, and he never played in the majors again. 
 Cashman can be a calculating businessman when empowered to make decisions, as he seems to be now for a managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, who trusts him. Cashman likely understands, deep down, that a great achievement of the season was probably keeping so many older players healthy and productive.
 Four significant Yankees in their mid- to late-30s were coming off surgery: Posada to his shoulder; Matsui to his knee; Mariano Rivera to his shoulder; Rodriguez to his hip. All had standout years, putting off the inevitable decline caused by age.
 How long can they all defy time? Nobody knows, of course, but the issue will not be as pressing if the Yankees get younger. Matsui will seek a two-year contract and the chance to prove he can still play in the field. Damon's agent, Scott Boras, could cite the four-year deal the Yankees gave Posada in 2007 as a reason to give his client the same.
 Last winter, the Yankees showered $423.5 million on starters C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett and first baseman Mark Teixeira. It was wild spending in a depressed economy, but it made shrewd baseball sense. Sabathia is 29, Teixeira 30, Burnett 32 -- all in their primes.
 It was a sharp contrast to many of the high-profile additions the Yankees made in the years since the 2000 championship. Mike Mussina, Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, Carl Pavano and Jaret Wright were all older than Sabathia at the time of their Yankees debuts. Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield were older than Teixeira -- and both, the Yankees later learned, had connections to performance-enhancing drugs. (So did Brown.)
 In the era of steroids testing, the traditional career arc is returning and younger players tend to be more valuable than veterans. And pitchers, the theory goes, are most valuable of all.
 ''They finally got it, and it was pitching,'' said Rivera, who vowed to pitch five more years during the postgame celebration. ''The two best guys that were there, and the best first baseman that was there, made our team complete. And that's the result of hard work for the whole spring training, for the whole season till today.
 ''The heart that these guys have, and the desire and the will that these three players have, it looked like they were here for years. And this is only the first season of many.''
 The younger supporting players should become more prominent soon. Robinson Cano, Melky Cabrera, Francisco Cervelli and Brett Gardner are all under 28. Pitchers Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes -- next year's fourth and fifth starters, perhaps -- are under 25. Dave Robertson and Mark Melancon, the setup men in waiting, are 24. Outfielder Austin Jackson, 22, hit .300 in his first year at Class AAA.
 They have all been part of Cashman's plan, prospects to hoard instead of to trade, even for an ace pitcher like Johan Santana two years ago. Lean payroll at the bottom makes it easier to carry heavy payroll at the top.
 After Game 6, a reporter mentioned the team's unabashed spending to Cashman and said, ''There are fans of other teams who go, 'Well, they're the only team that can do that, of course they won.' How do you respond to that?''
 The question was tough but fair, and Cashman gave a perfectly pinstriped response. ''You can call us anything you want,'' he said. ''You also have to call us world champions.''

HEADLINE: What Independents Want

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Liberals and conservatives each have their own intellectual food chains. They have their own think tanks to provide arguments, politicians and pundits to amplify them, and news media outlets to deliver streams of prejudice-affirming stories. 
 Independents, who are the largest group in the electorate, don't have any of this. They don't have institutional affiliations. They don't look to certain activist lobbies for guidance. There aren't many commentators who come from an independent perspective.
 Independents are herds of cats who find out what they think through a meandering process of discovery. Right now, independent voters are astonishingly volatile. Democrats did poorly in elections on Tuesday partly because of disappointed liberals who think that President Obama is moving too slowly, but mostly because of anxious suburban independents who think he is moving too fast. In Pennsylvania, there was an eight-point swing away from the Democrats among independents from a year ago. In New Jersey, there was a 12-point swing. In Virginia, there was a 13-point swing. 
 The most telling races this year were the suburban rebellions across the country. For example, in Westchester and Nassau counties in New York, Republican candidates came from nowhere to defeat entrenched Democratic county officials. In blue Pennsylvania, the G.O.P. won six out of seven statewide offices.
 Middle-class suburban voters who have been trending Democratic for a decade suddenly lurched out of the Democratic camp -- and are now in play.
 Why? What do these voters want?
 The first thing to say is that this recession has hit the new suburbs hardest, exactly where independents are likely to live. According to a survey by the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University, 76 percent of suburbanites say they or someone they know have lost a job in the past year.
 The second thing to say is that in this time of need, these voters are not turning to government for support. Trust in government is at its lowest level in recent memory. Over the past year, there has been a shift to the right on issue after issue. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans who believe that there is too much government regulation rose from 38 percent in 2008 to 45 percent in 2009. The percentage of Americans who want unions to have less influence rose from 32 percent to a record 42 percent.
 Americans have moved to the right on abortion, immigration and global warming. Over the past seven months, the number of people who say government is doing too many things better left to business has jumped from 40 percent to 48 percent, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. 
 According to that same survey, only 31 percent of Americans believe that the president and Congress ''should worry more about boosting the economy even though it may mean larger budget deficits.'' Sixty-two percent, twice as many, believe the president and Congress ''should worry more about keeping the deficit down, even though it may mean it will take longer for the economy to recover.''
 These shifts have not occurred because conservatives and liberals have changed their minds. They haven't. The shift is among independents. 
 According to Gallup, the share of independents who describe their views as conservative has moved from 29 percent last year to 35 percent today. The share of independents who believe there is too much government regulation of business has jumped from 38 percent to 50 percent. Independents are in the position of a person who is feeling gravely ill at the same time he has lost faith in his doctor.
 This does not mean that independents are turning into Republicans. G.O.P. ratings are still in the toilet. But it does mean the Democrats have to fight to regain some of their most crucial supporters.
 If I were a politician trying to win back independents, I'd say something like this: When I was a kid, I had a jigsaw puzzle of the U.S. Each state was a piece, and on it there was a drawing showing what people made there. California might have movies; Washington State, apples; New York, fashion or publishing. That puzzle represented an economy that was diverse and deeply rooted. 
 We've lost that. First Wall Street got disproportionately big, then Washington. It's time to return to fundamentals. No short-term fixes. Government should do what it's supposed to do: schools, roads, basic research. It should not be picking C.E.O.'s or setting pay or fizzing up the economy with more debt. It should give people the tools to compete, not rig the competition. Lines of restraint have dissolved, and they need to be restored.
 Independents support the party that seems most likely to establish a frame of stability and order, within which they can lead their lives. They can't always articulate what they want, but they withdraw from any party that threatens turmoil and risk. As always, they're looking for a safe pair of hands.

HEADLINE: Stimulus To Expand From Bank Of England

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and MATTHEW SALTMARSH. 
Julia Werdigier reported from London and Matthew Saltmarsh from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The Bank of England decided on Thursday to inject an additional $:25 billion ($40 billion) into the still-sputtering British economy to try to promote a recovery. By contrast, in the healthier euro zone, the European Central Bank suggested it would soon be ready to remove some of its bank-support measures.
 Along with its new stimulus, the British central bank decided to leave its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent. 
 The European Central Bank also kept its main rate steady, at 1 percent, and indicated that it would not increase borrowing costs soon.
 But at a news conference, the E.C.B. president, Jean-Claude Trichet, suggested that strengthening economic activity and bank health would permit the central bank to cautiously dismantle its huge support programs. 
 ''Not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past,'' he said. The phasing out of these steps -- including auctions of funds and purchases of covered bonds -- would be ''timely and gradual,'' he added. 
 Many investors already expect the E.C.B. to end its extended 12-month credits for banks this year, and Mr. Trichet said that he would not wish to ''dispel'' this notion. 
 He will offer more details on the auctions after the E.C.B.'s next meeting Dec. 3. The third, and probably last, auction is set for Dec. 16. 
 Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING, said Mr. Trichet was preparing the ground to ''gently drain liquidity'' and let money market rates drift higher. 
 The vote by the Bank of England's monetary committee raised the amount of assets being bought in its stimulus program, mainly government bonds, to $:200 billion. It was the third increase since the central bank began buying assets with $:75 billion in March.
 ''The prospect is for a slow recovery in the level of economic activity,'' the bank said in a statement. It noted that there were signs of recovery elsewhere, especially in emerging markets, but that global activity as a whole remained ''significantly depressed.''
 Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital in London, said the British economy was faring especially poorly. ''Britain seems to be lagging even the laggards,'' he said shortly before the decision.
 Consumers have continued to reduce spending because of concerns about rising unemployment. The services and hotel sectors have struggled as people stay at home rather than eat out or take trips. 
 Gross domestic product in Britain fell 0.4 percent in the third quarter, surprising many economists who expected slight growth helped by a weak pound. It was the sixth consecutive contraction, meaning Britain's economy has probably failed to follow the United States, Germany, France and Japan out of recession.
 The decision to expand the bond-purchasing program came amid an intensifying debate about whether it has actually helped. Former policy makers argued in London this week that while the program helped to improve debt markets, the effects had failed to trickle down to the rest of the economy. Lower rates and a weak pound might be the real motor for the recovery, they argued.
 The pound fell further this week after the European Union required the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group, the largest consumer banks in Britain, to sell large parts of their businesses to comply with regulations for accepting government aid. 
 Facing a general election next year, the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is fighting to reduce a record budget deficit that is forecast to approach 15 percent of gross domestic product this year. 
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it would keep its benchmark rate at virtually zero and that economic conditions were likely to warrant ''exceptionally low'' rates for ''an extended period.''
 But recent economic data from the 16 countries in the euro area have been generally positive, although some analysts are concerned that the uptick in activity in the second and third quarters may have been overly dependent on stimulus measures, especially concerning automobile sales.

HEADLINE: The Forever War of the Mind

BYLINE: By Max Cleland. 
Max Cleland, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission, was a Democratic senator from Georgia from 1997 to 2003. He is the author, with Ben Raines, of ''Heart of a Patriot: How I Found the Courage to Survive Vietnam, Walter Reed and Karl Rove.''

 BODY:
''EVERY day I was in Vietnam, I thought about home. And, every day I've been home, I've thought about Vietnam.'' So said one of the millions of soldiers who fought there as I did. Change the name of the battlefield and it could have been said by one of the American servicemen coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan today. Wars are not over when the shooting stops. They live on in the lives of those who fight them. That is the curse of the soldier. He never forgets. 
 While the authorities say they cannot yet tell us why an Army psychiatrist would go on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, we do know the sorts of stories he had been dealing with as he tried to help those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan readjust to life outside the war zone. A soldier's mind can be just as dangerous to himself, and to those around him, as wars fought on traditional battlefields. 
 War is haunting. Death. Pain. Blood. Dismemberment. A buddy dying in your arms. Imagine trying to get over the memory of a bomb splitting a Humvee apart beneath your feet and taking your leg with it. The first time I saw the stilled bodies of American soldiers dead on the battlefield is as stark and brutal a memory as the one of the grenade that ripped off my right arm and both legs.
 No, the soldier never forgets. But neither should the rest of us. 
 Veterans returning today represent the first real influx of combat-wounded soldiers in a generation. They are returning to a nation unprepared for what war does to the soul. Those new veterans will need all of our help. After America's wars, the used-up fighters are too often left to fend for themselves. Many of the hoboes in the Depression were veterans of World War I. When they came home, they were labeled shell-shocked and discharged from the Army too broken to make it during the economic cataclysm. 
 So it is again, with too many stories about veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan ending up unemployed and homeless. Figures from the Department of Veterans Affairs show that 131,000 of the nation's 24 million veterans are homeless each night, and about twice that many will spend part of this year homeless. 
 We know of the recent failures at Walter Reed Medical Center, where soldiers were stranded in substandard barracks infested with rats while awaiting treatment. I was in Walter Reed myself at that time seeking counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder, which, ignited by a barrage of Iraq headlines and the loss of my United States Senate seat, had simply consumed me. 
 I never saw it coming. Forty years after I had left the battlefield, my memories of death and wounding were suddenly as fresh and present as they had been in 1968. I thought I was past that. I learned that none of us are ever past it. Were it not for the surgeons and nurses at Walter Reed, I never would have survived those first months back from Vietnam. Were it not for the counselors there today, I do not think I would have survived what I've come to call my second Vietnam, the one that played out entirely in my mind. 
 When I was wounded, post-traumatic stress disorder did not officially exist. It was recognized as a legitimate illness only in 1978, during my tenure as head of the Veterans Administration under President Jimmy Carter. Today, it is not only recognized, but the Army and the V.A. know how to treat it. I can offer no better testament than my own recovery. 
 Weeks before the troubles at Walter Reed became public in 2007, my counselor put it to me simply. ''We are drowning in war,'' she said. The problems at Walter Reed had nothing to do with the dedicated doctors and nurses there. The problems had to do with the White House and Congress and the Department of Defense. The problems had to do with money. 
 When we are at war, America spends billions on missiles, tanks, attack helicopters and such. But the wounded warriors who will never fight again tend to be put on the back burner. 
 This is inexcusable, and it comes with frightening moral costs. There are estimates that 35 percent of the soldiers who fought in Iraq will suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. I'm sure the numbers for Afghanistan are similar. Researchers have found that nearly half of those returning with the disorder have suicidal thoughts. Suicide among active-duty soldiers is on pace to hit a record total this year. More than 1.7 million soldiers have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Imagine that some 600,000 of them will have crippling memories, trapped in a vivid and horrible past from which they can't seem to escape. 
 We have a family Army today, unlike the Army seen in any generation before. We have fought these wars with the Reserves and the National Guard. Fathers, mothers, soccer coaches and teachers are the soldiers coming home. Whether they like it or not, they will bring their war experiences home to their families and communities. 
 In his poem ''The Dead Young Soldiers,'' Archibald MacLeish, whose younger brother died in World War I, has the soldiers in the poem tell us:''We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.'' Until we help our returning soldiers get their lives back when they come home, the promise of restoring that meaning will go unfulfilled.

HEADLINE: In Anxious Times, Medical Help for the Mind As Well as the Body

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
STRESSED? Depressed? Or worse?
 You wouldn't be alone. Unstable economic times can lead to unstable states of mind. 
 ''As life becomes more unpredictable, levels of toxic stress increase,'' says David L. Shern, the president of Mental Health America, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Alexandria, Va.
 But when you're worrying about money, it's hard to spend money on getting help -- as in $200-an-hour therapy sessions.
 That's how Karen Nienhauser felt. Her family had experienced considerable turmoil over the last year, and she knew they could benefit from therapy. But because she and her husband were both working only part time and money was tight. Ms. Nienhauser, who lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., did something she had never done before. The family has insurance through her husband's part-time teaching job, so she went to the insurer's list of approved psychologists and chose one. 
 In the past she would have gotten a recommendation from a friend or doctor and paid the going rate. ''I used to think network therapists were not as good,'' she said. ''But I was wrong.'' She's delighted with her choice and the cost: just $30 a session, no matter how many family members attend.
 If you have a job, and insurance that includes mental health benefits, you can find affordable care -- but you need to shop wisely. 
 You also need to be aware that your benefits might be changing in the coming year. Because of a new federal law that takes effect for most insurance plans on Jan. 1, the Mental Health Parity Act, there is a very good chance that your mental health coverage has indeed changed -- possibly for the better. 
 In this column I will explore how to make the most of your mental health benefits. In a future column, I'll discuss how to find free or low-cost mental health care if you don't have insurance.
 THE CHANGES You might have noticed in the materials your employer handed out recently during open enrollment that your mental health benefits would look different in 2010. For instance, rather than being given a set number of visits, you may have unlimited visits now, but possibly with additional administrative hurdles before you can have access to the care. 
 That's because of that Mental Health Parity Act, which Congress passed last year.
 As of Jan. 1, the law requires that group plans covering more than 50 people provide the same level of care for mental health and substance abuse problems as for medical ones. Right now, most employer plans provide less coverage for mental health -- say, by limiting the amount of visits you can make to a provider or setting higher annual deductibles than for medical care.
 The law's changes can be good and not so good. Good, because you might have access to more care. Not so good if there are new requirements, like getting precertification for coverage, that place additional barriers to getting treatment, says Kaye Pestaina, vice president of health care compliance for the Segal Company, a benefits consulting firm. 
 ''Employees should make sure their employer provides information to them about any new medical management rules,'' Ms. Pestaina said.
 TRY EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE If you need care, and your situation is not dire, consider going to your company's employee assistance program, which might be able to arrange free counseling sessions with a nearby therapist. Often, employees are offered three or so sessions. 
 But Janice Dragotta, a senior consultant at the benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt, says that the number of sessions might be more like five to eight in the coming year. ''Employers want to solve problems at an early point, realizing that early intervention is critical,'' says Ms. Dragotta, who is also a clinical social worker. 
 FOR URGENT HELP If your situation is dire, say you or a family member is dangerously depressed, call your insurer, explain your situation and ask for guidance. The plan can help match you with a therapist who specializes in the issue you are facing. In some cases, you might need to have your care preapproved by your insurer. This is often as simple as calling the 800 number and explaining what you need to the person who takes your call.
 Ms. Nienhauser, for instance, talked to an insurance representative on the phone and was able to get approval for 12 months of coverage.
 TRY BARGAINING The most cost-effective approach is to stay in network, because rates are lower. But what if the therapist you like is out of network? You might be reimbursed for part of that bill, but if that's still too high for your current budget, bargain. 
 Yes, it's appropriate to ask your therapist for a discount, especially if it's for short-term therapy or as a temporary measure.
 ''We've seen requests for fee adjustments increase this year,'' says Maxine Gann, a psychoanalyst who is on the faculty of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan. ''Money should always be a topic of discussion in therapy. People should absolutely bring it up.''
 IF DRUGS ARE NEEDED If you need medication to help stabilize your mood, explain to your doctor that cost is an issue. Some of the newer drugs prescribed for depression like Cymbalta, can be $100 to $200 for a 30-day supply, and your insurer will very likely charge you either a portion of that cost or a steep $30 or $40 co-payment. 
 But older drugs like Paxil and Prozac, in generic form, can be as little as $5 or $10 for a month's supply. Some insurers are now insisting that doctors first try generic drugs before prescribing pricier ones, according to Ms. Pestaina. If you are seeing a network therapist, that person might bring this up without your asking. 
 FURTHER TREATMENT If you or a family member is in therapy and needs to be hospitalized or requires a more expensive type of treatment, ask for the ''medical necessity criteria'' for the condition, which insurers use to determine whether the requested treatment is medically necessary. 
 Under the new Mental Health Parity Act, insurers must provide you with written documentation of their criteria. This way, you will know in advance if your insurer will cover the extra treatment you believe you or your family member needs. In addition, if an insurer denies your claim, it must explain why. 
 BE PUSHY During times of high anxiety you need all the support you can get. Don't be shy about using your mental health benefits, and don't be shy about challenging your insurer if you are not getting the help you need. The new law provides people with mental health issues greater access to care -- take advantage of it.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE HITS 10.2%, WITH MORE UNDEREMPLOYED

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
For all the pain caused by the Great Recession, the job market still was not in as bad shape as it had been during the depths of the early 1980s recession -- until now.
 With the release of the jobs report on Friday, the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment tracked by the Labor Department has reached its highest level in decades. If statistics went back so far, the measure would almost certainly be at its highest level since the Great Depression.
 In all, more than one out of every six workers -- 17.5 percent -- were unemployed or underemployed in October. The previous recorded high was 17.1 percent, in December 1982. 
 This includes the officially unemployed, who have looked for work in the last four weeks. It also includes discouraged workers, who have looked in the past year, as well as millions of part-time workers who want to be working full time.
 The official jobless rate -- 10.2 percent in October, up from 9.8 percent in September -- remains lower than the early 1980s peak of 10.8 percent. 
 The rate is highest today, sometimes 20 percent, in states that had big housing bubbles, like California and Arizona, or that have large manufacturing sectors, like Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
 The new benchmark is a sign of just how much damage financial crises tend to inflict. A recent book by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, two economists, found that over the last century the typical crisis had caused the jobless rate in the country where it occurred to rise for almost five years. By that standard, the jobless rate here would continue rising for two more years, through the end of 2011.
 Most economists predict that the rate will in fact begin to fall next year, largely because of the federal government's aggressive response -- fiscal stimulus, interest-rate cuts and a variety of creative steps by the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department. Friday's report showed that monthly job losses continued to slow recently, though the improvement has been gradual. 
 At the White House Friday, President Obama signed a bill to extend unemployment benefits and a tax credit for home buyers, and said that he was looking at ways to enact more stimulus. On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it expected to leave its benchmark interest at zero for ''an extended period.''
 Nearly 16 million people are now unemployed and more than seven million jobs have been lost since late 2007.
 Officially, the Labor Department's broad measure of unemployment goes back only to 1994. But early this year, with the help of economists at the department, The New York Times created a version that estimates it going back to 1970. If such a measure were available for the Depression, it probably would have exceeded 30 percent.
 Compared with the early 1980s, a smaller share of workers today are officially unemployed and a smaller share are considered discouraged workers. 
 But there are many more people who would like to be working full time and have been able to find only part-time work, according to the government's monthly survey of workers. The rapid increase in their ranks and in the officially unemployed has caused the rate to rise much faster in this recession than in the early 1980s. Two years ago, it was only 8.2 percent.
 One of the more striking aspects of the Great Recession is that most of its impact has fallen on a relatively narrow group of workers. This is evident primarily in two ways.
 First, the number of people who have experienced any unemployment is surprisingly low, given the severity of the recession. The pace of layoffs has increased, but the peak layoff rate this year was the same as it was during the 2001 recession, which was a fairly mild downturn. The main reason that the unemployment rate has soared is the hiring rate has plummeted. 
 So fewer workers than might be expected have lost their jobs. But those without work are paying a steep price, because finding a new job is extremely difficult.
 Second, wages have continued to rise for most people who still have jobs. The average hourly wage for rank-and-file workers, who make up about four-fifths of the work force, actually accelerated in October, according to the new report.
 Even though some companies have cut the pay of workers, the average hourly wage has still risen 1.5 to 2.5 percent over the last year, depending on which government survey is examined. Average weekly pay has risen less -- zero to 1 percent -- because hours have been cut. But average prices have fallen. Altogether, the typical worker has received a 1 to 2 percent inflation-adjusted raise over the last year.
 In the other two severe recessions in recent decades, workers with jobs fared considerably worse. At the same point in the mid-1970s downturn, real weekly pay had fallen 7 percent; in the early 1980s recession, it had fallen 4 percent. 
 It is a strange combination: workers who still have a job are doing better than in other deep recessions, but the unemployment and underemployment have risen to their highest level since the Depression.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Real' Unemployment at a High: When both unemployment and underemployment are counted, roughly one in six workers who would like full-time work could not find it in October. At 17.5 percent, this broader rate of job-market distress is the highest it's been since at least 1970 and most likely since the Great Depression.(Source: New York Times Analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics figures)(B6)

PERSON: Nien Cheng 

HEADLINE: Nien Cheng, Memoirist, Is Dead at 94

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Nien Cheng, whose memoir, ''Life and Death in Shanghai,'' offered a harrowing account of the Cultural Revolution in China and her years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Red Guards, died last Monday at her home in Washington. She was 94. 
 The cause was cardiovascular and renal disease, said Catherine Mack, the executor of her estate. 
 As the widow of a diplomat and businessman and an adviser to a foreign oil company, Mrs. Cheng found herself in a politically dangerous position as the Cultural Revolution gathered strength in the 1960s. In 1966 she was arrested by Red Guards and charged with espionage. 
 She spent the next six and a half years in solitary confinement at the No. 1 Detention House in Shanghai, harshly interrogated and beaten by her jailers, to whom she responded with defiance and mockery. 
 ''I grew up with a strong sense of loyalty, and duty, to my country,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1987. ''I felt humiliated that they should accuse me, who loved my country, of being a spy. I could not accept it, I had to fight. In prison, sometimes I would get so mad -- I was rarely depressed -- by and large my predominant emotion was anger.''
 In 1973 she was told that the authorities had agreed to release her in recognition of an ''improvement in her way of thinking and an attitude of repentance.'' She refused to leave and vowed to stay in prison until the government declared her innocent and issued an apology in the press. 
 Astonished prison officials pushed her out the door, grumbling that ''in all the years of the detention house, we have never had a prisoner like you, so truculent and argumentative.'' 
 Once outside, she learned that her only child, Meiping, an actress with the Shanghai Film Studio, was dead. The official explanation was suicide, but Mrs. Cheng learned that her daughter had been murdered by the Red Guards for refusing to denounce her mother as a class enemy. 
 In 1987, after emigrating to Canada and then the United States, Mrs. Cheng published her memoir, which began, memorably, with the sentence ''The past is forever with me, and I remember it all.'' The book won critical acclaim and became a best seller. Stanley Karnow, reviewing it in The Washington Post, echoed the prevailing critical response when he wrote that ''her narrative deserves to rank with the foremost prison diaries of our time.'' 
 Yao Nien was born on Jan. 28, 1915, in Beijing. Her father, the descendant of wealthy landowners, was a vice minister in the navy. In 1935 she went to study at the London School of Economics, where she became a fervent socialist and met her husband, Kang-chi Cheng. 
 Mr. Cheng entered the diplomatic service after returning to China and was posted to Australia, where he and Mrs. Cheng spent the war years, returning to China in 1948. When Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan the following year, the Chengs remained in China. Mr. Cheng became the general manager for Shell Oil in Shanghai, and after his death in 1957, Mrs. Cheng became a special adviser to the company, negotiating its tenuous relationship with the new Communist government. 
 She later speculated that her interrogators were eager to compile evidence that would incriminate Zhou Enlai, the prime minister, who opposed the Cultural Revolution. Specifically, she theorized, they hoped to extract a confession that a business trip to Britain that she and her husband had taken with Zhou's approval was in fact a spy mission.
 After being released from prison, Mrs. Cheng, still regarded as politically suspect, moved back into her house, now subdivided and occupied by numerous tenants. In 1980 she gained permission to leave China. Once abroad, she had access to money in her husband's overseas accounts and was able to live in relative comfort in Washington. 
 There are no immediate survivors. 
 ''She was a humble person,'' said James A. Dorn, the vice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute and a friend of Mrs. Cheng's. ''She said: 'I didn't really do anything. I just recorded what I saw, and I wrote it for my daughter.' ''

HEADLINE: Concierges and Marble Baths: For Some at Columbia, This Is Dorm Life

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Last year, when Columbia University tried to interest Ben Cox, then a first-year M.B.A. student, in its new apartment building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, he scoffed. It was too far from the campus in Manhattan, he thought, and the unit was a bit expensive. He did not even bother to look at it.
 He and his family -- his wife, Sasha, and their young boy -- moved instead into an apartment in Manhattan. But at 500 square feet, it felt tiny, especially compared with the house they had owned back in Minnesota. When their second son arrived in April, the Riverdale building, called the Arbor, suddenly seemed more appealing. ''We called and wrote letters and e-mailed for a month to get in here,'' Mrs. Cox said. ''Everyone who has a kid wants to be here because it's the largest apartment you can get.''
 Columbia, which provides housing for more than half of its 13,000 graduate students, owns dozens of apartment buildings, many with prewar charm and within walking distance of the university's campus in Morningside Heights. Now it also offers students an apartment in the Arbor, a sleek building in Riverdale that was privately developed as a condominium. 
 The university snapped up the Arbor, a nine-story building at 235th Street and the Henry Hudson Parkway, in July 2008 for $67 million after the developer struggled to sell the condominiums. (Prices started at $400,000.) Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for Columbia, said the decision to buy the Arbor, which has 127 apartments, was part of a strategy of ''opportunistic purchases.'' It was chosen, he said, because it ''offers apartment layouts that are conducive to families.''
 Other colleges have taken advantage of the real estate slump to push expansion plans. The City University of New York recently decided to move its law school from a cramped former junior high school in Flushing, Queens, to an underused Citigroup office building center in Long Island City, also in Queens. CUNY will pay Citigroup $155 million for six floors in the two-year-old building, far less than the cost of new construction.
 In Providence, R.I., Johnson & Wales University signed a lease this year on a four-story condominium building with river views and granite-and-stainless-steel kitchens. The three-year lease, with an option to renew, allowed the university to house 300 additional students this fall, when the demand for housing was ''significantly higher'' than usual, said Lisa Pelosi, a spokeswoman. The developer had tried to market the building, opposite the train station, as the economy went into free fall.
 Columbia's purchase of the Arbor also reflects the increasing diversity of graduate students, who are often in midcareer, married with children or both. The Coxes, who moved into a two-bedroom apartment in September, are still adjusting to the luxurious touches not found in most university-owned housing: oversize picture windows, individual washers and dryers, stainless-steel appliances, marble bathrooms, a 24-hour concierge, a fitness center, even a colorful playroom with a slide and toys.
 ''This is pretty extraordinary,'' Mr. Cox, 29, said as he waited out front for a shuttle van that would take him to campus. ''I've never had a kitchen this nice before. It has a full convection oven.''
 The university owns housing in one other location outside Manhattan: a dozen apartments in Palisades, N.Y., that are reserved for postdoctoral fellows at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Rockland County.
 Most of the Arbor's residents are graduate students, many of them from other countries, but some faculty members and administrators live there, too. Ross A. Frommer, associate dean for government and community affairs at Columbia University Medical Center, had signed a contract to buy a two-bedroom unit on the seventh floor of the Arbor before the developer decided to sell the building to Columbia.
 He and his wife, Connie Dong, were able to rent the same apartment they had planned to buy. ''We love our apartment,'' he said. ''We certainly feel we're getting good value.''
 But some residents say there are drawbacks to living a borough away from campus.
 Even though the shuttle operates frequently throughout the day, the small vans are sometimes so crowded that residents are forced to wait until there is room. On weekends, there is no shuttle. Residents without cars must walk to the No. 1 subway stop -- a good 20-minute trek -- or take a bus and transfer if they need to get to campus. The walk to the station is downhill, but coming home can be a workout, especially with a stroller.
 ''You definitely trade the convenience of being right next to Columbia for more space,'' said Steve Little, 34, who is pursuing a master's degree in public administration. His two-bedroom apartment has two roomy bathrooms with marble counters.
 Unlike the Coxes, Mr. Little, who is from England, said the university simply assigned his family to the Arbor, whose brick-and-tinted-glass facade stands in contrast with some of the neighborhood's older buildings. ''We could have said no if we didn't fancy being here, but it suited us,'' he said.
 Alexandra and Alex Petrasincu, who have an 8-month-old daughter, were also drawn to the suburban feel of the neighborhood, where a Starbucks coexists with a shoe-repair shop and a traditional kosher delicatessen. The couple is from Germany, and Mr. Petrasincu, a lawyer, is enrolled in a one-year international law program. They pay Columbia $2,200 a month for their two-bedroom apartment.
 ''With a child, there's no question that I prefer this,'' said Ms. Petrasincu, pausing in a small plaza at the back of the building, which was planted with ornamental grasses and hostas and was free of the din from the Henry Hudson Parkway. ''You have loads of children and playgrounds, and everything is within walking distance. And it seems very reasonable.'' 
 Robert Wachsman, a real estate broker who owns the Riverdale Homes agency, says that $2,200 for a two-bedroom in that building is, in today's market, ''probably bordering on the higher side, but it's in line.''
 Mr. Hornsby declined to comment on the rents at the Arbor, but he said that Columbia's focus was not to make money. ''Unlike other entities, we're not a commercial landlord, so our goal is to provide housing,'' he said. ''We don't have a profit motive.''
 There are occasional droll reminders of the market originally envisioned for the building, which sits a few blocks from Riverdale's business district, in a neighborhood with a distinctly Jewish culture. The appliances, for example. ''The oven has a kosher function,'' Mr. Little said as his 1-year-old daughter ambled around the living room and his 3-month-old son slept in a stroller.
 ''They also said the dishwasher has a Sabbath setting,'' chimed in his wife, Deborah Muylle, ''but I don't know what that means.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Delays on Food Donations Are Reducing Supplies in Somalia, U.N. Says

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
United Nations officials said Friday that the supply of critical food aid to Somalia had been interrupted and that rations to starving people needed to be cut, partly because the American government had delayed food contributions out of fears that they would be diverted to terrorists.
 Last month, American officials said they had suspended millions of dollars of food aid because of concerns that Somali contractors working for the United Nations were funneling food and money to the Shabab, an Islamist insurgent group with growing ties to Al Qaeda. 
 American officials played down the impact of the delays and said the food shipments would resume soon, once the United States government was assured that the United Nations was doing more to police the aid deliveries.
 But on Friday, the World Food Program said, ''The food supply line to Somalia is effectively broken.'' 
 United Nations officials said that around 40 million pounds of American-donated food was being held up in warehouses in Mombasa, in neighboring Kenya, because American officials were not allowing aid workers to distribute it until a new set of tighter regulations was ironed out. 
 United Nations officials said the American government was insisting on guarantees that were unrealistic in Somalia, like demanding that aid transporters not pay fees at roadblocks, which are ubiquitous and virtually unavoidable in a nation widely considered a case study in chaos.
 American aid officials declined to comment on Friday.
 In the drought-stricken regions of central Somalia, where entire communities are on the brink of famine, elders said that many children who had been surviving off the American donations were now dying from hunger.
 ''We are totally dependent on this food, and people are now suffering,'' said Ahmed Mahamoud Hassan, the chairman of the drought committee in Galcaio, central Somalia. ''We have nothing else to eat.''
 Somalia is one of the neediest nations in the world -- and one of the most complex environments to deliver aid. Ever since the central government imploded in 1991, the country has lurched from one crisis to the next, the latest being a vicious civil war between a weak government and an extremist Islamist insurgency during one of the worst droughts in years. 
 The United States has played a huge role in saving lives by supplying about 40 percent of the $850 million annual aid budget for Somalia. But that aid is often only loosely monitored at best once it enters the country because of the dangers of working in Somalia and the fact that so much of it is a no-go zone for foreigners.
 For months now, United Nations officials have been negotiating with their American counterparts, trying to agree on language for new rules that would ensure, as much as possible, that American donated food goes to needy people and not to the Shabab. 
 Last month, American officials said they were legally bound to do this, because the American government has listed the Shabab as a terrorist organization, a designation that means that aiding or abetting the Shabab is a serious crime. 
 There is increasing evidence, according to United Nations documents, that some of the United Nations contractors in Somalia have been stealing food and channeling the proceeds to the Shabab and other militant groups. United Nations officials are investigating some of their biggest contractors.
 United Nations officials say that other donor nations have been skittish about contributing aid during these investigations, which is another reason for the aid shortages in Somalia. The global recession has also taken a toll on aid operations around the world. 
 That said, ''the United States is traditionally W.F.P.'s largest single donor,'' said Peter Smerdon, a spokesman for the World Food Program, ''and other donors cannot make up the difference.''
 He warned that the food supplies for Somalia were steadily dwindling each month and that by December, ''we will completely run out.'' 
 Partly because of the standoff over the new rules and the ensuing interruption in the food pipeline, the World Food Program recently halved the emergency rations to the more than one million displaced Somalis.
 United Nations officials said they had been urging the American government to release at least some of the food from the warehouses in Kenya while they worked out the new rules. 
 The officials said that even if they wanted to bypass the American government and ship in food from other countries, which would cost millions of dollars, it would be impossible to get it to Somalia in time and that the American sacks of grain sitting in Mombasa were the only solution to averting a widespread famine.
 ''The urgency of the situation has been communicated,'' said one United Nations official in Nairobi, who spoke on condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. ''Basically, USAID,'' the United States Agency for International Development, ''has to come through, one way or the other.''

HEADLINE: Money Issues That Can Test Even a Rock-Solid Marriage

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
When a couple first gets together, they may not have the same approach to managing money. But it's often easy enough to get past any differences when so much of the future is theoretical anyway.
 Then reality sets in. It may take years, even decades, but the gloss wears off. Children arrive, layoffs occur or housing prices collapse just as adult children run out of money. 
 In my last column, I highlighted a number of topics that the newly engaged should discuss to keep disagreements about money from later threatening the union. This week, I had intended to move on in my series about the financial impact of divorce and write about what happens after the split. 
 But some readers warned that I was skipping a step. 
 While it's good to focus on financial conversations to have before getting married, they said, what about the wrenching financial issues that come up years or decades into the marriage that you never could have anticipated? 
 ''You may find yourselves with an aging relative thousands of miles away who needs your care and support while you're trying to put one of your own kids through college,'' read a comment on nytimes.com from Leslie. ''Tough to plan for that one, especially if the aging relative refuses to talk about their own finances ahead of time.''
 Any situation like this can strain a marriage to the breaking point. You can either disengage and get divorced or re-engage, said Sandra Wang, a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney financial adviser who is a licensed marriage and family therapist and a certified divorce financial analyst.
 What follows are five of the financial issues that are most likely to cause strife and a few ideas about how to work them out. 
 REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES If your household income and assets aren't what they once were, it can be a real problem for spouses who are not living in the style to which they have become accustomed. You may have thought that neither of you could possibly be the kind of person who would feel this way, until you found yourself in the thick of it and were surprised you were contemplating leaving the marriage. ''Do they decide to check out?'' asked Ms. Wang, who is based in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Because if they decide to re-engage, it means readjusting expectations about what married life is going to look like. Can they redefine a relationship that's not based around the lifestyle?''
 Sadly, some people simply cannot. 
 YOUR MISTAKES When one person in the household is the chief financial officer, there's just one place to point the finger when things go wrong. So in families where the price of the home has fallen, the adjustable-rate mortgage is resetting to a higher payment and the retirement accounts have fallen 25 percent from their peak, the resident money manager sometimes comes under attack. 
 ''If you go into debt, you may smack your head and say 'How could this have happened?' and 'You never told me we couldn't afford this big of a house,''' said Lili A. Vasileff, a financial planner in Greenwich, Conn., who has taken to calling her work ''marital financial mediation.'' 
 ''But blame is not a Ping-Pong game,'' she said. ''This often happens because they didn't realize that they weren't making joint decisions.''
 The solution is more transparency and conversations about assets, debts and risk. But after years of letting the other grownup in the house make the decisions, people get out of the habit of keeping up with the details. 
 YOUR PARENTS Some of the toughest financial problems that come up well into a marriage are those that feel like a choice between your spouse and another loved one. 
 Take an aging parent who needs specialized care but has run out of money or can't get the treatment that you and your siblings want to provide without everyone spending a lot of their own money. 
 ''Many couples find themselves in these situations ethically where they feel like they have to do something'' to help a family member financially, said Jerry Gale, an associate professor of child and family development at the University of Georgia, where he's part of an effort to integrate traditional therapy and financial planning. ''But if I do that, what is the cost to my own family?''
 YOUR CHILDREN While the desire to do right by the children often keeps couples together, the financial challenges that children pose can be formidable. 
 Ms. Vasileff, who is also the president of the Association of Divorce Financial Planners, said this sometimes comes up with a third child whose parents have bled the college savings dry paying for the first two children. ''How do we not deprive our youngest child of what our other children had because we had more money then? Is that just life, that there is not enough left?'' she said. ''That really strikes hard between the two spouses.''
 Even if you manage to get the children educated, they may move home in their 20s expecting their old room back. ''It really comes to a boiling point when a couple realizes that they have very different expectations for what will happen when their kids reach the age of majority and how their coming home could affect the couple's postretirement years,'' Ms. Vasileff said. 
 YOUR UNCERTAINTY Most couples reckon with a sort of low-grade, long-term economic uncertainty that comes when so many people around them are losing their jobs. The stakes only get higher as you and your marriage age and you have children or other large financial responsibilities. 
 Some people handle this better than others, but the pervasive anxiety that often results can slowly wear down a couple. 
 It is possible, if you're diligent early on and live below your means, to plan around many of these issues. A larger-than-average emergency fund can provide a better mental buffer against uncertainty. Starting early with college savings or buying long-term care insurance for your parents will help, too. 
 But few couples get everything right, which is why it's a good idea to stop every so often and reassess how you've arranged your finances. Sometimes even the most basic practices deserve re-examination. Dan Icolari and his wife, who live in the St. George section of Staten Island, have been married for 46 years. But about 20 years ago, they realized that their different approaches to money were the source of a lot of their arguments.
 ''Rather than fighting, we decided to separate our bank accounts,'' he said. ''Once we did it, it instantly affected every other part of our relationship.''
 Over the course of a long marriage, you're bound to run up against financial issues that you didn't plan for. Or you may simply change your mind about your goals and how money affects them.
 ''Step back from where you are, often in the heat of the emotions or frustration or anger,'' said Mr. Gale, the Georgia professor. ''I try to remind people to think about how they overcame stress and challenges in the past. I think couples, when things get stressful, it becomes 'Here's what I need to do or for you to do.' But it's really about what you can do together.''

HEADLINE: Seeing the Glass Half Full Despite the Day's Reports

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In the morning, they were hit with a dreary jobs report. In the afternoon, they learned that consumers had again scaled back on borrowing. But even in the face of grim economic news on Friday, investors seemed content just to shrug it all off. 
 Stocks traded in a hair-thin range all day, with investors picking up shares of industrial companies and selling off financial stocks. The only real movement was a dip at the market's open as investors tried to draw meaning from a report showing that unemployment in the United States had climbed to a 26-year high. 
 By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had risen 17.46 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,023.42. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.67 points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,069.30, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,112.44.
 The Department of Labor's monthly job market barometer showed that the unemployment rate climbed to 10.2 percent in October, the highest level since 1983. The pace of job-cutting slowed to 190,000 in October, down sharply from the peak of the recession last winter, but there were concerns that the revival of hiring could still be far off.
 The unemployment numbers were slightly worse than Wall Street analysts had expected. Stephen F. Auth, chief investment officer for Federated Investors, said traders were reacting to signs of hope in the labor report, including increases in the number of temporary workers -- an early indicator that employers are restoring staffing levels.
 ''I just think people are starting to accept the idea that we're not heading into Armageddon,'' he said. ''It took 14 months to go down, and it's going to take at least 14 months to get back, but it's been steadily moving back up.''
 As the recovery takes shape, the flow of credit to consumers -- through car loans, student loans and credit cards, for instance -- remains constrained. For an eighth consecutive month, borrowing fell in September, the Federal Reserve said on Friday, declining by $14.8 billion, or a 7.2 percent annual rate, to $2.46 trillion.
 The price of gold continued to climb to record highs on Friday; the spot gold price rose to $1,095.10 an ounce as the dollar weakened. The Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates at historic lows has pushed the dollar lower and left investors turning toward gold. 
 ''Any potential concerns over inflation are another positive factor for gold,'' said Bart Melek, global commodities strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ''There's certainly a potential for gold to move even higher if we get the economy in the U.S. becoming more positive.''
 In addition, gold traders were encouraged by news that India had purchased 200 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Melek said.
 The unemployment report seemed to drive up the price of bonds, as investors looked to safe government debt in light of concerns over future economic growth and the profitability of Wall Street companies. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 101 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.50 percent from 3.52 percent late Thursday.
 Overseas markets closed mostly higher. The Nikkei average in Japan closed up 0.7 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 1.6 percent. In Europe, the CAC 40 in France was down fractionally, the FTSE 100 in Britain closed up 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany climbed 0.1 percent. The price of crude oil decreased to $77.43 a barrel, down $2.19 from Thursday.

HEADLINE: With the Economy in a Spin, Turning Happy Hour Into a Global Job Search

BYLINE: By DAN LEVIN

 BODY:
A baseball game was on television, the mechanical bull was waiting to thrash and dozens of women in business suits and heels were partaking liberally of after-work drink specials at Johnny Utah's, a bar in midtown Manhattan. 
 On another night, Michael Chow might have swaggered over to the cluster of women doing tequila shots in the corner, sat down and bought them another round. But on this particular Monday evening, Mr. Chow, 30, a commercial real estate broker, was looking to get out of there. In fact, he was looking to get out of Manhattan, out of New York, indeed, out of the country. 
 With a nametag on his lapel and hope in his handshake, Mr. Chow plunged into the crowd, exchanging business cards during the Chinese-themed happy hour, eager to try out his Mandarin as he prepared to move to Shanghai next year. ''I'm learning the basic language now so I don't feel totally lost when I get there,'' he said.
 The gathering was organized by Golden Networking, an event-planning company that has been mining the city's kaleidoscopic ethnic niches by organizing business receptions and after-work mixers in Manhattan. The events, started last year by an unemployed Peruvian-born bank executive, are geared toward Chinese, Chileans, Brazilians, Mexicans and those whose homelands were once part of the former Soviet Union.
 At a time when New York's economy is teetering, Golden Networking is trying to exploit growing interest and opportunities in some of the world's emerging economies. Many immigrants are leveraging relationships back in their native lands, while Americans are immersing themselves in languages they ignored in high school in the hope that the streets of Beijing, Sao Paulo or Moscow might be paved with gold, or at least a currency faring better than the dollar.
 ''There's no future in New York,'' Mr. Chow said, scanning the bar crowd. ''There's more for me in China. Maybe not free speech, but economic growth and stability. I want to be a part of that.'' 
 Before rushing over to introduce himself to a pair of Chinese men who were discussing the stock market in heavily accented English, he added, ''Any job, really, I'll do it.''
 He may have some competition. Brian Mihelic, 29, who was laid off from his job at an investment bank in July was also planning to relocate to China. ''I'm definitely going to go, it's just a matter of time,'' he said. ''Hopefully people here can point me in the right direction.''
 The economic shift bodes well for Edgar Perez, 35, who started Golden Networking last year after losing his job as a vice president at Citibank. Since then, Mr. Perez has built a database of 25,000 people in the New York, gleaned from business schools, cultural groups and industry associations. 
 Golden Networking has sponsored two dozen events, including happy hours, career nights and investment seminars, mostly with a focus on developing economies. Success has convinced Mr. Perez to expand to Boston and Washington.
 ''I don't hear a lot of people telling me they want to do business in Germany,'' he said as he huddled with a group of importers from Hong Kong. ''I see a lot more interest in China and Dubai, where, despite the financial crisis, people are still investing in infrastructure.'' 
 Jonathan Model, 28, a high school tutor who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was there hoping the fluent Mandarin he learned during five years living in China would help him land a job. 
 A few weeks earlier, at a networking event focusing on Russia that was held in a fashionable Manhattan bar, the English was spoken with a Slavic lilt. Over cocktails, many in the crowd reveled in the fact that their shared heritage was now something to highlight on a resume. 
 ''International business is leading the economic recovery here, so it helps to be connected to your roots,'' said Katerina Vorotova, 24, a consultant at Thomson Reuters who immigrated from Russia 11 years ago but goes back often in search of business opportunities. But some people, including Ms. Vorotova's companion, Arseny Lebedev, 24, were not necessarily there to make a deal. 
 ''I just want to meet other Russians and go to the sauna together,'' he joked. A manager at a solar energy company, Mr. Lebedev said it can be difficult to meet other young Russian professionals, even in New York. ''I'm Russian, but sometimes that's not enough for communication, for finding friends,'' he said.
 Christine Loomis, a senior consultant at Coleman & Company, an executive search firm that places Western-trained Russian speakers at global companies based in Moscow, has found the networking events to be an ideal hunting ground. Ms. Loomis, 59, recently addressed Columbia University students interested in careers in Russia, thanks to a connection made at the happy hour, and will be presenting several of the resumes she picked up there to Russian clients in Moscow this month. ''Many connections have been made,'' she said. ''Undoubtedly, a handful will bear fruit in a meaningful way.''

HEADLINE: Prep Schools Face Cuts in Student Aid

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. 

 BODY:
For now, the nation's biggest preparatory schools are protecting students like Ivy Alphonse-Leja, who depends on financial aid to attend the Lawrenceville School.
 ''There was never a concern that I could not come back next year,'' she said recently.
 The question is whether the schools, which, like their university brethren, suffered significant declines in their endowments as financial markets withered, can continue to offer that same promise to incoming students.
 The question goes to the heart of the prep schools' longtime efforts to open up their classrooms to promising students of all incomes, and not just the children of wealthy families. Adding to the pressures on the schools are the increasing financial woes of their students.
 The schools are left with limited options. This is a bad time to dip more deeply into their endowments. Raising tuition would just mean that ''more of their families may qualify for financial aid because their incomes may become insufficient to pay tuition bills,'' said Amy Falls, who oversees the endowment for Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. And attracting gifts from alumni may get harder if the downturn continues or tax laws change. 
 Lawrenceville has decided to keep its financial aid budget flat for now, and that means ''somewhat fewer newcomers receive aid next year,'' the school's chief financial officer, Wesley R. Brooks, said. Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, N.H., has also decided to keep its financial aid budget the same as it was last school year, said Julie Quinn, the spokeswoman for the school. None of the schools want to find themselves in the predicament that the Albuquerque Academy is in. The academy, a private day school in New Mexico, suffered a 20 percent decline in its endowment, and its prospects for raising new money are especially limited. Much of its investments were in real estate, and there is little hope for that coming back anytime soon. Next year, for the first time in its history, Albuquerque Academy will not be able to provide financial aid to all needy students. 
 ''The core of our mission is accessibility to everyone,'' said Albuquerque's treasurer, Gary L. Gordon, who graduated from the academy and sends his two children there. ''Other schools don't have as a mission to help so many families in so many ways. They have a much larger capacity for giving programs and they have so much money coming in that they don't have to worry.'' 
 Now Albuquerque has to rethink its core mission.
 The outlook for other schools seems less severe. The budget cuts so far at the other big prep schools in the country, most of them in the Northeast, have been noticeable, but are not likely to be as deep if the markets recover.
 Lawrenceville laid off 6 percent of its staff. Phillips Exeter Academy is trimming all its budgets, including the one for recruiting. Andover, where the value of the endowment fell 15.1 percent, is using ''restraint'' in hiring. 
 Ms. Falls said that Andover planned to continue to meet all the financial needs of students it accepts. The school was in a relatively good position last year, she said, because the endowment had raised about 5 percent in cash, which meant it did not have to sell investments that had plummeted in value. 
 Nevertheless, she said, ''We have sharpened our pencils a lot.'' It may become more difficult to raise money, she said. ''People's tax rates are going up. There will be less to go around. So everybody has to be thoughtful.''
 And some schools are even increasing their commitment to financial aid despite steep drops in their endowments. The Peddie School, in Hightstown, N.J., for instance, is increasing its financial aid budget by 8 percent despite an 18.6 percent drop in the endowment's return. ''We felt it was important to maintain our strong commitment to the policy,'' said Sean Casey, the school's director of communications.
 Many of the prep schools also have the advantage of being generally conservative in their investments. As a result, they did relatively better when the markets turned down than the big universities -- their endowments generally declined 20 percent or less, while Harvard's and Yale's returns were down over 24 percent. 
 The prep schools ''don't gain as much or lose as much,'' said Michael Schuller, immediate past president of Association of Business Officers of Preparatory Schools. Indeed, a survey by Commonfund, which manages money for nonprofit institutions, found that university endowments over $1 billion generated an average annual return for the five years that ended June 30, 2008, of 13.1 percent whereas the returns from private school endowments over $50 million averaged 10.4 percent for the same period.
 Albuquerque Academy, where the endowment came largely from a real estate grant by the Albert Sims family, did well during the real estate boom. That helped the board develop a policy of accepting all students regardless of need. 
 Though every school subsidizes its students to some degree, at Albuquerque full annual tuition is $17,500 and the actual cost per student is more than twice as much. 
 But the school is just 54 years old and has only 6,000 graduates worldwide, so the universe of graduates who can give to the endowment is relatively small. Moreover, few of its graduates go into finance-related industries where they can make large sums of money, Mr. Gordon noted. Already this year the endowment, which provides 50 percent of the school's operating budget, is contributing 15 percent less than last year. 
 To raise more money, the school has already increased tuition costs. But that has only increased the demand for financial aid from families that cannot make the higher payments. By next year the school will have to start limiting the aid it offers, Mr. Gordon said.
 ''Last year we raised just under $1 million in annual gifts,'' Mr. Gordon, the treasurer, said. ''Endowment gifts are delightful, but they happen just occasionally.''
 ''Raising new money is difficult because Albuquerque is not a place of high-income individuals,'' he added.
 What Albuquerque has is common with other prep schools is a heavy dependence on its endowment to finance the operating budget. That means tough financial markets are treacherous. Exeter, for example, like Albuquerque, gets 50 percent of its operating budget from its endowment. The balance comes from tuition and annual gifts. 
 ''We think that the endowment reduces our risk because we have all that money in the bank,'' said Mr. Brooks of Lawrenceville. ''But the bigger schools are more exposed to economic cycles because they use their endowments more aggressively. They do it because they can afford to. But if the endowment falls, you have to whack your operating budget.''
 That means the endowment is crucial since it accounts for anywhere from 23 percent of a budget at Lawrenceville to 100 percent at the Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pa., and more than 90 percent at Kamehameha Schools in Hawaii.
 Some schools are trying to reduce the volatility by cutting their dependence on their endowments. At St. Paul's, in Concord, N.H., the endowment now provides just 29 percent of the operating budget, compared with 50 percent seven years ago, according to Michelle F. Chicoine, the school's chief financial officer. Ms. Chicoine said she did not believe it was wise either to erode the endowment or have the operating budget too dependent on it. 
 Today, many schools wish that they had done the same.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Consumers borrowed less for a record eighth consecutive month in September amid rising unemployment and tight credit conditions. Some economists worry that the declines in borrowing will be a drag on the fledgling recovery.
 The Federal Reserve said on Friday that borrowing fell $14.8 billion in September. The 7.2 percent decline was the biggest since July and was larger than the $10 billion drop economists expected.
 Borrowing for revolving credit, including credit cards, fell at an annual rate of 13.3 percent in September, the same pace as in August.
 Borrowing for nonrevolving loans, including auto loans, fell at an annual rate of 3.7 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in August.

HEADLINE: Patience on Corruption Is Running Out, Britain Warns Afghan President

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and ALAN COWELL; John F. Burns reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
In unusually harsh terms reflecting international frustration with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday that the government in Kabul would forfeit its right to international support against the Taliban insurgency if it failed to root out corruption.
 ''Sadly, the government of Afghanistan had become a byword for corruption,'' Mr. Brown said in a speech to defense experts. ''And I am not prepared to put the lives of British men and women in harm's way for a government that does not stand up against corruption.'' 
 His words were regarded by some analysts as the toughest by a Western leader since Mr. Karzai was declared the winner this week of Afghanistan's flawed elections.
 The timing of Mr. Brown's warning was particularly significant, with the Obama administration under domestic and international pressure to decide whether to commit up to 40,000 more American troops to Afghanistan at a time when international appetite for the conflict seems to be receding.
 Mr. Brown was speaking four days after five British soldiers were killed by an Afghan policeman they were supposed to be mentoring in an attack that shook many Britons' support for the eight-year war. So far, 230 British soldiers have died since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001. Seven of them died in the past seven days. 
 A spokeswoman at the international forces' joint command in Kabul said Friday that two American soldiers were killed Thursday by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, but gave no further details.
 The deaths bring to three the number of United States service members killed in the Afghan war so far this month. October was the deadliest month of the war for American forces, with 59 deaths reported, according to icasualties.org, a Web site that tracks combat deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 Mr. Brown reiterated that Britain would not abandon its role in the American-led NATO coalition. ''We cannot, must not and will not walk away.''
 He continued, ''If the Taliban insurgency succeeds in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda will once again cross the border and re-establish themselves in sanctuaries in Afghanistan from where they will plan, train and launch attacks on the rest of the world.'' 
 Mr. Brown said he had spoken several times this week to Mr. Karzai, who had promised that the first action of his new government would be to tackle corruption.
 ''International support depends on the scale of his ambition and the degree of his achievement in five key areas: security, governance, reconciliation, economic development and engagement with Afghanistan's neighbors,'' Mr. Brown said.
 Mr. Brown also echoed calls this week by senior White House officials for Mr. Karzai and the Afghan government to establish an anticorruption commission to establish strict accountability for national and provincial officials.
 In addition, some American and European officials are pressing for at least a few arrests of what one administration official, speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday, called ''the more blatantly corrupt'' people in the Afghan government. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue.
 Administration officials declined to provide the names of people they wanted to see arrested and acknowledged that such arrests were a long shot.
 The international community's wish list of potential defendants includes Mr. Karzai's brother Ahmed Wali Karzai, a suspected player in the country's booming illegal opium trade; Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is accused of involvement in the killings of thousands of Taliban prisoners of war early in the Afghan conflict; and one of Mr. Karzai's running mates, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, a former defense minister who is suspected of drug trafficking. 
 On Friday, three retired officers who have held the top post in Britain's armed forces, chief of the defense staff, criticized Mr. Brown in a House of Lords debate on the armed forces, saying, in effect, that he had denied British troops the financing and equipment they needed, exposing them to greater risks.
 One of the officers, Field Marshal Peter Inge, said of Mr. Brown that the armed forces ''have felt that he has never really been on their side.'' 
 Adm. Michael Boyce said the Brown government ''does not realize we are at war,'' and Gen. Charles Guthrie said ''dithering in London'' had left ''the people in the front line questioning whether the government is really, really committed to making progress'' in Afghanistan.
 Britain is the second largest contributor to the coalition fighting the Taliban, with about 9,000 soldiers, compared with 68,000 Americans. But the steady increase of casualties is eroding public support for the conflict.
 On Thursday, the body of Sgt. Olaf Schmid, 30, who had died trying to defuse a roadside bomb, was flown back to Britain. 
 As has now become the tradition, the body was driven on Thursday through the Wiltshire village of Wootton Bassett, close to a military airfield used by flights to and from Afghanistan, as a church bell pealed. Mourners stood in silence, laying flowers on a hearse bearing a coffin draped in the red, white and blue union flag.
 Such poignant moments, broadcast on national television, have raised public doubts about whether the war in Afghanistan could be won. 
 Mr. Brown's government insists that British troops will be able to withdraw only when Afghan forces are able to take over the campaign against the Taliban.

HEADLINE: The World's Best Health Care System?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As Nicholas D. Kristof points out in ''Unhealthy America'' (column, Nov. 5), the health statistics that measure average outcomes do not support the claim that Americans have the ''greatest health care system in the world.''
 These numbers come as no surprise in the face of tens of millions of uninsured or underinsured Americans. Americans are tethered to a health care system that they neither chose nor control. Where else in the world do some people have to keep their jobs to maintain their health coverage? 
 The majority of Americans who have coverage are not unaware of the many deficiencies in our health care system; rather they live in fear that any change in health care that includes those not currently in the system will significantly diminish their own health care. Unfortunately, the Obama administration and the Democrats in Congress have done very little to reassure them that this is not the case.
 Charles E. Inturrisi New York, Nov. 5, 2009
 The writer is a professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medical College.
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof promotes the misunderstanding that our dysfunctional health care delivery system equates to wretched health care and underestimates the devastation that obesity has had on our country's health.
 Comparing infant mortality and life expectancy between the United States and Canada or Europe does not account for inherent differences in health between societies that are culturally and economically diverse and those that are more culturally and economically homogenous.
 I have practiced medicine in Europe, Central America and the Middle East. I have met many wealthy foreigners seeking care at my institution here in the United States. If our health care is so deplorable, then why do foreigners seek it? If 36 countries are more likely to deliver a healthy baby, then why are our affluent not flocking elsewhere when the stork is arriving?
 The focus of health care reform should be to reform ''the system'' and to elevate the care of all citizens. Implying that there is widespread practice of substandard health care is misleading.
 Peter J. Allen Chappaqua, N.Y., Nov. 6, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof reminds us of public health statistics that have been widely known to health professionals for years. We lag behind almost all other industrialized and developed countries in most measures of the health of our citizens. 
 Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, and his allies would have us believe we already have the best health system in the world. We do, provided you belong to a favored group: You're rich and can afford to pay out of pocket, you're over 65 like me and can't be turned away by Medicare or you have a generous employer like Senator Shelby that subsidizes its employees so they can have ''Cadillac'' plans. 
 Meanwhile more than 46 million of our fellow citizens are uninsured. The best health care system the world has ever known?
 We have forgotten our basic American value of looking out for one another. Would we support the idea of a fire or police department that provided help only to those who had a ''Cadillac'' protection plan? I don't think so.
 Only a health care system that provides each and every one of us with the care we need will be good enough. We need a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system.
 Donald Broder Studio City, Calif., Nov. 5, 2009
 The writer is a retired medical doctor.
 To the Editor:
 ''Mandates and Affordability'' (editorial, Nov. 1) demonstrates just how difficult it will be to get universal coverage by mandating that citizens purchase private health insurance. Congressional proposals leave insurance companies free to set premiums at whatever level maximizes profits.
 In effect, Congress would require every citizen to pay a tax (another name for a ''universal mandate'') set by a private corporation. Surely this could spark a tax revolt. Moreover, the higher the premiums, the greater the subsidies necessary, and the larger the hit to the Treasury.
 There is an easier, more democratic way. Allow people to buy into Medicare, with premiums determined by income. Such coverage would be affordable by definition. If costs exceed premium income, use the money earmarked for subsidies. Those who prefer (and can afford) comparable private insurance could buy it instead.
 Medicare buy-in would bring money into Medicare, instead of draining money out, and would guarantee good, affordable coverage for all.
 Caroline Poplin Bethesda, Md., Nov. 2, 2009
 The writer is an internist.
 To the Editor:
 The public option has been significantly weakened in both the Senate and the House.
 These steps have made elimination of the antitrust exemption for insurance companies a much more attractive way to introduce real competition in the health insurance industry. The repeal could give broad latitude to the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to fashion remedies that would suit the unique circumstance of each market.
 For example, additional companies could be invited into markets lacking real competition, and remedies could include giving the new entrants the same preferred provider rates that the existing monopolies have, thus eliminating barriers to entry. Or large regional or national companies could be broken up into smaller units, enabling existing smaller companies to compete.
 Unlike the public option, which is aimed only at the individual market, the antitrust approach would have an industrywide impact, covering both group and individual markets.

HEADLINE: Economists Scan Jobs Data, Seeking Signs of Hope

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
As the unemployment rate surged to 10.2 percent in October, reaching double digits for the first time in 26 years, it suddenly seemed possible that the nation might yet confront the worst joblessness since the Great Depression.
 In the six decades since the government began compiling such data, the highest level of unemployment came at the end of 1982, when it hit 10.8 percent. Despite the widespread assumption that the recession has already ended, and even as the economy has resumed growing, the government's latest snapshot of the labor market released Friday testified to the uncomfortable truth that expansion had yet to translate into jobs.
 ''The guy on the street is going to ask, 'What recovery?' '' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ''The job market is still in reverse.''
 The sharp rise in unemployment -- which climbed from 9.8 percent in September, as the nation lost another 190,000 net jobs -- intensified pressure on the Obama administration to show results from the $787 billion package of spending measures unleashed early this year to spur the economy. 
 On Friday, President Obama signed into law a bill that that extends both unemployment benefits and temporary tax credits for home buyers, adding that he was on the lookout for other ways to generate job growth. 
 Hilda Solis, the labor secretary, noted a slowdown in the pace of deterioration in arguing that better days were already on the way, while dismissing suggestions that the stimulus had proved disappointing. ''I don't think it's a matter of things going wrong,'' she said in a conference call with reporters. ''We're making a tremendous turning point here.''
 But the stark reality of double-digit unemployment seemed certain to inject fresh tension into the economic policy debate, offering Republicans a prop as they assert that the administration's spending package has failed to create jobs.
 Labor unions and some Democrats have called for more spending to create jobs -- a course that runs headlong into worries about swelling federal budget deficits.
 In an interview this week, Richard L. Trumka, president of the nation's largest labor union, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., urged the government to finance large-scale construction projects to put people to work. Absent that, he said, ''it will probably be 2012 before there starts to be real job creation.''
 Despite the headline-grabbing unemployment number, economists sifting through the details of the Labor Department's report found several reasons to take comfort. 
 The pace at which jobs are disappearing continued to taper off in October. Between November 2008 and April 2009 -- amid the paralyzing fear that accompanied the collapse of prominent financial institutions like Lehman Brothers -- the economy shed an average of 645,000 jobs a month. Between May and July, the pace dropped to an average monthly loss of 357,000 jobs. Over the last three reports, average monthly job losses have slipped to 188,000, after factoring in upward revisions to the data for August and September.
 Temporary workers increased by 44,000 in October, adding to gains in the previous two months -- an apparent sign that businesses had squeezed as much production as they could out of their existing work forces and felt the need to bring in more people. 
 ''That goes the right way,'' said Dean Baker, co-director for the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''That's an encouraging sign.''
 The hope is that as the economy expands, companies will use fresh profits to add to payrolls in a reach for increased sales. As workers spend their paychecks, they will create opportunities for other businesses, generating more jobs -- an upward spiral. 
 Some experts see this unfolding now, asserting that the economy will add jobs by late winter.
 ''People are hurting, but if you can get past the sticker shock of the unemployment rate and look at the guts of the report, they are still very consistent with a recovery,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at the research and trading firm MKM Partners. ''We're getting very close to the peak unemployment rate.''
 But some doubt recent trends can continue, absent another dose of government spending. 
 Though the economy grew at 3.5 percent annualized rate between July and September, much business activity was enhanced by special programs aimed at encouraging consumers to spend, not least the cash-for-clunkers program, which provided taxpayer-financed cash incentives to people trading in their cars.
 As the effects of this and other stimulus programs fade over coming months, fundamental weakness may re-emerge, with consumers -- whose spending accounts for 70 percent of overall economic activity -- confronting enormous debt, the loss of wealth and fears about job security.
 ''We just went through an unbelievable financial catastrophe in this country and it typically takes a long time to come back,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc., a market research firm in New York, who envisions the decline in jobs to continue until at least the middle of next year. He forecasts that the unemployment rate will reach 10.6 percent by the middle of next year and then perhaps climb higher.
 Some worry that double-digit unemployment carries a psychological dimension that could perpetuate anxiety, prompting further hunkering down within the economy.
 ''It's a benchmark,'' Mr. Baker said. ''It's part of a general backdrop of economic news that does affect decisions by businesses and purchases of big-ticket items.''
 Beneath the dueling interpretations of future prospects, the report left little doubt that the present remained bleak in millions of American households. The pain has fallen harder on men, among whom unemployment reached 10.7 percent in October, compared with 8.1 percent among women. The unemployment rate for African-American men reached 17.1 percent.
 Unemployment reached 9.5 percent among white Americans, 13.1 percent among Hispanics and 27.6 among teenagers.
 Health care, a rare bright spot, added 29,000 jobs in October. Construction and manufacturing led the way, losing 62,000 and 61,000 jobs respectively.
 In Columbia, S.C., Raymond Vaughn, 43, remains unemployed a year-and-a-half after he lost his job installing windows, relying upon his fiancee's wages from a secretarial job to pay the bills. 
 Back in April, he was training for a new career in medical billing through an online course he found on the Internet. But his unemployment benefits soon ran out, eliminating his $221-a-week check, and then he could no longer muster the $98 weekly payments for his course.
 Last month, Mr. Vaughn thought he had a job for $13 an hour at a factory that makes flooring boards. But two weeks before he was to begin training, the company called him to revoke the offer. ''They said they had a hiring freeze,'' he said.
 So Mr. Vaughn finds himself stuck in a drearily familiar routine: every morning, he drives to the unemployment office downtown, where crowds seem thicker than ever. He scans meager listings and sends out fresh applications. Then, he returns home, to his sagging couch and his television, where cheerful news anchors tell him that the economy is looking up.
 ''They say it's supposed to be better, that's what I see on the news,'' Mr. Vaughn said. ''But I sure see a lot of people down at the unemployment office. I really don't see how the job stuff is going to change. I don't see any jobs out there.''

HEADLINE: Quarterly Profit Triples at Berkshire Hathaway

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway said Friday its third-quarter profit tripled as the improving economy and stock market raised the value of its derivatives contracts. Berkshire, the investment company run by Warren E. Buffett, said it generated $3.2 billion, or $2,087 a share, in net income, up from $1.1 billion, or $682 a share, a year earlier. 
 Most of the swing in earnings is related to an unrealized $1.7 billion gain on Berkshire's derivatives, some of which are tied to credit defaults and some of which are tied to equity markets. That compares to a $1.3 billion loss on Berkshire's derivatives in the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the investment and derivative gains, Berkshire's operating earnings were nearly flat at $2.06 billion, or $1,325 a share. Last year, Berkshire, reported operating earnings of $2.07 billion, or $1,335 a share. 
 Berkshire's insurance units reported better investment income of $976 million in the quarter, up from $809 million a year earlier. Berkshire's noninsurance companies, which include Shaw carpet, Acme Brick, Nebraska Furniture Mart and NetJets, generated an operating profit of $774 million in the quarter, down from $1.1 billion a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Top Democrats Push for Votes Before Health Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats put the finishing touches on their health care legislation on Friday, but failed to bridge an internal divide over the politically treacherous issue of insurance coverage for abortions, as party leaders and the White House pushed to lock in votes on the eve of a historic floor debate. 
 Democratic leaders said they were confident that they would have the 218 votes needed to pass the bill, but they continued to scramble behind the scenes. A planned visit to the Capitol by President Obama was postponed until Saturday so that a face-to-face appeal would have greater impact on wavering lawmakers just before the vote. 
 Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., cabinet secretaries and other senior officials, including the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, worked the phones, imploring undecided Democrats to vote yes on a bill that they said would be remembered as a landmark achievement. 
 ''What I explained to the president is my district is a difficult district on this,'' said Representative Jason Altmire, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who received calls from Mr. Obama, Mr. Emanuel and two cabinet secretaries. Mr. Altmire said he remained undecided. He quoted Mr. Obama as saying, ''The only two options are failure or move the ball down the field.'' 
 As rank-and-file members of both parties girded for hours of boisterous floor debate on Saturday, lines began to harden and attention was focused on Democrats coming out in opposition to the bill, including several centrists from rural districts. 
 With Democrats controlling 258 of 435 House seats as of Friday, they can afford only 40 of their members breaking ranks and still win approval for the health measure. 
 As of Friday evening, Democratic officials counted just more than 205 certain votes and were hopeful that a successful resolution of the abortion and immigration issues would produce the final commitments to ensure passage of the bill. 
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi was devoting significant individual attention to holdouts. Securing the final supporters was proving difficult, officials said.
 ''This is a much heavier lift than we thought it would be,'' said a top Democratic official who did not want to be named when talking about the internal lobbying efforts.
 Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin of South Dakota, an influential leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats, announced her opposition to the bill. 
 ''It is not the right answer for South Dakota because it could unintentionally threaten existing access to health care in our state, and it does not include sufficient cost-containment and deficit reduction measures,'' Ms. Herseth Sandlin said in a statement. 
 But others said their concerns had been addressed by party leaders eager to build support for the bill that Mr. Obama has declared his top domestic priority. 
 Representative Jared Polis, a freshman Democrat from Colorado who raised concerns this summer about the potential impact on small businesses, said he would back the bill.
 ''It has become a much more favorable bill for small businesses,'' Mr. Polis said, ''and small businesses and self-employed people really have the most to benefit from increased choice and competition.''
 The House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said the vote, tentatively scheduled for Saturday evening, could end up taking place on Sunday or even early next week depending on Republican tactics. 
 ''We will be successful in the next two or three days,'' Mr. Hoyer said. 
 Not one of the 177 House Republicans is expected to support the bill. And as they prepared for a showdown, Republican leaders said they were less inclined to mount a full-fledged guerrilla war on the floor to slow the bill than simply to make their case against it and let Democrats live with the potentially sour political consequences. 
 But Republican leaders also acknowledged that they could not necessarily control all of their colleagues and that combative parliamentary tactics were still possible. 
 After weeks of intraparty wrangling, Democratic leaders offered additional concessions to abortion opponents on Friday. Failing to reach a compromise during late-night negotiations between foes and supporters of abortion rights, Democrats said party leaders would allow a vote on an amendment that would bar the use of government subsidies to buy a health plan that covers abortion.
 Democrats who support abortion rights said they were furious, but it seemed unlikely that they could prevent the amendment from being approved, especially if many Republicans joined Democrats who oppose abortion to support it. And party leaders seemed to be calculating that supporters of abortion rights, despite their anger, would vote for the health care bill. 
 Ms. Pelosi, who is a strong supporter of abortion rights, had no choice but to make the concessions because Democrats who oppose abortion seemed to control enough votes to endanger the bill. 
 Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan and the chief sponsor of the anti-abortion amendment, said its purpose was to strengthen existing federal law.
 ''It does one very simple thing: it applies current law, the Hyde Amendment, in barring federal funding for abortion,'' Mr. Stupak said at a late-night meeting of the House Rules Committee. ''We are not writing a new federal abortion policy.'' 
 Republicans cited a report on Friday that unemployment had risen above 10 percent in October as evidence that this was the wrong time to pass the health care legislation.
 ''The speaker's bill includes job-killing taxes and mandates that will hurt small businesses,'' the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said at a news conference. ''And for the sake of our families and small businesses, this job-killing bill needs to be defeated.'' 
 The House Rules Committee, which is controlled by the Democrats, worked throughout Friday to set the parameters of Saturday's floor proceedings.

HEADLINE: Obama's to Fix

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
What a difference a year makes.
 In October 2008, the candidate Barack Obama delivered a major economic speech in Toledo, Ohio. In it he said: ''Right now, we face an immediate economic emergency, and that requires urgent action. We can't wait to help workers and families and communities who are struggling right now -- who don't know if their job or their retirement will be there tomorrow; who don't know if next week's paycheck will cover this month's bills. ... We need to pass an economic rescue plan for the middle-class, and we need to do it not five years from now, not next year, we need to do it right now. 
 ''So today I'm proposing a number of steps that we should take immediately to stabilize our financial system, provide relief to families and communities and help struggling homeowners. It's a plan that begins with one word that's on everybody's mind, and it's easy to spell: J-O-B-S.''
 ''Right now,'' ''immediate economic emergency,'' ''requires urgent action,'' ''can't wait.'' Wow! He gave the impression that job creation would be his top priority, that action would be swift and effective, that his solutions would not only stanch the hemorrhaging, but reverse the trend. 
 Fast forward. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released unemployment figures for October 2009. The official rate was 10.2 percent, up more than 50 percent from the time Obama gave that speech. Oops, nevermind.
 (By the way, the underemployment rate, which includes part-time workers who want to work full time and those who've given up searching, is a staggering 17.5 percent.)
 Job creation has dropped from top priority to one of many, and President Obama has been remanded to pandering for patience and offering excuses. On the one hand, he argues the tortured rationale that there is good news in the awful numbers: Things are still getting worse but at a slower pace. On the other, he incessantly reminds us that he inherited the crisis. The implication: Don't blame me, blame Bush. 
 But this president can't keep deflecting to the last one. Pain is presently felt. The crisis that took form on Bush's watch is being experienced on Obama's. Fair or not, finger-pointing is not effective policy. 
 This is now Obama's crisis, and it carries political consequences. During Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, nearly 9 in 10 voters said that they were worried about the direction of the nation's economy in the next year. And the majority of those who held that view voted for the Republican candidates. This could portend a flashback to 1994.
 It isn't President Obama's fault that he inherited this mess, but it is his to fix, and he must make haste. To paraphrase his Toledo prelection: you need to do it not five years from now, not next year, you need to do it right now. J-O-B-S.

HEADLINE: British Bankers Defend Compensation

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
''Profit is not satanic,'' John Varley, the chief executive of Barclays, told an audience at St. Martin-in-the-Fields church here this week. 
 The day before, Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, had insisted at a conference here, ''Size is not necessarily evil.'' 
 While not exactly Gordon Gekko's ''greed is good'' speech from the movie ''Wall Street,'' Brian Griffiths, an adviser to Goldman Sachs International, said during a recent panel discussion at St. Paul's Cathedral on ''the place of morality in the marketplace,'' that bonuses would encourage charity and lift the economy. 
 ''We have to tolerate the inequality as a way to achieve greater prosperity and opportunity for all,'' Mr. Griffiths said.
 With the Most Rev. Rowan D. Williams, archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Church of England, recently calling on those who work in finance to repent, the debate over bank reforms is becoming a modern-day morality play.
 ''We haven't heard people saying 'Well, actually, no, we got it wrong,' '' Archbishop Williams noted, referring to the lapses that set off a financial crisis that globally caused trillions of dollars in bailouts and losses. But all the moral outrage has set off a counterreaction among a host of European bankers who are defending their industry and their paychecks, often in moral terms.
 Many of the scenes are playing out in houses of worship, with executives sounding, by turns, defiant and plaintive. Sometimes their near-confessions read like attempts to reconcile, even justify, the values of religion and those of banking -- not always quite convincingly.
 The two sides of the Atlantic have taken markedly different paths to reform from the financial disaster. The United States has moved slowly on regulation and sought only to impose pay caps on the seven companies that received multiple multibillion-dollar bailouts. The Continental Europeans have been quicker to impose a raft of regulation on big financial firms, including strict limits on bonuses, as in France.
 And even in Britain calls are gathering pace to force its bailed-out banks -- the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds -- to break up so that no one is ''too big to fail.'' 
 Rejecting such proposals from senior Bank of England officials and Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Ackermann said that ''large firms do have a benefit for the users of financial services and for our economies at large.''
 At St. Martins, Mr. Varley did not dispute that banks played a role in the economic crisis, but he stressed that making money per se was not immoral. He said that banks were the ''backbone'' of the economy and that bonuses were necessary because ''talent is highly mobile.''
 ''If we fail to pay, or are constrained from paying, competitive rates, then that talent will move to another employer,'' he said, in a church that is known for its work with the homeless.
 Bankers are facing the brunt of growing criticism from regulators, central bankers and ordinary citizens for continuing large compensation packages while the industry is being propped up by government funds. 
 A recent pledge by Goldman Sachs to donate $200 million to its charitable foundation did little to defuse public anger about its plan to pay $16.7 billion in compensation this year.
 The Rev. Christopher Harrison, a member of the Nottingham city center clergy and a former adviser to Britain's Treasury, said much more was needed than just giving to charity. ''There is a general feeling that the level of bonuses we've seen have been obscene,'' he said in a telephone conversation on Thursday. ''There is a need for proportionality and more robust social responsibility.''
 Stephen K. Green, the chairman of HSBC, agreed. Last month, he called for a change of culture among bankers. The banking sector ''owes the real world an apology,'' he said, as well as ''a commitment to learn the lessons.'' 
 But some people in high places say that is already happening. 
 The bishop of London, Richard Chartres, said the economic crisis already had many in the banking industry re-examining their place in society and their contribution to the commonweal. 
 ''I have seen firsthand in my own meetings and conversations around the capital how it has provoked deeper contemplation within the financial community of the relationship between money and society,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Profound shocks can open us to a new awareness.''

HEADLINE: With Votes and Margin Down, Bonuses for Bloomberg Election Aides Are Uncertain

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Robert Gebeloff contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg prides himself on importing traditions from Wall Street to City Hall. But he did not count on introducing this one: end-of-year bonus anxiety. 
 The mayor's unexpectedly close re-election could jeopardize the quadrennial payouts -- some as high as $400,000 -- that he has routinely showered on his campaign workers, a highly unusual perk in municipal politics, a world not typically associated with lavish pay.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a former bond trader, considers the bonuses a reward for hard work and successful results: as his election-night victory margins have grown, as they did from 2001 to 2005, so have the checks he writes to his staff. 
 But on Tuesday, his margin of victory dropped by three-quarters, compared with 2005 -- not exactly cause for a cork-popping celebration.
 So like investment bankers stung by a poor earnings report, some of the mayor's campaign operatives are fretting over a potentially diminished windfall.
 ''It's crossed our minds,'' said one campaign aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, for fear of losing a bonus altogether. ''How could it not?''
 An examination of Mr. Bloomberg's previous election results, and the bonuses that followed, suggests that they may have reason to be nervous. In 2001, when he won by 2.4 percentage points, and collected 744,757 votes, he paid out a total of $850,000 in bonuses, campaign finance records show. In 2005, when he won by 19.4 points and garnered 753,089 votes, he gave out $1.55 million.
 If those payouts were correlated to either his margin of victory or the number of votes in his favor, his staff can expect less this time around. 
 Of course, many factors go into compensation considerations, and it is impossible to predict how Mr. Bloomberg -- who pays for the bonuses out of his own pocket -- will determine them. 
 But if the mayor were to base the bonuses on his relatively meager 4.6-point margin over his rival, William C. Thompson Jr., the bonus pool would drop to about $950,000, a decline of more than $500,000. If he based it on his vote tally, the drop of 196,030 votes would cost his staff about $400,000.
 Mr. Bloomberg brushed aside a question about the bonuses the day after the election, saying, ''I haven't even thought about that.'' But he seemed to lay the groundwork for sizable bonuses, should he decide to grant them. ''I don't think the margin of victory was narrow,'' he said, comparing his achievement at the polls to the World Series victory that the Yankees were closing in on -- their 27th. A win is a win, he suggested, regardless of the score: ''That's all that matters, O.K.?''
 His aides said that his modest victory in 2009 must be put into context: New Yorkers are anguished over the economy, angry about his term limits maneuver and hungry for change. And still, he won, they say, even as voters tossed out nearby incumbents, like the county leader of Westchester County and the governor of New Jersey. 
 The methodology behind Mr. Bloomberg's bonuses, if there is one, remains something of a mystery. After he won in 2001 by a slim margin, Mr. Bloomberg gave his campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, a $100,000 bonus. A much bigger victory, four years later, resulted in a $400,000 payout to Mr. Sheekey.
 But the jump in bonus size is harder to explain for Patricia E. Harris, who is now Mr. Bloomberg's top aide at City Hall. In 2001, she worked full time on Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral run, and received a post-election bonus of $100,000. In 2005, she worked on the campaign for less than three months, but her payout reached $350,000. 
 In some cases, bonuses appear to be unrelated to an election's outcome. In 2001, when the mayor eked out a victory over Mark Green, William T. Cunningham, a media consultant, received a bonus of $300,000. Four years later, when the mayor won by nearly 20 points over Fernando Ferrer, he got $300,000 again. 
 Ken Sherrill, a professor of political science at Hunter College, recalling that surveys this time showed the mayor with a 16-point lead until Election Day, said the payments should turn on whether the staff knew the race would be as tight as it was. 
 ''If they knew it was going to be by the skin of their teeth, they deserve it for pulling off a victory,'' he said. ''If all the public polls were right, they should get stiffed.''

In light of Mr. Bloomberg's not-so-big margin on Tuesday, will his campaign bonuses be as hefty? KEVIN SHEEKEY: Senior adviser/deputy mayor 2001: $100,000 2005: $400,000

HEADLINE: On Health Care, Democrats Play Down Election Results

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Democrats lost races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia this week, officials in both parties suggested that the outcome could undermine President Obama's push for a health care bill, scaring off politically vulnerable moderate Democrats at the very moment the White House needed them to get the bill through.
 As Congress prepares to vote on a health care bill this weekend, however, there were indications on Capitol Hill that the Democratic setbacks on Tuesday were not high on the list of factors influencing even politically vulnerable Democrats as they decided what to do this weekend. In interviews, members of Congress who are at the center of the debate -- in particular, those facing tough re-election bids next year -- said they were dealing with forces that had been in play long before Election Day, including factors such as how the bill would affect constituents and local doctors and hospitals. 
 Several representatives said they would pay a huge cost if they did nothing after spending so much time on the bill, pointing to constituents' strong support for some change after years of growing disgust with how Congress goes about its business. 
 ''The health care vote is critically important to me,'' said Representative Mary Jo Kilroy, a first-term Democrat from Ohio, who said she would support the bill. ''I told people when I asked them to send me to Washington, it was because I wanted to make health care reform successful.''
 Others said they were concerned about angering the army of Mr. Obama's supporters, even if those troops did not help the Democrats running for governor this year. These representatives expressed fear that those voters would either fail to turn out to support them, or even oppose them in primaries, if they did not back Mr. Obama on this big bill. 
 Adopting an argument made by the White House after Tuesday's elections, the representatives suggested that what happened in two contests for state office was less instructive than what happened in races for two House seats that Democrats won, among them a Republican district in upstate New York.
 ''If you look at the elections across the country,'' said Representative Tom Perriello, a first-term Democrat in Virginia, ''one of the things that it shows is that people aren't showing up for Republicans or Democrats: They are showing up for people who are giving them something to vote for.'' 
 ''I think it would be dangerous to draw a conclusion from that vote that voters are looking for me to say no to everything,'' said Mr. Perriello, who has not yet decided how to vote on health care.
 He said he was weighing the desire among his supporters to get something done against concerns about potentially distasteful elements of the bill, rather than focusing on the fact that a Republican, Robert F. McDonnell, was elected governor in his state on Tuesday.
 ''If you look in Virginia in my district, the biggest thing is how few voters showed up,'' Mr. Perriello said. ''In my district, I got more votes last year than Bob McDonnell this year.''
 None of this is to say that members of Congress, particularly vulnerable Democrats, are not keeping a close eye on political currents as they face tough votes on health care and, down the road, on paying for the war in Afghanistan.
 But in many cases, the results Tuesday came too late to be a major factor in the deliberations of both supporters and opponents of the health care bill. 
 ''My view of that is, absolutely not,'' said Representative Frank M. Kratovil Jr., a first-term Democrat from Maryland who said he was going to vote against the current version of the legislation, and had been intending to do so since the summer. ''People have been looking at this for months.''
 Republicans have a list of 30 Democrats who they think will be easy to knock off next year -- first-term members, or those serving in Republican-majority districts or in states with a high number of independents upset by some of Mr. Obama's policies.
 ''A vote for yet another job-killing expansion of government in the wake of newly released skyrocketing unemployment numbers would just be further proof of how politically tone-deaf the Democratic majority has become,'' said Ken Spain, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
 Representative Kathy Dahlkemper, a first-term Democrat from Pennsylvania who is a top target of Republicans -- Senator John McCain won her district in last year's presidential race -- said she had paid no attention to the Tuesday results as she weighed whether to support or oppose the bill.
 ''What happened in other parts of the country does not, I think, reflect my district,'' Ms. Dahlkemper said. ''Honestly, I bet if I went out and stopped 10 people on the street and asked them who won in New Jersey and Virginia, they wouldn't be able to tell me. ''
 Representative John Adler of New Jersey announced on Friday that he would vote against the bill, but said he was motivated not by the defeat of a fellow Democrat, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, in his state on Tuesday. Rather, he said, the problem was something he objected to when the House first proposed a bill in June: its failure to contain costs.
 ''I've been consistent -- I've told people consistently that my fundamental concern was cost containment,'' Mr. Adler said. ''The bill has a lot of good objectives. But the most important objective was to rein in insurance and medical costs to make it affordable, and this bill doesn't do that.''
 Ms. Kilroy, the Ohio Democrat, said she was not influenced by the contests in New Jersey and Virginia in deciding to support the bill. ''Regardless of what happened to the Democratic candidates in those races,'' she said, ''it doesn't change the fact that my constituents need health care reform.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2009

A Political Memo article on Saturday about the effect of last week's elections on the health care debate in Congress misstated the middle initial for the Republican who is the governor-elect of Virginia. He is Robert F. McDonnell, not Robert H.

HEADLINE: Dr. James Will Make It Better

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
I.
During one of our first conversations, Brent James told me a story that you wouldn't necessarily expect to hear from a doctor. For most of human history, James explained, doctors have done more harm than good. Their treatments consisted of inducing vomiting or diarrhea and, most common of all, bleeding their patients. James, who is the chief quality officer at Intermountain Healthcare, a network of hospitals and clinics in Utah and Idaho that President Obama and others have described as a model for health reform, then rattled off a list of history books that told the fuller story. Sure enough, these books recount that from the time of Hippocrates into the 19th century, medicine made scant progress. ''The amount of death and disease would be less,'' Jacob Bigelow, a prominent doctor, said in 1835, ''if all disease were left to itself.'' 
 Yet patients continued to go to doctors, and many continued to put great in faith in medicine. They did so in part because they had no good alternative and in part because, as James put it, they wanted a spiritual counselor with whom they could talk about their health. But there was something else, too. There was a strong intuitive logic behind those old treatments; they seemed to be ridding the body of its ills. They made a lot more sense on their face than the abstract theories about germs and viruses that began to appear in the late 19th century.
 So the victory of those theories would require a struggle. The doctors and scientists who tried to overturn centuries of intuitive wisdom were often met with scorn. Hippocrates himself wrote that a physician's judgment mattered more than any external measurement, and the practice of medicine was long organized accordingly. 
 In the end, of course, the theories about germs and viruses won out. They had the advantage of being correct, and doctors -- haltingly and skeptically, but eventually -- embraced them. ''Medicine adopted the scientific method,'' James said as we were sitting in his Salt Lake City office, which looks out onto the Utah State Capitol Building and the Wasatch Mountains. ''It transformed medicine, and it's easy to make the case.'' Diphtheria, mumps, measles and polio were conquered, and pneumonia and heart attacks became far less deadly. In 1910, life expectancy at birth in the United States was less than 50 years, and it had not risen much for centuries, James noted. Life expectancy today is 78 years. 
 But there is one important way in which medicine never quite adopted the scientific method. The explosion of medical research over the last century has produced a dizzying number of treatments for different ailments. For someone with heart disease, there is bypass surgery, stenting or simply drugs and behavior changes. For a man with early-stage prostate cancer, there is surgery, radiation, proton-beam therapy or so-called watchful waiting. To enter mainstream use, any such treatment typically needs to clear a high bar. It will be subject to randomized trials, statistical-significance tests, the peer-review process of academic journals and the scrutiny of government regulators. Yet once a treatment enters the mainstream -- once we know whether it works in certain situations -- science is largely left behind. The next questions -- when to use it and on which patients -- become matters of judgment, not measurement. The decision is, once again, left to a doctor's informed intuition.
 ''There are some real advantages to that,'' James says, ''and in some ways there are some real disadvantages too.'' The human mind can sometimes do a better job of piecing together amorphous bits of information -- diagnosing a disease, for example -- than even the most powerful computer. On the other hand, human beings can also be unduly influenced by just a few experiences, like the treatment of an especially memorable patient. As a result, different doctors frequently end up coming up with different answers to the same question. Cardiologists in Davenport, Iowa, are quick to insert stents; cardiologists in Iowa City and Sioux City are not. They can't both be right. Some people with heart disease are getting the best treatment, and some are not. The same is true of debilitating back pain, various cancers and even pregnancy.
 The health care debate of 2009 has had so many moving parts that it has sometimes seemed impossible to follow. The crisis behind the debate, though, is about one thing above all: the scattershot nature of American medicine. The fee-for-service payment system -- combined with our own instincts as patients -- encourages ever more testing and treatments. We're not sure which ones make a difference, but we keep on getting them, and costs keep rising. Millions of people cannot afford insurance as a result. Millions more have had their incomes pinched by rising insurance premiums. Medicare is on a long-term path to insolvency. The American health care system is vastly more expensive than any other country's, but our results are not vastly better. 
 Any bill that Congress passes this year is unlikely to fix these problems. The lobbying groups for drug companies, device makers, insurers, doctors and hospitals have succeeded, so far, in keeping big, systemic changes out of the bills. And yet the modern history of medicine -- the story that James tells -- nonetheless offers reason for optimism. Medicine has changed before, after all. When it did, government policy played a role. But much of the impetus came from inside the profession. Doctors helped change other doctors.
 For the past decade or so, a loose group of reformers has been trying to do precisely this. They have been trying to figure out how to improve health care while also holding down the growth in costs. The group includes Dr. John Wennberg and his proteges at Dartmouth, whose research about geographic variation in care has received a lot of attention lately, as well as Dr. Mark McClellan, who ran Medicare in the Bush administration, and Dr. Donald Berwick, a Boston pediatrician who has become a leading advocate for patient safety. These reformers tend to be an optimistic bunch. It's probably a necessary trait for anyone trying to overturn an entrenched status quo. When I have asked them whether they have any hope that medicine will change, they have tended to say yes. When I have asked them whether anybody has already begun to succeed, they have tended to mention the same name: Brent James.
 II.
 ON A RECENT Wednesday morning, about 25 students gathered in a conference room in downtown Salt Lake City. The students were doctors and hospital executives who came to Utah to be taught by James. His four-month course is called the Advanced Training Program, and it is a combination of statistical methods and management theory applied to the practice of medicine. ''I've wanted to go for years,'' Janet Porter, the chief operating officer of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, told me later. For anybody interested in improving the quality of health care, she said, the program is the equivalent of Harvard. 
 At the front of the room stood James, a 58-year-old surgeon by training who speaks with the clipped accent of an Idaho native and likes to make his points by telling stories. On more than one occasion, including this one, I watched him pour himself a Diet Coke and then leave it untouched as he jumped from one illustrative tale to another. On this morning, he was telling the class the story of Intermountain Healthcare. 
 In the late 1980s, a pulmonologist at Intermountain named Alan Morris received a research grant to study whether a new approach to ventilator care could help treat a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome. The condition, which is known as ARDS, kills thousands of Americans each year, many of them young men. (It can be a complication of swine flu.) As Morris thought about the research, he became concerned that the trial might be undermined by the fact that doctors would set ventilators at different levels for similar patients. He knew that he himself sometimes did so. Given all the things that the pulmonologists were trying to manage, it seemed they just could not set the ventilator consistently.
 Working with James, Morris began to write a protocol for treating ARDS. Some of the recommendations were based on solid evidence. Many were educated guesses. The final document ran to 50 pages and was left at the patients' bedsides in loose-leaf binders. Morris's colleagues were naturally wary of it. ''I thought there wasn't anybody better in the world at twiddling the knobs than I was,'' Jim Orme, a critical-care doctor, told me later, ''so I was skeptical that any protocol generated by a group of people could do better.'' Morris helped overcome this skepticism in part by inviting his colleagues to depart from the protocol whenever they wanted. He was merely giving them a set of defaults, which, he emphasized, were for the sake of a research trial. 
 The crucial thing about the protocol was that it reduced the variation in what the doctors did. That, in turn, allowed Morris and James to isolate the aspects of treatment that made a difference. There was no way to do that when the doctors were treating patients in dozens of different ways. James has a provocative way of describing his method to doctors: ''Guys, it's more important that you do it the same way than what you think is the right way.'' 
 While the pulmonologists were working off of the protocol, Intermountain's computerized records system was tracking patient outcomes. A pulmonology team met each week to talk about the outcomes and to rewrite the protocol when it seemed to be wrong. In the first few months, the team made dozens of changes. Just as the pulmonologists predicted, the initial protocol was deeply flawed. But it seemed to be successful anyway. One widely circulated national study overseen by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital had found an ARDS survival rate of about 10 percent. For those in Intermountain's study, the rate was 40 percent. 
 All along, Morris has been reluctant to give the protocol credit for the increase. As he explained to me, Intermountain's trial differed from the earlier study in any number of ways. Still, his once-skeptical colleagues were impressed. Orme said that the gap in survival was eye-opening for him and others. James was thrilled not only by the results but also by the fact that the doctors managed to put together such a complex set of clinical guidelines.
 In the years since the ARDS study, one Intermountain department after another has embarked on a similar project. By now, the hospital has gone through the exercise for 50 clinical conditions, accounting for more than half of Intermountain's patients. For each, a committee made up of doctors, nurses and administrators has tried to identify variation and then figure out which treatments have not been working. 
 The committee members are drawn from Intermountain's network of 23 hospitals and dozens of clinics in Utah and Idaho. These doctors and nurses can then spread the gospel of the protocol, and their words are far more influential than any printed document. Whenever possible, the guidelines are also embedded in the hospital's computer system. Doctors and nurses are presented with a default choice -- how much of a given drug to prescribe, for example -- and have the option of overriding it. Most important, the electronic records system allows both committees and doctors to track patient outcomes. Doctors with consistently poor results can expect to be pulled aside for a collegial conversation with a supervisor about what they might be doing wrong. Doctors with the best results can expect to be asked what they are doing right. Doctors in many areas are also eligible for bonuses of up to about $2,500 a year if their outcomes are good. 
 Tracking outcomes and adjusting care, however, is rarely easy or clear-cut. Among many other things, the committees have to decide how to balance Intermountain's internal evidence with published studies that are both more scientific and potentially less relevant. By any definition, the exercise depends on human judgment. At one primary-care meeting I attended, Dr. Scott Lindley said he had heard complaints from doctors who thought the committee made a mistake by setting the goal for hemoglobin A1c levels -- a common measure of blood sugar in diabetes patients -- at 8. If an obese person came in at 13 and the medical team reduced the level to 9, wasn't that a success? An 8 might be too ambitious a benchmark, Lindley said. ''Some literature shows 9 is better,'' he noted. 
 In response, Dr. Michael Visick, another committee member, pointed out that nobody was being punished for having patients with hemoglobin levels above 8. Doctors were simply asked to take a second look at those patients. And the only reason the committee set a benchmark was that data had shown the percentage of patients with a level above 8 was rising, Visick said. That was a sign that Intermountain's diabetes care might be slipping. Lindley seemed to accept the explanation. Still, he added with a tone of mild sarcasm that he was sure his colleagues would ''just go away happy'' when he conveyed the explanation to them. 
 James's answer to such skepticism -- and there is a lot of it, especially beyond Intermountain -- is to show results. Intermountain has reduced the number of preterm deliveries, as well as the number of babies who must spend time in the neonatal-intensive-care unit. So-called adverse drug events, which include overdoses and allergic reactions, were cut in half in the mid-1990s. A protocol for dealing with one broad category of pneumonia cut its mortality rate by 40 percent over several years. The death rate for coronary-bypass surgery was cut to 1.5 percent, from the national average of about 3 percent. Medicare data on heart-failure and pneumonia patients show that Intermountain has significantly lower-than-average readmission rates. In all, James estimates that the changes have saved thousands of lives a year across Intermountain's network. Outside experts consider that estimate to be fair. 
 Wennberg, the Dartmouth researcher, argues that Intermountain is fundamentally different from other oft-cited models of high-quality, lower-cost care, like the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic. These places, including Intermountain, share certain traits, like having a large number of doctors who receive fixed salaries rather than being paid piecemeal for each treatment. Partly as a result, these hospitals do fewer tests, treatments and operations than other hospitals and still get excellent results. What sets Intermountain apart, Wennberg says, is that it is also making a rigorous effort to analyze and improve bedside care. 
 ''It's the best model in the country of how you can actually change health care,'' Wennberg told me. I heard nearly the same argument from Anthony Staines, a health scholar and hospital regulator in Switzerland who recently completed a study of some of the world's most-admired hospitals. ''Intermountain was really the only system where there was evidence of improvement in a majority of departments,'' Staines said.
 Among James's biggest points of pride is his growing, if still small, group of imitators. Thirty-five hospitals have set up in-house versions of his course, usually run by one of his former students. ''Everybody is trying to systemically improve value and quality,'' says Dr. John Mendelsohn, the president of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, which started its course in 2005. ''But at Intermountain they have worked out the operational system and the culture to do it.'' Based on the success of the Anderson program, the University of Texas has required all the other branches of its medical system to start their own courses. 
 Viewed across the entire health care system, however, the pace of change is extremely slow. The journal Health Affairs will soon publish a survey of the chairmen of more than 700 hospitals. Its main message is that many hospitals are not even aware of what they do well and what they don't. The physicians who conducted the survey, Ashish Jha and Arnold Epstein, gave the chairmen a list of issues -- including financial performance, organizational strategy and the quality of health care -- and asked them to name their board's two top priorities. Roughly half did not name the quality of care. Yet the chairmen said they believed that the care at their hospitals was above average. Even at those hospitals that Medicare data suggest are among the worst in the country, 58 percent of the chairmen said they thought their hospital was above average. Not a single one said the hospital was below average. 
 ''Brent is the future,'' says Lucian Leape, a professor of public health at Harvard and a former surgeon. ''But how long are you willing to wait? It may take 100 years.''
 III.
 WHEN JAMES WAS growing up on a cattle ranch in Blackfoot, Idaho, as the oldest son in a family of six children, he spent a fair amount of time on a tractor. Sometimes he would have nothing to do but wait for a ditch to fill up with water. So he brought along a calculus textbook. ''I'm one of the relatively rare subset of people that finds math fun,'' James said. ''Just thinking about it was fun. It's how my brain is wired.'' He liked the elegance of mathematics, and he also liked that it could describe the workings of the world. Numbers could tell stories. Like many number lovers who don't want to do pure, abstract math, James decided to be an academic physicist. He enrolled at the University of Utah and spent his time there working on high-energy physics and the relatively new field of computer science.
 ''One day, we're in the lab and we're working away, and we had a postdoc there,'' James recalled. ''We had a little conversation, and he said I was an idiot for going to into physics.'' The postdoc explained that there was ''a line 200 people long for any university faculty position.'' After checking around, James decided that the postdoc was right, and he began looking for another field that offered both fascinating research questions and decent career prospects. Medicine seemed as if it might be the answer. He applied to the University of Utah's medical school and was accepted
 James enjoyed treating patients more than he expected, and he became a cancer surgeon. But research remained his main interest. After his residency, he did a fellowship at the National Cancer Institute, outside Washington, and then took a job at the American College of Surgeons, helping to oversee its cancer research. One of his projects involved studying variation in how oncologists determined cancer stages and then treated patients. 
 Eventually he joined the faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health. While in Boston, he and his wife divorced, which made him want to be closer to his family out West. Salt Lake City was especially appealing because James is an observant Mormon. In 1986, he was hired by Intermountain as the director of medical research and continuing medical education. At the time, Intermountain was one of the few medical systems with electronic patient records. 
 The job gave James his first real chance to put his research into practice. He was no longer working where so many other reformers do, in an academic department or government agency. He was working for a hospital. But being in the real world also created a problem for him. He could not simply tell Intermountain's doctors what to do, no matter how much research he brought to bear. Doctors have a degree of professional autonomy that is probably unmatched outside academia. And that is how we like it. We think of our doctors as wise men and women who can combine knowledge and instinct to land on just the right treatment. Our fictional doctor heroes, from Marcus Welby to House, are iconoclasts who don't go by the book. They rely on intuition, and intuition is indeed a powerful thing, be it in medicine or other parts of life.
 Everyone has had the experience of being able to read someone's face or voice -- to know his or her mood -- without knowing how. Then there are the stories of firefighters who have rushed out of a burning building shortly before it collapses. Gary Klein, a cognitive psychologist and researcher, collects examples like these, and one of the most powerful involves a paramedic who, at a family gathering, told her father-in-law that he needed to go the hospital. He said he felt fine. She prevailed on him. The next day, he was undergoing heart-bypass surgery. Like the firefighters and the face readers, the paramedic could not explain her reasoning. She did not know how she knew what she knew. When she was interviewed later, she said that she must have been tipped off by the kind of paleness and swelling that she had seen dozens of times before.
 Stories like this one are deeply appealing. They allow us to feel that we are tuned into the mysterious logic of life. Indeed, in many ways we are. The human mind can store huge amounts of knowledge. Intuition is not simply belief; it springs from this knowledge. A doctor making an intuitive diagnosis is doing so on the basis of thousands of hours spent treating patients. The problem, however, is that the mind is not particularly good at sorting through this knowledge and weighing different parts appropriately. We give too much weight to information that confirms our suspicions or that is highly memorable. 
 Behavioral researchers have come to believe that there is a clear pattern to when intuition works and when it doesn't. ''Intuitive diagnosis is reliable when people have a lot of relevant feedback,'' says Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics who recently collaborated on a project about intuition with Klein. People need a great deal of experience, and the feedback from these experiences -- whether a treatment is working, say -- needs to come quickly and to be clear. ''But,'' Kahneman adds, ''people are very often willing to make intuitive diagnoses even when they're very likely to be wrong.'' When doctors have been asked to estimate the likelihood of a treatment succeeding based on experience, for example, they give wildly divergent answers. Medicine is full of such examples.
 James is a voracious consumer of social science, and he likes to frame these issues with opposing concepts: pattern matching and rate estimation. Pattern matching refers to intuition at its best. It is what people can do in those few areas in which they have had vast experience and clear feedback. Rate estimation is a task that people usually do not perform well but that happens to make up a great deal of modern medicine. ''When a person says, 'In my experience,' what's actually happening is you're being dominated by one or two recent cases that you can recall or by some distant case that was either particularly good or particularly bad,'' James says. ''My first goal for Intermountain is that anytime a physician or nurse says, 'In my experience' when they're talking to a patient, they mean, 'In my measured experience.' ''
 IV.
 TWO YEARS AGO,Jerome Groopman, the Harvard doctor and New Yorker writer, published a book called ''How Doctors Think.'' It would seem in many ways to be the kind of book that James and the other medical reformers would love. Groopman tells a series of stories about misdiagnosis and uses academic research, including Kahneman's, to explain how intuition could lead doctors astray. But Groopman comes to a very different conclusion than the reformers do. In the book and his subsequent writings, he lays out the central challenge to what might be called the Intermountain way.
 He argues that evidence-based medicine is useful in only a limited number of run-of-the-mill situations, like distinguishing between strep throat and a simple sore throat. ''Human beings are not uniform in their biology,'' wrote Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, a Harvard endocrinologist (and Groopman's wife), in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article criticizing the Obama administration's plans to tie Medicare payments to so-called quality metrics. ''A disease with many effects on multiple organs, like diabetes, acts differently in different people.'' Groopman and Hartzband mentioned a handful of studies in which protocols had led to outcomes that were no better, or even worse, than what doctors had previously been doing. A couple of the studies dealt with the regulation of blood sugar in diabetics, the same issue that came up in the primary-care meeting I attended at Intermountain.
 To Groopman, a fundamental problem with ''systems analysis,'' as he calls it, is that it discourages doctors from considering a wide-enough array of possible treatments. He also worries that if doctors are judged based on how well they follow a protocol, they may follow it even when they are correctly skeptical of it. Groopman says that the proper solution to misdiagnosis instead lies with individual doctors. If they are taught the ways in which their instincts can lead them astray, and if they reflect on their previous mistakes, they can avoid some of the pitfalls of intuition. They can become more self-aware. 
 This debate between intuition and empiricism is as old as Plato, who thought that knowledge came from intuitive reasoning, and Aristotle, who preferred observation. The argument has seemed especially intense lately, as one field after another has struggled to define the role of human judgment in a data-saturated society. The police officials in New York City who overhauled crime fighting were classic empiricists. The debate over education reform revolves around how well teachers can be measured and what the consequences of those measurements should be. These disagreements can sometimes be exaggerated, because everyone agrees that intuition and empiricism both have a role to play. But the fight over how to balance the two is a real one.
 I asked James one day whether he had read Groopman's criticisms, and he said yes. ''Groopman's right at one level,'' James said. ''You cannot write a protocol that perfectly fits any patient. Humans that come to us for care are just too variable.'' James likes to say that the trained, expert mind of a physician is the most valuable resource in medicine. He adds that he is simply trying to focus that resource on the problems where it is most needed: those for which data does not have an answer. 
 But James then pulled out a graph that was sitting on his desk. It showed a steep fall in mortality after Intermountain put in place a heart-failure protocol. Among other things, doctors now automatically receive a beta-blocker prescription to sign, or not, as part of a patient's discharge process. The changes appear to save about 450 lives a year. Graphs like that one, he said, are the reason he believes in evidence-based medicine. It must be done right -- with hospitals monitoring outcomes at every step, quickly sharing that data with doctors and altering the guidelines as necessary -- and James acknowledges it isn't always done right. He is not defending protocols per se. He is defending measurement. ''Don't argue philosophy,'' he told me. ''Show me your mortality rates, and then I'll believe you.'' 
 Groopman declined to be interviewed for this article, but after talking with medical researchers and social scientists, I think there is a way to make sense of Groopman's and James's dueling narratives. The researchers say that Groopman is right to highlight examples of human judgment being just as good as data. There are many of them. Still, the overall record of decision-making approaches that are based mostly on intuition is far weaker than the record of decisions based mostly on data. To give just one example, an article in the journal Psychological Assessment, analyzing dozens of studies that compared clinical judgments with data-based diagnoses, found that clinical judgments were better in only a few instances. The two approaches were equally accurate about half of the time, but the data-based diagnoses substantially outperformed human judgment in nearly half of the studies. And with data collection becoming ever cheaper, Kahneman says that the number of occasions in which an intuitive approach beats a systemic one is getting smaller all the time.
 American medicine, then, appears to have it backward. Yes, it is possible to rely too heavily on numbers and patterns when treating patients. But the bigger risk -- the one we are now taking -- is relying too heavily on intuition. ''There is too much evidence -- good evidence -- that the care many patients receive isn't up to snuff,'' says Dr. Alan Garber of Stanford University. 
 Perhaps the clearest example is the Pronovost checklist. As many as 28,000 people in this country die each year from infections that come from intravenous lines. Several years ago, Peter Pronovost, a Johns Hopkins physician, developed a simple list of five steps that intensive-care doctors should take before inserting an IV line, in order to prevent the introduction of bacteria. The checklist reduced the infection rate to essentially zero at 108 hospitals in Michigan where it was adopted. Pronovost published the results in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2006. But most intensive-care doctors are still not using the checklist. To insert an IV line, they continue to rely on their own judgment. 
 V.
 THE COMMITTEES that James sets up to study variation in treatment do not disband after they have written their initial protocols. They meet monthly to tweak those protocols, set clinical goals and track patient outcomes. The statistics the committees examine reach down to the level of the individual doctors.
 Last summer, the members of the labor-and-delivery committee noticed some worrisome signs about an obstetrician at an Intermountain hospital outside Salt Lake City. His births were taking unusually long on average, and a relatively large number of them were Caesarian sections. So Ware Branch, the head of the labor-and-delivery committee, a fit obstetrician in his 50s, sent the doctor a letter asking him to think about what might be causing the trends. One item on the committee's September agenda was talking about the doctor's response.
 Sitting at the head of a long conference table, Branch started the discussion by inviting the other members to predict what the doctor had said. ''What do we know the first issue is?'' Branch asked.
 A few called out, ''The data's wrong!''
 This is the classic response when doctors (and many other people) are confronted with numbers indicating they could be doing their job better. Doctors often say that their outcomes look worse because their patients are sicker. In this case, the obstetrician suggested that Intermountain's numbers were just not right. Branch and his colleagues were confident of their statistics, and they thought this might be what Janie Wilson, the lead nurse on the committee, called ''a little growth opportunity.''
 The labor-and-delivery committee was formed in 1998, and its main success since then has been reducing the number of elective inductions -- births that are induced without a medical reason. Elective inductions can be convenient for doctors and expectant families and can spare mothers some of the discomfort of the final weeks of pregnancy. But since 1999, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that, for the sake of the baby's health, no elective inductions be done before the 39th week of pregnancy. The dating of pregnancy is sufficiently uncertain that what is thought to be the 38th week may really be the 36th week, and a baby born in the 36th week is more likely to have underdeveloped lungs or other problems. Early elective inductions also lead to longer labors and more C-sections.
 Despite the recommendation, though, about 30 percent of elective inductions at Intermountain in 2001 were done before 39 weeks, roughly what the national share was. That year Intermountain adopted a protocol urging doctors to avoid most early inductions, and only then did the rate begin to fall. One hospital in southwest Utah has gone so far as to allow nurses to refuse a doctor's early-induction orders unless the medical director has given permission. By 2004, the share of elective inductions done before the 39th week at Intermountain fell to 5 percent, and it is now less than 2 percent. The number of newborns with respiratory problems has also dropped.
 At the September meeting, Branch distributed his own response to the obstetrician's response. It was a breezy letter full of doctor bonhomie, and it profusely thanked the obstetrician for taking the time to respond in writing. ''You are perfectly right to question the data,'' Branch wrote. ''We have been found incorrect in numerous cases.'' But for all its politeness, Branch's letter was also pointed. With it, he attached a list of every elective induction the obstetrician had done recently and invited him to identify any that had been incorrectly classified. Branch also enclosed statistical profiles of other, similarly busy obstetricians. They performed fewer C-sections and had shorter delivery times. The letter's final section included the following:
 ''Lastly, quality improvement is a process, not an event. In part it works by finding variation and drawing attention to it, as has happened with you and others in this effort. And well-done quality improvement is not punitive; it's educational. It is also worth noting that those docs determined not to learn never do.''
 VI.
 THERE IS, OF COURSE, an alternative to Intermountain's focus on doctors. Instead of creating committees charged with ensuring the best possible medical care, a hospital could turn over that responsibility to patients. Some parts of the grass-roots medical-reform movement are already trying to make this happen.
 Academic research has suggested that when doctors share hard information about the risks and benefits of different treatment options, it can affect patients' decisions. Patients tend to choose less-aggressive treatments but still end up with similar outcomes and are more satisfied with their care. Intermountain is one of the hospitals starting to experiment with such ''shared decision'' models. Dartmouth's Hitchcock Medical Center is the pioneer. The availability of medical information on the Internet encourages these approaches.
 In the end, though, it is not clear how many decisions most patients really want to make. For the past several years, Medicare has published data on the Web comparing hospitals on various measures, like infection rates and surgical-complication rates. Patients have largely ignored it. (Do you know which hospitals to avoid where you live? I didn't before writing this article.) President Obama, when discussing his own health care in an interview earlier this year with this magazine, made a similar point. ''I'm a pretty well educated layperson when it comes to medical care; I know how to ask good questions of my doctor,'' he said. ''But ultimately, he's the guy with the medical degree.''
 James's strategy acknowledges this reality. He tries to win over doctors with a combination of flattery, deference and, finally, evidence. ''We never name names,'' he told me. He admitted that Intermountain was probably too soft on doctors who evidence suggested were not giving their patients the best possible care. Intermountain rarely forces a doctor to leave.
 This approach obviously involves some realpolitik. Since his fellow doctors have so much clinical autonomy, James has little choice but to woo them. As Robert Wachter, the chief of hospital medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and an expert on medical errors, told me, ''He knows that the minute he says, 'I'm right, and you must do this,' he loses everybody but the true believers.'' James is appealing to the same idealistic side of doctors -- the flame, he calls it -- that helped persuade their predecessors to adopt scientific methods a century ago.
 ''That flame burns brightly within the heart of any physician,'' he told his students during one recent class. ''It's what brought us into medicine. That's what defines us as a profession. And that's your real leverage point. There are a few outliers, but don't let those outliers get you off track.''
 It would be a mistake, however, to see the deferential approach as solely political. James also frequently notes that many medical questions still have no data-proven answer. Many never will. When patients have conflicting symptoms, statistics and protocols won't always help. Sometimes, intuition is the only good tool a doctor has.
 VII.
 ONE DAY, WHILE I was standing in Intermountain's cardiology intensive-care unit, which, unlike those in many other hospitals, is next to the cardiac-surgery wing, it occurred to me that Intermountain really was not so unusual. It is unusual for a health care organization. But its story is fairly typical in the rest of the economy.
 The executives at a company realize that their industry has built up all kinds of bad practices over the years. Those practices damage the quality of their product and waste money. The executives do a rigorous analysis of their operations, relying on solid information rather than conventional wisdom. And then they persuade their colleagues to make changes. Much of the lingo of management theory -- ''quality,'' ''lean,'' ''Six Sigma'' -- is simply a dressed-up way of describing this approach. 
 James peppers his classes with anecdotes about W. Edwards Deming, arguably the original quality guru, and it is easy to see why Deming would be attractive to James. Deming grew up on a farm in Iowa in the early 20th century and majored in electrical engineering at the University of Wyoming. During World War II, he was part of a committee that helped the government make wartime production more efficient. After the war, his statistical methods caught on in Japan, and the Japanese credit him with helping to make their postwar boom possible. The so-called Toyota way stems from Deming's work. Eventually, the same ideas caught on at General Electric, Intel, Wal-Mart and elsewhere in this country. 
 But there is a fundamental difference between Toyota and Intermountain. As Toyota built better cars than its competition for less money, it won new customers. Some rivals matched its successes (as Honda did); some lost market share (as Detroit did). No such dynamic exists in health care. William Lewis, a former director of the McKinsey Global Institute who studies productivity, says that the economic benefits from the various quality movements have been quite large but that they are also largely in the past. Most industries have incorporated Deming's big ideas and are now making only incremental progress. ''However, there is one big exception,'' Lewis adds. ''You guessed it: health care.''
 Why? In part, it is the faith that patients have in their doctors. When people are buying a car, they often consult Consumer Reports or Road & Track. When they are choosing a place to have surgery, they ask their doctor to recommend a surgeon and go to the hospital where that surgeon works. Hospitals that provide less than top-quality care are rarely punished in the way that General Motors and Ford have been.
 Even more important than how we choose our health care, though, is how we pay for it. One of Deming's principles is that improving quality also tends to reduce costs. That is not always the case in health care; expensive treatments -- implantable cardiac defibrillators, for instance -- can bring enormous benefits. But Deming's principle holds more often than you might think. When in doubt about the best procedure, doctors tend to do more -- more tests, more procedures, more surgery. So if a hospital does a rigorous analysis of what actually works, it is likely to discover a fair amount of waste. 
 But in our current health care system, there is no virtuous cycle of innovation, success and expansion. When Intermountain standardized lung care for premature babies, it not only cut the number who went on a ventilator by more than 75 percent; it also reduced costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Perversely, Intermountain's revenues were reduced by even more. Altogether, Intermountain lost $329,000. Thanks to the fee-for-service system, the hospital had been making money off substandard care. And by improving care -- by reducing the number of babies on ventilators -- it lost money. As James tartly said, ''We got screwed pretty badly on that.'' The story is not all that unusual at Intermountain, either. That is why a hospital cannot do as Toyota did and squeeze its rivals by offering better, less-expensive care. 
 For all of its focus on efficiency, Intermountain, too, can be tempted by the dark side of the fee-for-service system. In one committee meeting, I listened to a debate about how much the hospital should charge patients for a certain medical device. Intermountain previously had negotiated a price reduction from the manufacturer that saved thousands of dollars on each device. But the hospital was still charging patients the old price, and the insurers, including Medicare, were still paying. That was what their reimbursement charts said they would pay. 
 A few people in the meeting were clearly bothered by this. They asked the finance executive, participating by speakerphone, if anything could be done. One committee member argued that Intermountain (which is nonprofit) should not overcharge for a treatment, even if it helped the hospital cover its overall expenses. The finance executive replied, apologetically, that changing the reimbursement rate would cost Intermountain millions of dollars and that there did not seem to be any way to make up for the loss. The meeting then moved on to another topic.
 VIII.
 IF YOU SIMPLY looked at Intermountain's overall results -- the good outcomes and low costs -- you might be tempted to dismiss them as a product of the environment. Utah has the youngest population of any state, as well one of the lowest rates of alcohol and tobacco use. More than half of the state's residents are Mormons. This homogeneity creates a noticeable sense of community, even a sense of mission, among many Intermountain doctors and nurses. 
 The places that spend far more on medical care and get worse results -- south Texas, south Florida, New York City and its suburbs -- don't have those advantages. They tend to have more diverse populations and a more diverse set of medical needs. None of these places is ever likely to reduce its costs, or raise its life expectancy, to Utah's levels.
 But once you acknowledge all this, you are still left with some fairly striking facts. There is nothing inherently Mormon about waiting until the 39th week to deliver a baby. Nor is there something unique to Utah that allows doctors there to analyze their results and systematically try to improve them. There is no reason, really, that a hospital anywhere else cannot do the same. Maybe more hospitals will begin to do so on their own, pushed by the same internal forces that remade medicine a century ago. But maybe not. The economic incentives in health care are still pointing in the other direction. As long as doctors and hospitals are paid for each extra test and treatment, they will err on the side of more care and not always better care. No doctor or no single hospital can change that. It requires action by the government.
 One big remaining uncertainty about health reform -- assuming some version of it passes -- is how much it will do on this front. Earlier this year, James and doctors from Dartmouth, the Mayo Clinic and the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania traveled to Washington to talk about health reform with a small group of Obama administration officials. It was part of a continuing effort by the evidence-based crowd to influence reform in Congress. At one point during the meeting, the doctors began to talk about a potential pilot program that would make it easier for hospitals to improve care and hold down costs. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and budget-office official (and brother of Rahm, the White House chief of staff) who has spent much of the past year trying to get such programs included in the bill, asked how much this one would cost to set up. The doctors estimated $250 million over five years. The White House officials laughed. It was a much smaller sum than they usually discussed.
 Several pilot programs with similar aims have made it into some of the health-reform bills considered by Congress. One is a bundling program, in which Medicare would pay hospitals a set fee for certain operations or chronic illnesses, rather than paying piecemeal for every aspect of the treatment. Hospitals would then have an incentive to avoid complications and readmissions, because they would no longer be automatically reimbursed for them. The hospitals that did the best job of keeping their patients healthy would end up helping their bottom lines. The details are still being fleshed out, but Medicare or private hospital groups would most likely monitor outcomes to make sure the incentives didn't lead hospitals to skimp on care or turn away the sickest patients.
 These pilot programs have been largely overlooked in the public discussion of health reform, because they start small. At first, they would be voluntary. Places like Intermountain would presumably sign up for them, and high-cost hospitals would not. But the Obama administration is hoping to make the pilot programs national -- and mandatory -- if they are successful. In that case, the program would suddenly not be so small. It would begin to attack medicine's most upside-down incentives.
 Other such ideas also have a chance to be a part of health reform. One is the so-called Cadillac tax on the most expensive health-insurance plans. It would put pressure on insurers to hold down costs, which would increase their incentive to steer patients to hospitals like Intermountain. Another idea would aim to make the market for health care more like the market for new cars. Pushed by Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, the proposal would encourage employers to let their workers choose from a much wider range of insurance plans, which would allow people to shop around for those that provided good, cost-effective care. 
 James and his allies have no illusion that any of these ideas is a silver bullet. But given the scale of Medicare's long-term budget shortfall, the only sensible strategy is to try anything that seems promising. At the top of that list is moving medicine away from the fee-for-service system and toward something like a fee-for-health system. As dispiriting as the health care debate has been at times, Congress still has a chance to pass a bill that would begin to make life easier on the hospitals trying to do the right thing and, eventually, nudge many more hospitals into that category. That would be no small thing.
 Some doctors will resist the change. But the bet that James is making is that most will not. We may still want our doctor to be like Marcus Welby, but our great fortune is that he cannot be. Medicine has made too much progress. The range of cures and treatments is too vast. Every year, medical journals publish hundreds of new findings that doctors are supposed to synthesize. Yet somehow, both doctors and patients have come to imagine that a physician can accomplish far more than any human being reasonably can. As a result, modern medicine is accomplishing far less than it reasonably should. 
 James told me that one of his first challenges, when talking to a new group of doctors, is to persuade them he is not accusing them of failure. You can think of this as yet another part of his charm offensive, but there is something to it. Most doctors want to do the best possible job for their patients. Most also do not have the ability to do so right now. ''We're still not nearly as good as we're going to be,'' James says.

HEADLINE: Windfall Seen as Banks Give Bonuses in Stock

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
Even as Washington tries to rein in Wall Street pay, bankers are likely to make unusually large gains on the stock grants and options they received after shares in their companies fell sharply during the financial meltdown.
 Banks cut bonuses last year and shifted more pay into stock and options from cash, a tactic that lawmakers supported for its emphasis on long-term performance. Within months, the financial system began to mend -- partly with the help of billions of dollars in government aid -- and that stock began surging in value. Some of it can be cashed in starting in just a few months.
 And so the bonuses Wall Street received last year, billed as paltry at the time, are turning out to be among the most lucrative payouts ever.
 Goldman Sachs, for instance, sharply cut nearly all bonuses it paid last year but gave some executives more options than usual. 
 The company gave its general counsel, for example, 104,868 stock options and 14,117 shares in December, when the bank's stock was around $78. 
 Now the bank's shares have more than doubled in value, making that stock and option award worth nearly $12 million, according to Equilar, an executive compensation research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif. 
 That executive is just one of many Wall Street workers who have seen the bonuses they received last year soar in value, even though some of the shares cannot be sold for a few years. 
 Goldman's bonus pool last year was $4.82 billion, according to the New York attorney general's office, but because about half of that was paid in stock, it is now worth upwards of $7.8 billion. At JPMorgan Chase, workers have seen the value of the stock awarded them last year increase at least $3 billion.
 ''People have to look at the sizable gains that have been made since stock and options were granted last year, and the fact is this was, in many ways, a windfall,'' said Jesse M. Brill, the chairman of CompensationStandards.com, a trade publication. ''This had nothing to do with people's performance. These were granted at market lows.''
 Wall Street has long used a mix of stock and cash for bonuses. But the greater emphasis on cash before the financial crisis began meant executives could walk away rich even as their companies collapsed. 
 That has left many on Wall Street -- and in Washington -- demanding that a greater portion of pay be made in stock in hopes of rewarding long-term performance rather than short-term bets. 
 The Treasury's special master of pay, Kenneth R. Feinberg, has said there is ''too much reliance on cash'' on Wall Street and has proposed stock as an alternative.
 Banks began the trend by paying more in stock last year. Then, in February, Congress required that bonuses at bailed-out banks be paid entirely in stock. Last month, the Treasury Department took the idea further by proposing that some executives' salaries be paid in stock. The result is that Wall Street workers have more of their pay at risk than ever. 
 Still, some compensation experts say the risk has been decreased by the government's backing of the financial system and historically low stock prices. After all, they point out, companies like JPMorgan, American Express and Capital One issued stock and options last year when their share prices had little chance of going anywhere but up.
 The stock gains raise questions about the wisdom of pushing pay too far in either direction, favoring either cash or stock. Normal theories about stock compensation and risk-taking may not hold true today, compensation experts say, in large part because of the government's continued financial support of the industry. 
 And they say the upside at many banks is far bigger than the downside, particularly for banks like Bank of America and Citigroup that have not yet seen their shares recover.
 ''Right now the world is set up for these people to take big gambles,'' said Kevin J. Murphy, a professor at the University of Southern California who advised the Treasury Department on pay. ''The worst part of the asymmetry comes from the too-big-to-fail guarantee'' that has been reinforced by the government aid.
 Wells Fargo was one of more than a dozen major banks to award executives stock and options since the bailout. In February, the bank gave nearly three million options and roughly 528,000 shares to 11 executives. On paper, the grants have risen in value to $57.3 million from $12.1 million, according to Equilar. 
 Pat Callahan, one of the Wells Fargo executives to receive the grants, said the bank's board always considers equity grants in February.
 ''Of course in February the price was very low, but nobody knew what was going to happen,'' she said. ''It's true that the stock price change from February to now is a mix of economic recovery and things that we've done.''
 The Wells Fargo options start to become available early next year, though executives there are not allowed to sell more than half of them until a year after they retire. Of course, the stock could fall rather than rise before then, as could shares of other banks like Goldman or JPMorgan.
 The stock payouts strike some experts as a way to simply defer windfalls into the future. 
 ''The stock doesn't bother me. What bothers me are the gross amounts,'' said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware. ''Most people are focused on cash payments, and they ignore the stock. When you issue stock in a period of economic distress, you've often given someone a gift.''
 Many financial workers, of course, do not consider their compensation a gift, despite widespread criticism of their high pay.
 And some pay experts point to stock losses on Wall Street in recent years. Ira T. Kay, the head of compensation at the consulting firm Watson Wyatt, said, ''No one's looking to give them sympathy, but it's not correct to say they haven't felt the pain of their shareholders.'' 
 Still, at some banks, like Goldman and JPMorgan, the stock in the bonus pools from 2006 and 2007 has almost fully recovered its value.
 For upcoming compensation at Citigroup and Bank of America, the Treasury required the banks to pay executives almost entirely in stock. That means if performance goals are met, 19 executives at Citigroup would split $113 million in stock this year and 12 executives at Bank of America would share in $73.6 million in stock. (Each bank is also paying roughly $5 million of these executives' salaries in cash.)
 But greater upside lurks. If Citigroup's stock returns to its early 2008 price of $29, from just above $4 on Friday, the executives' shares from this year alone would be worth more than $800 million. Even if the stock rose to only $12, their shares would be worth $340 million. 
 At Bank of America, seven executives could see their pay packages become worth more than $10 million apiece if the bank's stock increases just $10. A bank spokesman, Bob Stickler, said, ''Under that scenario, executives get paid because the shareholders are being paid.''
 The Treasury Department declined to comment when asked if these bank executives were being set up for windfalls. Lucian A. Bebchuk, a Harvard Law School professor who advised Treasury on pay rules, said, ''What should we have done differently?''
 ''It would be better if you could take the stock and somehow neutralize what the government did, but that's really tricky,'' he said. ''If you have equity compensation, sometimes there are massive windfalls.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the large gains for Wall Street bankers on stock grants and options awarded last year in lieu of cash bonuses misstated, in some editions, the value of some anticipated compensation, which the Treasury Department mandated be almost entirely in the form of stock. If performance goals are met, 19 executives at Citigroup will split $113 million, not $133 million, in stock this year, and 12 executives at Bank of America will share in $75.6 million, not $78.6 million. The article also misstated, in some editions, the value of the Citigroup options should the share value, which was around $4 on Friday, rebound to $12. The shares would then be worth $340 million, not $400 million.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: It Happened This Year ...: Executives at financial companies bailed out by the government received large proportions of their pay in the form of stock and options granted at the turn of this year. The value of the equities is much greater now than was estimated at the time they were granted, reflecting a stronger rebound in stock prices than anticipated. Still, it isn't cash in hand
shares could fall before executives sell.
... and It May Happen Again: Banks that have received exceptional bailout assistance, like Bank of America and Citigroup, have been required by the government to pay a significant amount of executive compensation later this year in stock, rather than in cash. This would set the executives up for large gains if their companies' stock prices increase significantly -- or big losses if they fall.(Sources: Equilar

HEADLINE: City's JobsNow Program Also Benefits Newsom

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
Arik Levy was not expecting to benefit from the federal economic stimulus package -- until one day last summer when a city worker stopped him on Mission Street in San Francisco and offered to give him some money. 
 Free money from the government? To Mr. Levy, the owner of a wash-and-fold service called Laundry Locker, the pitch sounded like a late-night infomercial. Too busy to stop and chat, he brushed the woman aside, handing her a business card as he ducked into his car.
But by the time Mr. Levy got to his office, he had an e-mail message from the woman, Roxana Morales. The city, Ms. Morales said, would pay 100 percent of the wages of any new workers Mr. Levy hired, as long as they had at least one dependent child and an income below two times the poverty level, or about $3,000 a month for a family of three. All Mr. Levy had to do was pay the payroll taxes and benefits. 
 ''That's ridiculous,'' he said. But after Ms. Morales convinced him that it was true, he agreed to sign up. She walked him through the application process, and he now has four new employees, courtesy of the City of San Francisco and the taxpayers.
 The program, known as JobsNow in San Francisco, is a piece of the stimulus program Congress passed earlier this year. Mayor Gavin Newsom, who dropped out of the race for governor on Oct. 30, has been promoting the program aggressively, trying to burnish his credentials with the business community. And no wonder.
 The $26 million pot of federal money allows Mr. Newsom's administration to use public money to place people on private payrolls. Think of it as public-private patronage.
 Mr. Newsom insists he has nothing to do with the screening process. Yet just like Ms. Morales, the mayor is button-holing business owners every chance he gets to tell them about the program, and he hired a Democratic political operative to reach out to potential business clients. Mr. Newsom also plans to send letters about JobsNow to everyone who applies for unemployment benefits, and will also do a mass mailing to every family with a child in the San Francisco public schools.
 At a time when critics are questioning whether the stimulus is creating jobs, Mr. Newsom cites 803 San Francisco residents who are working in jobs that probably would not exist without the program. 
 ''These are real people getting real jobs,'' he said in an interview.
 Mr. Newsom's goal of creating 2,000 jobs with the money would put only a small dent in the more than 40,000 unemployed in the city. And the subsidies will end in September 2010. But for now he is praising the program as an unheralded success. He is almost giddy when he tells a reporter that there is no limit to the wages a company can pay a worker with the grants.
 ''The biggest issue we've had is the employers offering too little for the jobs,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''They said, 'We'll give you 10 bucks an hour.' We're saying, 'Why only 10 when we are taking care of the subsidy?' ''
 Scott Hauge, a San Francisco insurance broker who runs a group called Small Business California, said the program suffered from an impression that it was designed for low-skilled workers. Some employers, he said, could not find people qualified to do the jobs they needed to fill.
 ''There is a concern about the quality of the worker you are going to get,'' Mr. Hauge said. ''You can't pay me enough to hire a bad employee. Even if it is free, if you get a bad employee in a small company, it will really screw up the company.''
 Robert Miller, director of books for Internet Innovations, a nonprofit that digitizes books for the San Francisco library, described the program as ''phenomenal.'' Mr. Miller has hired 40 subsidized employees and hopes to get 100 more.
 ''It's a game-changer,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It's the best government interaction I've ever had.''
 That is generally how people feel when someone gives them money. But for a mayor whose relations with the business community have been less than stellar, it is praise that is priceless.

HEADLINE: Maybe a New Day For Doctors' Pay

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at Cornell University, is also co-director of the Paduano Seminar in Business Ethics at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 BODY:
EVEN without a robust public option, any of the health care reform bills now under consideration would expand coverage greatly. But they would also start a competitive dynamic that would eliminate the fundamental conflict of interest that has made American health care so expensive. 
 The United States spends twice as much per capita on health care as many other nations, yet achieves inferior outcomes by such varied measures as life expectancy, preventable deaths from specific illnesses, and infant mortality. Much of the performance gap stems from the fact that many of the nation's 45 million uninsured fail to receive needed care. 
The spending gap stems largely from a conflict inherent in how American physicians are paid. Elsewhere, most doctors are salaried. But under most American health plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, doctors are reimbursed according to how many tests and procedures they perform. 
 Most doctors undoubtedly recommend only those tests and procedures that they sincerely believe to be in their patients' best interests. Yet those interests are seldom completely clear. And when doctors know that their incomes will be higher if they recommend additional procedures, many may tilt in that direction.
 Physicians, like everyone else, are also subject to herd behavior. If some doctors in a given city begin prescribing additional procedures, others may feel pressure to follow suit -- not just because patients expect it, but also to keep pace with colleagues' incomes. 
 In an article in The New Yorker, for example, Atul Gawande described an entrepreneurial medical subculture in McAllen, Tex., in which doctors prescribe roughly half again as many tests and procedures as those in otherwise similar Texas communities. McAllen, he argued, is where American health care is heading.
 Current reform bills do little to curtail such spending, and all include subsidies to help meet insurance mandates, which would shift substantial existing health spending onto the federal budget. So enacting one of these bills would intensify pressure to cut costs. 
 The good news is that Dr. Gawande also identifies at least some health plans, like that of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, that have sidestepped the incentive problem by putting doctors on salary and operating their own hospitals. Such plans, which provide superb care and high patient satisfaction at significantly lower cost than conventional fee-for-service plans, would become more attractive under the proposed legislation.
 But that raises a puzzling question: If the Mayo model is better and cheaper, why hasn't it swept the market like wildfire? 
 Part of the answer lies in the so-called adverse selection problem, a market failure that explains why so many Americans remain uninsured. When the decision to buy insurance is left to individuals, the young and healthy often opt out, thinking -- generally correctly -- that their premiums are likely to far exceed any reimbursement they will get.
 But that means that the remaining members of the insured pool, on average, are significantly less healthy, so premiums must rise further. This puts pressure on the healthiest remaining members to drop out, causing still further increases in premiums, and so on. 
 Adverse selection affects all models of health care delivery. The reform bills under discussion would eliminate the problem by requiring insurance companies to sell at roughly the same rates to all applicants and by requiring everyone to buy insurance. Accordingly, they would greatly expand the proportion of citizens who could obtain more efficient models of health care delivery. 
 But adverse selection can't explain why the Mayo model hasn't gained ground faster in the employer-provided health insurance market. That market doesn't suffer from adverse selection, because insurance is tax deductible only if insurers accept all employees on equal terms. 
 Dr. Gawande reports that Mayo has recently opened a clinic that serves employers in the high-cost Florida market. But given how bitterly businesses complain about rising health care costs, we might have expected much more movement.
 One explanation may be residual prejudice against the for-profit H.M.O. wave of the 1990s, which entailed a conflict of interest of a different sort. Patients paid a fixed annual fee, which meant that H.M.O.'s made more money each time they avoided prescribing a procedure. Because clinics like Mayo's are nonprofits, they may avoid this conflict. 
 ANOTHER factor militating against quick expansion of the Mayo model is that many current doctors chose their profession hoping to earn lucrative pay, which they might not be able to do in a nonprofit clinic. But across the economy, we see talented professionals whose career choices are driven by concerns far broader than pay. Many top graduates from elite law schools, for example, turn down lucrative positions in corporate law to work for public-interest groups paying a third as much. 
 Doctors who choose to work in nonprofit clinics seem to view their professions more as a calling than as a job. There is evidence that when medicine was less adversarial than it is now, American doctors were both happier and more respected, even though their incomes were much lower. Doctors elsewhere also remain satisfied and respected, though they are paid less than their American counterparts. 
 In time, medical schools will be able to attract plenty of talented people willing to accept positions under the Mayo model, where they would spend more time healing patients and less time fighting insurers. Any of the current health reform bills would help start this transition.

HEADLINE: Johnson Turns Chase Into a Stroll

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
Jimmie Johnson will probably make stock-car history this month by winning a fourth consecutive championship, but his coronation will culminate an anticlimactic Nascar Sprint Cup Series season. 
 Johnson has promised that he will race hard in the last three races, even though he does not need to push it.
 Johnson leads Mark Martin, the driver in second place, by 184 points going into Sunday's race at Texas Motor Speedway. If Martin wins the final three races and accumulates all 585 possible points, Johnson will need to finish 10th in each of those races to win an unprecedented fourth straight Cup points title. ''Finishing 10th isn't as easy as it sounds,'' Johnson said in a teleconference last Tuesday. 
 Johnson has made it look easy. He has 22 top-10 finishes in 33 races this year. He has finished in the top 10 in all seven Chase for the Sprint Cup races and has won three. He finished second in April at Texas Motor Speedway and fourth two weeks later at Phoenix, which hosts its second race of the season next weekend.
 Johnson has turned the Chase into a dud, spoiling several juicy story lines before they had a chance to develop. The 50-year-old Martin took a full-time ride this year with Hendrick Motorsports, Johnson's team, and won four races during the regular season to enter the Chase with the points lead. Juan Pablo Montoya, the 2000 Indianapolis 500 winner and a former Formula One driver, was in contention until Johnson stormed to a commanding points lead with back-to-back wins in mid-October.
 ''I was one of those like many others from the outside looking in, looking at Jimmie Johnson making it look easy, thinking he was a lucky guy that drove for a great race team,'' Martin said Friday at a news conference in Fort Worth. ''I'm taking that back now. I've seen different, and I'm one of the guys that is standing up saying, 'Hey, he's not getting enough credit.' '' 
 Martin has won only once in the last 15 races and has not won two races in a row this season, let alone three. It is possible, even probable, that Johnson will carry an insurmountable lead -- 161 points or more -- into the final race of the season Nov. 21 in Homestead, Fla. That has not happened in the six-year history of the Chase. 
 Johnson's margin of victory will probably be the largest since the Chase was devised in 2004 to make the end of the season more interesting. Johnson won the last three titles by 56, 77 and 69 points; no driver has won the title by 100 points or more. 
 Johnson has been virtually untouchable. His crew chief, Chad Knaus, has given him fast cars and has made shrewd pit calls. 
 Last Sunday at Talladega, Knaus told Johnson to make a quick pit stop for gas after Ryan Newman was involved in an accident that stopped the race for 13 minutes.
 Johnson, who had been content to run in the middle of the pack for most of an otherwise dull afternoon, passed more than 15 cars when the race was restarted. 
 He finished sixth at a track that is far from his strongest and gained 66 points on Martin, who flipped across the track at the end of the race, finishing 28th.
 ''I'm really just treating these races as if they were other races,'' Johnson said Tuesday. ''I know it sounds stupid and corny and almost predictable, but it's the truth. I mean, the way we have prepared to this point has led to the points lead that we have and the race wins that we've accumulated over the year, and we need to do more of the same.''
 Johnson, pleasant and hardly controversial, often sounds like another Californian born in 1975 who came to dominate another sport: Tiger Woods. Johnson demands a lot of himself, but he has continued to surpass his own expectations.
 Nascar, hit hard by the recession, does not seem to need a history-maker as much as it needs tight packs of fast cars to sell the sport. Last Sunday's race at Talladega drew an estimated 127,500 fans -- 14,500 fewer than in April and 17,500 fewer than for the fall race in 2008.
 The fans who came were incensed by the single-file parade for most of the afternoon. Nascar's president, Mike Helton, had told the drivers to refrain from bump drafting, an aggressive tactic that can help cars at Talladega, where restrictor plates are mandated to slow the cars down and spectacular crashes have become the norm.
 ''Everybody was minding their manners and being responsible up until we could see the checkered flag essentially, and that's when things started to get crazy and we crashed,'' Johnson said. 
 But Johnson avoided trouble, once again. He is ruffling the intent of the refined points system, which is supposed to keep the Chase close until the last race. 
 The 12 drivers who qualify for the Chase start with 5,000 points, and each is given 10 bonus points for each race he had won entering the Chase. Johnson has never failed to qualify for a Chase and has never finished lower than fifth in six previous seasons as a driver. 
 Besides leading in points, Johnson has won more races (6) and more money ($6,725,006) this year than any other driver. 
 Nascar could come up with yet another way to level the playing field -- it always does. Until then, Johnson remains far enough ahead of the pack that he does not need to stamp the gas pedal, even though he said he would.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with an article about the late-season leader for the Nascar Sprint Cup Series points title misspelled, in some copies, the given name of the driver aiming for his fourth consecutive title and misstated the driver's final position in the 2005 standings. He is Jimmie Johnson, not Jimmy, and he finished fifth, not second. The chart also misstated, in some editions, Johnson's points total in 2009, with three races remaining. It was 6,248 -- not 6,284. 

GRAPHIC: CHART: Always at or Near the Top: Since Nascar installed its 10-race Cup playoff format in 2004, Jimmie Johnson has been at or near the top of the final standings. He is poised to win his fourth straight points championship.

HEADLINE: The Decline and Fall Of the Bachelor Pad

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
BACHELORS always seemed to have it made. With only themselves to support, they could flash their cash and trick out their apartments in such a way that James Bond himself would feel at home shaking himself a martini in their ultra-cool, chick-magnet pads. 
 Then the recession thundered in, and suddenly young men found themselves one of the hardest hit demographic segments. 
 In 2008, the unemployment rate for men ages 20 to 34 in New York State was 7.4 percent. The countrywide average was 7.7 percent, while the state average for women in the same age range was 6.1 percent, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Numbers for 2009 are not yet available.)
 Bachelors have been walloped, but many are taking their lumps and moving on. 
 Until a year ago, Jason Brooks, 36, a host of the short-lived MTV show ''Trailer Fabulous,'' a solo artist and the singer in a band called Rehab, paid $5,000 a month for a 2,000-square-foot TriBeCa loft that he shared with his wife. Before that, he paid $3,500 a month for an apartment in a doorman building in the Financial District. 
 Now, says Mr. Brooks, whose stage name is Brooks Buford, he pays $1,600 a month for a tiny studio in SoHo. 
 ''It's such a bizarre shift from where I was to where I am now,'' said Mr. Brooks, who is now divorced. ''I catch myself trying to make excuses for this place. Like before anyone comes up, I'm like, 'Yeah, it's like an airplane cabin.' ''
 Mr. Brooks, who says he lives off royalties from his past music career, also worked in information technology until he was laid off about a year ago. 
 In his old married apartment in the financial district, he said, two walls were devoted to shelves showcasing his vast sneaker collection. In his new single-again apartment, shared with a pug puppy called Brooks Junior, he needs a penlight to help him excavate footwear from the mountain of clothing jammed into his small closet -- though he says it's only one-eighth of what he owned in more prosperous times. 
 In still another past-life apartment, back in Atlanta, where Mr. Brooks is from, a grove of plastic trees surrounded his bed. In SoHo, he has a photomural of a forest stapled to the wall. 
 ''At first it was very uncomfortable,'' Mr. Brooks said of the scaled-down apartment. ''It's the fall that hurts. Once you adjust to it, it's a delusion that you think you need all this stuff. You don't know that you don't need it until you don't have it.'' 
 The small size of the apartment could affect his dating life, he said. ''It's definitely not as impressive, but I guess it depends on the woman, on how money conscious she is.'' 
 One prospective date asked if she could come over and cook for him, and Mr. Brooks told her he wasn't interested. In truth, he refused the offer because he has no table.
 ''There's barely enough room to hang out in the apartment,'' he said. ''I can't have parties. I could have people standing in the hall and take turns standing inside.''
 Anthony Lunn, a broker with Blackstone Properties of New York, has a listing for a $2,450-a-month for a ''luxury bachelor pad'' on Craigslist. The headline says it all: ''Pop out the bottle of Champagne and Grey Goose.'' 
 A year ago, apartments like this one might have gone to a single person; now, ''bachelors are doubling up and saving their money,'' Mr. Lunn said. 
 Aaron Seawood, a broker with Anchor Associates, says young men still desire apartments with the ''sexy factor,'' which he describes as any property that screams: ''Take a risk; do something different. You're not worried about school districts right now.'' 
 But these days, to afford these sexy-factor places, Mr. Seawood said, bachelors make concessions, either by sacrificing location or by ''tag teaming,'' as he calls subdividing a space. In previous years, for a $3,500-a-month one-bedroom, ''I would have had a few solo guys. Now it's like, 'Me and my buddy are going to be here,' '' he said.
 Joe Tandle, 32, came to New York from Rochester in 2001, seeking, he said, ''this sort of 'Sex and the City' lifestyle.'' To Mr. Tandle, that meant a two-bedroom condominium in a new building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for which he paid $3,300 a month. 
 When the computer training business he owns began to falter as the economy slowed last year, he decided to invest his money in buying an apartment, rather than renting. 
 But Mr. Tandle's choice of a 1,900-square-foot garden apartment in an older building on a decrepit block in Bushwick, Brooklyn, for which he paid about $500,000 last spring, is far from anywhere Carrie Bradshaw would set a Manolo. 
 ''You sort of get inundated with this American consumerism dream, and that's what I pushed for, and I worked for,'' he said. ''This beautiful place in the hip area and the hipster friends or whatever. And then, I guess, I realized that was not really what I wanted.''
 Mr. Tandle said he had found alternative ways to live the party-filled lifestyle. In place of costly leather sofas, he fills kiddie pools with piles of pillows for guests to snuggle in on his monthly movie nights. 
 Friends and neighbors pitched in to landscape his backyard, but ever the bachelor, once it is finished, he's planning to install a $6,000 hot tub. His apartment is not ''big and lush and grandiose,'' he said, ''but sometimes you want to have a ridiculous 150 people and a world-class D.J. in your basement.''
 And sometimes your crib is so far from a plush and inviting bachelor pad that you can use it as a way to vet women, as David Friedlander, 33, does with the extraordinary fun-house-like environs where he lives. If a date isn't turned off by the premises, it's a good sign.
 Mr. Friedlander bounced from apartment to apartment after he and his girlfriend split up eight months ago. He now pays $750 a month for a five-story ramshackle building in Brooklyn Heights that is packed to the rafters with antiques. He and a roommate rent the space from an eccentric collector.
 When he lived with his ex, Mr. Friedlander, a former caterer who now produces Lucid NYC, a series of parties with intellectual content, paid $1,900 a month for ''a conventional one-bedroom in Chelsea.'' 
 The break-up gave him plenty of time to think, and he has had a real-estate change of heart. ''I was buying into an idea of how I should be in my early 30s, sort of a mode of living that one is supposed to inhabit,'' he said. Now, ''I place a higher premium on living a rich life, rich with experience.'' 
 Leaving catering took a bite out of his income. So his new policy is subletting the first place he hears about that fits his budget, and staying there until the occupant of record returns. That means accepting what he calls ''serious quirks.'' Others might call them deal breakers. 
 When Mr. Friedlander entertains, he must first vacuum the blue velvet couch because of the constant rain of ceiling plaster. He sleeps fully clothed and wearing a hat because at night he can see his breath in the as-yet-unheated air. A chunk of wrought-iron railing retrieved from the flotsam pins the balcony door shut and, oh, there's no kitchen. He makes do with a toaster oven and washes his dishes in the bathtub. 
 For Mr. Friedlander, his surroundings are an exercise in mastering a sort of Zen, ''and not identifying with my apartment,'' he explained, ''being able to find peaceful existence no matter what kind of living situation.''
 In Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Urtzi Grau took another tack altogether -- rather than give in, he conquered the space with manly industry.
 Mr. Grau, 32, an architect originally from Bilbao, Spain, splits the $2,100-a-month rent on a 900-square-foot loft with a roommate. It is here that Mr. Grau showcases creations that he calls pods: two 8-by-6-foot boxes made of particle board, topped with Plexiglas and on wheels. 
 He and a former roommate originally built the pods to create private bedrooms in the wide-open loft space. 
 But because Mr. Grau is a partner in an architectural firm, Fake Industries Architectural Agonism, which he runs with his girlfriend, Cristina Goberna, 36, they were also design projects.
 Part of a series called ''Foreclosure Fantasy,'' the boxes represent ''opportunities we have found under such conditions: alternative forms of domesticity emerged from foreclosures,'' according to a descriptive leaflet.
 The pods won Mr. Grau and Ms. Goberna a coveted place in an exhibition organized by the Architectural League of New York.
 At a total construction cost of $500, and somewhat portable, the boxes also meet a key bachelor criterion: they're ''a tool for seduction,'' Mr. Grau said. The entire floor of the box is one giant bed. 
 If the high-style bachelor apartment was at its core intended as a lure for love interests, a move toward a more ascetic place might seem to clash with this goal. But some bachelors with pared-down pads disagree. 
 Mr. Brooks, the former MTV host, thinks the flashiness of a bachelor's apartment no longer matters.
 ''The great thing about a recession is that girls are not going to pass you up,'' he said, ''because every other guy they are meeting isn't doing that great either.''

HEADLINE: A Hybrid Stakes Out High Ground

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
FOR every smartly realized hybrid like the Toyota Prius or Ford Fusion, there has been one whose combination of price, economy and practicality doesn't quite add up. 
 Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota, was especially known for its free-lunch hybrid theory: that cars could become both speedy and stingy by combining robust electric motors with big V-6 and V-8 engines. But while Lexus's latest hybrids -- the RX 450h crossover and HS 250h sedan -- are finally delivering on their mileage promise, previous efforts fell short, especially the Lexus LS 600h L, the direct competitor to the new Mercedes-Benz S400. The big Lexus was saddled with a $30,000 hybrid price premium and a weighty battery pack that hogged trunk space.
 But nothing deserved more eye-rolling than ''mild hybrids'' like the now-defunct Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid, whose on-the-cheap hybrid systems also produced insignificant mileage gains. These neither-nor hybrids have been spurned by savvy consumers, who seemed to send a clear message: if you're not bringing big mileage to the party, don't bother coming at all. 
 The Mercedes-Benz S400 BlueHybrid neatly dodges those hybrid traps. First, the car doesn't fake it by trying to convince people that they can have a fat V-8 cake with mileage meringue and a cherry of virtue on top. 
 By downsizing the S550's gasoline engine by 36 percent -- a 3.5-liter V-6 replaces the usual 5.5-liter V-8 -- the Mercedes holds down costs and raises the mileage even before the hybrid equipment is added. And the 275-horsepower V-6, like the 4-cylinder in the Toyota Prius, uses the fuel-efficient Atkinson cycle, which squeezes maximum energy from each combustion cycle.
 To that, the S400 adds a 20-horse electric motor (for a total of 295 horsepower) and a lithium-ion battery. Indeed, Mercedes says this is the first car with a lithium-ion battery engineered expressly for an automobile. (The Tesla Roadster uses a cluster of 6,831 conventional laptop batteries). 
 Yes, the Mercedes is a mild hybrid. To save energy, its gas engine can stop and start automatically at speeds below 9 m.p.h., but it never accelerates on electricity alone. 
 But in conjunction with the smaller engine, the mild approach pays off. As huge and decadent as any S-Class -- the flagship Mercedes sedan -- the hybrid delivered a solid 29 m.p.g. on a highway run from Brooklyn to eastern Pennsylvania, a 7 m.p.g. improvement over the V-8 model. The S400 averaged 21 m.p.g. in the city, beating the conventional V-8 by about 5 m.p.g. That real-world mileage also topped the official federal rating of 19 m.p.g. in town and 26 on the highway.
 Could one of Mercedes's clean diesels do better, at least on the highway? Without a doubt: the 3-liter diesel in the E320 BlueTec sedan (a smaller car) managed 38 highway m.p.g. in my testing. But considering the Americans who would flip over a plush S-Class with a hybrid halo -- Laurie David, your car is ready -- you can imagine how quickly Mercedes decided to take the hybrid route for its flagship. Arrive at a charity benefit in a diesel S-Class, and the last Cristal will be poured before you're done explaining yourself. 
 The S400's power-dense 144-volt lithium battery is barely larger than a conventional 12-volt lead-acid battery, so it fits neatly under the hood without stealing trunk or cabin space. And while full hybrids add hundreds of pounds to conventional models, the S400 -- whose entire hybrid module weighs 165 pounds -- tips the scales at 4,474 pounds, just 19 more than the S550. In contrast, the Lexus LS 600h L hybrid weighs 5,049 pounds, a big reason for the disappointing 21 highway m.p.g. that I got on a 2007 road test. 
 The final advantage is price: the S400 actually costs $3,650 less than the S550 V-8 model: $88,825 instead of $92,475. Buyers can toss out the hybrid calculators that figure how many years they'll have to drive before the fuel savings offset the hybrid premium. (The S400 also qualifies for a $1,150 federal alternative vehicle rebate.)
 Even with the helpful nudge from the electric motor sandwiched between the engine and 7-speed transmission -- the motor cranks up 118 pound-feet of torque -- the S400 is noticeably slower off the line than the V-8 version. Mercedes cites 7.2 seconds from a stop to 60 m.p.h., compared with 5.6 seconds for the S550. 
 That power deficit would bother me in, say, a BMW 7 Series that lives for speed. But I'm not looking to race anyone in an S-Class, unless I'm driving the wild child S63 AMG. And the hybrid system is well-suited to the S-Class's personality: Serene and traditional, the S-Class is a chamber-music salon on wheels. Once up to speed, I was content to listen to my iPod -- smartly controlled by the single-knob Comand system -- and let the world pass by.
 Relatively speaking, the S400 still has plenty of oomph to merge onto highways or glide past slow traffic. Top speed is limited to 130 m.p.h., just as it is with the S550.
 As with most hybrids, the regenerative brakes, which return energy to the battery, don't feel entirely linear and natural. The engine stop-start function is above average, but not seamless. As I crawled up to toll booths, for example, I felt a shudder in the cabin as the engine cycled on and off. 
 In most other respects, there's no discernible difference between the hybrid and gas-only S-Class. A few options aren't available on the hybrid, including adaptive cruise control, but none seem essential. 
 Mercedes will offer a second hybrid in December, a full-hybrid ML450 crossover with a nickel-metal-hydride battery pack. That vehicle will have the two-mode hybrid system Mercedes developed in a venture with General Motors and BMW. 
 There's one sure way to tell whether the S400 is the S-Class for you. Point it out of the dealership on a test drive and punch the gas. If you feel unfulfilled, turn around and ask for an S550. If the S550 doesn't cut it, the salesman will gladly show you the 12-cylinder S600 (with 510 horsepower); the S63 AMG (518 horsepower) or the hallucinatory $199,000 S65 AMG with a twin-turbocharged V-12 (604 horsepower).
 In each of those models, you'll go, spend and pump a lot faster. For those who would rather slow the pace without giving up their big Benz, the S400 is it. 
 INSIDE TRACK: Two green statements in one.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A review of the Mercedes-Benz S400 hybrid sedan last Sunday misstated a difference between that car and the conventional nonhybrid S550. Adaptive cruise control is offered on the S400, though two other features available on the S550 -- an active body-control suspension and Attention Assist, which sends a warning to drowsy drivers -- are not.

PERSON: Alice S. Rossi 

HEADLINE: Alice S. Rossi, Sociologist And Feminist Scholar, 87

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Alice S. Rossi, a noted sociologist and feminist scholar who was a founder of the National Organization for Women, died on Tuesday in Northampton, Mass. She was 87 and lived in Amherst, Mass.
 The cause was pneumonia, her son, Peter E. Rossi, said. 
 At her death, Professor Rossi was the Harriet Martineau professor of sociology emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, where she had taught from 1974 until her retirement in 1991. 
 In her scholarship, Professor Rossi explored the status of women in work, family and sexual life. An early public advocate of abortion rights, she was often quoted by the national news media on an array of women's issues. Her writings are widely credited with helping build the platform on which the women's movement of the 1960s and afterward was erected.
 Professor Rossi was best known for her studies of people's lives -- those of women in particular -- as they move from youth to age. She edited several books on the subject, including ''Gender and the Life Course'' (Aldine, 1985); ''Sexuality Across the Life Course'' (University of Chicago, 1994); and ''Caring and Doing for Others: Social Responsibility in the Domains of Family, Work and Community'' (University of Chicago, 2001).
 One of her most influential feminist articles was ''Equality Between the Sexes: An Immodest Proposal.'' First presented in 1963 at a meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, it was published the next year in the academy's journal Daedalus.
 In the article, Professor Rossi argued that for most women motherhood had become a full-time occupation, a state of affairs that hurt not only women but also the larger society in which they lived. For the well-being of both the women and the culture, she wrote, parity of the sexes is essential.
 Familiar today, Professor Rossi's argument was considered subversive at the time. As a result, she was called a monster, an unnatural woman and an unfit mother, as she recalled in interviews afterward. Her article can be found in the anthology ''Life Cycle and Achievement in America'' (Harper & Row, 1969), edited by Rose Laub Coser.
 In later work, also controversial, Professor Rossi argued that the cultural divide between men and women was not the product of socialization alone, as the prevailing view held, but was partly rooted in inborn biological differences between the sexes.
 Alice Emma Schaerr was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 24, 1922. She earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and, in 1957, a Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia. Her doctoral dissertation, ''Generational Differences in the Soviet Union,'' was published in book form by Arno Press in 1980.
 A past president of the American Sociological Association, Professor Rossi held appointments at Harvard, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins University and Goucher College before joining the Massachusetts faculty. With a group that included Betty Friedan, she founded NOW in 1966.
 Professor Rossi's first marriage ended in divorce; she married Peter H. Rossi in 1951. Mr. Rossi, also a prominent sociologist, died in 2006. Besides her son, Peter, an economist at the University of Chicago, Professor Rossi is survived by two daughters, Kristin Rossi of Keene, N.H., and Nina Rossi of Turners Falls, Mass.; and six grandchildren.
 Among her other books are ''The Feminist Papers: From Adams to de Beauvoir'' (Columbia University, 1973), which she edited; ''Of Human Bonding: Parent-Child Relations Across the Life Course'' (de Gruyter, 1990), which she wrote with her husband; and ''Seasons of a Woman's Life: A Self-Reflective Essay on Love and Work in Family, Profession, and Politics,'' published as a slender volume by the University of Massachusetts in 1983.

HEADLINE: Please Visit, but Don't Expect an Invitation

BYLINE: By HARLAN J. LEVY

DATELINE: HARTFORD 

 BODY:
 FOR $1, a smart shopper can get one Butterfinger candy bar, three cans of cat food or five Christmas cards. Now, Connecticut's tourism officials have to stretch a buck for statewide marketing campaigns -- over an entire year.
 After two years with a budget of $4.3 million a year, the state's Commission on Culture and Tourism has to make do this fiscal year with just $1 allocated by the legislature in September for statewide promotions. The agency will get another lonely dollar next year. 
 The $4.3 million budget paid for producing vacation guides and maps distributed throughout the nation, and for Connecticut's ''Closer Than You Think'' advertising campaign -- an effort aimed at professional women in the New York area with household incomes of $80,000 or more.
 But those ads -- one labeled ''Power Walk,'' showing a couple meandering through a meadow, another called ''Morning Rush,'' featuring children tubing down a river -- will no longer be on television. 
 ''There won't be any advertising,'' said Karen Senich, executive director of the Connecticut commission. ''Of course we're disappointed.'' 
 Randy Fiveash, the state's director of tourism, said that he was unaware of any other state making such a drastic cut in funds for its efforts to attract tourists. ''Even states with huge deficits, like Michigan and California, are plowing major dollars into tourism marketing,'' he said.
 While the lingering recession has state and local governments everywhere in slim-down mode, whether to cut tourism budgets can be a particularly tough call because they are inherently two-sided -- they cost money but they also bring money in: in Connecticut, spending by tourists is estimated at $14 billion.
 It is easy for politicians to give priority to, say, homeless services or education over tourism, but hotel and restaurant taxes can help pay for shelters and textbooks. And in setting these budgets, officials must keep one eye on rival destinations. A tourist who is lured to the North Fork of Long Island might be taking money from the pocket of entrepreneurs on the Jersey Shore. With this balancing act in mind, most governments have made more modest cuts. New York State allocated $13 million for tourism promotion this year, compared with $16 million last year, for instance. And Westchester's $700,000 tourism budget is down from $800,000 last year (75 percent is earmarked for promotion.) 
 And Connecticut is not entirely giving up on tourism, either. Mr. Fiveash will retain his office and staff of seven -- who are on a separate budget line -- and the state will continue to provide a total of $1.7 million annually to several local tourist districts. But that sum is far less than the $4.5 million that the districts received in the prior year, and they tend to promote specific regional attractions, like Dinosaur State Park in the center of the state, the casinos in the southeast corner and the Connecticut Wine Trail in the northwest. 
 The leaders of major Connecticut tourism sites, like the Mark Twain House in Hartford and the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, are worried by the disappearance of the statewide marketing funds. 
 ''If the state does not have resources to adequately promote Connecticut as a destination, we won't be a destination,'' said Jeffrey Nichols, executive director of the Twain House, which is counting on next year, its 175th anniversary, being a big one. ''People won't come.''
 State Representative John Geragosian, a Democrat from New Britain and co-chairman of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee, defended the $1 budget, given the recession and the state's continuing economic crisis. ''There were a lot of tough decisions we had to make,'' Mr. Geragosian said. ''There was no stone left unturned. There were cuts across the board.''
 Mr. Geragosian added that the tourism industry, including the state's large attractions, can pay for statewide promotion to compensate for the vanished funds. Nowadays, he noted, many vacation planners rely on the Internet rather than on television ads.
 ''I've never gone to New York City because of an 'I New York' commercial,'' Mr. Geragosian said. 
 Donald E. Williams Jr., a Democrat from the Town of Brooklyn and the president pro tem of the Senate, said that the statewide funds may be restored two years from now if the economy improves. 
 Sue Norrington-Davies, managing director of Discover New England, a regional tourism organization, called the $1 budget ''an error of judgment.''
 ''The legislature doesn't see that you need to invest in tourism to make it work,'' she said. 
 Mr. Fiveash, the tourism director, and others noted that tourism supports about 170,000 jobs statewide. ''They're not just hamburger-flipping jobs,'' Mr. Fiveash said. ''They're solid jobs, and the cut in marketing affects families.'' 
 The radical cutback has caught the attention of tourism officials across the border in New York, raising the specter of tourists forsaking Connecticut for more heavily marketed locales.
 ''You guys are falling off the map, and it makes our job easier,'' said Moke McGowan, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, speaking of his Connecticut counterparts. His private nonprofit group, the official Long Island tourism promotion agency, has a $2.6 million budget for 2010 -- $1.3 million of which is for marketing. 
 But the $1 budget is now a fact, and Connecticut's tourism industry is scrambling. ''We're not sitting back,'' said Mr. Nichols, the Twain House official. The site, which drew visitors from all 50 states and from 61 other countries last year, has recently hired a marketing firm -- the first time in memory it has done so. How much is it paying? ''It'll be more than a dollar,'' Mr. Nichols answered in a pointed reference to the state's promotion budget. Michael Price, executive director of the 141-year-old Goodspeed Opera House, has tentative plans for stepped-up promotions, too, including joint campaigns with local inns. ''We all know we have to bang the frying pan a little louder,'' he said. 
 And at Connecticut's tourism office, the staff plans to focus on improving the state's tourism Web site, www.ctvisit.com, and wait for the economy to pick up.
 ''We are going to try our darnedest not to fall off the map until the next legislative cycle comes along, so that hopefully this can be turned around,'' Ms. Senich said.
 And what will it spend its $1 on? It may be worth more than it seems. ''It's a place holder so it doesn't close out the line item in the state budget,'' Mr. Fiveash said. ''It's not a joke. It's serious business.''

HEADLINE: The Price to Pay for Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Supply-Side Ideas, Turned Upside Down'' (Economic View, Nov. 1), in which N. Gregory Mankiw said health care reform legislation now in Congress would raise the implicit marginal tax rates of many Americans: 
The word ''tax'' has become a goblin in our society, immediately eliciting responses like ''Enough, we can't bear any more!'' or ''High taxes kill initiative.''
 Isn't it time to ask instead how much personal income we would forgo to ensure that we no longer have to depend on bake sales to pay for little Johnny's life-saving treatment?
 Or how much less pay we would accept in order to travel over safe bridges -- or to have safe food, adequate housing and good education and parks?
 In other words, it's time to ask these questions: How much do low marginal tax rates affect the continued well-being of our society? And how does that society contribute to the personal pursuit of life, liberty and happiness -- and economic success? Marie Lowe
 Fonda, N.Y., Nov. 2
 To the Editor:
 The column related a story that Ronald Reagan, while in Hollywood, chose to limit his number of films because of the higher marginal tax rate he would have paid by making more of them. 
 But unlike highly paid actors, the struggling middle-income families of today often cannot afford to choose forgoing work, regardless of the tax rates involved.
 The column also doesn't mention that the rapid growth of health care costs already has the effect of a tax increase on consumers.

HEADLINE: The Recession's Over, but Not the Layoffs

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN. 
Peter S. Goodman is the author of ''Past Due: The End of Easy Money and the Renewal of the American Economy.''

 BODY:
The Great Recession is over -- not officially, but by popular acclaim -- and in this accepted fact we are invited to take comfort, even as the unemployment rate last week rose into double digits for the first time in a quarter-century.
 Experts have long assured us that economic life is governed by the business cycle, a repeating loop of downturn followed by expansion, as reliable as the seasons. In this context, worsening joblessness is like a punishing blizzard in April: Misery notwithstanding, the calendar promises spring. 
 But just as climate change has altered how we contemplate the seasons, some economists argue that the business cycle no longer operates as it once did, failing to replenish the jobs it destroys, and leaving our economy vulnerable to a potentially long-term shortage of work.
 The tools we use to assess the business cycle date back to the 1920s, when the economy looked much different. Manufacturing jobs have declined sharply as a percentage of overall employment, while services have emerged as the primary economic engine. Automation and globalization have supplied thrifty corporate managers with myriad ways to boost production without hiring.
 ''It's a change in the structure of the business cycle,'' argues Allen Sinai, chief global economist at the research firm Decision Economics, who has put together a panel to discuss the subject at a January meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta. ''There appears to be a new tendency to substitute against labor. It's permanent, as long as there are alternatives like outsourcing and robotics.''
 Certainly, those inclined to argue that commercial life has been remade are frequently chastened when -- as often happens -- the dusty old laws of economics reassert themselves. 
 During the technology boom of the 1990s, some hailed a New Economy that supposedly liberated us from the tyranny of the business cycle while explaining how companies that never earned a nickel could be worth more than established brands. When arithmetic returned, the New Economy became synonymous with silliness.
 This decade, as investors bid housing prices to levels that breached all connection to incomes, some economists argued that the booms and busts of real estate had been rendered inoperative by financial innovation. We know how that turned out.
 But the latest reassessment of the business cycle now has a couple of decades of data to consider. After recession gave way to expansion in March 1991, it took a year before hiring resumed in earnest -- a so-called jobless recovery. After the following recession ended in March 2001, two years passed before jobs grew. Many economists assume that the third straight jobless recovery has already begun, as nervous businesses -- worried about the lingering bite of the financial crisis and weak prospects -- continue to hold back on hiring.
 This is not how things are supposed to go, not according to our traditional view of the business cycle. When the economy is growing, businesses hire aggressively as they increase production and sell more goods. As workers spend their paychecks, they distribute dollars throughout the economy, creating business opportunities that prompt other companies to hire -- a virtuous cycle. As growth slows, companies let people go, then hire anew when new opportunities emerge.
 Our unemployment insurance system is built for this kind of boom and bust cycle, giving furloughed workers some cash to tide them over until their companies call them back.
 But as Mr. Sinai and his colleagues see things, our view of the business cycle is antiquated. They say it fails to account for the critical role of finance and changing appetites for risk that can influence economic growth; that, crucially, it dates to a time when manufacturing employed roughly one-third of the American workforce, well before what we now call the global economy. 
 In the middle of the last century, a retailer in Chicago who needed goods likely had to place an order with a factory in the Midwest. Today, that retailer could well be part of a conglomerate that taps a global supply chain; it sends its orders to workers in China and elsewhere, or to domestic factories that can increase production without hiring many more people, either by further automating or by bringing in temporary workers.
 Of course, automation can itself create extra factory jobs for American firms that make robotics, and these companies increasingly export their gear to the same factories in China that produce goods now landing on shelves in Chicago. Yet the overall trend appears to make many American companies less inclined to hire, reluctant to take on cost in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
 Not everyone buys into this view. Labor-oriented economists like Lawrence Mishel at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington argue that the business cycle works the same as it always did; the problem is that economic growth has been weak in recent times.
 ''When growth comes back,'' Mr. Mishel said, ''so will jobs.''
 Others suggest that the business cycle has not changed, but rather that we have developed unrealistic assumptions about the bounty that should accrue in good times. In this view, our expectations have been perverted by an unhealthy reliance on credit in recent years. 
 Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and co-author of a history of financial crises, ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,'' recalls that when he was a graduate student, most economists viewed the normal level of unemployment to be about 7 percent. 
 But over the last decade, as the Federal Reserve relied upon excessively low interest rates to spur economic activity, the norm slipped steadily lower, with some proclaiming that unemployment had effectively been tamed and could remain permanently in the vicinity of 5 percent.
 As Mr. Rogoff portrays it, what may seem like weak hiring in recent times is really just a return to normal. Eventually, after the lingering dysfunction of the financial crisis gives way to a more healthy flow of money, enabling more businesses to borrow and expand, unemployment will settle in to a long-term average of about 6 percent, he says.
 In other words, recession still turns to expansion, much as spring follows winter, but the warm months may not be as bountiful as in years past, when easy money fertilized outlandish crop production.
 In any event, we'd best get ready for leaner harvests.

HEADLINE: Inside the Global Gold Frenzy

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: MENDRISIO, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 HERE, in a corner of Switzerland where Italian is spoken and roughly one-third of the world's gold is refined into bars and ingots, business is booming. Every day, bangles, bracelets and necklaces arrive in plastic bags -- from souks in the Middle East, from pawn shops in Asia and from corner jewelers in Europe and North America.
 ''It could be your grandmother's gold or the gift of an ex-boyfriend,'' said Erhard Oberli, the chief executive of Argor-Heraeus, a major refiner here that processes roughly 400 tons of gold a year. ''Gold doesn't disappear.''
 Amid a global frenzy fed by multibillion-dollar hedge funds, wealthy speculators and governments all rushing to stock up on the precious yellow metal, the price of gold briefly surpassed $1,100 an ounce on Friday, a record high. 
 Long considered the ultimate refuge for nervous investors, gold has climbed as the dollar has steadily weakened, budget deficits have expanded in the United States and Europe, and central banks have continued to pump trillions of dollars into weak economies, creating fears of another asset bubble that will ultimately pop.
 ''It's not that gold has changed, but gold buyers have changed,'' said Suki Cooper, a precious-metals strategist for Barclays Capital. ''It's a structural shift we're seeing on the investing side, from Asian central banks right down to individual investors buying ingots and coins.''
 ''Gold's appeal has broadened,'' added Ms. Cooper, who predicts that it will hit $1,140 an ounce by the second quarter of next year. 
 Indeed, last month, Harrods, the 160-year-old London department store, began selling coins as well as gold bullion ranging from tiny 1-gram ingots to the hefty, 12.5-kilogram, 400-Troy-ounce bricks that are so often featured in movies and stocked inside the vaults of Fort Knox. Harrods's lower ground floor, where the gold is peddled, has been packed with interested shoppers.
 ''The response has been astounding,'' said Chris Hall, head of Harrods Gold Bullion. ''Bars are definitely more popular than coins. The 100-gram is the most popular.''
 IN the United States, ads promising high prices for gold are regular fodder for late-night television spots, while buyers are setting up tables at shopping malls or hosting gold-buying gatherings at private homes -- like recession-era Tupperware parties.
 ''Everyone and their grandmother has a sign out saying, 'We buy gold,' '' said Ron Lieberman, the owner of Palisade Jewelers in Englewood, N.J. He estimates that 10 times as many people come into his store to sell gold now as when the metal was selling for $300 an ounce at the beginning of the decade. ''I hear people come in and say gold is going to $2,000.''
 Jewelry store shoppers aren't the only ones forecasting lofty prices. Jim Rogers, an investor who has made his name investing overseas and in commodities, predicted to Bloomberg Television last week that gold might reach $2,000 an ounce -- prompting a rebuke from Nouriel Roubini, an economist who gained attention for his early warnings about the global economic crisis. At a conference in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Roubini described Mr. Rogers's forecast as ''utter nonsense,'' saying that there aren't any inflationary or economic pressures that would drive the price of gold to $2,000 an ounce.
 Even the most bullish of gold lovers were surprised last week when the Reserve Bank of India stepped in and bought 220 tons of gold from the International Monetary Fund for $6.7 billion, a sign that other central banks might move away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds in favor of the precious metal. India's huge purchase means that gold will now account for about 6 percent of India's $285.5 billion of foreign exchange reserves -- up from the previous level of about 4 percent.
 ''We have money to buy gold,'' said Pranab Mukherjee, India's finance minister. ''We have enough foreign exchange reserves.'' 
 On Thursday, Sri Lanka's central bank disclosed that it, too, was buying gold, in a trend that could hurt the United States over time because it needs foreign bond buyers, especially central banks, to finance its growing debt. Gold closed at $1,095.10 an ounce on Friday, down from its intraday high but up nearly 5 percent for the week.
 Adjusting for inflation, gold would have to top $1,885 to set an all-time record.
 China has already doubled its gold reserves over the last six years, but the Indian move underscored how even the most traditional investors are shifting a portion of their assets into bullion.
 ''I have never been a gold bug,'' Paul Tudor Jones, the prominent hedge fund manager, told his investors last month. ''It is just an asset that, like everything else in life, has its time and place. And now is that time.''
 Over all, in the second quarter of 2009, consumption of gold for jewelry plunged 20 percent, while investor demand for gold increased 51 percent, according to the World Gold Council.
 THE Harrods gold line is made by PAMP, a rival Swiss refiner down the road here from Argor-Heraeus, in the nearby town of Castel San Pietro. And demand for bars weighing 100 ounces or less for individual investors is up 80 percent, said Marwan Shakarchi, the chairman of MKS Finance, a Geneva company that owns PAMP.
 Inflows of old gold jewelry and individual investor sales are especially strong in the United States and Western Europe, a new phenomenon for MKS, Mr. Shakarchi said. In the past, hoarding gold as an investment was much more popular in the Middle East and Asia. ''Europe and the United States are our emerging markets,'' Mr. Shakarchi said.
 In addition to high anxiety about the future, recent political trends may also be playing a part in the global gold fever. With a crackdown on tax havens worldwide and Swiss bankers handing over the names of wealthy American clients to authorities, some experts say rich people now prefer an investment that can easily be hidden from the prying eyes of tax collectors. 
 ''In Europe, people want physical gold to store themselves, with no documents,'' said Bernhard Schnellmann, director for precious-metal services at Argor-Heraeus. Often, the company doesn't know the ultimate destination of the bars it makes, only the identity of the bank in Zurich or London that is handling the order.
 The region surrounding Mendrisio has dominated gold refining for decades, profiting from its close proximity to northern Italy -- which has a long tradition of jewelry-making and cheap labor -- as well as from Switzerland's own reputation for financial stability and discretion. The Swiss government has also nurtured the business, guaranteeing gold assays for purity and carefully regulating the industry.
 One of the 100-gram bars that is produced here just about fits in the palm of your hand, with a satisfying metallic coldness that belies its $3,500 price tag. The standard 12.5-kilo, 400-ounce brick, on the other hand, is a monster, straining the wrist as well as the imagination: just one of these thick bars commands a higher price than a studio apartment in Manhattan. 
 Although India is now a far bigger consumer than Italy of gold for jewelry, the region around here has retained its distinctive status as the gold workshop of the world, with ore arriving from South Africa along with the old bracelets and necklaces destined for the crucible. 
 ''If you give somebody a ton of gold, you don't have to worry about it in Switzerland,'' said Mr. Oberli, the Argor-Heraeus chief executive. Efficiency, another Swiss virtue, and speed are of the essence in the gold business, because prices change quickly and buyer and seller want to lock in their order quickly, Mr. Oberli explained.
 ''Everything that comes in has to go out,'' he said. ''It's not our material.''
 Perhaps as a result, the gold-refining fraternity is secretive, with verbal discretion as much a part of the culture as the high concrete walls that surround Argor-Heraeus and the metal detectors workers pass through when they go home for the day. 
 ''Everybody is afraid someone else is chasing their customers,'' said Mr. Oberli. ''The banks don't want us to know.''
 Mr. Oberli is wary of walk-in clients and accepts orders from mines only when he can vouch for the origin of the ore, fearing ''conflict gold'' from rebel-held areas in Africa and elsewhere. 
 ARGOR-HERAEUS makes sure that even the tiniest amount of the precious metal doesn't disappear during refining. Gold dust from the soles of workers' and visitors' shoes is scooped up on special mats when they leave. And, annually, the overalls that employees wear during manufacturing are burned to recover the smallest fleck.
 At the airport in Zurich, where there are special vaults to hold gold, shipments of jewelry arrive daily on early morning flights before making their way here via a twisty, three-hour journey through the mountains on tightly guarded trucks. After the jewelry is unloaded, gold ingots, bars and other forms of bullion -- already stacked like cordwood along the sooty corridors of Argor-Heraeus -- are sent back to Zurich in the same trucks.
 ''The truck never drives back empty,'' said Mr. Oberli. ''Time is so important because the value of the material is so high.''
 Mr. Oberli is also confident that he is running a business that, even in the middle of one of the worst economic downturns of the last century, is relatively recession-proof and always of interest to investors. 
 ''Gold has been around as an investment for 6,000 years,'' Mr. Oberli said. ''When there is no alternative, it's there.''

HEADLINE: Lawyer Cites Mental Illness in Shooting

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Amy Green contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla. 

 BODY:
The lawyer for the man accused of shooting six people, one fatally, at an Orlando office building on Friday told reporters after a court appearance on Saturday that his client was ''very, very mentally ill.'' 
 ''This guy is a compilation of the front page of the entire year -- unemployment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, divorce, all of the stresses,'' said the lawyer, Robert Wesley, a public defender assigned to represent the suspect, Jason Rodriguez. ''He has been declining in mental health.'' 
 Mr. Rodriguez, 40, who was apparently unemployed, was fired in 2007 from an entry-level job at Reynolds, Smith & Hills, the engineering company where the shooting took place. A company spokesman said Mr. Rodriguez had been fired because his work had not been up to the company's standards. 
 ''He had been given notice all year that performance was substandard,'' said the spokesman, Michael T. Bernos. After that, Mr. Rodriguez had difficulty keeping a job and filed for bankruptcy in May, claiming assets worth less than $5,000, including a Nissan Xterra that did not run. 
 Mr. Rodriguez is being held without bail on suicide watch in the Orange County Jail. He appeared in court wearing handcuffs and a protective vest. 
 Mr. Rodriguez is accused of entering the offices of the engineering firm and opening fire, killing Otis Beckford, 26, the father of a 7-month-old, near the reception desk. He then went into the common work area, the police said, and opened fire, wounding five people, who were listed in stable or good condition. Hours later, he was arrested at his mother's apartment.
 According to an arrest affidavit, Mr. Rodriguez told the police, ''I'm just going through a tough time right now, I'm sorry.'' When asked by a reporter why he had opened fire, he replied, ''They know why I did it; they left me to rot,'' according to the affidavit. 
 Mr. Rodriguez had quit his most recent job, at a Subway sandwich shop, the affidavit said, because he was not getting enough hours, and he had filed for unemployment. He believed that the engineering firm was somehow blocking his application for benefits, the affidavit said.
 Mr. Rodriguez periodically took medication for what his former mother-in-law, America Holloway, said was schizophrenia. When he was not taking the medication, Ms. Holloway said, he was unbearable to live with -- angry, jealous, paranoid and controlling.
 Once, Ms. Holloway said, her daughter had appeared at the front door covered in bruises. She moved home, but a few weeks later Mr. Rodriguez apologized and said he was taking anger management classes. Her daughter took him back.
 The couple then lived with her for five years, Ms. Holloway said, before she finally threw him out and the couple divorced in 2006. They have an 8-year-old son.
 ''I'd be standing in the kitchen, he would come from the back room and say, 'I know you're talking about me.' I would say, 'There's nobody here,' '' Ms. Holloway said. ''When he had his medicine, he was the most wonderful person.''
 Ms. Holloway said that before the couple married Mr. Rodriguez had decided to join the armed forces, but that he changed his mind because he did not want to have to say ''Yes, sir'' and ''No, sir'' to anyone. At the same time, he often believed that co-workers were spreading rumors about him or trying to get him fired. ''He felt superiority and inferiority at the same time,'' she said. 
 Ms. Holloway said she believed that Mr. Rodriguez, in a downward spiral, had not been able to afford treatment. About six months ago, she said, he left his car and keys behind and walked to a mental health facility, where he stayed for a few weeks before being discharged, she said. 
 There were other indications that Mr. Rodriguez had received mental health treatment. 
 The Orlando Sentinel reported that in 2007, Mr. Rodriguez attacked a nurse's aide while he was at a hospital for a mental health evaluation. 
 ''He was laying down in the bed, said he was going in the bathroom, and I was watching him to make sure he was O.K. going there,'' the aide, Denise Exume, said in a telephone interview on Friday. ''And suddenly he just pushed me and ran outside the room.'' 
 The Sentinel reported that after that incident, a recommendation for Mr. Rodriguez's arrest on a charge of battery was sent to the Orange-Osceola state attorney's office, but there is no record of criminal charges. Law enforcement officials said they did not know what had led to the hospital evaluation. 
 Ms. Holloway said she believed that Mr. Rodriguez's father was also mentally ill. Over time, Mr. Rodriguez's child support payments had dwindled from $365, the amount he was supposed to pay, to $200, to $140, to nothing. 
 Ms. Holloway said her grandson had called his father about a week ago and begged to see him. He replied, as Ms. Holloway recalled: ''No, honey. I cannot see you. I don't have money, I don't have anything to eat, and when things get better, I will see you. You know I love you.''

HEADLINE: Follow the Money, and the History

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
For bankers and brokers, Wall Street is not so much a place as perhaps a dream (or, last year, a nightmare): a churning pool of risk, debt, credit, and information that is best realized in the physical world as the blinking screen of a Bloomberg terminal. But for ordinary New Yorkers, Wall Street is a neighborhood, a neck of the city's woods that more or less runs from ground zero to Battery Park. There, one finds the aorta of the nation's financial heart, of course, but also shops and cafes and bits of history. 
 9:15 A.M. Take the No. 1 train to Rector Street and walk a few blocks uptown to Brooks Brothers, above, 1 Liberty Plaza, (212) 267-2400, since you don't want to wander through a jungle of money without the proper gear. Pick up a crisp white-collared shirt ($79.50), a clubby rep tie ($75), perhaps some khaki chinos ($79.50) or even a pair of stomp-on-the-Socialist loafers ($598). 
 10 A.M. Dressed and ready, head south on Broadway for a couple of blocks to Trinity Church, 74 Trinity Place, (212) 602-0800, which offers a regular schedule of concerts, as well as a small, historic cemetery. Close to the cemetery's southern gate is a monument above the grave of Alexander Hamilton, right, the nation's first Treasury secretary and the man who brought us wonders like the national debt. Nearby is the resting place of Robert Fulton, who made a fortune running steamboats on the Hudson River between New York and Albany.
 10:15 A.M. Heading east on Wall Street, you will pass the Bank of New York on your right and, a little farther, at Wall and Broad Streets, the New York Stock Exchange, top, which you cannot enter these days because of security concerns. Walk instead to the Deutsche Bank building, at 60 Wall Street, which is as close as you can get to the site of the Buttonwood Agreement, the pact that led to the exchange; it was signed in 1792 by 24 stockbrokers underneath a buttonwood tree.
 11 A.M. Before the Fed's expansionary policies reduced the value of a dollar to that of, say, your toothbrush, the nation's currency was backed by gold. This allowed both the control of inflation and the creation of really big reserves of gold bullion at places like Fort Knox and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, 33 Liberty Street, (212) 720-5000. You can tour the gold vault, which is 80 feet beneath the street and is said to contain as much as 5,000 metric tons of gold. Closed weekends; make reservations in advance.
 1 P.M. Having looked at hundreds of billions of dollars in gold, you'll probably be ready to eat. Classically speaking, the only place to lunch on Wall Street -- unless you're a junior trader, in which case the halal food carts on Nassau Street in front of the Chase building will be fine -- is Harry's Cafe, below, 1 Hanover Square, (212) 785-9200. Do what the men with the mid-October suntans do: eat sandwiches. There is a lobster roll ($19.50), a fat-looking steak-and-cheese sandwich ($16.50) and a more than passable sirloin burger ($13.50).
 2:30 P.M. What you really need, however, is a bit of perspective, and that is to be found at the Museum of American Finance, 48 Wall Street, (212) 908-4110. There you can find exhibits on the history of money (a 60-pound gold bar, counterfeit notes), the financial markets in America (vintage bond coupons, an old ticker machine) and the women of Wall Street (the desk of Isabel Benham, a financial analyst and female Wall Street pioneer.) Most impressive, though, is the museum's timeline tracking the progression of the credit crisis. It begins with the bursting of the American housing bubble in 2006. There is plenty of room left for the next crash.

HEADLINE: The Outside's Insider

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE. 
Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about the troubled daily newspapers in Philadelphia.

 BODY:
 I.
 At sunset on a September evening, Dick Armey, the former House majority leader, strode to a lectern set up in the parking lot of a Harley-Davidson dealership in Hickory, N.C., where about 300 people had gathered to hear him speak. He was dressed less like a Washington power player and more like someone intending to clear brush. Armey, who is 69, wore black jeans, a red Western-cut long-sleeve shirt and a white cowboy hat. He removed the hat before he started and set it down in a visible spot, like a prop, right beside the microphone. 
 The crowd at the Harley dealership, the last of three stops in North Carolina that I made with Armey that day, included blue-collar workers, small-business owners, military retirees, a couple of teachers. Many were receiving benefits from Social Security and Medicare. From my conversations with them, though, it is fair to say that they were people who tend to distrust the hand of government and suspect that big initiatives from Washington will take something away from them, whether they have a little or a lot. Their way of thinking -- libertarian, anti-Washington, old-fashioned get-out-of-my-way-and-I'll-make-it-on-my-own American self-sufficiency -- is as old as the republic, and Armey, who grew up in a North Dakota pioneer town called Cando (pronounced can do), plays to it in every speech.
 ''Nobody has ever lived on this earth with the prosperity, the tranquillity, the safety, the security, the freedom and the peace that we Americans have enjoyed,'' he said that evening as a fading sun lighted the parking lot. ''Europe is governed by a concern for the well-being of the collective. That's what they care about. What makes us different is we begin with the liberty of the individual. We got it right, and they got it wrong.''
 Since retiring from the House in 2003, Armey, like legions of other former elected officials, has burrowed into Washington's establishment, never fully returning home to his 89 acres north of Dallas, his ''ranchette,'' as he calls it. For most of the last half-dozen years, he has worked in the lobbying shop of the giant law firm DLA Piper while also serving as chairman of FreedomWorks, a nonprofit organization that in 2008 paid him $550,000. For Armey, it is the early 1990s all over again -- the last time, as he put it to me, ''the Democrats had their hands on all the levers.'' Back then, as a Republican leader in the House and an ally of Newt Gingrich, Armey worked to defeat the Clinton administration's health care plan. Now, in his role with FreedomWorks, which helped stage a big march on Washington in mid-September, he is again at the center of the opposition.
 Armey and his organization have operated nimbly, seeding and supporting protests against policies of the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress while taking care not to be seen as controlling the dissent from on high. The march on Sept. 12 was largely organized by FreedomWorks, which secured the permits and opened the podium to a range of speakers -- including those from the like-minded but separate Tea Party movement. The stated purpose of the march was to ''defend'' liberty and reduce the size of the federal government. (According to an unofficial estimate by a city official, the march drew between 60,000 and 75,000 people; organizers claimed a much higher number.)
 FreedomWorks staff members have been studying the tactics of Saul Alinsky, the community organizer from Chicago whose thinking has influenced, among many others, Barack Obama. Adam Brandon, who accompanied Armey in North Carolina and is the press secretary for FreedomWorks, told me he was excited by the prospect of more direct action -- like that undertaken by antiwar demonstrators in the '60s or, more recently, anti-abortion and other social conservatives. Armey himself has been traveling the country in support of favored political candidates, not all of them running on the Republican line. In a special election in upstate New York, he backed a third-party candidate for Congress over a Republican whom he did not consider sufficiently conservative on economic matters.
 Defense -- stopping forward motion -- is Armey's preferred political mode. Back in 1994, during the last health care debate, he told The Washington Post: ''Health care happens to be the play they called. They're the offense. We're the defense.'' On his own terms, Armey is best measured by what he prevents rather than what he achieves, because his goal of small government often means blocking new initiatives.
 When I asked Mark McKinnon, a political strategist and former consultant to George W. Bush, how he would explain Armey's resurgence on the national stage, he replied: ''Armey and FreedomWorks have been the invisible hand behind much of the recent conservative activism around the country. Armey understands that while the Republican brand has been damaged, most people in this country still lean center-right. And he taps into the innate fear most Americans have about government activism and overreach.''
 II.
 Armey has a folksy way of delivering a hard-edged message. He likes to quote country-and-western lyrics. He extols the superiority of Texas barbecue, even while in North Carolina. On the road, he explains Washington from the perspective of a man who is somehow simultaneously an insider and an outsider, a sage steeped but no longer mired in the ways of the nation's capital. Armey's record includes one of the most notable bipartisan accomplishments in recent decades: legislation he shepherded in the late 1980s that led to the closing of dozens of obsolete and expensive military bases, just about every one of them dear to their surrounding communities and local representatives in Congress. But for him it is not the season for that kind of political coming together. He told the crowd that day in North Carolina, ''Nearly every important office in Washington, D.C., today is occupied by someone with an aggressive dislike for our heritage, our freedom, our history and our Constitution.''
 When Armey said that ''politics is like a dysfunctional marriage'' because ''every fight is really about something else,'' he could just as well have been talking about his own tactics. Armey and FreedomWorks will move on from opposing health care reform to fighting against the cap-and-trade approach to limiting greenhouse-gas emissions -- and from there to organizing opposition to any Democratic measure that, in his view, threatens to increase the size of the federal government, raise taxes or curb individual liberties. ''Right now we're still talking about health care,'' he said to me at one point. ''But pretty soon it's going to be about cap and trade, which is another big Democratic power play.''
 FreedomWorks also advocates a so-called flat income tax, free trade and personal Social Security retirement accounts whose investments would be controlled by workers. But more telling is what is not on its list of concerns -- abortion, gay marriage and other social issues. To some degree, Armey's new prominence signals the rise of economic conservatives in the Republican Party -- and a decline in influence of the religious right. ''Even in our office, we've got people on different sides of the abortion issue, on all the social issues,'' Brandon said. ''The point is we stay away from it. It's not what we do.''
 Sarah Bond, a leader of a Tea Party group in the San Diego area, told me much the same. A graphic artist and stay-at-home mother to two toddlers, she is focused primarily on health care, opposing climate-change legislation in California and a local water issue. ''A lot of people have been willing to shelve their social issues,'' she said. ''At least among the people I'm talking to, they understand we should unite around what brings us together -- fiscal responsibility and preventing us from heading down this road toward a more socialized culture.''
 Michael Franc, vice president for government relations at the Heritage Foundation, in Washington, told me that he believed recent events -- the severe economic downturn and measures to address it that have alarmed many -- have accelerated a shift that was already under way. ''In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, all the energy on the conservative side was on social issues,'' he said. ''You had outside-the-Beltway groups, principally the Christian Coalition, that came to Washington to be heard. Their troops cared mainly about social issues, but many had a corollary concern about tax relief for their families. But they have basically collapsed since the departure of Ralph Reed,'' the Christian Coalition leader who stepped down in 1997. ''He was a genius at what he did, and his abilities were not replaced. The Bush-Cheney campaigns in 2000 and 2004 went out and identified the social-conservative voters. But they didn't exist as the same organized, cohesive force. There was a vacuum, and Armey and some of these other economic conservative groups have filled it.''
 III.
 The first time I talked with Armey, at a Midtown restaurant one morning when he was in New York for a television appearance, I was struck by how estranged he feels from what had been the dominant wing of his party -- figures who themselves were social conservatives or who used social issues to energize a base of Republican voters. Armey told me he has had only a couple of conversations with Karl Rove, a fellow Texan and George W. Bush's longtime strategist. The first occurred as he was contemplating his first run for Congress -- in Armey's recollection, Rove told him not to bother -- and another, he recounted with evident relish, ''was when Rove came into town after Bush got elected president and paid a courtesy call on the majority leader, which was me.'' (Rove, through his office, said he did not recall ever meeting Armey before he was elected to Congress in 1984.)
 Armey calls himself a free-market Republican, and enthusiasm for him was always strongest in the party's libertarian-leaning branch, among what are sometimes called Goldwater Republicans. He is seen by some today as doing the bidding of his party, but he suspects that many who attend his rallies voted for the independent presidential candidate Ross Perot in 1992 and the Republican iconoclast Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries.
 A churchgoer and born-again Christian, Armey has nonetheless clashed with the religious right. He disagreed with Republicans' attempts to inject themselves into the Terri Schiavo case and said that Tom DeLay and other important Republicans who remained after he left ''got too wrapped up in social issues'' and turned off voters. At one point, he referred to them as ''those nitwits who took over after we left.''
 ''They jumped from the defensive side to the offensive side in the whole homosexual-marriage issue,'' Armey told me, explaining that, in his view, Republicans overreached by putting ballot measures forward to define marriage. ''When Republicans are fighting against the power of the state, we win. When we are trying to advance it, we lose.''
 Armey told me that he had doubts from the beginning about the Iraq war and now regards it as a mistake. He faults George W. Bush for ''siding too much with the social conservatives and forgetting all about fiscal discipline.'' He also has a more liberal view of immigration than many in his party. ''Reagan went to Berlin and said, 'Tear down this wall,' '' Armey said. ''We went to San Diego and said, 'Build a fence.' It was just stupid. You have Hispanics saying, 'I'm not going to vote for those guys because they don't like me.' ''
 For all his dissent over Republican policies (which he did not fully express when he occupied a leadership role in the House), Armey should not be perceived as a figure of political moderation. He can be deeply partisan, and some of his offhand comments over the years -- notably referring to Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman, as ''Barney Fag'' -- have angered Democrats.
 Armey's resurgence has occurred not because the Republican establishment loves him but rather because the debate has moved back to what he considers his turf. After high school, he worked a year for the local electric utility, stringing wire, then earned an undergraduate degree at Jamestown College, about 120 miles due south of Cando, and a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oklahoma. He spent the first part of his working life as a professor, rising to chairman of the economics department at North Texas State University. ''I'm an economist and, I don't mind telling you, a damn good one,'' he told me over breakfast. He added, ''President Obama is a talented person who showed up at exactly the right time, but I don't believe the man has ever been exposed to a serious economic idea, and I'm not sure anyone around him ever has, either.''
 I pointed out that Obama's circle of advisers includes some decorated economists, including Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard -- a controversial figure but not one generally regarded as an intellectual slacker. ''I don't consider Larry Summers a serious economist,'' Armey said. ''You can get a Ph.D. from Harvard without ever having seriously considered the subject.''
 IV.
 When he speaks in public, Armey does not use notes and can be discursive, veering into asides that sometimes befuddle his audiences, like when he drops the names of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and his other favorite economists as if they were the well-known head coaches of local college basketball teams. ''I've also read everything that Galbraith ever wrote, so I have the equivalent of a minor in sociology,'' he quipped to a crowd in a banquet hall in Clemmons, N.C., one stop on his tour. When no one laughed, he shrugged and added, ''I thought it was funnier than that.''
 What makes Armey an effective advocate is how he uses his status as a learned professor and a plain-spoken man to deliver the message his audiences want to believe: that various Democratic initiatives are not just wrongheaded policy but also flagrant violations of the Constitution and affronts to traditional American values. In his telling, the Constitution is elevated to something like a sacred religious text, written by Christian believers, possibly divinely inspired and intended to be read in the most literal way. It contains solutions to any civic problem faced by modern Americans, including those brought about by the tangled health care system. To Armey, the Constitution is not a ''living document'' -- a phrase he mocks at rallies, to laughs and great applause -- and is in fact so straightforward and speaks so directly to this era that it's reasonable to wonder why we need the nine justices of the Supreme Court to interpret it.
 At the Harley dealership, he emphasized that everyone must stay focused on the polestar, the nation's essential document. ''What should be your guide?'' he said, pausing for a beat before shouting out the answer. ''The Constitution. This ain't no thinkin' thing.''
 Armey prides himself on his intellect and rationality, but his years in Washington have taught him the political uses of irrationality and even outright fantasy. He told me he does not believe some of the most extreme charges that emerged in the debate over health care reform -- for example, that ''death panels'' will tell elderly people when it's time to die -- but he welcomes the energy and passion that such beliefs bring to his side. ''You know that expression: The enemy of my enemy is my friend?'' he asked. ''Are their fears exaggerated? Yeah, probably. But are Obama's promises exaggerated? I may think it's silly, but if people want to believe that,'' he said, referring to death panels, ''it's O.K. with me.''
 I wasn't always sure if Armey was being entirely serious or playing a role. He told me about a friend of his who is concerned about preserving clean rivers and streams. ''But he's not having a love affair with Mother Earth the way the lefties are,'' he hastened to add. ''He just wants to catch God's little fishes.''
 In one of our conversations about health care, Armey argued that tort reform would significantly cut costs because doctors, with less fear of huge malpractice judgments, would no longer order every possible test. I asked if it might not be patients who sometimes insisted on unneeded tests. As an example, I mentioned that I had recently suffered an athletic injury, a ruptured Achilles' tendon, and underwent surgery after my orthopedist examined me clinically and said he was sure of his diagnosis. I didn't ask for any further diagnostic exams, but I suspect that some patients, conditioned to accept the perceived scientific certainty of M.R.I.'s and other scans, would have insisted on more sophisticated measures. ''I'd have gotten the M.R.I.,'' Armey said. ''I'm a big shot, and doctors sure as hell don't want to be sued by a big shot. He would not even have dared ask. He would have just sent me for the test.''
 Later, in North Carolina, we sat down to dinner, and he said: ''You ever see that Danny DeVito movie, I think it was Danny DeVito, where he says big shots never order off the menu? They just say what they want.'' We were at an On the Border, a Tex-Mex restaurant chain and not the type of place I imagine many big shots patronize, but he pushed the menu aside without reading it and told the waiter what he wanted the kitchen to cook up for him.
 The following day consisted of the three stops -- rallies at the Harley dealership, the banquet hall and a barbecue joint. At each, Armey had a warm-up act, a somewhat bizarre one: Mason Weaver, a former San Diego radio personality and the author of the book ''It's O.K. to Leave the Plantation.'' Weaver, in a gray suit, crisp white shirt and red tie, was dressed more formally than Armey, and his delivery had more heat to it. For those who believe that American politics has gone around the bend, Weaver could plausibly serve as Exhibit A. Speaking in a former Confederate state to almost entirely white crowds, Weaver, who is black, repeatedly referred to government as ''master'' and warned his audience that America's first black president wants to enslave them. ''You've got to decide what kind of country you live in,'' he thundered at one stop. ''You've got to decide if you're free or you're a slave. . . . They want you to be tolerant. Are you kidding me? They have broken into your home, folks. They are robbing you of your money. They have taken away your freedom.''
 He went on to say: ''You see, slavery was a choice. The master didn't lock those slaves up at night. There was no ball and chain. They stayed because they thought like a slave.'' Mocking one of Obama's campaign themes, he added: ''We don't need hope and change. We are Americans. So therefore we are free. What the heck are we going to change to? Back to slavery?''
 I was sitting at a table in the crowd, among those who had paid $15 for a sandwich, chips and the chance to hear the speeches. Everyone laughed at Weaver's opening -- ''I know why you wanted me to speak today: you guys wanted to hear a black man speak for 10 minutes without a teleprompter'' -- and as far as I could tell, the rest of his remarks made perfect sense to them. I asked one woman seated at my table if she really thought Obama wanted to enslave Americans. ''I believe he is leading up to becoming president for life,'' Nancy Moore, whose husband is a retired military man, replied. Her friend, Lillian Sharpe, added, ''Look how quickly it's all happened.'' How quickly what's happened? I asked. ''Everything,'' she answered. ''The stimulus. The bailouts. Now this health plan.''
 At the first rally in the morning, Armey threw his right arm around Weaver before following him to the podium and said, ''Way to go, brother.'' As the day wore on, he seemed to grow a little weary of him, perhaps because Weaver's incendiary style was not an easy act to follow. When I told Armey that I found the remarks on slavery offensive and planned to ask Weaver about them when he joined us in the car, Armey seemed amused and encouraged me to engage Weaver. But that certainly wasn't something Armey was going to do. The content of Weaver's presentation, harebrained as it may have been, was working for Armey -- just like the people who believe in Obama's death panels work to his benefit.
 In response to Weaver, Armey seemed to raise the temperature on his own remarks. He picked up on one of Weaver's themes, the threat of impending violation. ''They intend to have their way with us,'' he said of the Democratic Congress and administration.
 V.
 Armey and his wife, Susan, have five adult children and 10 grandchildren. In Texas, he spends a lot of time in his den watching professional hockey -- a vestige of his upbringing on the Northern Plains -- and presides as a sort of gentleman rancher on a property, as he put it, ''with nine head of cattle that will never make it to a dinner table, because each one of them has been named by a grandchild.''
 Susan Armey, a retired family therapist, told me that she did not initially want her husband to run for Congress or, later, to seek the position of majority leader, with its added responsibility and workload. Their retirement has not been as quiet as she anticipated. ''But I've never been prouder of my husband,'' she said. ''He cares so deeply.''
 Armey thinks all the plans for health care reform are too expensive, too intrusive because they require people to buy insurance and just generally unnecessary in their scope and ambition. If there's a health care crisis in America, he views it as a minor one that can be addressed with free-market remedies like allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. ''We are a wealthy nation, and there is not much reason that I can justify for anybody who lives within our borders doing without essential health care, and I'm happy to tell you that very few people do,'' he said. ''If there's 15 percent who are in that category, then let's construct a 15 percent solution so they can have it. To me, that's a wonderfully generous act.''
 What about the millions of Americans, I asked, who have insurance but find that the rising premiums and deductibles are eating away at any financial gains they might otherwise make? ''The largest empirical problem we have in health care today is too many people are too overinsured,'' he said.
 When I last spoke to Armey about health care, in late October, he was resigned to the Democrats' passing a reform bill but said that he and his allies had succeeded in cutting it down to size. ''We've pretty well given them a TKO'' -- a technical knockout -- ''on their big package,'' he said. ''They couldn't do all that they wanted, but they always play for the long haul. They'll take half a loaf now and come back later for more.''
 If Armey's views seem disconnected from how many Americans experience health care, one reason could be that Armey himself has very little recent personal exposure to the system. Like many American men, he avoids doctors and said he has not seen one in many years. ''I've been very fortunate,very healthy,'' he said, ''so why change up what I've been doing?'' He equates medical care with unpleasantness. ''What happens to old folks, and I'm 69, is they get prodded and poked and picked on. They run a camera up your behind. If these things are medically necessary, I will adhere to them. But don't make me go through them for your comfort. Medicine is supposed to be for my safety, not yours.''
 For most of his career, Armey drew his salary and health benefits from the public sector, first as a professor at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) and then during his nearly two decades in Congress. When he left the House in 2003, he became a senior policy adviser and a lobbyist at DLA Piper, a job he left in late summer because his high profile in the health care debate was bringing unwanted attention to the firm. 
 FreedomWorks and a related organization, the FreedomWorks Foundation, emerged in 2003 from the splintering and merging of several conservative groups and took their names from Armey's longtime mantra ''freedom works.'' (The foundation's board includes Steve Forbes, the former presidential candidate and longtime flat-tax advocate.) The organizations raised about $7 million from donors in 2008, most of it in large donations -- including gifts of $1 million and $750,000. The organizations refuse to reveal the sources of their money. They have ''not received a dime'' from any health insurance or pharmaceutical interests, according to Brandon, but that is impossible to confirm because under I.R.S. rules, while the organizations must list donations of more than $5,000, they are not required to publicly disclose who made those bequests.
 As we drove between stops in North Carolina, I asked Armey if it bothered him that he fit the profile of the proverbial Washington fat cat -- the pol who steps down from office but stays around to cash in on his connections. ''The fact of the matter is when you walk out of Congress, if you've been effective and kept your nose clean, you have a market value in D.C. that you don't have anyplace else,'' he said. ''You're a free man on your own hoof, so why not make the best living you can for yourself?''
 As an economist, Armey is an adherent of public-choice theory, which emphasizes that public policy is driven by the self-interest of political decision makers. One of the field's leading scholars, James M. Buchanan, of George Mason University, a Nobel laureate in 1986, has described it as ''politics without romance.'' Armey told me: ''What public choice teaches is that despite their pretensions to altruism, politicians are just like the rest of us. They're all in business with themselves.''
 Armey has a natural geniality about him and is pleasant to spend time with. As he rode in the front passenger seat of an S.U.V. driven by Brandon, I sat in the back and addressed him as ''Professor Armey'' and said that as a student of sorts in his freshman seminar on public-choice theory, I was struggling with how to square his current role with one of the discipline's central tenets: If politicians primarily serve their own interests, shouldn't I assume his positions are determined by whatever he stands to gain?
 He said he had asked himself the same question and for a time even struggled to formulate an answer. Finally he concluded that his personal mission and his most deeply held beliefs were something like a perfect match with the collective wisdom of the founding fathers. ''My highest secular value is liberty and freedom,'' he said. So as he sees it, even when he is speaking up for himself, he is working for the common good.
 VI.
 At the Harley dealership, Armey told a story involving George Miller, a liberal California Democrat and the current chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. According to Armey, Miller said to him back in the early 1990s that Americans ''are going to get health care whether they want it or not.'' When Armey shared this anecdote with me a few days earlier, he said Miller had ''literally snarled at me and said, 'The American people are going to get it . . . because we've been waiting for 40 years to do this.' ''
 To Armey, this tale illustrates what he believes about Democrats -- that they don't really care about the people who are supposed to benefit from the social programs they create; they just want to increase the size of government and solidify their own power. ''The first and most pernicious goal of this whole health care push by the Democrats is their desire to control a major sector of the American economy,'' he said. ''Pure and simple, it's power. . . . The other motive, and the less pernicious, is we should all have an equal access to health care. It's the old romantic egalitarian motive that says we would live in a better world if everyone has an equal share of a smaller pie rather than a world with unequal distribution of a larger pie.''
 I called George Miller for his recollection of the exchange with Armey. He didn't remember it at all. ''Maybe there is something I'm completely missing here,'' he said, ''but I don't think that conversation took place. Ever.'' Armey's only goal, he said, ''is to get people worked up and to disrupt any real dialogue between the president and the American people. He enjoys the attention. He likes saying outrageous things. He likes being Peck's Bad Boy.''
 Miller did pay Armey a kind of backhanded compliment, however. ''I'm sure he's being paid to organize,'' he said. ''And he's doing a good job of it.''

HEADLINE: Gauging Progress Of U.S. Soccer

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, is an economics professor at Columbia University and one of the financial architects of Major League Soccer. He presides over a game that continues to grow and show promise in the United States on many levels, including the national team's berth in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. JACK BELL 
 Q.The United States has qualified for South Africa. Mission accomplished?
 A. There were some ups and downs, but on the whole, the team has progressed. We again qualified early, with a game to spare, at the top of the group. But it's unlikely we'll get a seeding.
 Q.Does a seeding mean anything?
 A. It's not just an ego issue. It affects who you play, if the ranking and performance in previous events mean something.
 Q. Have you read the book ''Soccernomics,'' in which the authors assert that three things -- population, national affluence and access to European soccer expertise -- will shift the balance of soccer power to the United States, India and China?
 A. I haven't seen the book, but it sounds like the overall hypothesis is that having a larger players base, a larger population and an affluent society gives you some natural advantages. In almost any meaningful competition, it would be hard to argue against. But it doesn't mean that India or China will be a power. I'm not saying that China and India won't be powers, but I don't know what that means. Twenty, 50, 100 years?
 Q. Does United States soccer have an inferiority complex?
 A. There is some of that for sure. Look, no one is claiming we're Brazil or Spain. No one claims that M.L.S. is the E.P.L. or La Liga. But we've made a lot of progress in building the league and a national-team fan base and culture. They are huge pluses.
 If we can replicate the growth of the last 25 years in the next 25, I'd do it in a heartbeat. There aren't many countries that have made advances in all ways: M.L.S. is 14 years old; the U.S. makes the largest TV rights payment for the World Cup; Americans are the No. 1 ticket buyers to the World Cup; the U.S. has more registered players; our women's team is unparalleled; and no one is taking the men's team for granted anymore, and we're in the mix to be seeded. No one would have thought those things 20 years ago. We're all impatient by nature. It's not fast enough for me.
 Q. What was your reaction when the FIFA president, Joseph S. Blatter, said M.L.S. needed to change its schedule to conform to the European calendar?
 A. I told him that Chicago is not London in January. Chicago is Moscow in January. You're not playing in Moscow in January. He also mentioned domed stadiums. I don't think that's going to happen, and we can't take six weeks off.

HEADLINE: Versailles or Kykuit?

BYLINE: By CHRIS HARCUM

 BODY:
''You have to spend money to make money'' goes the adage, but that has not been true this season at Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills. Attendance there has risen 4 percent this year over last, despite a 5 percent drop in spending on marketing. 
 Thom Thacker, the site director, noting that tourism is not usually recession-proof, speculates that the rise in attendance might be due to word of mouth, nice fall weather or the appeal of an economical staycation during times of recession. ''Should I go to Versailles or Kykuit? Kykuit is cheaper,'' Mr. Thacker said, imagining the reasoning of a budget-minded traveler.
 The increase in attendance is surprising, since Kykuit (a Dutch word meaning ''lookout'' and pronounced KYE-cut) cut back on promotion spending. 
 ''We achieved similar or more exposure for fewer dollars,'' said Rob Schweitzer, director of public relations for Historic Hudson Valley, a network of six historic sites that includes Kykuit. ''We spent more wisely, using new strategies and more online strategies.'' 
 This year's numbers are not complete, but about 32,000 people visited Kykuit last year. Mr. Schweitzer said that, historically, one-third come from Westchester, one-third from the New York region and one-third from elsewhere. 
 ''You want to get that sweet spot of people from within a few hundred miles from the site,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. He believes the online marketing was most effective in reaching that group.
 But, he said, the job is never done: ''We do have to keep awareness up.''

HEADLINE: Degree Required, But You Don't Have One

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: thesearch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOME job seekers harbor a secret that prevents them from applying for work they know they could do. Or they worry that if this fact comes to light in a job interview, it will explode and cause them to be led unceremoniously to the door.
 These are people who went to college but never got a degree. 
 People who have had ''some college'' are far from rare. After six years, more than 40 percent of those who started at a four-year institution have not finished, according to data from the Education Department.
 Some may have decided that college wasn't right for them; some will take longer than six years to finish. But for many others, life intervenes, said Jacqueline E. King, assistant vice president for policy analysis at the American Council on Education, which represents degree-granting institutions. They may have decided to start a family, or had to care for a sick relative, or took on more responsibility at work.
 Then more life happens, and as the years go by, that piece of paper with the calligraphy, gold seal and signatures of bigwigs becomes ever more elusive.
 Owning that paper may seem especially important when the unemployment rate is high. Many employers are now reflexively listing a bachelor's degree as a requirement; it's an easy way to help whittle down hundreds of applications into a manageable pile.
 Don't lie on your resume about having a bachelor's degree, but if you spent some time at college, write down ''bachelor's studies,'' with the name of the institution you attended, said Katy Piotrowski, a career counselor based in Fort Collins, Colo., and an author of career books. That could get you past the initial screening. 
 Still, if you respond to an online job posting that requires a bachelor's degree and you don't have one, you are much more likely to end up in the ''no'' pile. That's why it is especially important for those without degrees to rely on networking, Ms. Piotrowski said.
 If, through your connections, you can convince someone to give you an interview, you can show how your skills, qualities and experience make you right for a job -- and that whole degree business may well melt away.
 Ms. Piotrowski said that hiring managers should realize that employees who don't have degrees can be some of the hardest-working and most loyal, for the very reason that they feel themselves to be at a disadvantage in the job market. 
 Some people wear their lack of a degree as if it's a scarlet letter, she said. Just about the first words out of their mouths at an interview are, ''I don't have a B.A., but ... ,'' she said. 
 There's no need to mention that you don't have a degree unless you're asked, Ms. Piotrowski said. And remember that everyone has blips in their past. ''Put in perspective this small piece of the total picture and don't focus on it,'' she said.
 One of Ms. Piotrowski's clients, Michele McCreath, 46, has over two years of college but never got a degree, she said, having quit more than two decades ago to raise her two children. She started working again when her younger child was in third grade.
 Without a degree, she obtained her current job as a marketing director at a telecommunications business. But the company has told her that she will be part of a coming layoff, she said, and she will need to find a new job.
 ''Companies that have looked past not having the degree, and have seen the experience, have always been really pleased with my work,'' Ms. McCreath said. But in this economy, she knows that she has to pick up the phone and use her connections to find a way in the door. She is also working on completing professional certificates as a meeting planner and a trade show marketer. 
 At this stage in her life, Ms. McCreath said, earning such certificates is a realistic goal. She is open to the idea of finishing her degree, she said, but ''it's really hard to go to work full time and go to school full time and have a life.'' 
 But for some people, getting a degree may be more feasible. For some suggestions on how to get started, you might look at the Center for Lifelong Learning on the Web site of the American Council on Education. Check with your former college, with schools in your area or with online universities to find out about programs for adult learners, Ms. King of the council said. 
 MORE schools are reaching out to students who never finished degree requirements, creating flexible programs that can be particularly helpful to those who have just a few credits left, she said. If you are unemployed and unable to find new work, this could be an excellent time to go back to school. Money may be an issue, of course. But financial aid is available for nontraditional students, she said.
 If you have only a few credits to go, why let them dog you for the rest of your life? For some people, Ms. Piotrowski said, the hours spent worrying about not having a degree could be spent actually getting one. 
 Amid all the practical considerations, don't forget that you might learn something, too. When people return to school later in life, Ms. King said, they are often pleasantly surprised at how much they actually enjoy the learning process.

HEADLINE: A Way Out Of the Deep Freeze

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
FOR many holders of auction-rate securities -- investments that Wall Street once peddled as safe, sound and as fully liquid as cash -- life in the frozen zone drags on. 
 Not only are some brokerage firms still refusing to let customers redeem their securities -- Oppenheimer and Raymond James are two examples -- but also investors' efforts to be repaid through class-action lawsuits are being stymied. Judges overseeing at least 23 auction-rate class actions have dismissed them in recent months, leaving investors who were hoping for some relief out of luck again. In September, one judge said the plaintiff was not specific enough in his allegations.
 Municipalities, student loan companies, closed-end funds and tax-exempt institutions like hospitals and museums all issued auction-rate securities as either preferred shares or debt instruments to companies and individual investors. The interest rates that issuers paid investors were supposed to reset periodically, usually every week, in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that sold the securities. 
 Problems in the market emerged in early 2008, when weekly auctions that allow investors to cash in their holdings simply stopped functioning. Wall Street firms sponsoring the auctions could no longer match buyers with sellers, and the machinery supporting the $330 billion auction-rate trade ground to a halt.
 State securities regulators have forced some of the larger brokerage firms in the market to redeem their customers' holdings, but not all investors have been so fortunate. 
 So what is an investor to do? 
 On the corporate side, a coalition of executives from 25 companies holding $8 billion in frozen auction-rate securities backed by student loans is arguing that if companies and individual investors could cash in those securities, jobs would be created, investments would be made and money would be spent. 
 The overall market for auction-rate securities backed by student loans is sizable: about $70 billion. 
 James Butkiewicz and William Latham, economics professors at the University of Delaware, estimated in research conducted for the coalition that 15,000 jobs and $2.3 billion in spending would be created for every $1 billion redeemed in auction-rate securities backed by student loans.
 Michael J. Beyer, chief executive of Foresight Energy, a privately held company in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and a member of the coalition, says his company is stuck with $146 million in auction-rate securities. He has struggled to finance three mining projects his company has already begun in Illinois. 
 Foresight raised capital for the projects in late 2007 and parked the money in auction-rate securities in early 2008, just as the market was starting to shut down. Since then, it has tried to get the securities redeemed by Citigroup, the bank that recommended them. Citigroup refused, but gave Foresight a $100 million line of credit against the securities. 
 ''We have been scrambling to find other alternative sources of cash,'' Mr. Beyer said. ''But at some point next year, we will end up short.'' 
 Citigroup said in a statement that it had ''worked diligently with issuers, investors and regulatory authorities'' on the frozen auction-rate securities, adding that ''We have made progress on our efforts to help provide liquidity to our clients and remain committed to continuing our work on these initiatives.'' 
 Mr. Beyer says his coalition is trying to educate the Obama administration about the impact that this Wall Street failure has had on Main Street. 
 ''Our goal is to show the administration that this is money that could be creating jobs in a high-unemployment area,'' he said. 
 INDIVIDUAL investors, of course, don't have the resources or reach of corporate coalitions, and their plight seems even more intractable given the host of recent court rejections.
 Still, one promising road remains open to them: filing an arbitration case against the brokerage firm that sold them their securities. For a variety of reasons, such cases have been much more successful than the class-action matters have been. (An arbitration is a closed-door hearing overseen by a small panel of officials appointed by the securities industry itself.)
 According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the large regulator that oversees investor arbitrations, almost 500 auction-rate claims have been filed by investors since the market seized up. A total of 253 are pending; 242 have been closed. 
 Only 17 claims went all the way through the process. Of those, investors won in four cases; a $400 million award was handed down by a panel in one matter.
 But 146 of the 242 closed cases were settled by the parties involved in the dispute. Although the settlement terms aren't public, lawyers who have handled these cases say that such deals typically involve refunding much, if not all, of investors' money. 
 Some settlements also involved ''consequential damages'' -- extra money awarded to cover investors' costs or opportunities they missed because they didn't have access to their funds. According to Finra, investors have filed 32 claims seeking additional damages in auction-rate cases that were settled through regulatory enforcement actions. Of those, 14 remain open and 9 were settled. Five cases that went through arbitration produced three victories for the plaintiffs. 
 It isn't particularly surprising, legal experts said, that judges have rejected so many class-action suits. The legal hurdles that investors must clear under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 are far greater than those in arbitration, where the less arduous standard of ''just and equitable principles of trade'' is the guiding benchmark. 
 For example, investors in a class action must convince the judge that the brokers who sold them the auction-rate securities knew they were problematic -- not an easy task. And investors filing a class action cannot begin to conduct discovery until their case has survived a defendant's motion to dismiss. This makes it hard to plead the specifics of their case early on. 
 Protracted battles over who will be the lead plaintiff and the lead counsel can also arise in a class action, eating up time and money. And sometimes there are time-consuming disputes over the proper venue for the case. 
 Arbitrations are likely to move along much more speedily and at lower cost.
 Of course, arbitration does have its costs and risks. But for so many investors still stranded with these securities almost two years after the market failed, taking matters into their own hands may be the only approach that holds any promise.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Set to Hear Appeals on Life in Prison for Youths Who Never Killed

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
There are just over 100 people in the world serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed as juveniles in which no one was killed. All are in the United States. And 77 of them are here in Florida.
 On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear appeals from two such juvenile offenders: Joe Sullivan, who raped a woman when he was 13, and Terrance Graham, who committed armed burglary at 16. They claim that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment forbids sentencing them to die in prison for crimes other than homicide. 
 Outside the context of the death penalty, the Supreme Court has generally allowed states to decide for themselves what punishments fit what crimes. But the court barred the execution of juvenile offenders in 2005 by a vote of 5 to 4, saying that people under 18 are immature, irresponsible, susceptible to peer pressure and often capable of change.
 A ruling extending that reasoning beyond capital cases ''could be the Brown v. Board of Education of juvenile law,'' said Paolo G. Annino, the director of the Children's Advocacy Clinic at Florida State University's law school. Judges, legislators and prosecutors in Florida agree that the state takes an exceptionally tough line on juvenile crime. 
 But they are deeply divided about when sentences of life without the possibility of release are warranted.
 ''Sometimes a 15-year-old has a tremendous appreciation for right and wrong,'' said State Representative William D. Snyder, a Republican who is chairman of the House's Criminal and Civil Justice Policy Council. ''I think it would be wrong for the Supreme Court to say that it was patently illegal or improper to send a youthful offender to life without parole. At a certain point, juveniles cross the line, and they have to be treated as adults and punished as adults.''
 A retired Florida appeals court judge, John R. Blue, did not see it that way. ''To lock them up forever seems a little barbaric to me,'' Judge Blue said. ''You ought to leave them some hope.'' 
 Several factors in combination -- some legal, some historical, some cultural -- help account for the disproportionate number of juvenile lifers in Florida. 
 The state's attorney general, Bill McCollum, explained the roots of the state's approach in the first paragraph of his brief in Mr. Graham's case.
 ''By the 1990s, violent juvenile crime rates had reached unprecedented high levels throughout the nation,'' Mr. McCollum wrote. ''Florida's problem was particularly dire, compromising the safety of residents, visitors and international tourists, and threatening the state's bedrock tourism industry.'' Nine foreign tourists were killed over 11 months in 1992 and 1993, one by a 14-year-old.
 Mr. Snyder, the state legislator, put it this way: ''Instead of the Sunshine State, it was the Gun-shine State.''
 In response, the state moved more juveniles into adult courts, increased sentences and eliminated parole for capital crimes.
 Thomas K. Petersen, a semi-retired judge in Miami who spent a decade hearing cases in juvenile court, said that the state's reaction was out of proportion and that it has lately failed to take account of changed circumstances.
 ''Back in the 1990s, there were dire predictions about teenage super-predators, particularly in Florida,'' Judge Petersen said. ''Florida, probably more than other places because of that rash of crimes, overreacted. It was a hysterical reaction.''
 ''People still go around saying things have never been worse,'' he added. ''But violent juvenile crime has gone down even as the juvenile population has grown.''
 The state's brief in Mr. Graham's case said juvenile crime fell 30 percent in the decade ended in 2004. It attributed the drop to its tough approach.
 Shay Bilchik, who served as a state prosecutor in Miami from 1977 to 1993 and is now the director of the Center for Juvenile Justice Reform at Georgetown, said the state took a wrong turn. ''We were pretty aggressive in those years in transferring kids into criminal court,'' he said. 
 He said later research convinced him that his office's approach was much too aggressive and had not served to deter crime. ''My biggest regret,'' he said, ''is that during the time I was in the prosecutor's office, we were under the false impression that we were insuring greater public safety when we were not.'' 
 Mr. Sullivan, 34, had committed a string of crimes by the time he was charged with raping a 72-year-old woman after a burglary in 1989 in Pensacola. Mr. Graham, 22, was sentenced to a year in jail and three years' probation for a 2003 robbery of a Jacksonville restaurant, during which an accomplice beat the manager with a steel bar. Mr. Graham was sentenced to life in 2005 for violating probation by committing a home invasion robbery when he was 17. 
 Concern about tourism continues to drive crime policy in the state, said Kathleen M. Heide, a professor of criminology at the University of South Florida. ''We're at the more extreme level,'' she said, ''because our economy is so tied up with people coming here on vacation and feeling safe. And older people want to live out their retirements here and be safe.''
 Florida is one of eight states with juvenile offenders serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for nonhomicide crimes, according to a report prepared by Professor Annino and two colleagues at Florida State. Louisiana has 17 such prisoners; California, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi, Nebraska and South Carolina have the rest.
 The number of such sentences in Florida was greater in the decade that ended in 2008 than in the decade before. The state sentenced nine juvenile offenders for nonhomicide crimes to life without parole in 2005 alone. ''We're just so far out from everyone else,'' Professor Annino said. 
 Mr. Snyder said finding the right balance in addressing juvenile crime was difficult but should be left to the states. ''People do things at 16 and 17 that they wouldn't do at 37, but they spend a lifetime paying for it,'' he said. ''But we have to create an environment where our children are safe and our elderly are safe.''

HEADLINE: Watch The Walk And Prevent A Fall

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
FALLS are so harmful to the elderly and so costly to society that if falling were a disease, it would be deemed an epidemic.
 More than one-third of people ages 65 or older fall each year. About one fall in 10 results in a serious injury, like a hip fracture. Roughly 20 percent of older people who suffer a hip fracture die within a year. 
 The estimated economic cost of falls ranges widely, up to $75 billion a year in the United States, if fall-related home care and assisted-living costs are added to medical expenses. 
 For years, a small group of geriatric experts has studied falls and suggested preventive programs. Most of the work has relied on visits to doctors and self-reported surveys of volunteers.
 But now, researchers are beginning to apply the digital tools of low-cost wireless sensors in carpets, clothing and rooms to monitor an older person's walking and activity. The continuous measurement and greater precision afforded by simple computing devices, researchers say, promise to deliver new insights on risk factors and tailored prevention measures. 
 For an older person, a fall is often a byproduct of some other health problem: cardiovascular weakness, changes in medication, the beginnings of dementia, gradual muscle degeneration. Motion analysis aided by inexpensive sensors and computing, researchers say, may well become a new ''vital sign,'' like a blood pressure reading, that can yield all sorts of clues about health.
 ''For the last 100 years, clinical research and medical practice have been based on appointments, examinations and asking patients questions -- tiny biopsies of time in a person's life,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, a professor of neurology and biomedical engineering at the Oregon Health and Science University. ''But technology now gives us the ability to get behavioral activity data all the time for a much more fine-grained, real-world picture of what is happening with a person's health.''
 The National Institute on Aging is intrigued, and sponsoring some initial research. Richard M. Suzman, the institute's director of behavioral and social research, said studies of older people's activity patterns, including early detection of risks, would ''increasingly use sensors to deliver this higher fidelity of data.''
 ''It's extremely promising,'' he added.
 Fall prevention also promises to be part of an emerging -- and potentially large -- worldwide industry of helping older people live independently in their homes longer. The European Union, for example, has committed 1 billion euros, or nearly $1.5 billion, to study and finance technologies and services for the aged. Big corporations, including Intel and General Electric, are investing in the field.
 ''The independent-living industry could have a huge payoff in innovation, jobs and competitiveness,'' said Eric Dishman, an Intel research fellow and director of strategy for the company's digital health group.
 In clinical settings, wearable sensors and wireless sensors embedded in carpets are used to measure precisely a person's walking speed, stride length, step width and body sway -- all variables in assessing the risk of falling. 
 In Ireland, a research group, Technology Research for Independent Living, recently completed a two-year study of 600 people, ages 60 to 94. The subjects came in for detailed walking assessments, using the sensor technology. The exact measurements, said Dr. Chie Wei Fan, a medical gerontologist at Trinity College Dublin, help in devising more customized exercise programs for specific muscles or changes in medication to eliminate dizziness.
 The technology-aided ''targeted interventions,'' Dr. Fan said, reduced falls by 30 percent in the study group, compared with a similarly aged sampling of the population. But she thinks it should be possible to reach 50 or 60 percent.
 ''We're still catching the fallers too late,'' Dr. Fan said.
 Earlier detection is the goal of an at-home sensor and data study being conducted by the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, whose sponsors include the Oregon Health and Science University and Intel.
 The initial five-year study, begun in 2006 and financed by the National Institute on Aging, involves 230 volunteers, whose mean age is 84. In each home, wireless sensors are placed in rooms and hallways linked to a personal computer connected to the Internet, allowing a person's activity to be monitored steadily. The cost of the sensors is $200 or less. 
 Activity patterns from the data, said Dr. Kaye, director of the aging and technology center, can help identify ways to prevent falls. The motion sensors may show that a person with congestive heart failure, for example, is getting up from bed often at night to go to the bathroom. If the heart problem is under control, Dr. Kaye said, it may well be a good idea to reduce the dose of the person's diuretic, trading a little bit of ankle swelling for a good night's sleep -- and far less risk of falling.
 Dorothy Martin, 81, and her husband Philip, 83, joined the study two years ago. They live in a two-bedroom apartment in a retirement community in Lake Oswego, Ore., and as part of the study they fill out weekly self-assessments of their activities and health. Once a year, they undergo detailed, in-person physical and cognitive evaluations. They say the sensor monitoring is unobtrusive because the sensors track only motion, not what they are doing.
 Both of the Martins are in good health. Still, they have watched friends grow increasingly frail over the years.
 ''We did this to participate in research that would be helpful to other people, and possibly to us,'' Mr. Martin said.

HEADLINE: City's Cabbies Like Plastic. Who Knew?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
New York's cabbies howled when the city began forcing them to take credit cards. Some even went on strike, calling the requirements a kowtow to tourists and a burden on drivers.
 But two years later, the back-of-the-cab swipe has emerged as an unlikely savior for New York's taxi industry, even as other cities' fleets struggle to find fares in a deep recession.
 Overall ridership and revenue have increased. More and more fares are being paid with credit cards, even for shorter rides. And tips for drivers, usually an early casualty of tough times, are up sharply, double over the pre-plastic days.
 Even cabbies are conceding that credit cards are good for business. ''It's better,'' said Naveed Shah, 35, a driver for five years, as he gassed up his Ford Crown Victoria recently. ''If there was no credit card, people aren't going to take taxicabs.'' 
 Other major cities are now rushing to follow suit. Although New York was late to bring credit cards to cabs, it leapfrogged ahead by pioneering a customer-friendly system that required no signed receipts, no minimum payment and an interactive device that let passengers swipe the card and add tips themselves.
 In Los Angeles, for instance, credit card machines are often in the front seat, forcing riders to hand their cards to the driver. Business this year is off about 15 percent, according to fleet owners, mirroring national trends in the industry. 
 In New York, however, revenues have risen about 13 percent from the end of last year, according to data collected by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission. And tips, which hovered around 10 percent when cab rides were cash only, averaged 22 percent on credit-card transactions this fall.
 ''Credit cards helped the New York industry stay stable in a time when the rest of the for-hire industry was in significant decline,'' said Alfred LaGasse, chief executive officer of the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association, a national trade group.
 Taxi fleets in Boston, Chicago, Las Vegas and the suburbs of Washington are all beginning to experiment with back-seat card readers similar to those in New York, Mr. LaGasse said.
 Once considered a convenient payment method for longer trips, often to the area's airports, credit cards are now being used for shorter, cheaper rides, the type of $5 rainy-day indulgences that were once handled exclusively with cash.
 Amos Tamam, president of VeriFone Transportation Systems, whose card readers are in 6,700 cabs, or about half of the city's fleet, said his company's average credit-card fare is now less than $15, down from $16 a year ago.
 ''The more usage you get with credit cards, the lower the average ticket is going to go,'' Mr. Tamam said. 
 Passengers said that paying with credit cards has become second nature. ''Any time I take a cab, I pay with a card, on the advice of my accountant,'' said Michelin Hall of Manhattan, after swiping his American Express card in a taxi outside Pennsylvania Station the other day. Mr. Hall said that with cards, ''it's easy to track the receipts, it can tell you how long the cab ride was and where you went'' -- convenient information when he files expenses for his job in marketing. 
 The increase in tips, however, may have less to do with New Yorkers' generosity than with the preset amounts suggested to passengers on the taxi's software systems. In many of the city's cabs, riders are offered options for their tip depending on the length of the ride. For fares under $15, a screen prompts tips of $2, $3 or $4; the numbers can range from 15 percent to 30 percent for higher fares. The presets are used about 70 percent of the time, according to industry estimates.
 New York's success seemed unlikely a year ago, when the last of the city's 13,000 cabs were outfitted with credit-card readers, part of an initiative started in 2007 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The city was reeling from a maelstrom on Wall Street that disproportionately affected the high-income industries that drive the New York economy. 
 And riders were still reporting unpleasant run-ins with drivers who refused to accept the cards or pressured customers to pay with cash, a resentment left over from a two-day strike in September 2007 that forced officials to institute an ad-hoc system for shared rides.
 But in 2008, taxi officials began noticing a trend: Cab business was staying steady, and credit card use was on the rise. 
 At the end of last year, about one-fifth of cab rides were being paid for with a card. That portion has grown steadily this year, reaching 28 percent in September, the latest month for which data was available. Meanwhile, black-car business has fallen about 30 percent, as companies encourage employees to use corporate credit cards to expense cheaper yellow-cab rides. 
 ''It's becoming a way of life in the taxi world,'' said Matthew W. Daus, New York's taxi commissioner. ''New Yorkers are getting more accustomed to going around without cash. We think it's a good thing.''
 In interviews, drivers acknowledged that business had improved, but still groused about the credit card machines. The higher tips are tempered by a 5 percent service fee applied to fares that are paid with plastic. Drivers must also wait anywhere from a day to a week to retrieve their fare money paid by credit cards, and they said the machines occasionally break down, resulting in lost fares.
 ''Because of credit cards we get customers, that's true,'' said Muhammed Hamid, 35, of Queens. ''But if they give us cash, you can put the gas on that; you don't have to wait three, four days.'' 
 Told of the statistics that showed higher tips, some drivers scoffed. ''I know that's not true,'' said William Lindauer, a driver and coordinating member of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. ''They get no tips, or less tips.''
 A random survey suggested otherwise. Several drivers were asked to share their credit receipts after their shifts. Of 20 receipts reviewed, the average tip came out to just over 18 percent. The preset tip amounts were used more than half the time, resulting in a $5.30 ride getting a tip of $2, or about 38 percent. 
 It may be difficult, however, for other cities to recreate New York's success. ''Not all agencies in other cities have the same tools, manpower and budget to do what New York City did,'' said Mr. Tamam of VeriFone. And New York's fleet, the largest in the country, has a bigger customer base that can help justify the high cost of installing more advanced credit card technology.
 Some drivers suggested, paradoxically, that the recession itself may be prompting greater credit card use. Simon Palade, a driver for more than 40 years, said he sees far more cash fares around the first of the month, when paychecks are often issued. 
 ''After that it slows down and they've got to use plastic more and more,'' Mr. Palade, 59, of Sunnyside, Queens, said the other day, as he navigated a Central Park transverse. ''People don't got no money. They're banking on the future.''

HEADLINE: Real Rembrandts, And the Also-Rans

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
For years, the Wadsworth Atheneum was one of the premier museums in the nation. But as Hartford has gone into economic decline, so have the fortunes of the museum, with successive directors needing to severely cut staff and exhibition budgets to stay ahead of a broad drop in revenue. It is a story that many other regional art museum directors and board members know all too well.
 But unlike most other regional museums, the Atheneum has a distinguishing asset: an amazing collection formed over more than a century that encompasses approximately 45,000 objects, ranging from Egyptian, Roman, Asian and Grecian antiquities to all the decorative arts and Renaissance painting and sculpture. It is an old-school encyclopedic museum, a microcosm of world culture. 
So it makes sense that the museum has initiated a new Masterpiece series, consisting of what it calls ''small, dossier exhibitions'' that bring some of the world's best artworks to Hartford and display them alongside works from the museum's great permanent collection. The first in the series is a jewel-like show of paintings by Rembrandt.
 The exhibition, ''Rembrandt's People,'' includes seven Rembrandt paintings borrowed from leading museums in North America, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art, as well as two more works from the Atheneum's collection that were thought to be by Rembrandt when acquired, but that have since been attributed to other artists. The pairing of these two works alongside their authentic counterparts is fascinating, enabling us to appreciate just how talented Rembrandt was.
 That talent is very much on display in ''Self-Portrait'' (1659), an extraordinary late work from the National Gallery of Art that alone is worth the price of admission to the museum. It is a testament to the high regard in which the Atheneum is held that it was able to borrow this priceless picture, which is among the best Rembrandt paintings in the country. 
 Rembrandt painted more self-portraits than any other 17th-century artist, perhaps because he wanted or at times even needed to save on modeling costs, as some art historians have suggested. He also frequently used his wife, Saskia, and friends and relatives as models. 
 The model for the woman in ''Young Woman at Her Toilet (Old Testament Heroine)'' (c.1632-33), on loan from the National Gallery of Canada, is believed by some historians to be Rembrandt's sister, or possibly his wife, but there is no firm evidence of this. 
 Either way, this beautiful early painting, showing a woman preparing herself for a night of seduction, is a fitting way to begin the essentially chronological arrangement of compelling works in the show. It is also a useful example of how the artist used real people in historical and religious scenes.
 In some ways, this is the whole point of the show, which is focused on the artist's figure paintings. Rembrandt was among the first artists to push European art away from idealism and on the path to realism. 
 You get a good sense of this in ''Portrait of Anthonie Coopal'' (1635), a commissioned portrait of a distant relation by marriage on loan from a private collection. Here the artist strives to capture the personal style and spirit of the sitter, who is shown as a dashing young man with curling blond hair and moustache wearing typical Dutch clothing -- sober and black -- with a flat, expensive lace collar over his coat suggesting that he is a man of wealth and taste. 
 It is interesting to contrast the intricate detail in an early work like ''Portrait of Anthonie Coopal'' with other works here from the 1650s and 1660s, much later in the artist's career, when he began to move away from highly polished, finished paintings to a rougher, more direct style with rich, textured impasto surfaces. The self-portrait is a good example of the later style, as is ''Bust of a Young Jew'' (1663), a wonderfully evocative, rapid-fire character study of an ordinary person.
 When either of these paintings is compared with the two works here that were once thought to be Rembrandt, it can seem embarrassingly obvious that they are not by the same artist. ''Portrait of a Woman in Profile (Possibly Saskia)'' and ''Portrait of a Young Man (Possibly Titus),'' both undated, lack the subtle, deft brushwork, the emphasis on facial expression and sensitivity to light found in the authentic Rembrandts.
 Or maybe everything just seems clearer with hindsight. Back in the '50s and '60s, when the Atheneum acquired these two works, they were authenticated by the world's top Rembrandt scholars. Knowledge of Rembrandt, his studio and circle has increased a lot since then, enabling better attribution. But it is still worrying to think that the experts could have gotten it so wrong.

HEADLINE: Casual Dining Dons a Blazer

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

DATELINE: Maryville, Tenn. 

 BODY:
 IF you heard Sandy Beall order lunch at a Ruby Tuesday here one recent afternoon, and didn't know he's the founder and chief executive of this casual dining chain, you would assume the guy has serious issues with appetite control.
 ''Bring the New Orleans seafood, bring the herb-crusted tilapia, bring the cheddar burger,'' he tells a waitress, in a Tennessee drawl.
 ''How do you want that cooked?'' she asks, scribbling as fast as she can.
 ''Medium. And bring a rack of ribs.'' 
 ''Half or full?''
 ''Full,'' replies Mr. Beall. ''The full is prettier.''
 All this as waiters whisk away a pile of appetizers that includes a jumbo lump crab cake, guacamole, tortilla chips, a chicken wing sampler, Asian dumplings and the punningly named Thai Phoon shrimp, described on the menu as ''the perfect storm of texture and flavors.''
 It's a lot of lunch for two people, especially because Mr. Beall (pronounced ''bell'') is hardly going to lift his fork. But he hasn't ordered this orgy of meat, seafood and sesame peanut glaze because he's feeling peckish. He has summoned this spread because he's feeling proud.
 For the last two years, Mr. Beall has spent upward of $100 million of his company's money in a grand, all-consuming campaign to upgrade the brand -- its food, its service and, most recently, its decor, which for a long time was dominated by faux Tiffany lamps and rummage-sale bric-a-brac. Now Ruby Tuesday features leather banquettes and dark varnished wood, and the wait staff is clad in hipster black shirts and black pants. The new menu includes upmarket fare, like lobster tails, and offers suggestions about which wine will work with your dish.
 ''Pairs well with Penfolds Koonunga Hill Shiraz,'' it says under a picture of the surf and turf.
 The menu is a long way from the burger-and-beer joint that Mr. Beall, then 21, created in 1972 on the campus of the University of Tennessee, where he was a student. 
 If he'd picked any other moment during his years atop this international empire of 896 restaurants, the makeover might have merely been very hard. But the recession started right about the time that those faux Tiffany lamps were yanked from the ceilings. The chain has been trying to transform itself into the fancier, pricier alternative to much larger rivals like Applebee's just as consumers have been hoarding their dimes.
 Americans eat 20 million meals a week at casual-dining chains, according to Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm -- a number second only to fast food.
 The companies that gave the world such singular creations as riblet platters, Southwestern egg rolls and dessert shooters stay so keenly attuned to our appetites and urges that you could tell the story of our country's ever-evolving, slightly twisted love affair with food and commerce with a collection of menus from Chili's, T.G.I. Friday's and their ilk.
 When Ruby Tuesday began its self-enhancement drive, it hoped merely to join a slightly posher neighborhood, the place where Olive Garden and Outback Steakhouse live. But by commencing just before the bust and sticking to its strategy, the company has become an object lesson in recession-era economics, demonstrating both the perils and possible upsides of pushing lobster in an age of chicken pot pie.
 THE company is haunted by the stark metrics of its trade: Ruby Tuesday's same-store sales are down about 8 percent from last year, when it closed 54 restaurants. With traffic flagging, a war of discounts and specials broke out in the middle of last year, and the chain started offering buy-one-get-one-free deals -- a k a ''Bogos'' -- to get customers in the door.
 Wall Street began to worry that the company would break its debt covenants, and Ruby Tuesday shares, which traded as high as $33 a few years back, fell to 85 cents in March. A side of the creamy mashed cauliflower cost about three times as much.
 Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday?
 Not quite. 
 The stock has rebounded to $6.54, and the company has raised money to pay down debt. Even if a sense of imminent doom has passed, however, nobody is yet calling Mr. Beall's makeover a success. 
 The company says that traffic is up in the most recent quarter, but according to Technomic, same-store sales at Chili's, Applebee's and Ruby Tuesday have fallen at roughly the same rate, suggesting that diners either haven't heard about the changes or can't taste the difference.
 ''You ask people in surveys why they chose one casual dining chain over the other and they'll say, 'because the line was shorter,' '' says Ron Paul, the president of Technomic. ''Ruby's is trying to break out of that, and Sandy's point is correct -- if and when people decide to go back to casual dining, you need to give them a reason to do it. Based on the numbers, though, Ruby Tuesday has a long ways to go.''
 Last month, for the first time in its 37-year history, this media-shy company allowed a reporter to visit what is officially called the Ruby Tuesday Support Services Center, here in Maryville, just south of Knoxville. It's a modern, three-building complex, with more than 35,000 square feet of cubicles, classrooms, test kitchens and roughly 370 very cheerful employees. If you have always assumed that every casual chain restaurant has a nerve center and idea laboratory, you're right -- and this is what it looks like. 
 A group of chefs work on the first floor in the main building, confecting and painstakingly market-testing the next ''craveable,'' as standout dishes are known. And the company is stepping up its already extensive training program, called Wow-U, flying in managers weekly from across the country and preaching an astoundingly detailed catechism of rules, etiquette and sales tactics known as ''the Ruby Way.''
 The trick is for the company to elevate its image without alienating those customers who actually liked the dowdier original. Mr. Beall, a supremely confident man, sounds unworried.
 ''We lost about 5 percent to 8 percent of our base by upgrading, mostly at lower income levels,'' he says with a shrug. ''Very few people miss the roller skates on the wall and the bad food.''
 PAT PETERSON is teaching ''Service Engagement'' in front of about 60 Ruby Tuesday managers. Like a lot of the lecturers here, he's been with the company for more than a decade; he started as a part-time cook and is now director of quality and innovation.
 Mr. Peterson has boundless energy, and he paces back and forth in front of his students -- most of them men in their 30s and 40s -- shouting and gesticulating like a TV pitchman selling a Miracle Mop. He is recounting a night when two guys came into a Ruby Tuesday wearing Budweiser trucker hats. A waitress approached and asked something foolish: Want to try the sangria?
 ''What did the Budweiser brothers want?'' Mr. Peterson shouts at the class.
 ''Bud,'' the class replies in improvised unison.
 ''A cold beer, right! They couldn't have been more clear about that if they walked in with a buzzing neon sign that said 'Give me a Budweiser!' If you want to get really frisky you might have sold them up to a Sam Adams handcrafted draft or something like that, but I wouldn't have gone anywhere near sangria. Because these are not sangria people.''
 His audience nods.
 ''And when I approach that table with sangria, then I'm making clear from the very beginning, this is about me winning a contest or my manager is bugging me about selling sangria, or whatever it is. 'Hey, I don't care what you want. I'm going to nudge you to what I think you need.'
 ''Does that make sense to everybody?''
 Class: ''Yes.''
 ''Is it something we want to be doing?''
 Class: ''No.''
 ''Is it something we're doing every day?''
 Class: ''Yes.''
 ''Exactly! And we're going to have to break out of that.''
 When people say the restaurant business is tough, they are usually referring to the challenge of running only a single restaurant. So how do you run 896? And how do you run 896 as you trade up virtually every protocol, ingredient and recipe, not to mention the uniforms, cutlery and ambience?
 Now add this wrinkle: Ruby Tuesday employs 43,000 people, and its annual rate of turnover is currently 100 percent. That doesn't mean that everyone leaves in a given year; many of the managers stay for a long time. But there's enormous churn on the rungs below.
 ''And 100 percent, that's really good,'' says Robert LeBoeuf, whose Ruby Tuesday title is chief people manager. ''Three years ago, we were at 135 percent.''
 This rotating staff must be tightly managed, but it is never supposed to sound overly scripted. As with every casual dining chain, Ruby Tuesday embraces the upside of fast-food uniformity (identical meals, no matter which restaurant you visit), but wants none of its downsides (a sense of prefab cooking that is delivered by programmed servers).
 So while the company has thick orientation and training manuals, the point of Wow-U is not to rehash the regulations. It's to acquaint managers with the art of improvising within those regulations, so they can teach underlings to do likewise.
 Ruby Tuesday will spend as much as $2.5 million this year on Wow-U, much of it to fly managers here and put them up at the Ruby Lodge, a rather luxurious inn that until recently wasn't open to the public.
 The managers will commute at 7:45 a.m. to the Support Services Center in a faux trolley with ''Ruby Tuesday'' painted on the side. In the evenings, they will be served elaborate meals, including dishes like crostini and cornmeal-crusted oysters, items unlikely to show up at a Ruby Tuesday.
 ''They want us to experience a really exceptional level of food and service, so we'll bring that spirit back to our restaurants,'' says one manager, drinking a beer on the veranda of the lodge after dinner one night. The company prohibits managers from speaking to the news media, so he declined to give his name.
 Managers can make $50,000 to $60,000, as well as bonuses of up to $20,000, the company says, and if the group visiting this week in October is typical, they are an upbeat, motivated bunch, well versed in the language of the brand.
 A good manager, for instance, is ''LnC,'' which stands for ''large and in charge.'' A shift leader is called ''FoH,'' for ''front of the house.'' Checklists are known as ''the Ruby Walk.''
 Like all good business cultures, this one evolves with the times, and inevitably the recession has had a big impact.
 ''I read guests' complaints,'' Mr. Peterson tells the class, ''and there's about 400 a week that I read.'' 
 These days, almost all contain a variation on this statement: ''In this economy you can't afford to treat me this way.''
 ''How many have seen that?'' he asks.
 Everyone in the room, it seems.
 ''Absolutely. It's a common theme through everything we're doing.''
 For a while, Ruby Tuesday servers were instructed to offer ''silent service,'' which meant a minimum of interaction with guests. But that, Mr. Peterson explains, is out of sync with the times.
 ''In a poor economy, people need a retreat,'' he half-yells at the class. ''So what happens when they walk into a Ruby Tuesday? What are they looking for? An escape! And that's O.K.''
 He turns on his hospitality voice: '' 'You're more than welcome. Come on in. You're going to have a good time.' There's a monetary value to being that place. A huge monetary value.''
 THE genesis of the Ruby Tuesday upgrade can be traced to a conversation that Sandy Beall had with his son, who attended the California Culinary Academy.
 ''About four years ago, he said, 'Dad, you know what is wrong with Ruby's, don't you?' '' recalls Mr. Beall as he nibbles on the New Orleans seafood. ''I said, 'Oh, no, wise one of 28 years.' He said: 'Garbage in, garbage out. You can't have great food if you don't buy great product.' ''
 A slight, 59-year-old-man who is dressed this afternoon in a Canali houndstooth sport jacket, Mr. Beall has a somewhat aristocratic bearing, an impression reinforced by his affinity for equestrian fox hunting and tennis, which he describes as his only passions other than family and Ruby Tuesday.
 He says he has never spoken to a reporter for a profile, but swears that shyness has had nothing to do with it. He's just never understood what's in it for Ruby Tuesday, and it seems a distraction from the hundreds of tasks forever at hand.
 ''I don't know why you're here, actually,'' he says wryly. ''Now, somebody could argue that you can create more value by being more visible, and sell the company or sell yourself.''
 Yes, the Richard Branson approach.
 ''Disgusting,'' he sneers. Smiling contritely, he leans into a digital recorder. ''Richard,'' he says, ''I'm kidding.''
 The son of a chemical engineer, Mr. Beall was a real estate and finance major who happened into a Pizza Hut, looking for work, and ended up managing three franchises. The owner became a mentor and, after he had a heart attack, sold the restaurants back to Pizza Hut and gave Mr. Beall $10,000 worth of Pizza Hut stock.
 ''He said, 'Keep it for two years and it'll be worth $20,000,' '' Mr. Beall recalls. ''I said, 'Should I work for Pizza Hut?' And he said, 'No, start your own business.' ''
 Instead of getting his undergraduate degree, he took a quick trip to Manhattan, where he scoped out restaurants, including an early iteration of T.G.I. Friday's. He decided to serve ''hamburgers shaped like softballs'' as well as soup, salads and beer. He was never much of a Rolling Stones fan; the name for his restaurant was suggested by one of several fraternity brothers who were co-investors.
 ''I wasn't that hip of a person,'' Mr. Beall says.
 The place was busy from Day One, but it took six years for Mr. Beall to start making real money because he opened a new Ruby Tuesday at a pace of about one every nine months. To quicken the pace, he sold the company in 1982 for about $15 million to Morrison Restaurants Inc., which ultimately sank about $250 million into expansion plans. He remained in charge of operations, and in the following years Ruby Tuesday added more than 500 restaurants.
 In 1996, he helped orchestrate a reverse buyout, splitting Morrison into three companies, one of which was Ruby Tuesday. Nine years later, he dropped ''Bar and Grill'' from the name, and the upgrade was on.
 He was fighting for a bigger slice of a shrinking pie. According to Malcolm M. Knapp Inc., a consulting firm that tracks the restaurant industry, total year-over-year sales have been slowing in the casual dining chain category since 2005, and this year will be the first since the firm started collecting data in 1991 that total sales turned negative.
 The best a company can do now is steal customers from competitors. And the best customers to steal are the wealthiest ones, because they are actually spending.
 ''What he did was a pretty bold move,'' says Malcolm Knapp, founder of the firm. ''He looked over the horizon and said, 'I have to get the higher-end demographic.' He made a decision strategically, that that's the sweet spot of the market.''
 The average check -- for lunch or dinner -- at Ruby Tuesday is now about $11.50. Mr. Beall hopes to raise that by $3 in coming years and toraise the daily guest count from 360 per restaurant back to 400, where it was before the recession. Given the fixed overhead costs, this is a business that works only when you put ''butts in seats,'' as executives here are fond of saying.
 ''Look at this dish,'' says Mr. Beall, pointing to the Thai Phoon shrimp. ''The shrimp are 11 cents each. There's probably 12 shrimp in that dish. So that's $1.32 in food cost. Plus the lettuce, plus the sauce. That's about $1.60. You sell it for $8.'' 
 The key, says Mr. Beall, is buying in quantities large enough to keep the food price down -- which in this case means buying 30 million shrimp at a time.
 Is it possible to cook fresh, delectable meals at these volumes? Taste-testing with the company president didn't seem the ideal way to experience a typical meal, so a few days ago this reporter paid a visit to the Ruby Tuesday in Times Square. The Thai Phoon shrimp was actually the standout dish, though think about it: you could batter, fry and pour sweet syrup on a tire and it'd be a chewy delight. On the downside, the salmon Florentine was salted into oblivion, and the ice cream that came with a strawberry puff pastry dessert did something mind-blowing: it sat on a plate for 20 minutes without melting.
 Even the waitress seemed utterly amazed.
 GIVEN the scale of the business, adding or subtracting any dish from Ruby Tuesday takes months. It's a process led by the boyish and easily excitable Peter Glander, a former sous-chef at the Modern, the Danny Meyer restaurant at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan.
 His career path may seem bizarre for a gourmet, but Mr. Glander gets to cook, in effect, for about 300,000 people a day. The downside is that food-related decisions at Ruby Tuesday are highly collaborative and extensively customer-tested, which means a lot of time can elapse between the inspiration for a dish and its rollout.
 Consider one of Mr. Glander's more recent creations: the pretzel bun.
 ''It was this idea in my mind,'' he says, standing in the test kitchen one afternoon. ''People know they like pretzels, but they rarely order them. It's just a great flavor and texture.''
 A vendor in Chicago was found who could mass-produce the bun; then its shape, texture and size were tweaked for weeks. Eventually, the bun was rolled out to a limited number of restaurants, tested and then tweaked some more. Last Wednesday, five months after he proposed it, the bun finally hit all the chain's United States restaurants.
 Subtractions from the menu are handled the same way.
 ''Some things lose luster,'' says Mr. Glander. ''Like the chocolate tall cake. It's this cake that is extremely rich, and when I came over a year ago, this was the holy grail of the dessert menu. It was like, there will never be anything happening to this piece.''
 ''We'd had it for 10 years at least,'' says Andy Scoggins, vice president of culinary and beverage.
 ''In that time we've introduced cheesecake,'' says Mr. Glander.
 ''And Italian cream cake,'' says Mr. Scoggins. ''And a yogurt parfait. And as we put these other desserts to tests, the scores were so high, and the tall cake scores were so low, it was a no-brainer.''
 The same day the pretzel bun joined the menu, the tall cake was retired.
 It isn't among the desserts Mr. Beall orders at the Ruby Tuesday lunch bacchanalia, which happens a few weeks before the tall cake's farewell. Instead, he asks for the blondie a la mode, the chocolate molten cake and the cheesecake. Each is like a parade float -- so large and so colorful it makes you laugh.
 The outsize dessert is a staple of the category, one that Ruby Tuesday will stick with, along with cheddar fries and cheeseburger quesadillas. At the same time, the company is betting $100 million that the decade-old foodie craze in the more affluent ZIP codes of this country can be sold, in a mass-market variation, to Middle America.
 ''If you really care what you put in your body, Ruby's is a good place for you,'' says Mr. Beall, as the wait staff clears away the plates. ''If you don't care, hell, go to Hardee's.''

HEADLINE: Secrets of the Stacks

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
The New York Public Library, with its headquarters at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, encompasses four major research libraries and 87 branches, with a total of 20 million books, 50 million cataloged items and a growing demand in this recession for loaner laptops and other free services. Only the Library of Congress and the British Library are larger. But even the Fifth Avenue landmark by itself is a marvel of big numbers. It is undergoing a $1.2 billion makeover in preparation for its 100th birthday. Built from 1899 to 1911, it cost $9 million, contains 530,000 cubic feet of white Vermont marble and 125 miles of shelving, and opened with an inventory of one million items. Here are some highlights of this fabled institution.
 ANSWER ZONE The library began its telephone reference service in 1968; it is available online or by calling 917-ASK-NYPL (917-275-6975). How old is the moon? 4.72 billion years. Where was the toothbrush invented? China, in 1498. How often does the service receive questions? Every 10 seconds. 
 SADDEST ITEM In August 1820, a dying John Keats wrote a letter to his soul mate, Fanny Brawne, that begins with a fond salutation -- ''My dearest girl'' -- but goes quickly downhill. ''I am glad there is such a thing as the grave,'' he wrote. ''The world is too brutal for me.'' It ends with a romantic flourish: ''I wish that I was either in your arms full of faith or that a thunderbolt would strike me.'' 
 MOST FAITHFUL CUSTOMER Norbert Pearlroth, the head researcher for ''Ripley's Believe It or Not,'' visited the library almost daily. Although he wrote about the incredible, his own routine was anything but: He sat at the same table for 52 years, from 1923 to 1975. 
 READY FOR ITS CLOSE-UP The library has figured in dozens of films, including ''Sex and the City''; ''The Wiz''; ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' right; ''Spider-Man''; and ''Ghostbusters.'' 
 THE FIORELLO LA GUARDIA IMPACT La Guardia, New York's loquacious Depression-era mayor, renamed the famous lions that guard the Fifth Avenue entrance. The mayor decided that Patience and Fortitude -- survival qualities essential during a depression -- made better sense than Lord Lenox and Lady Astor, especially since both lions are male. 
 THIS OLD HOUSE The writing on a cuneiform tablet dating from 2050 B.C. may document the oldest real estate transaction on record -- the sale of a house in Sumeria.
 MENU, PLEASE The library has 40,000 restaurant menus, the world's largest collection, dating from the 1850s to the present. It is heavily used by chefs, novelists and researchers; a few years ago, a marine biologist consulted menus from the early 1900s for a study of fish populations. 
 THANK YOU FOR SMOKING The Arents Tobacco Collection was assembled by George Arents, whose father was president of the American Tobacco Company. The only collection of its kind, it contains 15,000 books, all of them about or containing references to tobacco. ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Alice in Wonderland'' are included, but nothing by Shakespeare, who never mentioned tobacco or smoking. 
 IN THE EVENT OF FIRE...
 MICHAEL INMAN, curator of rare books, would grab the only printed copy of a four-page letter Columbus wrote in 1493 about his discovery of and reaction to America. 
 ELIZABETH DENLINGER, curator of the Shelley Collection, was torn between the one-of-a-kind Esdaile Notebook, a manuscript of Shelley's early poetry, and William Blake's hand-engraved 1793 version of ''The Songs of Innocence.'' 
 ISAAC GEWIRTZ, curator of the Berg Collection, which has 35,000 volumes of English and American literature, would save the 1605 handwritten manuscript that contains the most accurate transcription of John Donne's ''Holy Sonnets.''
 FIRST BOOK LENT OUT ''Ethical Ideas of Our Time,'' a treatise on Nietzsche and Tolstoy, by N. I. Grot. 
 MOST SCANDALOUS BOOK A copy of the so-called Wicked Bible, printed in London in 1631. In it, the word ''not'' was omitted from the prohibition on adultery. 
 HEAVIEST BOOK A tie between ''Michelangelo: La Dotta Mano,'' a handmade coffee-table-size trophy, and John James Audubon's 1830s first edition of ''Birds of America,'' with its life-size raptors and flamingos. Both weigh about 61 pounds. 
 CABINET OF CURIOSITIES The most bizarre item, not counting those skull fragments from Percy Bysshe Shelley in Room 319, has to be Charles Dickens's favorite letter-opener. The shaft is ivory, but the handle is the embalmed paw of his beloved cat, Bob, toenails and all. 
 OTHER ODDITIES Truman Capote's cigarette case. The cane Virginia Woolf left on the riverbank the day she committed suicide. The original Winnie-the-Pooh. Hair from the heads of Charlotte Bronte, Walt Whitman, Mary Shelley and Wild Bill Hickok. Elizabeth Barrett Browning's slippers.

HEADLINE: Graceful Interchanges, Now Doubling as Civic Sculpture

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS maintain that Los Angeles is a city with no center. But Angelenos argue that the city of freeways has its core in the Stack, a tower of overpasses -- the first four-level connector interchange, according to the California Transportation Department -- where the Pasadena, Harbor, Hollywood and Santa Ana freeways intersect. 
 The Stack has long been a postcard symbol of the city. It is, as they like to say at chambers of commerce, a signature structure, as the Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building are for New York. When citizens fled attacking aliens in the 1953 film version of ''The War of the Worlds,'' they scrambled beneath the Stack and were jammed on the new Hollywood Freeway. 
 A city and country centered on the automobile are by necessity also centered on the road. Today's highway intersections are not just landmarks but the modern equivalents of crossroads and town squares, meeting places that become geographical centers of reference. 
 And both as landmarks and utilitarian features of life, they are getting more consideration. With federal stimulus money flowing to shovel-ready projects that have been on the drawing boards for years, new intersections are sprouting all over. 
 In recent months, drivers sitting in traffic at construction sites have grown accustomed to seeing signs that say Putting America to Work and bear the recovery.gov symbol or the striped letters of Tiger, which stands for Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery. 
 The Obama administration's stimulus program, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, calls for spending about $27 billion on highway improvements and repairs. According to the Federal Highway Administration, more than $20 billion of that money has been committed -- or to use the government term, obligated. 
 Federal highway money goes to state transportation and highway departments, not directly to contractors, but nearly 5,000 local projects are under construction and more than 8,000 have been authorized, according to information posted at recovery.gov and the Web site of the highway administration, part of the Transportation Department. 
 In New Jersey, construction crews are completing the connection between the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 78; for decades, motorists have clamored for such a link. In New York City, federal stimulus dollars will pay for new ramps on Staten Island, and to the Brooklyn Bridge, according to the office of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 Intersections are among the public works honored by America's Transportation Awards, a competition sponsored by the AAA, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The winners, chosen for reducing costs and time of construction -- not just efficiency or beauty -- were announced in October. 
 The people's choice award, chosen by on-line voting, was a project that added high-occupancy-vehicle lanes to Interstate 95 in Miami. Farther up I-95, in New Haven, a rehabilitation of intersections was singled out for praise. 
 Earlier awards also went to notable intersections. The MacArthur Maze, near the east end of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, was honored not for its size or the convoluted pattern of its ramps, but for contractors' heroically rapid repairs after it was severely damaged in a gasoline tanker-truck fire in 2007. 
 Other standout interchanges include the Marquette Interchange in Milwaukee, which has been called the crossroads of Wisconsin's largest city, where Routes I-43, I-94 and I-794 meet. Officials and engineers have previously honored the I-35 Interchange in Lenexa/Overland Park, Kan.; marveled at the unique curved bridge of the E-470/I-70 Interchange in Aurora, Colo.; and applauded a five-level interchange near Austin, Tex.
 Interchanges have more artistic fans as well. Yutaka Sone, an artist who creates models of Los Angeles freeway interchanges like the Stack, works in white marble, the traditional material of heroic sculpture. He makes a point: the freeway intersections are the heroic landmarks of Los Angeles, like domes and towers in London or Paris. 
 With their soaring ramps -- the British term for an overpass, the flyover, is aptly colorful -- and sweeping bridges, the grandest interchanges of major highways mix the thrill of a roller coaster with the grandeur of a Roman aqueduct. 
 Interchanges in other countries are as important as the Stack. 
 One of the landmarks of Stockholm is the Slussen, an intersection from the 1930s merging highways, pedestrian parks and waterfront. It is now being redesigned and will be rebuilt. 
 The frequently unnoticed complexity of intersections is brought home to drivers in the sorts of maps offered by Mapquest, Google Map and in-car navigation units that provide new perspectives on the knots and twists of intersection ramps and overpasses. Interchanges show up on screens in all their varicose variety, like tortured Celtic knots. 
 Not all intersections are dramatic, of course. The most common type is what highway builders call the grade crossing. In its most basic form, it is the crossroads, a place of powerful spiritual meaning in song and story. Oedipus had a moment of truth at ''the crossroads where three roads meet,'' and it's where blues singers met the devil and made a deal. (Think of songs like ''Crossroads Blues,'' and all those references to Highways 61 and 49 in the blues country of Mississippi.) 
 The automobile demanded new sorts of intersections. One early form of circular intersection was named the gyratory. A highway intersection laid out in a symmetrical pattern, the cloverleaf, opened near Woodbridge, N.J., in 1929. 
 There are fashions in highway design, as in everything. The latest intersection trend is the return of the circular interchange, popular in the early days but largely supplanted in later planning. 
 The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports that about 1,000 circular intersections have been built, and the Federal Highway Administration has embraced them. They have been blessed by advocates of the so-called new urbanist movement and by environmentalists who believe they can cut fuel consumption by reducing acceleration from stoplights. 
 ''Roundabouts are vastly safer than traditional intersections, and most drivers like the circular intersections once they get used to them,'' stated an article in the June 2008 issue of Status Report, the publication of the insurance institute. The article praised the roundabout for its ability to ''virtually eliminate the most serious kinds of crashes that occur at traditional intersections controlled by traffic signals or signs.'' 
 The design of intersections varies not only with the amount of traffic they carry but also with local conditions and local philosophy. Michigan mixes stoplights and extra lanes at grade crossings to produce the Michigan U-turn, an intersection shaped like a button hook. In heavy traffic areas where a left turn at a stoplight would involve a long wait, New Jersey offers its Jersey Jughandle, a loop from the right lane that brings you to the stoplight from a side road.
 How well intersections and highways work does not depend just on their layouts. Culture matters. The German autobahns would not work without a careful respect for the distinction between fast and slow lanes. Similarly, the calm alternate car mergings on some freeways contrast with the showdowns of Manhattan-bound drivers lining up for the Hudson River tunnels, who give way only at the last minute. 
 It is perhaps a matter of culture, too, that New York City drivers are barred from making right turns after stopping at a trafficlights. The inconvenience of this restriction, enforced through most of New York City but not practiced in Los Angeles, was made light of in ''Annie Hall,'' the 1977 Woody Allen film. 
 ''I don't want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light,'' said Mr. Allen's character, Alvy Singer.

HEADLINE: Christine Pace, Andrew Ellner

BYLINE: By PAULA SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Dr. Christine Angele Pace and Dr. Andrew Lee Ellner were married Saturday in New York. Dr. Jane S. Sillman, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated at the Manhattan Penthouse.
 Dr. Pace, 30, is a third-year resident in internal medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where Dr. Ellner, 34, provides primary care and also studies health systems for disadvantaged populations. 
 The bride She graduated summa cum laude from Williams College and received her medical degree from Harvard. She is a daughter of the Rev. Suzanne Wiedel-Pace and Eric D. Pace, both of New York. Her father retired as a reporter for The New York Times. Her mother is a hospital chaplain, most recently at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. 
 The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, where he also received his medical degree. He holds a master's in science from the London School of Economics. He is the son of Brenda Ellner of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Dr. Jerrold J. Ellner of West Orange, N.J. His mother is president of HourPower, a watch maker,in Kirtland, Ohio. His father is a professor and the chief of infectious diseases at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center. 
 Dr. Ellner was a resident in internal medicine at Harvard in July 2005 when he met Dr. Pace, then a third-year medical student, during a clinical rotation at Faulkner Hospital in Boston. 
 ''In a totally exhausted, delirious moment,'' Dr. Pace said she mistook him for her resident supervisor, who she had seen only once previously and who was also a tall, dark-haired man. She began talking to him about one of her patients before she realized her mistake.
 ''I was amused and I thought she was cute so I let her talk for a while before I corrected her,'' Dr. Ellner said.
 Over the next five months, their paths would occasionally cross, but at the time, Dr. Ellner was not open to a relationship with another physician. ''I had this notion it would be nice not to have to talk about medicine all the time,'' he recalled.
 One day, Dr. Ellner said, ''She followed me into the library,'' where he happened to mention his work for a medical publishing journal in London.
 That night she sent him an e-mail message asking his advice on getting published. ''That's probably the bravest thing I've ever done,'' said Dr. Pace, adding that she had told her twin sister she was frustrated with ''drifting along'' in her romantic life and ''not taking responsibility for choosing people that I really liked.'' 
 After he received the message, he came to recognize his attraction for Dr. Pace and suggested they get together for drinks. 
 ''I liked him after the date but a little part of my brain wondered if he was a little more arrogant than I expected,'' Dr. Pace said. She had forgotten to ask him about the medical journal so as he was dropping her off he suggested they meet again to discuss it.
 By the third date she began to admire his many qualities, including his volunteer work providing medical care to the homeless. ''It was this good luck that he is an incredibly good person I could actually fall in love with,'' she said.
 By then, Dr. Ellner said he had overcome his own reservations about dating a doctor.

HEADLINE: Air Quality Is Now an Inside Job

BYLINE: By KIRK SEAMAN

 BODY:
WHEN the Ecology Center, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, released its 2009 guide to toxic chemicals in cars in September, the results held a pleasant surprise. For the first time since the center began rating vehicle interiors in 2007, a car built in the United States by a Detroit automaker had the lowest levels of toxic chemicals among all the models evaluated.
 The vehicle that earned the best rating was the Cobalt from General Motors' Chevrolet division, a compact whose low price appeals to customers eager to buy a factory-fresh car. The good grades indicate that Cobalt buyers will have a much lower chance of encountering one of the least appealing aspects of owning a new vehicle: chemical odors in the car that are strong enough to make occupants ill. 
''What many refer to as new-car smell is actually the result of chemicals in the car's interior being released into the passenger compartment,'' said Jeff Gearhart, research director for the Ecology Center, based in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''When inhaled, some of these chemicals can have serious effects on the health of vehicle occupants.'' 
 The Cobalt had the least amount of worrisome chemicals in its interior plastics and textiles, earning a rating of 0.7 on the center's scale, which assigns a 5.0 rating for the worst offender; a vehicle with no detectable levels of chemicals would receive a rating of 0.0. (A Cobalt twin, the 2009 Pontiac G5, earned a slightly better rating, but it is no longer produced.) 
 The vehicle with the worst rating on the 2009 list was the Chevrolet Aveo, made in South Korea, at 4.9. The full study can be found at HealthyStuff.org.
 Chemicals known to be harmful to humans that showed up in the center's testing included antimony, bromine, chlorine and lead. Repeated and concentrated exposure to these chemicals can contribute to a variety of health concerns, including birth defects, learning impairment and liver damage, the center says. 
 With the average American spending almost two hours a day as a driver or a passenger, according to the Ecology Center, there is ample opportunity for exposure to these toxic chemicals. What's more, heat and ultraviolet light from the sun can increase the levels of these chemicals in the interior and possibly increase their toxicity. Children, whose bodies are still developing, are the most vulnerable to exposure.
 Visible evidence of chemicals being released into interiors can be seen in the form of a hazy film that sometimes fogs the inside of windshields. This occurs when chemicals in the interior plastics and textiles evaporate and then condense on the windshield or windows. This process accelerates in high temperatures. 
 Since the mid-1990s, the Ecology Center has worked with automakers to encourage the use of less toxic interior materials. According to the 2009 guide, the efforts are paying off: the Cobalt rated not only as the best vehicle tested this year, but as the fourth-best vehicle in the history of the center's testing. 
 ''We're pleased with the performance of the Cobalt in this report,'' said Doug Pickett, engineering group manager for interior materials at G.M. ''The fact that six of the best vehicles by type are from G.M. shows that this issue has been important to us for a while.''
 Mr. Pickett explained that the Aveo's poor showing was a matter of that car's older design and technology. ''Materials are getting better as models move through their product cycle,'' he said. ''We are listening to our customers. What is important to them, like less toxic interiors, is important to us.''
 Working with automotive suppliers and the plastics industry has proved essential to G.M. and other automakers in developing and manufacturing plastics that contain less harmful chemicals. 
 ''Rather than dictate how to formulate plastics, we provide a list of more than 100 chemicals banned in our vehicles, including formaldehyde and Class 1 carcinogens such as benzene,'' Mr. Pickett said. ''This approach helps ensure the plastic is safe and remains safe throughout its life cycle.'' 
 Using less toxic materials isn't just good for vehicle occupants -- it also benefits assembly workers and helps to reduce the environmental considerations at the end of the vehicle's useful life. ''When a vehicle is scrapped, the majority of its plastics often end up in a landfill,'' Mr. Gearhart said. ''This releases both known and unknown chemical hazards.'' 
 Mr. Gearhart recommended that shoppers use the Ecology Center's guide much as they would use a Consumer Reports survey or E.P.A. fuel economy figures. ''Consumers can use it to identify vehicles they want to shop, and then arrange an extended test drive to note any possible sensitivities,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Finding New Meaning in a Pageant of Dreams

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
EARLY in the first act of the new Broadway revival of the 1998 musical based on E. L. Doctorow's novel ''Ragtime,'' arriving immigrants troop through an abstract, high-vaulted structure that evokes Ellis Island. So when it came time to arrange a photo shoot of the creative team behind the show, which opens Nov. 15 at the Neil Simon Theater, the real Ellis Island seemed the logical place to go. 
 Mr. Doctorow was also invited along, and so it was that on Columbus Day he found himself strolling through the hall that offered millions of people their first glimpse of the United States and looking at photographs of people like some of those he portrayed in ''Ragtime.'' Afterward, at an outdoor cafe that offered a view of the Statue of Liberty, he discussed his novel's fitful evolution into a Broadway musical.
 ''They've constructed a show that is quite loyal to the book and has great integrity,'' he said. ''The novel, which keeps a certain ironic distance from the characters, is different in tone from the show, where people are openly expressing and singing their feelings. My feeling is that they all thought they were writing a musical, but they ended up with an iconic American opera.'' 
 ''Ragtime'' was originally published in 1975, in the prelude to what Mr. Doctorow called ''the self-congratulation'' of the Bicentennial, and nowadays is a fixture on college and high school reading lists. Set in the opening years of the last century, it mixed historical figures including J. P. Morgan and Harry Houdini with the interconnected but fictional stories of three very different families: one of prosperous suburban WASPs, another of struggling Jewish immigrants and the last constructed around a black honky-tonk pianist. 
 In 1981 there was a movie version, which Mr. Doctorow considers ''rather flatfooted, because it tried to assume that you were watching real life when this is not a realistic novel.'' In contrast, the musical, especially the new production, embraces ''the fact that you are watching an art object,'' he said, and registers not as a period piece but as something contemporary. 
 ''It has meanings now that were not apparent in the first version,'' Mr. Doctorow said. ''It seems to have more relevance today than it did in 1998. It's more fluent, and probably more exciting.''
 The show's director, Marcia Milgrom Dodge, explained that when she was hired last year, the producers told her that she should ''make it a 'Ragtime' for now.'' She took that to mean she needed to preserve the novel's unblinking portrayal of injustice and social turbulence without losing sight of a certain underlying optimism. 
 ''People identify with the timeliness, the idea that America is still the land of dreams,'' said Ms. Dodge, who is probably best known for her revamp of ''Seussical,'' the musical based on the stories of Dr. Seuss. ''The sociopolitical themes that run rampant through this story are still happening now. There is still bigotry, and we are in a huge economic disaster. Yet at the same time we are hopeful because we elected a black man as president, and he just won the Nobel Peace Prize.'' 
 With so many characters ''Ragtime'' is an ensemble piece, and in some respects the cast itself also reflects the moment. Stephanie Umoh, who plays Sarah, the role for which Audra McDonald won one of the four Tony Awards that went to the original production, has a father who is an immigrant from Nigeria, a mother from Illinois who is of Irish-German descent, and a soaring, sincere singing style. 
 ''It's so crazy perfect that this show is happening right now,'' said Ms. Umoh, who is making her first Broadway appearance at 23 and is barely a year out of college. ''It's not just that it's the Obama era, but that issues of immigration and race and terrorism are still relevant.'' 
 As originally staged in 1998, just before the dot-com bubble burst, ''Ragtime'' was a lavish $10 million production with a series of dazzling sets and props, including fireworks, and a working Model-T Ford. The new version is more streamlined: it shies away from the ornate in favor of a single all-purpose set that suggests locations as diverse as a tenement and a luxury ocean liner, and it employs the mere framework of a piano and an automobile as symbolic representations of the objects themselves. 
 ''When you do a revival, you don't want to do a reproduction of the original,'' said the playwright Terrence McNally, whose adaptation of Mr. Doctorow's novel also won a Tony. ''This is a fresh look at this material. But it's not a new version in terms of text and score.'' The new production of ''Ragtime'' may still clock in at just short of two and a half hours, but at least 15 minutes have been trimmed from the original version, in part due to the new staging. Much of the rest is what Ms. Dodge calls ''judicious nips and tucks'' to the Tony Award-winning score, with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, and music by Stephen Flaherty, who as a teenager actually played piano in a ragtime band.
 Unlike some of the adaptations the songwriting team has done in the past, in working from Mr. Doctorow's novel ''the problem is not how to flesh out and make clearer, but how to condense and make clearer,'' Ms. Ahrens said. As a result, she added, ''everything is compressed, to make it more intimate and powerful.''
 Bobby Steggert is cast as the younger brother in the WASP family, in Mr. McNally's estimation, the ''essential character in the piece.'' Mr. Steggert, 28, recalls seeing the original ''Ragtime'' from a balcony seat when he was a student at New York University. ''I knew the score and loved every bit of it,'' he said, ''but what I thought was missing was a clearer way to tell the story, and I think that is what we solved.'' 
 '' 'Ragtime' is in the tradition of 'Showboat' and 'South Pacific,' stories with a lot of plot, a moral fabric to the center of them and a real involvement with the society we live in,'' Mr. McNally said. ''This is not musical comedy, but we are part of a very long tradition with this show.''

HEADLINE: Love in the Time of Cellphones

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Cellphones, Texts and Lovers,'' by David Brooks (column, Nov. 3):
 According to my own experiences and observations, I would say that the social behaviors that Mr. Brooks describes in today's world are not qualitatively any different from what went on in the past. What is different is the speed and volume with which they occur.
 People have always had potential partners on ''back-burners.'' They have always had a ''series of marketing strategies.'' They have always been ''enmeshed in blizzards of supply and demand signals amidst a universe of potential partners.'' 
 And they have most certainly tried ''to establish different kinds of romantic attachments with different people at the same time.''
 Technology hasn't changed the basics of human behavior. It has just given people the tools to practice the same human foibles with greater speed and less expense and to expand our social network to the entire world instead of the small neighborhoods in which we grew up.
 Benjamin H. Bloom Philadelphia, Nov. 3, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 Like many writers and researchers, David Brooks is stuck in the 20th century with regard to romance. Postmodern love, however, takes place in a new era where time, distance, speed and place govern all human relationships.
 Text messaging is an example. Texting allows for ''brutal honesty,'' as one research participant told me. This is a higher state of social evolution, not a ''roadblock,'' as Mr. Brooks would have it.
 I'd like to note, also, that the majority of young adults reject the kind of no-strings-attached sexuality that he describes.
 Billy Lee Kidd Portland, Ore., Nov. 3, 2009
 The writer is a psychologist who researches romantic relationships.
 To the Editor:
 I enjoyed reading David Brooks's column about people using social networking technologies to cruise for casual sex with multiple partners. But Mr. Brooks romanticizes the past and demonizes the present.
 If he wants to fret over a technology that undermined permanence and commitment, he should look to the automobile, which made it exponentially easier for young people to spend unchaperoned time together.
 In the book ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America,'' John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman noted that ''cars provided privacy and marked the end of the 'gentleman caller' who sat in the parlor.''
 Mr. Brooks writes as if the technology motivated the behavior, when it is at least as likely that the desire for a different way of interacting is what generated the technology.
 He laments a bygone era of stability, reciprocity and trust. But were stability and reciprocity ever real, and was that trust ever warranted? Our history of domestic violence, adultery, prostitution and divorce would suggest otherwise.
 Perhaps new social networking technologies provide an alternative to a ''pattern of being'' that was as coercive as it was comforting.
 Michael Broder Brooklyn, Nov. 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 No one who has read Jane Austen's novels would believe, as David Brooks argues, that modern technology has only recently changed romantic life into an economy of crossing supply and demand curves of potential partners. 
 The ''Happy Days''-era courtship rules were the product of a specific time and place, and their putative normality and universality are the figments of nostalgic imagination.
 Tony Bozanich New York, Nov. 3, 2009

HEADLINE: Jobless Recovery

 BODY:
If you are looking for an economic recovery you can believe in, the October employment report is not for you. 
 After contracting for a year and a half, the economy grew in the quarter that ended in September, driven largely by federal stimulus. But government spending, as large and as necessary as it has been, has not been enough to revive hiring. 
 Unemployment surged from 9.8 percent in September to 10.2 percent last month, its highest level since 1983. At the same time, the economy lost 190,000 more jobs. That means employers have eliminated 7.3 million positions since the recession began in December 2007. 
 As dreadful as they are, the headline numbers understate the severity of the problem. They also obscure an even grimmer fact: Unless there is more government support, it will take several years of robust economic growth -- by no means a sure thing -- to recoup the jobs that have been lost. 
 The unemployment rate includes only jobless people who have looked for work in the past four weeks. The underemployment rate -- which also includes jobless workers who have not recently looked for work and part-timers who need full-time work -- reached 17.5 percent in October. And the long-term unemployment rate -- the share of the unemployed population out of work for more than six months -- also continues to set records. It is now 35.6 percent.
 The official job-loss data also fail to take note of 2.8 million additional jobs needed to absorb new workers who have joined the labor force during the recession. When those missing jobs are added to the official total, the economy comes up short by 10.1 million jobs. 
 Taken together, the numbers paint this stark picture: At no time in post-World War II America has it been more difficult to find a job, to plan for the future, or -- for tens of millions of Americans -- to merely get by. 
 At a recent meeting at the White House to discuss job creation, President Obama said that ''bold, innovative action,'' would be needed -- from the administration, Congress and the private sector -- to undo the devastation in the labor market. Americans are waiting for Mr. Obama to lead the way. 
 There were good ideas floated at the White House meeting, including bolstered federal support for efforts to retrofit and weatherize homes and public buildings. There was also talk of using government money to establishing a so-called infrastructure bank that would issue bonds to help finance big construction projects.
 The country also needs a program that would create jobs for teenagers -- ages 16 to 19 -- whose unemployment rate is currently a record 27.6 percent. Deep and prolonged unemployment among the young is especially worrisome. It means they do not have a chance, and may never get the chance, to acquire needed skills, permanently hobbling their earnings potential. 
 We know that more stimulus spending and government programs are a fraught topic. But they are exactly what the country needs. It may be the only way to prevent a renewed downturn. And the only way to create the jobs needed to put Americans back to work. Those are the essential -- and missing -- ingredients of a sustained recovery.

HEADLINE: Labels and Gay Benefits in Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Lower taxes for gay couples who receive health benefits from employers. Nutrition labeling requirements for snack food sold in vending machines and many restaurants. A new program to teach parents how to interact with their children.
 Those are some of the little-noticed provisions in a mammoth health care bill taken up Saturday by the House of Representatives. 
 The main purpose of the bill is to make health insurance readily available to all Americans. To that end, it would expand Medicaid and provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to help moderate-income people buy insurance. 
 As a high-priority bill for Congressional leaders and President Obama, the legislation has become a vehicle for many other initiatives large and small.
 Supporters of gay rights have long been trying to change the tax treatment of health benefits provided by employers to the domestic partners of their employees. In effect, such benefits are now treated as taxable income for the employee, and the employer may owe payroll taxes on their fair-market value. 
 Under the bill, such benefits would be tax-free, just like health benefits provided to the family of an employee married to a person of the opposite sex.
 Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, who proposed the change, said it would ''correct a longstanding injustice, end a blatant inequity in the tax code and help make health care coverage more affordable for more Americans.''
 Joseph R. Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, said federal tax law had not kept up with changes in the workplace.
 ''I meet people all the time who are gratified they work for companies that offer domestic partner benefits,'' he said. ''But they pass on the benefits because they cannot afford the taxes that go with the benefits.'' 
 M. V. Lee Badgett, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said employees with domestic partner benefits paid $1,100 a year more in taxes, on average, than married employees with the same coverage. 
 Another provision of the bill would establish the new labeling requirements for vending machines. Anyone who owns or operates 20 or more vending machines would have to ''provide a sign in close proximity to each article of food or the selection button that includes a clear and conspicuous statement disclosing the number of calories contained in the article,'' the bill says.
 Margo G. Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a research and advocacy group, said the data would be helpful.
 ''People do not realize that some orange juice has as many calories as sugar-sweetened soft drinks,'' Ms. Wootan said. ''Some granola bars have as many calories as candy bars.''
 The National Automatic Merchandising Association, which represents manufacturers and suppliers of vending machines, estimated that it would cost the industry $56 million to prepare for compliance with the disclosure requirement. In later years, vendors would need to update the information as they offered new products ranging from sticky buns to tortilla chips.
 Under the bill, chain restaurants with more than 20 locations would have to provide a calorie count for each standard menu item. The data would have to be displayed on the menu ''in a clear and conspicuous manner.'' Salad bars and cafeterias could satisfy the requirement by placing little signs next to items. The requirements would apply to restaurants as diverse as McDonald's, Burger King, Ruth's Chris Steak House and the Capital Grille.
 Chain restaurants would also have to make available, on request, written information about fat, cholesterol, sodium and carbohydrates in menu items.
 Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, who championed the requirements, said they would promote good health, help prevent chronic disease and obesity and thus lower health costs.
 ''If someone walks into McDonald's,'' Ms. DeLauro said, ''they should be able to see exactly how many calories are in a Big Mac, just as they would if they were eating a frozen pizza from the supermarket.''
 The National Restaurant Association supported the labeling requirements, saying uniform national standards would be better than a patchwork of local rules. But the association took no position on the overall bill. By contrast, in 1994, leaders of the trade group campaigned against President Bill Clinton's plan for universal health insurance, saying it would crush small businesses.
 The House bill this year would create many new programs. It would, for example, provide grants to states for ''home visitation'' programs in which nurses and social workers counsel pregnant women and new mothers in low-income families.
 A social worker could coach adults on ''parenting practices'' and teach skills needed to ''interact with their child to enhance age-appropriate development.''
 In his budget, Mr. Obama proposed a similar program, saying it could reduce child abuse, help prepare children for school and save money for Medicaid.
 Other provisions instruct federal officials to ''give priority'' to construction of Indian health clinics in Minnesota, Nevada and New Mexico; provide scholarships for training veterinarians, among others; and require health plans to pay a fee -- perhaps $2 a year for each subscriber -- to finance research comparing the effectiveness of different treatments.

HEADLINE: The Night They Drove the Tea Partiers Down

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
FOR all cable news's efforts to inflate Election 2009 into a cliffhanger as riveting as Balloon Boy, ratings at MSNBC and CNN were flat Tuesday night. But not at Fox News, where the audience nearly doubled its usual prime-time average. That's what happens when you have a thrilling story to tell, and what could be more thrilling than a revolution playing out in real time? 
 As Fox kept insisting, all eyes were glued on Doug Hoffman, the insurgent tea party candidate in New York's 23rd Congressional District. A ''tidal wave'' was on its way, said Sean Hannity, and the right would soon ''take back the Republican Party.'' The race was not ''even close,'' Bill O'Reilly suggested to the pollster Scott Rasmussen, who didn't disagree. When returns showed Hoffman trailing, the network's resident genius, Karl Rove, knowingly reassured viewers that victory was in the bag, even if we'd have to stay up all night waiting for some slacker towns to tally their votes. 
 Alas, the Dewey-beats-Truman reveries died shortly after midnight, when even Fox had to concede that the Democrat, Bill Owens, had triumphed in what had been Republican country since before Edison introduced the light bulb. For the far right, the thriller in Watertown was over except for the ludicrous morning-after spin that Hoffman's loss was really a victory. For the Democrats, the excitement was just beginning. New York's 23rd could be celebrated as a rare bright spot on a night when the party's gubernatorial candidates lost in Virginia and New Jersey. 
 The Democrats' celebration was also premature: Hoffman's defeat is potentially more harmful to them than to the Republicans. Tuesday's results may be useless as a predictor of 2010, but they are not without value as cautionary tales. And the most worrisome for Democrats were not in Virginia and New Jersey, but, paradoxically, in the New York contests where they performed relatively well. That includes the idiosyncratic New York City mayor's race that few viewed as a bellwether of anything. It should be the most troubling of them all for President Obama's cohort -- even though neither Obama nor the national political parties were significant players in it. 
 But first let's make a farewell accounting of the farce upstate. The reason why the Democratic victory in New York's 23rd is a mixed blessing is simple: it increases the odds that the Republicans will not do Democrats the great favor of committing suicide between now and the next Election Day. 
 This race was a damaging setback for the hard right. Hoffman had the energetic support of Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh and Fox as well as big bucks from their political auxiliaries. Furthermore, Hoffman was running not only in a district that Rove himself described as ''very Republican'' but one that fits the demographics of the incredibly shrinking G.O.P. The 23rd is far whiter than America as a whole -- 93 percent versus 74 -- with tiny sprinklings of blacks, Hispanics and Asians. It has few immigrants. It's rural. Its income and education levels are below the norm. Only if the district were situated in Dixie -- or Utah -- could it be a more perfect fit for the narrow American demographic where the McCain-Palin ticket had its sole romps last year.
 If the tea party right can't win there, imagine how it might fare in the nation where most Americans live. Some G.O.P. leaders have started to notice. Mitt Romney didn't endorse Hoffman despite right-wing badgering to do so. On Wednesday, Michael Steele dismissed the right's mantra that somehow Hoffman's loss could be called a victory and instead talked up the newly elected Republican governors who won by appealing to independents and moderates. Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell are plenty conservative, but both had rejected Palin's offers to campaign for them. They also avoided the tea party zanies, the fear-mongering National Organization for Marriage and the anti-abortion-rights zealots Hoffman embraced. They positioned themselves as respectful Obama critics, not haters likening him to Hitler. 
 In the aftermath of this clear-cut demonstration of how Republicans can win, the revolutionaries are still pledging to purge the party's moderates by rallying behind more Hoffmans in G.O.P. primaries from Florida to California. And they may get some scalps. But Tuesday's loss revealed that they're better at luring freak-show gawkers into Fox's tent than voters into the G.O.P.'s. As if to prove the point, protesters hoisted a sign likening health care reform to Dachau at the raucous tea party rally convened by Michele Bachmann on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
 Should the G.O.P. avoid self-destruction by containing this fringe, then the president and his party will have to confront their real problem: their identification with the titans who greased the skids for the economic meltdown from which Wall Street has recovered and the country has not. If there's one general lesson to be gleaned from Christie's victory over Jon Corzine in New Jersey, it's surely that in today's zeitgeist it's less of a stigma to be fat than a former Goldman Sachs fat cat, even in a blue state.
 Michael Bloomberg's shocking underperformance in New York was an even more dramatic illustration of this animus. Tuesday's exit polls found that he had a whopping 70 percent approval rating, as befits a mayor who, whatever his quirks and missteps, is widely regarded as a highly competent, nonideological executive who has run the city well. Yet only 72 percent of those who gave him a thumb's up voted for him. Though the mayor wildly outspent and out-campaigned his bland opponent, Bill Thompson, he received only 50.6 percent of the vote.
 This shortfall has been correctly attributed to Bloomberg's self-serving, highhanded undoing of the term limits law he had once endorsed. The ferocity of the public reaction to this power grab surprised him, pollsters and the press alike. That it became a bigger deal than anyone anticipated -- arguably bigger than it merited -- is an indicator of how much antipathy there is toward the masters of the universe in the financial capital. Americans don't hate rich people, but they do despise those who behave as if the rules don't apply to them. ''Michael Bloomberg is About to Buy Himself a Third Term'' was the cover line on New York magazine in October. However unfairly, some voters conflated his air of entitlement with the swaggering Wall Street C.E.O.'s who cashed out before the crash and stuck the rest of us with the bill.
 The Obama administration does not seem to understand that this rage, left unaddressed, could consume it. It has pushed aside the entreaties of many -- including Paul Volcker, the chairman of the White House's own Economic Recovery Advisory Board -- to break up too-big-to-fail banks. Those behemoths, cushioned by the government's bailouts, low-interest loans and guarantees, are back making bets that put the entire system at risk. Yet last Sunday, we once again heard the Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, on ''Meet the Press'' dodging questions about the banks in general and Goldman in particular with unpersuasive bromides. ''We're not going to let the system go back to the way it was,'' he said. 
 Surely he jests. On Monday morning, a business-savvy Democratic senator, Maria Cantwell of Washington, publicly questioned Geithner's fitness for his job, given his support of loopholes in proposed regulations of the derivatives that enabled last year's collapse. On Tuesday, Congressional Democrats, with the White House's consent, voted to gut the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the post Enron-WorldCom law passed in 2002 to prevent corporate accounting tricks and fraud. Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, told me on Friday it was ''surreal'' that Democrats were now achieving the long-held Republican goal of smashing ''the golden chalice'' of reform. If investors cannot have transparency, Levitt said, ''the whole system is worthless.'' 
 The system is going back to the way it was with a vengeance, against a backdrop of despair. As the unemployment rate crossed the 10 percent threshold at week's end, we learned that bankers were helping themselves not just to bonuses as large as those at the bubble's peak but to early allotments of H1N1 vaccine. No wonder 62 percent of those polled by Hart Associates in late September felt that ''large banks'' had been helped ''a lot'' or ''a fair amount'' by ''government economic policies,'' but only 13 percent felt the ''average working person'' had been. Unemployment ranked ahead of the deficit and health care as the No. 1 pocketbook issue in the survey, with 81 percent saying the Obama administration must take more action.
 The tea party Republicans vanquished on Tuesday have no jobs plan. They just want to eliminate all Washington spending -- a prescription that didn't go down too well in New York's 23rd, where the federal government has the largest payroll. The G.O.P. establishment's one-size-fits-all panacea is tax cuts -- thin gruel for those with little or no taxable income. The administration's answer is the stimulus, whose iffy results so far, it argues, can't be judged this early on.
 Fair enough. But a year from now the public will register its verdict in any event. Meanwhile, both parties have their own delusions, not the least of which is the Republicans' conviction that Tuesday was a referendum on what Obama has done so far. If anything, it was a judgment on just how much he has not.

HEADLINE: Reset Nov. 1 - 7

 BODY:
THE NEWS Republicans may have emerged from last week's elections in a position to turn back the political wave President Obama unleashed last year.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Victories in governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia highlighted the president's trouble in transforming his victory into a sustained advantage for Democrats. Independents who voted for him in those states shifted to the Republican candidates, who played down their conservative social views and focused on jobs and the economy. Michael Steele, the party's chairman, cast the victories as signs of a Republican renaissance. 
 THE NEWS Despite its victories, the Republican Party faces another battle: an internal clash between the party establishment and conservative activists over what the G.O.P. stands for.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The contours of that fight unfolded in a reliably Republican Congressional district in upstate New York. A Democrat won there after a conservative insurgency forced out a moderate Republican candidate who supported abortion rights and gay rights. Conservatives vowed to continue to oppose centrist Republicans, a prospect that worries party leaders as they head into 2010.
 THE NEWS Worried Democrats in Congress debated the political implications of their ambitious legislative agenda in the wake of the elections.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Many said the results should give new urgency to their proposals. But they still face a political dilemma. Should they try to motivate the party's core supporters by taking a liberal approach -- a public health insurance option, for instance? Or do they adopt a more moderate approach thinking that will win back independents and protect vulnerable Democrats? ''We have to do something,'' said one freshman Democrat, ''but it has to be right.''
 THE NEWS The coalition that elected Mr. Obama was largely absent from last week's election, and one important constituency, independents, voted for Republicans in big numbers.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Many of the young, African-American and first-time voters who voted for Mr. Obama stayed home. One analyst, Amy Walter of The Hotline, said this ''enthusiasm gap'' could hurt Democrats in marginal or swing districts next year. Another big worry for Democrats: independent voters. In New Jersey, there was a 12-point swing away from Democrats; in Virginia, the swing was 13 points.
 THE NEWS Some gay-rights advocates were reassessing their strategy on same-sex marriage after Maine voters repealed a law allowing such unions.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Advocates have sought to build a case for same-sex marriage state by state. But Maine unexpectedly became the 31st state to reject those unions through a public referendum. Some advocates may now seek a repeal of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. A major legal offensive is also underway in California, where a federal lawsuit is challenging a ballot measure that overturned a State Supreme Court ruling allowing same-sex unions.

HEADLINE: Britain and U.S. Clash Over a Financial Tax to Insure Against Bank Crises

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: ST. ANDREWS, Scotland 

 BODY:
The United States and Britain voiced disagreement Saturday over a proposal that would impose a new tax on financial transactions to support future bank rescues.
 Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, leading a meeting here of finance ministers from the Group of 20 rich and developing countries, said such a tax on banks should be considered as a way to take the burden off taxpayers during periods of financial crisis. His comments pre-empted the International Monetary Fund, which is set to present a range of options next spring to ensure financial stability. 
 But the proposal was met with little enthusiasm by the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who told Sky News in an interview that he would not support a tax on everyday financial transactions. Later he seemed to soften his position, saying it would be up to the I.M.F. to present a range of possible measures. 
 ''We want to make sure that we don't put the taxpayer in a position of having to absorb the costs of a crisis in the future,'' Mr. Geithner said after the Sky News interview. ''I'm sure the I.M.F. will come up with some proposals.''
 The Russian finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, also said he was skeptical of such a tax. Similar fees had been proposed by Germany and France but rejected by Mr. Brown's government in the past as too difficult to manage. But Mr. Brown is now suggesting ''an insurance fee to reflect systemic risk or a resolution fund or contingent capital arrangements or a global financial transaction levy.''
 Supporters of a tax had argued that it would reduce the volatility of markets; opponents said it would be too complex to enact across borders and could create huge imbalances. Mr. Brown said any such tax would have to be applied universally.
 ''It cannot be acceptable that the benefits of success in this sector are reaped by the few but the costs of its failure are borne by all of us,'' Mr. Brown said at the summit. ''There must be a better economic and social contract between financial institutions and the public based on trust and a just distribution of risks and rewards.''
 At the meeting at the Scottish golf resort, the last to be hosted by Britain during its turn leading the group, the ministers agreed on a detailed timetable to achieve balanced economic growth and reiterated a pledge not to withdraw any economic stimulus until a recovery was certain. 
 They also committed to enact limits on bonuses and force banks to hold more cash reserves. But they failed to reach an agreement on how to finance a new climate change deal ahead of a crucial meeting in Copenhagen next month.
 The finance ministers agreed that economic and financial conditions had improved but that the recovery was ''uneven and remains dependent on policy support,'' according to a statement released by the group. The weak condition of the economy was illustrated Friday by new data showing the unemployment rate in the United States rising to 10.2 percent in October, the highest level in 26 years. 
 The finance ministers also acknowledged that withdrawing stimulus packages required a balancing act to avoid stifling the economic recovery that has just begun. 
 ''If we put the brakes on too quickly, we will weaken the economy and the financial system, unemployment will rise, more businesses will fail, budget deficits will rise, and the ultimate cost of the crisis will be greater,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''It is too early to start to lean against recovery.''
 As part of the group's global recovery plan, the United States would aim to increase its savings rate and reduce its trade deficit while countries like China and Germany would reduce their dependence on exports. Economic imbalances were widely faulted as helping to bring about the global economic downturn.
 Mr. Geithner acknowledged on Saturday that the changes would take time but that ''what we are seeing so far has been encouraging.''

HEADLINE: The Words That Once Soared

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
-- As the most gifted orator of his generation, President Obama finds speechmaking perhaps his most potent political tool. It propelled him to national prominence in 2004 and to the White House in 2008. And whenever he needs to calm economic fears or revive stalled health care legislation, he takes to the lectern.
 But the limits of rhetoric were on display last week when the president could not rescue two foundering candidates in governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia. Has Mr. Obama lost his oratorical touch? Is the magic finally beginning to fade? Does the White House rely too heavily on his skills on the stump to advance his priorities? 
 It may be too soon to reach such conclusions. The Democrats who lost last week, after all, had fatal flaws all their own. But the results do suggest that Mr. Obama's addresses these days may not resonate quite the way they did. Speeches that once set pulses racing now feel more familiar. And if that remains the case heading into next year, it could make it more difficult for the Democrats' own Great Communicator to promote his program and carry along allies in crucial midterm elections.
 ''Really inspirational speeches like the Iowa caucus victory speech set expectations for Obama's rhetoric that would have been difficult to meet, and he hasn't met them,'' said Michael J. Gerson, who was President George W. Bush's chief speechwriter. ''He's had one really large explanatory task, which is trying to motivate people on health care reform, and the polls have gone the other way. He will now have another very difficult task, to explain his Afghan policy, whatever it is, to a country that's deeply skeptical.''
 Speechmaking as a president often presents a sharper challenge than it does on the campaign trail. The audience is different, the desired goals are different, the platform is different. Selling another candidate, as Mr. Obama tried to do for Jon Corzine in New Jersey and Creigh Deeds in Virginia, is invariably harder than selling yourself. And pushing policies requires more explanation than inspiration.
 ''The difference now is it's much more difficult to have to explain complicated policies consistently day in and day out,'' said Josh Gottheimer, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who now teaches the history of presidential speechwriting and is working on a book on the subject. ''The stakeholders have changed. Congress matters a lot more. When you're on the campaign trail, they don't matter as much.''
 Unlike Mr. Bush, who recognized his limitations as a public speaker, Mr. Obama and his team have enormous faith in his capacity for communicating with the American people. When he was considering a bailout for the auto industry and advisers warned of a popular backlash, he expressed confidence that he could explain it to the public. After Mr. Obama gave his speech in Cairo reaching out to the Muslim world, some aides argued that the address itself was responsible for Iranians taking to the streets of Tehran to protest a disputed election.
 But David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said the White House is realistic. ''No one ever believed that the power of communicating was in and of itself enough,'' he said. ''It's important to communicate what you're doing and why. But without the what and the why, the communicating is of little value.''
 ''I think it continues to be valuable,'' he added. ''But ultimately we're going to be judged not on the power of the oratory but the record. Everybody here understands that.''
 Presidential speeches used to be much rarer than they are today, reserved more for strategic moments. These days, in a hyperactive media environment, presidents talk publicly two or three times a day. Harry S. Truman spoke in public 88 times in a typical year, according to ''POTUS Speaks,'' the memoir of Michael Waldman, who was Mr. Clinton's chief speechwriter. By contrast, Ronald Reagan made 320 public remarks in a typical year and Mr. Clinton, 550.
 With the help of six speechwriters led by Jon Favreau, Mr. Obama is on pace to match Mr. Clinton and likely exceed him, according to White House officials. On any given day, Mr. Obama may address the Tribal Nations Conference and also tape a video speech to grassroots volunteers, to name a couple of examples from a single day last week.
 ''When you do four or five speeches a day, not any single speech is going to be the biggest speech he ever does,'' said one White House official who requested anonymity to speak more candidly. ''In a media environment like this, the attention span is rather short so it may seem like the magic isn't there. But there are still moments when he rises to the occasion when he needs to.''
 Mr. Obama's aides point to several such moments this year -- his first address to a joint session of Congress as he was advocating a large spending package to stimulate the economy, his speech at Georgetown University laying out his vision of a ''new foundation'' for a post-recession nation, his Cairo speech, his commencement address at Notre Dame where he tried to bridge the divide over abortion and his September return to Congress to argue for his health care plan.
 While Mr. Gerson contends that months of Obama speeches have not erased deep public concerns with his health care plan, Geoff Garin, a Democratic strategist, called the address to Congress ''the best policy address by a president since Lyndon Johnson talked about the Voting Rights Act in 1965.'' Following an August dominated by attacks on the health care plan, Mr. Garin said Mr. Obama ''was able to lift a debate that had got stuck in the mud up to a much higher place and let Obama and supporters of health care reform retake the high ground.''
 But the risk for any president is that at some point the public begins to tune out. ''President Bush in 2007 actually gave some pretty good speeches about Iraq and nobody was paying attention anymore and so it just didn't matter,'' Mr. Garin said. ''People still pay attention to President Obama. But did anybody hear his speech about education reform in Wisconsin the other day? Of course not.''

HEADLINE: Sweeping Health Care Overhaul Passes the House

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ROBERT PEAR; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Handing President Obama a hard-fought victory, the House narrowly approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation's health care system on Saturday night, advancing legislation that Democrats said could stand as their defining social policy achievement. 
 After a daylong clash with Republicans over what has been a Democratic goal for decades, lawmakers voted 220 to 215 to approve a plan that would cost $1.1 trillion over 10 years. Democrats said the legislation would provide overdue relief to Americans struggling to buy or hold on to health insurance.
 ''This is our moment to revolutionize health care in this country,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and one of the chief architects of the bill.
 Democrats were forced to make major concessions on insurance coverage for abortions to attract the final votes to secure passage, a wrenching compromise for the numerous abortion-rights advocates in their ranks. 
 Many of them hope to make changes to the amendment during negotiations with the Senate, which will now become the main battleground in the health care fight as Democrats there ready their own bill for what is likely to be extensive floor debate.
 Democrats say the House measure -- paid for through new fees and taxes, along with cuts in Medicare -- would extend coverage to 36 million people now without insurance while creating a government health insurance program. It would end insurance company practices like not covering pre-existing conditions or dropping people when they become ill. 
 Republicans condemned the vote and said they would oppose the measure as it proceeds on its legislative route. ''This government takeover has got a long way to go before it gets to the president's desk, and I'll continue to fight it tooth and nail at every turn,'' said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas. ''Health care is too important to get it wrong.''
 On the House floor, Democrats exchanged high-fives and cheered wildly -- and Republicans sat quietly -- when the tally display showed the 218th and decisive vote, after the leadership spent countless hours in recent days wringing commitments out of House members. 
 ''We did what we promised the American people we would do,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, who also warned, ''Much work remains.''
 The successful vote came on a day when Mr. Obama traveled to Capitol Hill to make a personal appeal for lawmakers to ''answer the call of history'' and support the bill. 
 Only one Republican, Representative Anh Cao of Louisiana, voted for the bill, and 39 Democrats opposed it. The House also defeated the Republicans' more modest plan, whose authors said it was a more common-sense and fiscally responsible approach. 
 The Democrats who balked at the measure represent mainly conservative swing districts, signaling that those who could be vulnerable in next year's midterm elections viewed voting for the measure as politically risky.
 ''Today's may be a tough vote, but it was in 1935 when we passed Social Security,'' Representative John Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the dean of the House, said as the debate drew to a close late Saturday. 
 Some Democrats said they voted for the legislation so they could seek improvements in it. ''This bill will get better in the Senate,'' said Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who has been outspoken in his criticism of some provisions of the bill but decided to support it. ''If we kill it here, it won't have a chance to get better.''
 After the vote, Mr. Obama issued a statement praising the House and calling on the Senate to follow suit. ''I am absolutely confident it will,'' he said, ''and I look forward to signing comprehensive health insurance reform into law by the end of the year.''
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said he would bring a bill to the floor as soon as possible.
 The vote came on the third anniversary of the 2006 Democratic takeover of the House, and the passage moves the bill well beyond the health care overhaul attempted by President Bill Clinton in 1993. 
 Lawmakers credited Mr. Obama with converting a final few holdouts during his appearance at a closed-door meeting with Democrats just hours before the vote. Democratic officials said that Mr. Obama's conversation Saturday with Representative Michael H. Michaud, Democrat of Maine, was crucial in winning one final vote.
 Many Democrats also credited Speaker Nancy Pelosi for pulling off a victory that proved tougher than many had predicted. ''She really threaded the needle on this one,'' said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts.
 A critical turning point was the decision by Ms. Pelosi late Friday night to allow anti-abortion Democrats to try to tighten restrictions on coverage for the procedure under any insurance plan that receives federal money. That concession eased a threat by some Democrats to abandon the bill, but also left Democrats who support abortion rights facing a choice between backing a provision they bitterly opposed or scuttling the bill. The new abortion controls were added to the measure on a vote of 240 to 194. 
 Mr. Obama made his rare weekend appearance on Capitol Hill as part of an all-out effort to rally Democrats to support the biggest health care legislation since the creation of Medicare for the elderly four decades ago. 
 During the private meeting with Democrats in the Cannon Caucus Room, the president acknowledged the political difficulty of supporting major legislation in the face of unanimous Republican opposition and tough criticism from conservatives.
 But, those present said, he urged them on, saying, ''When I sign this in the Rose Garden, each and every one of you will be able to look back and say, 'This was my finest moment in politics.' ''
 Republicans said the measure was too costly and would end up burdening the nation for decades to come. Some Democrats expressed the same view in explaining their opposition.
 ''This bill is a wrecking ball to the entire economy,'' said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia. ''We need targeted specific reforms to help people who have fallen through the health care cracks.''
 But Democrats said that Republicans were intent on protecting the status quo in health care and that the new Democratic approach would vastly improve the ability of Americans to gain affordable health insurance.
 ''Now is the chance to fix our health care system and improve the lives of millions of Americans,'' Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee, said as she opened the daylong proceedings.
 The wall of Republican opposition gave Democrats little room to maneuver, and they worked to corral as many party members as they could. But the preliminary approval to clear the way for the debate came on a 242-to-192 vote, suggesting that Democrats had a victory within reach. 
 The House vote was a significant step in the long-sought Democratic goal of enacting broad changes in the way health care is delivered in the nation. But the Senate has yet to bring its own emerging measure to the floor for debate, and the two chambers will still need to negotiate and approve a final bill in the weeks ahead. 
 The struggle House Democrats had in lining up the minimum number of votes for the measure was a clear indication of how difficult it would be to get final legislation to the president's desk.
 The House legislation, running almost 2,000 pages, would require most Americans to obtain health insurance or face penalties -- an approach Republicans compared to government oppression. 
 Most employers would have to provide coverage or pay a tax penalty of up to 8 percent of their payroll. The bill would significantly expand Medicaid and would offer subsidies to help moderate-income people buy insurance from private companies or from a government insurance plan. It would also set up a national insurance exchange where people could shop for coverage.
 Republicans forced a House vote on their much more modest plan that would expand coverage to just three million of the uninsured. But its authors said it would bring down the costs of private insurance premiums, which they argued was the chief concern of most Americans.
 ''More taxes, more spending and more government is not the plan for reform the people support,'' said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina and one of the conservatives who relentlessly criticized the Democrats' plan.
 But Democrats said their proposal was long overdue, would relieve the mounting anxiety of Americans struggling to get and retain health insurance, and would ultimately improve the economy by bringing spiraling health care costs under control.
 ''Our plan is not perfect, but it is a good start toward providing affordable health care to all Americans,'' said Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon.

Require most employers to provide coverage to workers or pay a penalty. Prohibit insurers from limiting coverage or charging higher premiums because of a person's medical history or current illness. Create a national insurance exchange where small employers and people who are not insured through work or a public program can buy insurance. Offer a new government insurance plan in the exchange that would negotiate rates with doctors and hospitals. Expand Medicaid to all those with incomes less than 150 percent of the poverty level. Impose a surtax on couples with adjusted gross incomes over $1 million a year and individuals over $500,000. Trim Medicare payments to hospitals and many other health care providers. (A1)

HEADLINE: Northrop Agrees to Sell TASC Consulting Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Northrop Grumman agreed on Sunday to sell its TASC government consulting unit to the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic for $1.65 billion in cash, in another sign that private equity firms are back to their core business of deal-making. 
 The TASC sale follows last year's deal by the Carlyle Group for Booz Allen Hamilton's government consulting business.
 Northrop began talking about selling TASC, which provides technology consulting services, several months ago to satisfy stricter requirements on the conflicts of interest facing military contractors, according to a person briefed on the matter. These companies now cannot provide consulting services to the government while also trying to sell it products.
 Northrop's options included arranging an initial public offering of the unit, selling it to a strategic buyer or striking a deal with private equity firms. Of those, the last option emerged as the most attractive, allowing TASC to reap additional investment for expansion and for holding onto its management team, led by Wood Parker, the business's general manager and prospective chief executive.
 ''This transaction is in the best interest of Northrop Grumman's customers, employees and shareholders,'' Ronald D. Sugar, Northrop's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ''It reflects Northrop Grumman's desire to align quickly with the government's new organizational conflict of interest standards, while preserving TASC's unique organizational culture and its status as the advisory services employer of choice.''
 Based in Chantilly, Va., TASC has about 5,000 employees. Northrop said the unit expected to earn about $1.6 billion in revenue this year.
 Northrop said it expected to reap about $1.1 billion of net cash proceeds through the sale. It will use that money to buy back stock.
 The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
 Several other big private equity firms have announced leveraged buyouts over the last month, including the Blackstone Group's purchase of Anheuser-Busch InBev's theme parks and TPG and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board's acquisition of IMS Health.
 With the improvement of the credit markets over the last year, private equity firms have been able to put their billions of dollars in capital to use. Their investors, who had previously been reluctant to provide the money for new takeovers, are now pressing for more deal-making to see better returns on their capital.
 However, even the largest leveraged buyout this year, the $4 billion takeover of IMS, was dwarfed by the sweeping takeovers of TXU and Equity Office Properties in 2007. That is partially because private equity firms can borrow less debt for their deals.
 K.K.R. and General Atlantic will receive financing from Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank and RBC Capital Markets and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.
 Sunday's deal demonstrated some of K.K.R.'s efforts to expand its business and become less reliant on outside banks for help. Its KKR Capital Markets unit will arrange a sale of bonds supporting the transaction, having already lined up Highbridge Mezzanine Partners, a unit of Highbridge Capital Management, as the lead investor.

PERSON: J. Nicholas Counter III 

HEADLINE: J. Nicholas Counter III, 69, Labor Lawyer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
J. Nicholas Counter III, a lawyer who changed the face of labor relations in Hollywood during his long tenure as chief negotiator for hundreds of film and television companies, died on Friday after collapsing earlier at his home in the Bell Canyon community in Ventura County, California.
 Mr. Counter was 69. The cause has not been determined, said Jesse Hiestand, a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. 
Mr. Counter spent 27 years as president of the alliance, retiring in March. The industry group negotiates contracts with an array of unions, from creative guilds like the Directors Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America to the blue-collar Teamsters and the craft-oriented locals of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.
 Working mostly behind the scenes, Mr. Counter, who was known as Nick, concluded more than 300 labor agreements. Tall, gray-haired and affable, though his temper occasionally flared, he became a public presence only rarely. And that usually happened when things went wrong, as with a pair of bitterly fought Hollywood writers' strikes, in 1988 and 2007.
 When 12,000 members of the Writers Guild of America East and the Writers Guild of America West walked out over payments for new media and other issues in November 2007, Mr. Counter told reporters to expect a long strike. Much of Hollywood was shut down for three months, before the companies and the guilds reached an accord that only set the stage for the next battle -- with the Screen Actors Guild.
 Actors worked for nearly a year without a contract during a fractious negotiation that ended after Mr. Counter turned over leadership of the alliance to his protegee, Carol Lombardini.
 Yet Mr. Counter was best known inside Hollywood for having corralled the alliance's diverse and often contentious film and television companies into a bargaining unit that was sufficiently disciplined to strike deal after deal with only a handful of breakdowns over nearly three decades.
 ''I never knew him to break his word,'' said Gilbert Cates, the secretary-treasurer of the Directors Guild, who had squared off with Mr. Counter in a number of contract talks. ''It was really important, because he was giving his word for a lot of people who weren't necessarily in unison.''
 Before Mr. Counter joined the newly formed alliance in 1982, companies like 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures had drifted away from an earlier bargaining group to conduct negotiations on their own. 
 James Nicholas Counter was born in Phoenix on March 21, 1940, and grew up in Colorado, where his father, a steel-mill hand, worked his way into management.
 After graduating from the University of Colorado and receiving a law degree from Stanford, he practiced law in Los Angeles and represented the alliance's predecessor.
 Mr. Counter insisted that the film and television companies keep a united front, not so much to prevail over the unions as to avoid the chaos that had plagued earlier negotiations. He often said that labor talks should not have winners and losers. ''Negotiations just end with your ability to make a deal,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1987.
 He is survived by his wife, Jackie; a son, Nicholas; a daughter, Samantha Kurtzman-Counter; and a grandson.
 Mr. Counter was particularly proud of his service as a trustee of 14 union health and pension funds, and of the Motion Picture and Television Fund, an industry-oriented philanthropy. The well-being of those funds, which have been strained by rising costs and the prolonged economic downturn, are likely to be an issue in a next round of negotiations by the alliance.

PERSON: Nien Cheng 

HEADLINE: Nien Cheng, 94; Wrote of Prison in China

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Nien Cheng, whose memoir, ''Life and Death in Shanghai,'' offered a harrowing account of the Cultural Revolution in China and her years of imprisonment and torture at the hands of the Red Guards, died on Nov. 2 at her home in Washington. She was 94. 
 The cause was cardiovascular and renal disease, said Catherine Mack, the executor of her estate. 
 As the widow of a diplomat and businessman and an adviser to a foreign oil company, Mrs. Cheng found herself in a politically dangerous position as the Cultural Revolution gathered strength in the 1960s. In 1966 she was arrested by Red Guards and charged with espionage. 
 She spent the next six and a half years in solitary confinement at the No. 1 Detention House in Shanghai, harshly interrogated and beaten by her jailers, to whom she responded with defiance and mockery. 
 ''I grew up with a strong sense of loyalty, and duty, to my country,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1987. ''I felt humiliated that they should accuse me, who loved my country, of being a spy. I could not accept it, I had to fight. In prison sometimes I would get so mad -- I was rarely depressed -- by and large my predominant emotion was anger.''
 In 1973 she was told that the authorities had agreed to release her in recognition of an ''improvement in her way of thinking and an attitude of repentance.'' She refused to leave and vowed to stay in prison until the government declared her innocent and issued an apology in the press. 
 Astonished prison officials pushed her out the door, grumbling that ''in all the years of the detention house, we have never had a prisoner like you, so truculent and argumentative.'' 
 Once outside she learned that her only child, Meiping, an actress with the Shanghai Film Studio, was dead. The official explanation was suicide, but Mrs. Cheng learned that her daughter had been murdered by the Red Guards for refusing to denounce her mother as a class enemy. 
 In 1987, after emigrating to Canada and then the United States, Mrs. Cheng published her memoir, which began, memorably, with the sentence, ''The past is forever with me, and I remember it all.'' 
 The book won critical acclaim and became a best seller. Stanley Karnow, reviewing it in The Washington Post, echoed the prevailing critical response when he wrote that ''her narrative deserves to rank with the foremost prison diaries of our time.'' 
 Yao Nien was born on Jan. 28, 1915, in Beijing. Her father, the descendant of wealthy landowners, was a vice minister in the navy. In 1935 she went to study at the London School of Economics, where she became a fervent socialist and met her husband, Kang-chi Cheng. 
 Mr. Cheng entered the diplomatic service after returning to China and was posted to Australia, where he and Mrs. Cheng spent the war years, returning to China in 1948. 
 When Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists fled to Taiwan the next year, the Chengs remained in China. Mr. Cheng became the general manager for Shell Oil in Shanghai, and after his death in 1957 Mrs. Cheng became a special adviser to the company, negotiating its tenuous relationship with the new Communist government. 
 She later speculated that her interrogators were eager to compile evidence that would incriminate Zhou Enlai, the prime minister, who opposed the Cultural Revolution. Specifically, she theorized, they hoped to extract a confession that a business trip to Britain that she and her husband had taken with Zhou's approval was a spy mission.
 After being released from prison, Mrs. Cheng, still regarded as politically suspect, moved back into her house, now subdivided and occupied by numerous tenants. In 1980 she gained permission to leave China. Once abroad, she had access to money in her husband's overseas accounts and was able to live in relative comfort in Washington. 
 There are no immediate survivors. 
 ''She was a humble person,'' said James A. Dorn, the vice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute and a friend of Mrs. Cheng's. ''She said: 'I didn't really do anything. I just recorded what I saw, and I wrote it for my daughter.' ''

HEADLINE: Louisiana Republican Breaks Ranks on Health Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats were thrilled by the passage of their major health care legislation on Saturday, but were particularly tickled by denying Republicans a solid wall of opposition with the solitary vote of Representative Anh Cao of Louisiana.
 Mr. Cao, a freshman Republican from New Orleans and a Vietnamese-American representing a predominantly black district, was elected last year in an upset victory over Representative William J. Jefferson, a Democrat who was under indictment at the time and has since been convicted of federal corruption charges.
 ''I have a constitutional duty to make the right decision for my district whether or not the decision was popular,'' Mr. Cao said in an interview Sunday on CNN. 
 ''I had to make a decision of conscience based on the needs of the people of my district,'' he added. ''A lot of my constituents are uninsured, a lot of them are poor.'' 
 On his Web site, Mr. Cao said he had studied the entire health care bill, and in a statement posted shortly after the vote on Saturday, he said he had secured a personal commitment from President Obama on health issues important to Louisiana, including disparities in federal reimbursement rates for Medicaid. 
 ''I read the versions of the House bill. I listened to the countless stories of Orleans and Jefferson Parish citizens whose health care costs are exploding -- if they are able to obtain health care at all,'' the statement said. ''Louisianans need real options for primary care, for mental health care and for expanded health care for seniors and children.''
 And while many Democrats complained that tighter restrictions on insurance coverage for abortions had threatened support for the bill on their side, Mr. Cao, a onetime Jesuit seminarian, said those tougher restrictions were essential for his vote.
 Another reason Mr. Cao may have felt pressure to support the health care bill is that most of his constituents are Democrats. 
 In his campaign last year, he promised ethics and integrity.
 Mr. Cao, 42, who is known as Joseph, was born in Vietnam (he is the first Vietnamese-American member of Congress) and fled with two siblings after the fall of Saigon in 1975, moving to live with an uncle in Indiana. He holds a master's degree in philosophy from Fordham University and received a law degree from Loyola University.
 He also has a sense of humor. 
 In a recent blog post, he explained how to say his name.
 ''I humbly write you today to clarify the confusion surrounding my last name,'' Mr. Cao wrote. ''In recent days, I have acknowledged the blush on the faces of television reporters, my fellow statesmen, my own interns, and even the president of the United States as they grasp frantically at the correct pronunciation and inevitably cast upon a hurried 'Cow' or 'Chow.' '' 
 He continued: ''My last name -- Cao -- is actually pronounced (drumroll please) 'Gow.' It starts with a 'G','' he continuted, and and rhymes with 'Pow.'
 He signed the letter: ''Anh (pronounced Anh) Joseph (pronounced Joseph) Cao (pronounced? You guessed it! Gow) P.S. On second thought, never mind. Just call me Joseph.''
 Mr. Cao's vote offered a notable break in ranks for the House Republican minority, which has stayed unified on major political issues. On the economic stimulus measure, for instance, Republicans voted unanimously in opposition.
 But this was not the first time Mr. Cao has broken with his party. He was one of 29 Republicans to join Democrats this year in voting to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, which typically covers children whose families do not qualify for Medicaid.
 Democrats, teasingly, immediately claimed a mantle of bipartisanship for their health care legislation.
 ''This was, as you observed, a bipartisan vote,'' the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said at a news conference to celebrate the passage of the bill.
 Mr. Cao, who registered his decision near the end of the 15-minute voting period, quickly slipped out of the House chamber and eluded reporters. He is certain to enjoy a new political celebrity, though it is unclear whether it will help his political prospects.
 Democrats are already lining up to challenge Mr. Cao next year, and analysts consistently rate his district as among the most likely to flip to Democratic control.
 His vote for the health care legislation contrasted with the ''no'' vote by Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat from southern Louisiana, who is running for the Senate next year. 
 The only Republican senator to vote in favor of the health care legislation in the committee process was Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, but Ms. Snowe has since said she will oppose bringing up the bill for debate because the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, added a government plan to the bill.

HEADLINE: College Presidents' Salaries

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''23 Private College Presidents Made More Than $1 Million in 2008, Survey Finds'' (news article, Nov. 2) will understandably anger students and their parents whose tuition bills have for years been rising faster than inflation. 
 If higher salaries for administrators could be shown to enhance the fundamental purposes of a university -- teaching and research -- then the raises might be justified. But there is an important sense in which the higher pay actually does the opposite: it undermines those basic functions.
 It puts out the message that to succeed in academic life is to climb the administrative ladder: department chair, dean, provost, president. 
 Generally speaking, the further one goes on this ladder, the less teaching and research one does. In the end, a campus can have a Nobel Prize winner who is paid only a third of what the president gets, and the most brilliant teacher on campus will be paid even less. 
 The pattern sets up perverse incentives: Want to maximize your pay? Don't work too hard on teaching or research. ''Success'' lies elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Which Way Will Wind Power Blow?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Cape Wind'' (editorial, Nov. 2):
 As a lifelong resident of Falmouth on Cape Cod, I fully support the Wampanoag Indians' effort to block a wind power project and preserve an uncluttered view of the rising sun on Nantucket Sound. They are the people of the rising sun; it is their tribal identity. 
 Cape Cod is embracing ground-based wind technology wholeheartedly. There are wind turbines going up in Falmouth and elsewhere. Longtime Cape residents remember a large failed wind farm in Nantucket. The answer is always the same: wind turbines are not economically feasible for very long in a marine environment. Ask anyone in the Navy about maintaining equipment on ships. 
 Our poor Coast Guard men and women will spend the next 100 years putting warning buoys around a failed Cape Wind project if it goes forward, and the Wampanoags and everyone who loves Cape Cod will be confronted with a derelict eyesore.
 Kristen Heisler West Falmouth, Mass., Nov. 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial urges America to ''do its part to address climate change,'' as if more towers were the only choice. If everyone on the Cape replaced incandescent bulbs with fluorescents and if federal stimulus included solar-energy incentives, there would be no need to devastate a pristine setting with the structural trappings of the planet's most destructive species.
 If you're going to urge construction in other people's front yards, you might first consider replacing Lady Liberty's torch with a turbine.
 Mike Garvan Brewster, Mass., Nov. 2, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I disagree with your statement that the Wampanoag tribes' ''claim'' about the cultural significance of Nantucket Sound ''seems unsupportable.'' As a co-author of the federal guidelines about what constitutes a ''traditional cultural property'' eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, I think the tribes' argument would be easily supportable. The significance of a traditional cultural property exists in the minds of those who value it.
 Besides, recognizing Nantucket Sound as eligible for the national register would not necessarily block Cape Wind. There is nothing in the National Historic Preservation Act that prohibits an agency from deciding that the public interest demands that a historic place, or someone's view of a historic place, be sacrificed in the public interest. 
 The tribes probably have a stronger case under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits federal agencies from substantially burdening a person's practice of religion unless they find a compelling government interest. 
 The preservation act's review process does provide a means of resolving disputes without going to court. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar should use this process creatively to resolve the Cape Wind controversy.
 Thomas F. King Silver Spring, Md., Nov. 2, 2009
 The writer is a consultant on historic preservation issues. 
 To the Editor:
 The only thing that should remain anchored in Nantucket Sound -- as in Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Canyon or any other treasured stretch of land or ocean on this planet -- is humanity's precious spirituality, which is among our greatest gifts from the gods.
 May we be visionary enough to site our imposing mechanical towers where they would cause far less spiritual demolition.
 Tony Balis Tisbury, Mass., Nov. 2, 2009
 The writer is president of the Humanity Initiative.
 To the Editor:
 You are right. We should greatly increase our use of wind power. But the Cape Wind proposal is the wrong scheme in the wrong place.
 Having 130 440-foot-high towers would be grotesquely out of scale for the site. The project would only increase opposition to wind power nationwide.
 Instead, let's build many smaller, more sensitively designed wind projects in less scenic locations.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Fewer Employed,
 But More Babies
 While Roosevelt Island's leafy streets and lower-priced apartments have long offered New Yorkers a respite from the endless concrete and shoe-box-size homes of city life, residents there have not been sheltered from the recession. 
 Roosevelt Islanders of all income levels have been cutting back, says Alfonso DiCioccio, a retired police officer who discovered the island he calls an urban Mayberry while searching its transit tunnels for work. 
 In January 2007, he helped his father open Nonno's Focacceria, and business thrived as roughly 200 construction workers came in daily for lunch. After construction work slowed and residents cut back, he laid off two workers.
 In the two months since he opened the Riverwalk Bar and Grill in another building, Mr. DiCioccio has offered senior citizen discounts and half-price happy hour drinks. 
 From his perch behind these two counters, Mr. DiCioccio talked about how the recession has played out across the island in pizza slices and babies. 
 Q. How have you noticed more residents out of work?
 A. I'm seeing a lot of people not working. They're all in the financial profession. They're dressing very casual. I'm used to seeing people every day coming off the train at 6:30 p.m. Now you see them in the afternoon walking their dog.
 Q. Are they getting rehired?
 A. You see it getting a little bit better. You see them getting new jobs. People who were working in finance are doing different professions, like insurance. One guy became a dog groomer. He worked on Wall Street for 15 years. 
 Q. How has the recession affected families?
 A. It's like a baby boom. About three or four women said: ''I lost my job. I'm having a baby.'' Some kids are coming in for their first pizza. There are like three or four kids whose first word is ''pizza.'' 
 Q. How have you noticed older children being affected?
 A. You see the same kids asking for stuff for free. They say, ''My mom is out of work.'' I've got two kids. It's hard for me to see four or five kids sitting there and one kid not eat. It's not happening. I say: ''I'm not giving it for free. But when you have the money, come back.'' I'm not worried about the girl coming back or not coming back. I just want to see her eat.

Wells Fargo's Big Dilemma
John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, objected vocally to the federal injection of rescue funds into banks, saying taxpayers were benefiting at Wells Fargo's expense. A year on, the government still owns $25 billion of Wells preferred stock. The bank's boss has cooled his rhetoric, but still wants to pay back the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program investment ''shortly.'' He also wants to avoid damage to his shareholders. Reconciling the two objectives is not easy.
 Much of Wall Street interprets Mr. Stumpf's emphasis on shareholder-friendliness to mean he has no intention of raising new common equity, which might be dilutive. That would suggest he is resigned to repaying Washington's investment out of accumulated earnings. On current performance, that could take two years or more. 
 Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, might have considered repaying the government quickly in cash. After all, the bank did raise $21.2 billion issuing common equity as the financial crisis unfolded. But it's not clear that regulators would be satisfied with that. More importantly, parting with that much cash would deplete the bank's capital.
 The bank's Tier 1 ratio of capital to assets would drop to just above 8 percent, fine in the good old days, but way below its rivals now. JPMorgan's equivalent ratio stands at 10.2 percent, and US Bancorp's is at 9.5 percent.
 The implication is that Mr. Stumpf cannot repay his relief funds in short order unless he raises equity, a move that would not be good for shareholders. But there may still be a middle way.
 That's because selling new common stock and being shareholder-friendly are not entirely mutually exclusive. Paying back the relief funds would extinguish $1.25 billion a year in post-tax dividends, freeing up earnings for common shareholders. Wells could issue up to $8.8 billion in stock without reducing the earnings per share available to current holders, according to JPMorgan.
 Doing that and repaying the rest of the funds in cash would put a 9 percent floor under Wells' Tier 1 ratio. The slug of new common stock would also raise the narrower Tier 1 common equity ratio to 6 percent from the current 5.2 percent, which is three percentage points below the bank's two bailout-free peers.
 Those improved ratios still appear skinny. But Wells set aside an extra cushion against loan losses when it bought Wachovia. That's worth another 1.5 percentage points on both capital ratios. 
 Squaring the circle this way would call for careful explanation. Should Mr. Stumpf decide to do it, though, he has no problem speaking up.
 Call It Socialism 
 Here's a shocker: Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the only self-described socialist in the Senate, has put forth the most capitalistic proposal yet for banking reform. The senator's Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act proposes that if a firm is so big that its failure would threaten the economy or financial system, it should be broken up, not protected by the promise of a bailout.
 That sounds simple and logical, yet none of the competing proposals floating around Capitol Hill -- those from the White House or the House Financial Services Committee, or others expected this week from Christopher Dodd, the Senate Banking Committee chairman -- have been so explicit in calling for an end to government rescues for private companies.
 Of course, Senator Sanders's bill is intended to be provocative. In two pages it outlines sweeping powers for the Treasury secretary to identify banks, hedge funds and insurers that are too big to fail. Within a year they would have to be broken up into smaller pieces whose failure would no longer torpedo the national or global economy without a bailout.
 Vermont is not home to any large financial groups, so it's not altogether surprising that Mr. Sanders would champion such legislation. If taken seriously, the proposals would face a struggle against the financial services industry and powerful political forces. And their brevity, while welcome in some ways, leaves too many questions unanswered.
 That said, Mr. Sanders's philosophy seems sensible. Breaking up the biggest financial firms would remove unfair subsidies in the form of implicit government backing, sharply reduce systemic risk, and perhaps foster greater competition. Given the poor performance of some of the biggest financial conglomerates, it might even benefit shareholders. It's quite a show of capitalist sympathies from a Green Mountain socialist.

HEADLINE: In Resilient Neighborhood, Morale Tumbles After Fire

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
A tilted plywood wall wraps around the northwest corner of Bainbridge Avenue and East 204th Street, where the air smells of smoke and the sidewalk glistens from broken glass. The wall tries to hide the ghastly sight of 10 storefronts burned to sooty brick and skeletal girders. But it only reminds all who pass of a local tragedy.
 A five-alarm fire on Halloween morning tore through this once-bustling strip of stores in the Norwood section of the Bronx, stirring neighbors awake shortly after 3 a.m. Within hours, owners, employees and customers stood side by side in shock and grief, not knowing how or where to begin rebuilding their livelihoods.
 Gone were the immigrant-owned businesses that had formed the backdrop to daily street life: a fish store, a hairdresser, a Mexican restaurant, a doughnut shop. One of the oldest businesses, the Bainbridge Bakery, had been there 18 years and was about to reopen after recovering from a fire in April. Fire marshals are still investigating the October fire, though they have not labeled the blaze suspicious. 
 ''This is not a good thing, psychologically,'' said Dart Westphal, president of the Mosholu Preservation Corporation, a local development group assisting the merchants. ''This place has been through a lot of ups and downs in the last few decades. There was a recession, but you had the sense we might be coming out of something. And wow, now this fire. It's like a kick in the stomach.'' 
 Change is not uncommon in Norwood, tucked between the New York Botanical Garden and Montefiore Medical Center. Decades ago it was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants who patronized the shops, pubs and restaurants along this winding, sloping avenue. About 20 years ago, the Irish were replaced by newcomers from Albania, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and several dozen other countries. 
 ''Things changed,'' Mr. Westphal said. ''But the place sort of dealt with it. It's been that kind of place as long as it's been around. You roll with the punches and fix something. Folks have an amazing resilience here.''
 But the devastation has not ceased to shock passers-by. A few days after the fire, an elderly woman shook her head when she spied the bakery's tattered awning.
 ''This is just a pity,'' said the woman, who would give only her first name, Pat. She moved from Ireland 40 years ago and raised her family here. ''For years I used to buy my bread there every Sunday morning,'' she said, striking a positive note: ''Oh, they'll rebuild. They say the city is going to help them.''
 Ana Mirbita, who opened the bakery with her husband, Tony, 18 years ago, hopes so. The Albanian couple are already out $300,000 from rebuilding after the April fire. The day before the second fire, Ms. Mirbita had gotten final approval to reopen from inspectors. Now she does not know for sure whether she is even covered by insurance.
 ''We have worked so hard for so many years, and in the end it's like I never worked in this country,'' she said. ''I'm left with nothing. It's ugly. Some people tell me I have no chance. Some tell me the government should help me.''
 Elected officials have been meeting with the affected merchants, who include the owners of four stores adjacent to the fire that were shuttered because of structural concerns. The borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., has directed his economic development staff to explore how to help the owners, while State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. has assigned a staff member to explore grants and low-interest loans.
 Mr. Espada said some good might come of the blaze, whether it was re-examining the fire codes that apply to older buildings, or bringing the merchants together to form an association to help bolster the commercial strip.
 ''As immigrant retailers, they were not used to that concept,'' Mr. Espada said. ''But we're talking about it, and I am certain we'll be able to help restore the vitality to the neighborhood.''
 How long that will take is still not certain, and in the meantime, even nearby merchants are feeling the pain.
 Salvatore Mirra, the owner of Hillside Meat and Deli, has already noticed slower foot traffic in his store, which was untouched by the fire but endured a few days without water or electricity.
 ''The sunny side is, at least people want the businesses to come back,'' he said before sending an employee off to fetch some water in a bucket. ''The bad part is, this makes it worse, and people are shaken at what's happened to the neighborhood. They see this fire and instead of thinking things were getting better, they see it in decline.''
 When Mahmoud Zaghari first considered investing in a candy store on the strip, he looked carefully at the location. Near bus and train stops, the area looked promising. What clinched it for him was the Dunkin' Donuts on the corner.
 ''They just don't put in a store anywhere,'' said Mr. Zaghari, who is Palestinian. ''They know where to put stores.''
 He and a partner opened in March, selling lottery tickets, beverages and cigarettes, and installing shelves and a counter for a planned deli, too. 
 Now, he has lost his investment -- and his laptop, where he had stored his work for his graduate courses in business. With no store, he has no income for rent or tuition. Sally Barker Dunford, the executive director of the West Bronx Housing and Neighborhood Resource Center, is trying to help him weather the ordeal.
 Ms. Barker Dunford has lived in Norwood most of her life, and can relate to the merchants: About 20 years ago her apartment was damaged in a fire.
 ''First you cry, then you pick things up,'' she said. ''That's when you get a good assessment and a plan to go forward.''
 When she was picking up the pieces, she had some help.
 ''People came in to clean up, and they took the clothes that were left,'' Ms. Barker Dunford said. ''Somebody brought them back, and they didn't smell of smoke anymore. To this day, I don't know who did that. That's how people are around here.''
 Even now, people are coming together, she said, in spite of all the laments by some old-timers about how their neighborhood has changed. 
 A few days ago, she was wondering whether there was an Islamic group that might be able to help a Palestinian merchant. Looking for advice, she asked the Muslim men who worked at the deli across the street from her office. 
 ''They said it was hard for them, because they were Turkish, not Arab,'' she said. ''They said they'd ask around. Then, this lady next to me who looked as Irish as I am said, 'No, this is who you have to call.' I looked at her. She said her mother was Moroccan. She gave me a lead, and I'm going to follow it.''

HEADLINE: Madoff's Prosecutor Is Joining Cleary Firm

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
Lev L. Dassin, a former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan whose office won the conviction of Bernard L. Madoff for his huge Ponzi scheme, resulting in a 150-year sentence, is joining the New York office of the international law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. 
 Mr. Dassin, 44, was the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York from December until August, when Preet Bharara, President Obama's nominee for the post, was confirmed by the Senate.
 Mr. Dassin had served earlier as deputy United States attorney, and before that, had run the office's criminal division for over two years. In all, Mr. Dassin had worked for nearly a decade as a prosecutor in two separate stints.
 At Cleary Gottlieb, Mr. Dassin will be a partner, handling white-collar and enforcement cases, and complex commercial civil litigation, the firm said. He will have no involvement in cases that he supervised as a prosecutor.
 His eight months as acting United States attorney, coming during the financial crisis, were busy ones. In addition to the Madoff case, he oversaw the prosecution of Marc S. Dreier, the prominent lawyer who was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison for an elaborate scheme that defrauded hedge funds and other investors of $700 million. The office also represented the government's interests in the Chrysler and General Motors bankruptcy cases.
 A New York native, Mr. Dassin received a law degree from New York University. In his earlier appointment as an assistant United States attorney, from 1992 to 1998, he prosecuted a major money-laundering case, and also helped to win the conviction of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the suspected leader of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, who was sentenced to life plus 240 years.
 Between his jobs as a prosecutor, Mr. Dassin worked in business and private practice, including time as a partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer. He also teaches a course in trial practice at Columbia Law School.

HEADLINE: Speaking of Champions, but Not Looking Like One

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
 The Giants have absorbed a string of terrible losses this season: a beating in New Orleans, an embarrassment at home to Arizona, a rout in Philadelphia.
 But on Sunday, the Giants may have lost their season. 
 Just when the fans at Giants Stadium sensed a spark, a glimmer of hope that this team might recapture some of the magic of 2007, the defense that had been so heralded in that Super Bowl season let them down. Again.
 Only in spots this season has there been any fire for the Giants. The electricity and sense of purpose and mission that defined the previous two seasons have been missing, from the team and the fans. 
 When the Giants took a 20-14 lead over the San Diego Chargers with a little over two minutes to play, there were reasonable expectations that their three-game slide would end.
 But San Diego's Philip Rivers hit Vincent Jackson with the winning touchdown pass with 21 seconds to play, plunging the Giants to a fourth straight defeat, not only dimming hopes for a division championship but also putting a spot in the playoffs in doubt.
 The Giants (5-4) are faced with the daunting task of playing four difficult games, against Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Philadelphia.
 ''We've put ourselves in a situation we didn't want to be in right now,'' quarterback Eli Manning said. ''These last seven are all going to be tough; it's going to be very important for us to win those games. We can't afford to lose any more.''
 Two seasons ago, the Giants won the Super Bowl with the help of a miracle play when Manning escaped a sure sack and hit receiver David Tyree, who made the catch of a lifetime to set up the winning score. The Giants were good that night and lucky.
 They came out of nowhere to win the Super Bowl and spent the next season proving to cynics that they were for real. But this season, injuries and a defense that seems lost and out of sync have pushed the Giants to the brink.
 After the Giants' loss last week in Philadelphia, Justin Tuck complained that the defense was thinking too much and not reacting. And Coach Tom Coughlin has complained that Manning is spending too much time with ''the chess game'' before the snap. 
 Last season, when it seemed they were rolling, the Giants got a bad break with Plaxico Burress. This season they have been hit by injuries and breaks that consistently have gone the other way.
 ''It seems like, to be honest with you, we've got to get some of these things going our way,'' a frustrated Coughlin said. ''This loss tonight, no matter what the circumstances, no matter if we were sitting there undefeated, this would have been a very hard loss. It was very difficult for me emotionally to come in there after that loss. We were in such great position to win and then to lose it like that.''
 The Giants began the afternoon with a hopeful championship veneer. Shortly after the game began, the organization recognized Yankees Manager Joe Girardi. Girardi and his wife, Kim, were introduced to a cheering crowd, though the video screen mistakenly identified him as the Yankees' general manager.
 During an interview before the game, Coughlin gushed when asked if the Yankees' success and the parade Friday inspired his team, perhaps giving it a much-needed spark. Coughlin singled out the core of Yankees players. 
 ''Some interesting things were said about the four core players of the Yankees,'' he said, referring to Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte. ''Humble, real humble guys. They go on the field and do their talking with their play. That's what this game is all about.''
 Then, alluding to the Giants' championship season, Coughlin said: ''The exhilaration of playing well, of doing your best, of giving great effort and succeeding -- there's nothing like it. You can't describe it.'' 
 If only the Giants could play by baseball's economic rules, which allow a team like the Yankees to spend as much as it can afford on players. The Giants could buy the best free-agent safety, corner and linebackers; buy the best free-agent wide receiver and running back. 
 Sadly, for their fans, the Giants are stuck with what they have--and it may not be good enough.
 Coughlin told the team that all is not lost: He told them that if the Giants play with the kind of energy they did on Sunday, if they upgrade their skill level and eliminate penalties, ''I think we can come back and be a good football team.''
 On Sunday, Manning headed off suggestions that the season was effectively over. But the game was like the season so far, an inconsistent ride to an uncertain destination.
 ''We haven't hit bottom,'' Manning said. ''When you hit bottom, that's when you see guys quitting. We didn't quit. We've got to come back, keep fighting and find ways to win games.''
 The Yankees' winning mood lingers as the Giants' hope fades.

HEADLINE: Economists Seek to Fix a Defect in Data That Overstates the Nation's Vigor

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A widening gap between data and reality is distorting the government's picture of the country's economic health, overstating growth and productivity in ways that could affect the political debate on issues like trade, wages and job creation. 
 The shortcomings of the data-gathering system came through loud and clear here Friday and Saturday at a first-of-its-kind gathering of economists from academia and government determined to come up with a more accurate statistical picture. 
 The fundamental shortcoming is in the way imports are accounted for. A carburetor bought for $50 in China as a component of an American-made car, for example, more often than not shows up in the statistics as if it were the American-made version valued at, say, $100. The failure to distinguish adequately between what is made in America and what is made abroad falsely inflates the gross domestic product, which sums up all value added within the country. 
 American workers lose their jobs when carburetors they once made are imported instead. The federal data notices the decline in employment but fails to revalue the carburetors or even pinpoint that they are foreign-made. Because it seems as if $100 carburetors are being produced but fewer workers are needed to do so, productivity falsely rises -- in the national statistics.
 ''We don't have the data collection structure to capture what is happening in a real time way, or what is being traded and how it is affecting workers,'' said Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., who has done pioneering research in the field. ''We have no idea how to measure the occupations being offshored or what is being inshored.''
 The statistical distortions can be significant. At worst, the gross domestic product would have risen at only a 3.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter instead of the 3.5 percent actually reported, according to some experts at the conference. The same gap applies to productivity. And the spread is growing as imports do. 
 That may help to explain why the recovery from the 2001 recession was a jobless one for many months and why the recovery from this recession is likely to generate few jobs for many months.
 In addition, more detailed import data would help to explain wage inequality, by linking some low wages more accurately to particular industries exposed to import competition. 
 On another front, many argue that labor productivity is rising faster than the pay of workers who made the greater productivity possible. That argument would be watered down if more accurate data showed that productivity had been overstated. 
 ''What we are measuring as productivity gains may in fact be changes in trade,'' said William Alterman, assistant commissioner for international prices at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 The federal agencies that compile the nation's statistics increasingly acknowledge that they lack the detailed data needed to calculate the impact of imported goods and services as imports rise from an insignificant 5 percent of all economic activity 35 years ago to more than 12 percent today, not counting petroleum. As a result, many imports are valued as if they were made in the United States and therefore higher in price than their imported counterparts. 
 The problem is particularly acute in manufacturing. Imported components constitute an ever greater share of the computers, autos, appliances and other finished merchandise that roll off assembly lines in the United States -- and an ever greater share of all of the nation's imports. 
 But the statistical system is not yet up to the task of sorting out which components are made here, which are made overseas and the resulting impact on employment. As Lori G. Kletzer, an economist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, put it, ''We don't know what jobs have been offshored.'' 
 The same holds for services. An accounting firm in New York with 50 employees outsources some of its functions to less expensive accountants in India: the paperwork on an income tax return, for example. That work comes back to New York by computer transmission and is billed at New York rates, as if it were value added in this country. 
 Grappling with these blind spots, nearly all of the 80 experts at the conference, which was sponsored by the Upjohn Institute and the National Academy of Public Administration, agreed that the statistics now published tend to overstate the strength of the economy. That view was shared by those who attended from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve, all big players in measuring economic performance.
 The stated goal, among those at the conference, is to repair the statistics, but that requires several years, lots of money (from Congress) to gather more information about what companies are doing, and whole new procedures for measuring imports. Much of the conference was devoted to an analysis of the gap between existing data and reality, and ways to close that gap. 
 Imports and exports are recorded, of course, as they enter and leave the country. The American trade deficit speaks volumes. But when it comes to who gets what import -- particularly which manufacturer gets what component or what metal or what machine -- these details are not gathered. 
 Instead, the federal agencies use an import price index, much of it imputed from small samples, that fails to capture just when an auto company switches from a domestically made carburetor to a less expensive Chinese model, and whether that shift is in all of the company's plants or just those in Michigan. 
 ''We can't pick up the price shift,'' Mr. Alterman said. ''We are not designed to do that.''

HEADLINE: Haute Couture, Available Through the Netflix Model

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
For many women, a $1,000 dress is something they admire in the pages of a glossy magazine or see draped on the frame of a celebrity -- not an item hanging in their closet. 
 But a nascent Web site called Rent the Runway is hoping to make high-end fashions much more accessible and almost as easy as renting a movie from Netflix. 
 The mail-order service, which finishes the testing phase on Monday, allows women to rent dresses from notable fashion designers like Diane Von Furstenberg, Herve Leger and Proenza Schouler for roughly one-tenth of what they would cost to buy in a retail store. 
 The rentals run $50 to $200 for a four-night loan and are shipped directly to the customer's doorstep. After wearing the dress, she puts it into a prepaid envelope and drops it in the mail. Dry cleaning is included in the price, but damage insurance costs $5, and in the case of outright destruction of the dress, the renter is responsible for the full retail price. 
 Rent the Runway is a recession-era twist on the Internet rent-by-mail model, which has been used for things like textbooks and video games in addition to movies. Unlike those utilitarian items, however, the dresses offer a touch of Cinderella -- on a budget. 
 Julia Harris, a 27-year-old graduate student living in New York, turned to Rent the Runway when she needed something chic for a fall wedding. For $50, she got a fuchsia Catherine Malandrino number with an elaborately ruffled bust that would have cost $495 to buy.
 ''It was so easy. You just wear it and drop it back in the mail to them,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I don't spend $2,000 on a dress regularly, so it's nice to be able to wear some of the more expensive brands I wouldn't be able to buy otherwise. And instead of just buying one or two dresses for this season, I can still have a lot of things to wear.''
 Rent the Runway was founded by two recent Harvard Business School graduates, Jennifer Hyman and Jennifer Carter Fleiss. Ms. Hyman said she got the idea for the service last year after watching her younger sister agonize over whether to buy an expensive new outfit to wear to a wedding.
 ''Here was this young girl who loves fashion and was willing to spend a good portion of her salary on a dress that she's only going to wear once or twice, and I thought, there has to be a solution for this,'' said Ms. Hyman.
 The founders say that more than 20,000 women have signed up for the service, which has been shipping dresses for only a week. Bain Capital Ventures provided seed financing, which the company used to build its inventory of 160 styles. 
 Rent the Runway declined to discuss its business strategy, but it is clear the company faces several risks. Unlike DVDs, fashion changes quickly, and there is no guarantee that the company will be able to rent each dress enough times to cover its costs. 
 In addition, retail stores in major cities have offered dresses for rent for years. Rent the Runway is betting that its shop-by-Web convenience and the appeal of its top-quality fashions will persuade women across the country to rent a dress for a special occasion without trying it on beforehand.
 The company has also chosen to make the service invitation-only, which gives it an air of exclusivity but may limit its audience. 
 Jeff Roster, an analyst with Gartner, said that execution would be critical. ''If my movie doesn't come on time, I might be mad, but life goes on,'' he said. ''But if my fancy dress for a big important event doesn't arrive, that's a customer service problem like you've never had before.''
 Ms. Hyman and Ms. Carter Fleiss said they had taken several steps to guard against service fiascos. For starters, they use a reservation system to ensure that a customer can get a specific dress for the night she needs it.
 To assist with fitting, they have on-call stylists who can advise customers on how certain materials feel and how a particular dress might hang on various body types. In addition, the site offers returns within 24 hours for any reason and will include an extra size of a first dress at no additional cost. 
 Customers who want to be extra-safe can choose a second style as a backup, for an additional $25. And all dresses come with a custom garment bag and a ''fit kit,'' which includes double-sided tape, bra strap adjusters and deodorant stain removers.
 For fashion designers, the service is a creative marketing strategy and a way to reach a new generation of customers, said Ms. Hyman. ''If someone wears a dress and absolutely loves it, she will go out and buy it,'' she said. 
 Although most designers are selling their dresses directly to the service, some are providing exclusive runway pieces that are not commercially sold in exchange for a cut of the revenue. 
 Christian Siriano, a New York designer who was the winner in the fourth season of the ''Project Runway'' reality TV show, said Rent the Runway was a way to introduce his collection to a broader audience.
 ''Even though most people probably know who I am, they don't know the brand yet,'' he said. At a boutique, Mr. Siriano's pieces can cost as much as $3,000. On Rent the Runway, his styles are offered for $150 to $200.
 Those prices are especially appealing in a tough economy, said Karen Scheck, president of Lela Rose, a label whose fans include celebrities like Anne Hathaway. 
 ''In challenging economic times, it's important for brands to reach a larger audience and age demographic that you wouldn't normally because of the price,'' she said. ''This is a great way to do it without jeopardizing the brand.'' 
 The real test of the service will be the quality of its collection, said Samantha Durbin, editor of FabSugar.com, a fashion blog. ''The key is to have really great products that are on trend,'' she said. ''No one wants to rent last season's dress.''

LENGTH: 1036 words

HEADLINE: Out of the Nursery, Movements of Desire and Narcissism

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
Nothing about dance is more mysterious than the diversity of ways in which it can connect with music. Paul Taylor's latest work is set to Debussy's ''Children's Corner.'' But its characters aren't children, and its stage incidents have nothing to do with the nursery exercises and lessons that Debussy had in mind. 
 You may call such choices contrary, and certainly Mr. Taylor has a contrary mind. But it is as important to call them revelatory, for they tell us something about expression in music that is too seldom considered. Many composers have shown how formerly heroic music can be reset as comedy, religious music as secular drama, culturally specific music to accompany dissimilar cultural evocations. It turns out that the music is expressing something beneath, and apart from, its originally stated intention. Mr. Taylor is a master at showing this. 
 He calls his new piece ''Brief Encounters.'' (Debussy wrote it for piano in 1908; the version used here is the one arranged for orchestra by Andre Caplet in 1911 as a ballet suite.) In the world premiere on Friday at the Mulroy Civic Center at Oncenter here -- the work was commissioned by Syracuse University and was accompanied by live music by the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra, conducted by David LaMarche -- the scenes altered like images in clouds. The dancers, beautifully adult and near naked in trim black underwear (by Santo Loquasto), passed through transient scenes of sexual desire, emotional perplexity and more. 
 There are points of resemblance to another Debussy work by Mr. Taylor, the 1977 ''Images.'' ''Brief Encounters,'' though, is more nebulous. The changes are part of its spell. Mr. Taylor has a Prospero-like ability to recast the mood in an instant.
 He starts ''Brief Encounters'' with pure pattern. Debussy's opening ''Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum'' becomes a cue for a revolving circle, center stage, picked out by lighting against the surrounding darkness. As the wheel of dancers turns clockwise and then counterclockwise, you're caught up by the sensuousness of their pace, first walking, then running. Mr. Taylor makes these basic human steps as ravishing as brush strokes in Impressionist painting.
 The circle expands. Dancers leave. Light changes. Dancers, returning, meet in twos and threes and pass one another. We might be watching molecular formations. Explosive jumps pivot in midair; the climax of a leap often occurs as a dancer turns to face his own leg. 
 Suddenly one man, James Samson, is alone, as Debussy's second section, ''Jimbo's Lullaby,'' commences. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Samson must enjoy the Jimbo/James pun here. Debussy is thought to have confused ''Jimbo'' with ''Jumbo,'' since his music has a quality of elephantine grace, but that too is perfect, for James/Jimbo/Jumbo Samson is the tallest, broadest and most seemingly innocent man in the Taylor company. The choreography shows the sumptuous lyricism he brings to a surprising array of movements: taking a raised knee in both hands and pushing it to the floor; placing both hands and one foot on the floor and extending the other leg into the air; a softly powerful run.
 Now he's joined by Julie Tice, to whom Mr. Taylor gives the work's most immediately startling moment. Without ado she kneels, stretches back in ardent abandon and opens her upper body to Mr. Samson. Yet he just watches at a distance, as if such behavior were new, and he was unsure of his own feeling. 
 Debussy's third item, ''Serenade for the Doll,'' becomes, at its climax in Mr. Taylor's setting, a little drama of narcissism. Annmaria Mazzini dances with a hand mirror. Even when she's with Sean Mahoney, she is as rapt by her reflection as by him. This leads to a note of bitterness, even a fleeting hint of self-flagellation; the mirror is hurled away.
 ''The Snow Is Dancing'' (Debussy's title) is all female, characterized by some of Mr. Taylor's most wonderful use of dehanchement: placing all the body's weight on one hip (introduced by Polyclitus into Greek sculpture, beautifully discussed by Kenneth Clark in ''The Nude'' but employed sparingly by almost every other Western choreographer). One woman after another is awoken until five women are all dancing together. Suddenly six men chase after them.
 Michael Trusnovec is alone when ''The Little Shepherd'' starts. He dances a solo in which adagio and allegro features are rivetingly combined, and then Ms. Tice enters and promptly repeats that kneeling backbend of inviting abandon that she addressed earlier to Mr. Samson. But unlike Mr. Samson, Mr. Trusnovec responds, at once taking her in a dance that suggests coupling. 
 Soon Mr. Mahoney joins them. Jealousy is suggested. But what kind? The two men are left together. Is what they do rivalry? Or intimacy? Everything is fleeting. Mr. Taylor's strokes are all economically ambiguous. 
 Other male-female liaisons quickly come and go, and now the finale, ''Golliwog's Cakewalk.'' All the dancers are lined up in a bright march, but this too melts -- like the music, which quotes Wagner's ''Tristan'' and then laughs it off -- into encounters more intimate or aggressive.
 I wanted ''Brief Encounters'' to last twice as long; certainly I am impatient to see it a second time. (It will be performed as part of an American tour and in the company's City Center season next year.) James F. Ingalls lights the dancers now from above, from sideways, from behind, so that the stage world keeps changing drastically. At Syracuse, because it followed the hilarious ''Also Playing'' (Mr. Taylor's other 2009 creation), the audience was quick to discover the comic aspects. Other programming could reveal more of its pain and desire. 
 ''Brief Encounters'' is an essay in the very stuff of theater poetry. Its kaleidoscopic succession of part-dramatic imagery seems often to touch -- lightly but keenly -- on some of the most ineffable aspects of the ways dance can illuminate musical expression. What Debussy designated as nursery music here depicts a more adult innocence. Every emotion and meeting seems young, pristine, mysterious.

HEADLINE: Honolulu Symphony Cancels Concert Calendar

BYLINE: Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The 109-year-old Honolulu Symphony announced on Friday that it would cancel this year's remaining concerts and file for bankruptcy protection, The Associated Press reported. Though ticket sales had been holding steady this year, they accounted for only 30 percent of the symphony's annual budget, and reduced donor contributions have left the company with almost $1 million in debt. In May 2008 the symphony was revived after receiving $1 million from an anonymous donor that covered back pay owed to musicians. And earlier this year $2.1 million was taken from the endowment as an advance. But on Oct. 30 the board of directors voted to file for protection under Chapter 11, and papers will be submitted to court next week. ''We made payroll, even in this economy, through October,'' said Peter Shaindlin, the board's chairman. ''But cash ran out and dried up.'' The symphony hopes to resume operations early next year, said a spokeswoman, Kristin Jackson, though perhaps, because of salary costs, not with all 64 musicians.

HEADLINE: Eyepopping, in Many Ways

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Can a movie studio make money on a film based on an original and unfamiliar story, with no Hollywood superstars, a vanishing DVD market and a price tag approaching $500 million?
 That question looms large for 20th Century Fox and its 3-D science-fiction film ''Avatar,'' among the most expensive movies ever. Despite many skeptics, the studio thinks it can turn a profit, in part because the film's creator, James Cameron, was the driving force behind the studio's immense hit ''Titanic.''
 But just in case box-office receipts for ''Avatar'' fall short, Fox has worked hard to hedge its large bet on the movie.
 Despite the estimated half-billion dollars spent on its production and marketing, ''Avatar'' may carry surprisingly little financial risk for Fox's parent company, the News Corporation, even if it disappoints. That is because of shifting industry economics, reliance on outside investors and help from a network of allied companies and in-house business units. 
 Fox's efforts underscore how studios generally have been able to minimize their exposure at a time of blockbuster budgets -- albeit at the cost of limiting their profit potential as well.
 The final cost of the film has not been tallied, as Mr. Cameron, who has worked on the film for 15 years, and his collaborators, as far-flung as Weta Digital in New Zealand, continue to complete their work. Published reports have put the production budget at more than $230 million. 
 But the price tag would be higher if the financial contribution of Mr. Cameron and others were included. When global marketing expenses are added, ''Avatar'' may cost its various backers $500 million. 
 Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos, the co-chairmen of Fox Filmed Entertainment, declined through a spokesman to be interviewed. Jon Landau, Mr. Cameron's partner in their Lightstorm Entertainment production company, also declined to be interviewed.
 But ''Avatar'' did get a mention in a conference call on Wednesday during which Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation's chairman, discussed a surprise 11 percent earnings jump in the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. 
 ''I'm confident we will lead the Christmas season,'' Mr. Murdoch said. He added that he was ''excited and moved'' by ''Avatar.'' 
 Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in an e-mail message before the earnings call that investors ''tend to ignore'' the impact of a single movie on a company as large as the News Corporation.
 At what point the various partners in ''Avatar'' would see profit from the film depends on what share of revenue each receives as the movie reaches theaters, then home video and other media around the world. If domestic ticket sales reach $250 million -- a level broken in the last year by five films, including ''Star Trek'' and ''The Hangover'' -- Fox and its allies would appear to be headed into the black.
 Mr. Cameron's ''Titanic,'' which took in more than $1.8 billion at the worldwide box office after its release in 1997, was a major corporate event for the News Corporation, then about a third the size of the current conglomerate, which has roughly $30 billion in annual sales. Less than a year after the release, the News Corporation raised nearly $3 billion in a public offering of shares in its filmed entertainment group, partly on the strength of ''Titanic.'' (It bought those shares back four years ago.)
 In 1980, the failure of ''Heaven's Gate'' was enough to chase the Transamerica Corporation, which then owned United Artists, out of the movie business. But such company-wreckers belong more to history than to the contemporary film business. 
 With ''Titanic,'' the News Corporation was at risk for at least half of a production budget that would approach $300 million in today's dollars, and was borne partly by Paramount Pictures. 
 The News Corporation is carrying a much smaller share of ''Avatar's'' production cost, as a pair of private equity partners -- Dune Entertainment and Ingenious Media -- pick up 60 percent of the budget, according to people who were briefed on the economics of the film but spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with the studio or filmmakers. 
 Speaking by telephone on Thursday, James Clayton, the chief executive of Ingenious, confirmed his company's backing for ''Avatar,'' but declined to discuss the size of its stake. Greg Coote, the chief executive of Dune, declined to be interviewed.
 In a further hedge, Mr. Cameron would give up part of his own participation in the film's returns if production costs exceed a specified level, according to those who were briefed on the film. If final production costs exceeded $300 million, for instance, Mr. Cameron would effectively defer much of his payout until the studio and others were compensated, despite his years of labor on the movie. 
 Mr. Cameron, along with Vince Pace, a Hollywood technology master, also developed much of the elaborate camera system and digital technology for the film themselves, at cost of about $14 million. According to Mr. Pace, the systems are owned by a company that expects to recoup the investment by selling to other filmmakers with help from the Creative Artists Agency.
 ''We're turning it into a business, as opposed to a path where everybody's supposed to service 'Avatar,' '' Mr. Pace said.
 While the film was largely shot in a converted aircraft hangar in Los Angeles, much of the work qualified for tax rebates in New Zealand, where Weta Digital operates under the direction of the filmmaker Peter Jackson and others. 
 Fox's biggest investment in ''Avatar'' may be on the marketing side, where the company is planning to spend about $150 million around the world -- a number that is somewhat lower than might be expected, because of recession-induced concessions on advertising prices and reliance on in-house resources. The News Corporation recently showed a new trailer for the film on Fox's ''NFL Sunday'' pregame show, and has been using MySpace to build awareness of the movie.
 But here, too, the studio has looked for partners to bear some of the load. One ally, Imax, worked with theater owners to set up a special 15-minute preview last summer without significant cost to the studio. ''A lot of people are lending this sort of in-kind support,'' said Greg Foster, chairman and president of Imax Filmed Entertainment.
 Panasonic, in return for using some of Mr. Cameron's expertise for its own 3-D home video systems, contributed technological and marketing help, linking ''Avatar'' to its campaign for home theaters, for example.
 ''We've been supporting the effort,'' said Eisuke Tsuyuzaki, Panasonic's North America chief technology officer, who spoke on Friday. Mr. Tsuyuzaki declined to put a price tag on that help, but said estimates of about $25 million were ''in the ballpark.''
 In addition, rapidly changing dynamics in the theater business have made blockbuster openings much easier to achieve. 
 Privately, theater owners are now predicting that ''Avatar'' may play in as many as 2,500 3-D theaters, while occupying almost as many conventional theaters over the holiday season, heightening the likelihood of a big opening. Theaters using 3-D bolster the overall box-office by commanding ticket prices perhaps 30 percent higher than those of conventional theaters. 
 Still, the studio has experienced some problems. Initial reaction to a conventional trailer was flat, and response to the 3-D Imax preview provoked doubts about whether Mr. Cameron's movie -- which uses new technology to tell the story of a planet being assailed by humans -- was really the cinematic game-changer that had been promised.
 Taking no chances, Fox is backing up Mr. Cameron's movie with what an executive recently called the studio's ''secret weapon.''
 That would be ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel,'' set to open just a week after studio marketers get ''Avatar'' into theaters. It is the relatively safe sequel to a chipper family comedy that cost about $60 million and took in $217 million at the domestic box office when it was released two years ago.

HEADLINE: After a Boss's Fraud, Training for a New Job and Holding on to Hope

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
Few may recall the spectacular downfall of Marc S. Dreier, the prominent Manhattan lawyer who pleaded guilty to running an elaborate fraud scheme, because his house of cards fell just days before Bernard L. Madoff's did.
 But for Carlton Palmer, Mr. Dreier's deception is fresh, and it still stings. 
 Mr. Palmer, 46, was a copy machine operator and trainer at Dreier L.L.P., a Park Avenue law firm, for more than two years, until Mr. Dreier -- who eventually pleaded guilty to selling $700 million in bogus promissory notes to hedge funds and investors -- was arrested in December. 
 The 250 lawyers at the firm abandoned ship, and ''it all fell apart,'' Mr. Palmer said. He learned of his unemployment by e-mail, and is still owed $2,000 in back wages.
 ''I like to work,'' Mr. Palmer said from his bare-bones living room in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where he spends most of his time at a makeshift work station consisting of a small table, a computer and an Internet connection. There he scours Careerbuilder.com, Monster.com, Craigslist.org and Hotjobs.com for hours. ''I don't like to get up in the morning and not work,'' he said. ''I like a paycheck.''
 But 20 applications and one interview later, Mr. Palmer's life is suspended, as if in amber. After the implosion of Dreier L.L.P., he decided to return to the health care industry, which he had entered several years before but abandoned because of the low pay. He made $11 an hour caring for disabled people, while he earned $56,000, plus overtime, as a mail room clerk and paralegal at Dreier and various other law firms before that. (In his native Jamaica, which he left 12 years ago, he briefly worked as a constable before receiving an associate's degree in business finance in London.) 
 This year, taking advantage of his midcareer slump, he enrolled in the dialysis technician program at Manhattan Institute's School of Allied Medicine and Nursing and lived off unemployment benefits and the $3,000 he had managed to save -- until August, when his savings ran out. 
 He gets $380 a week in unemployment benefits, after taxes, but his monthly expenses exceed that: rent for his one-bedroom apartment is $954; phone and Internet service is $100; electric and gas cost $89; and he has $11,000 in credit card debt. 
 Tuition for his six-week dialysis course was $1,299, but he was $600 short. He had been attending the city's Workforce 1 Career Center, which referred him to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven beneficiary agencies of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. His caseworker there, Alexandra Louis, was able to secure the remaining money so he could receive his certification. In August he graduated with a 4.0 grade point average. 
 But without the 2,000 work hours necessary to complete the next level of certification, Mr. Palmer is stymied. What he needs now, he said, is an employer willing to take a chance on a skilled but inexperienced technician with either a job or a paid internship. Once he has that, he can earn $80,000 a year. 
 ''Sometimes you feel the pressure, but you hope for the best,'' he said. ''You hope for the phone to ring with a 212 number.''
 This holding pattern is a departure for him. During his interview at Dreier L.L.P., he began interviewing the recruiter, peppering her with questions: What skills would he need for this job? How would she describe her ideal candidate for the position? Why did the position become vacant?
 ''She scratched her head and said, 'No one ever asks that,' '' he recalled. She hired him on the spot. 
 Ms. Louis is hardly surprised by Mr. Palmer's ingenuity. ''When he came in, it was so inspirational that he was already involved with so many of these services,'' she said. ''He was very proactive, already enrolled in the dialysis tech program -- these are things we'd normally do. He stood out.''
 While it might be easier for him to give up and return to Mandeville, the town in Jamaica where he grew up and where his father and 11 siblings still live, ''I love America,'' he said. ''I love the hospitality.'' 
 ''I think by the end of the year I'll probably get something,'' he added. ''I'm keeping my fingers crossed.''

HEADLINE: Paranoia Strikes Deep

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last Thursday there was a rally outside the U.S. Capitol to protest pending health care legislation, featuring the kinds of things we've grown accustomed to, including large signs showing piles of bodies at Dachau with the caption ''National Socialist Healthcare.'' It was grotesque -- and it was also ominous. For what we may be seeing is America starting to be Californiafied. 
 The key thing to understand about that rally is that it wasn't a fringe event. It was sponsored by the House Republican leadership -- in fact, it was officially billed as a G.O.P. press conference. Senior lawmakers were in attendance, and apparently had no problem with the tone of the proceedings. 
 True, Eric Cantor, the second-ranking House Republican, offered some mild criticism after the fact. But the operative word is ''mild.'' The signs were ''inappropriate,'' said his spokesman, and the use of Hitler comparisons by such people as Rush Limbaugh, said Mr. Cantor, ''conjures up images that frankly are not, I think, very helpful.'' 
 What all this shows is that the G.O.P. has been taken over by the people it used to exploit. 
 The state of mind visible at recent right-wing demonstrations is nothing new. Back in 1964 the historian Richard Hofstadter published an essay titled, ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics,'' which reads as if it were based on today's headlines: Americans on the far right, he wrote, feel that ''America has been largely taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of subversion.'' Sound familiar?
 But while the paranoid style isn't new, its role within the G.O.P. is. 
 When Hofstadter wrote, the right wing felt dispossessed because it was rejected by both major parties. That changed with the rise of Ronald Reagan: Republican politicians began to win elections in part by catering to the passions of the angry right.
 Until recently, however, that catering mostly took the form of empty symbolism. Once elections were won, the issues that fired up the base almost always took a back seat to the economic concerns of the elite. Thus in 2004 George W. Bush ran on antiterrorism and ''values,'' only to announce, as soon as the election was behind him, that his first priority was changing Social Security.
 But something snapped last year. Conservatives had long believed that history was on their side, so the G.O.P. establishment could, in effect, urge hard-right activists to wait just a little longer: once the party consolidated its hold on power, they'd get what they wanted. After the Democratic sweep, however, extremists could no longer be fobbed off with promises of future glory.
 Furthermore, the loss of both Congress and the White House left a power vacuum in a party accustomed to top-down management. At this point Newt Gingrich is what passes for a sober, reasonable elder statesman of the G.O.P. And he has no authority: Republican voters ignored his call to support a relatively moderate, electable candidate in New York's special Congressional election.
 Real power in the party rests, instead, with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin (who at this point is more a media figure than a conventional politician). Because these people aren't interested in actually governing, they feed the base's frenzy instead of trying to curb or channel it. So all the old restraints are gone. 
 In the short run, this may help Democrats, as it did in that New York race. But maybe not: elections aren't necessarily won by the candidate with the most rational argument. They're often determined, instead, by events and economic conditions.
 In fact, the party of Limbaugh and Beck could well make major gains in the midterm elections. The Obama administration's job-creation efforts have fallen short, so that unemployment is likely to stay disastrously high through next year and beyond. The banker-friendly bailout of Wall Street has angered voters, and might even let Republicans claim the mantle of economic populism. Conservatives may not have better ideas, but voters might support them out of sheer frustration.
 And if Tea Party Republicans do win big next year, what has already happened in California could happen at the national level. In California, the G.O.P. has essentially shrunk down to a rump party with no interest in actually governing -- but that rump remains big enough to prevent anyone else from dealing with the state's fiscal crisis. If this happens to America as a whole, as it all too easily could, the country could become effectively ungovernable in the midst of an ongoing economic disaster.
 The point is that the takeover of the Republican Party by the irrational right is no laughing matter. Something unprecedented is happening here -- and it's very bad for America.

HEADLINE: Albany and the Budget

 BODY:
Gov. David Paterson of New York has commanded the Legislature to return on Tuesday. Fixing the budget must be their top priority. The state is in a fiscal crisis. There is no other word for it. 
 The facts are these: Revenues are down about 20 percent; expenses are rising. And dreams that the good times will suddenly come roaring back are just dreams. Unless the Legislature can cut $3.2 billion from the state's operating budget by the end of the fiscal year, next year's deficit could reach $10 billion.
 There are, of course, other important matters that must be addressed. The secretive authorities that do much of the state's building and borrowing are badly in need of reform. The right to same-sex marriage in New York is long overdue. Mr. Paterson's proposal for a new, less costly pension plan for new state employees deserves attention as does his proposal to tighten controls on a state budget that expands even in the worst of times, like these. 
 But Albany's toughest and most important job right now is to make certain that New York does not become another California, running out of cash, paying bills with i.o.u.'s and watching state credit ratings deteriorate. 
 The governor's proposals are not pretty. Most agencies would lose 11 percent of whatever they expected to get over the next five months, except for education financing, which would drop 5 percent. And the numbers attached to some of Mr. Paterson's revenue-raising proposals need a more rigorous look, including a tax amnesty that his aides say could bring in $250 million in unpaid taxes or the Aqueduct raceway contract that might add $200 million. 
 The Legislature has been largely barren of new ideas. What it must do is work with the governor. If it refuses to do so, New Yorkers can legitimately add fiscal dysfunction -- the inability to deal with economic reality -- to the list of Albany's many flaws.
 Some legislators who don't want to make any hard choices say that they have heard these alarms before, and that if they just wait, the crisis will resolve itself. They are deluding themselves. If they won't act now, we will all pay the price.

HEADLINE: Iran Is Said to Have Ignored Obama's Attempts to Salvage a Nuclear Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Robert F. Worth contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration, attempting to salvage a faltering nuclear deal with Iran, has told Iran's leaders in back-channel messages that it is willing to allow the country to send its stockpile of enriched uranium to any of several nations, including Turkey, for temporary safekeeping, according to administration officials and diplomats involved in the exchanges.
 But the overtures, made through the International Atomic Energy Agency over the past two weeks, have all been ignored, the officials said. Instead, they said, the Iranians have revived an old counterproposal: that international arms inspectors take custody of much of Iran's fuel, but keep it on Kish, a Persian Gulf resort island that is part of Iran. 
 A senior Obama administration official said that proposal had been rejected because leaving the nuclear material on Iranian territory would allow for the possibility that the Iranians could evict the international inspectors at any moment. That happened in North Korea in 2003, and within months the country had converted its fuel into the material for several nuclear weapons. 
 The intermediary in the exchanges between Washington and Tehran has been Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the energy agency. He confirmed some of the proposals -- including one to send Iran's fuel to Turkey, which has nurtured close relations with Iran -- in interviews in New York late last week.
 But members of the Obama administration, in interviews over the weekend, said that they had now all but lost hope that Iran would follow through with an agreement reached in Geneva on Oct. 1 to send its fuel out of the country temporarily -- buying some time for negotiations over its nuclear program.
 ''If you listen to what the Iranians have said publicly and privately over the past week,'' one senior administration official said Sunday, ''it's evident that they simply cannot bring themselves to do the deal.'' The administration officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were speaking about delicate diplomatic exchanges.
 Iranian officials told the energy agency on Oct. 29 that they could not agree to the deal that their own negotiators had reached, but they never explained why. Iran has never publicly rejected the deal, but its official reaction has been ambiguous at best.
 Dr. ElBaradei insisted he still had hope, but he conceded that the chances were receding. 
 ''I have been saying to the Iranian leadership, privately and publicly, 'Make use of that opportunity. Reciprocate,' '' Dr. ElBaradei said last week. But he said that it now appeared that ''the foreign policy apparatus in Iran has frozen,'' partly because of the country's own domestic turmoil.
 So far, President Obama has said nothing about the stalemate threatening his first, and potentially most important, effort at diplomatic engagement with a hostile foreign government. When the first meeting in Geneva ended Oct. 1, Iranian and American officials said they would meet again later in the month to discuss the nuclear program and the potential for a broader relationship. That meeting never occurred, and none is scheduled. 
 Mr. Obama's aides say he is still willing to wait until year's end before concluding that Iran is rejecting his offers of diplomatic engagement. What happens after that is unclear: Mr. Obama has suggested he would then turn to much more severe sanctions than the United Nations has already imposed against Iran, though it is unclear whether Russia and China would go along. 
 Officials in Israel, which feels the most threatened by Iran, have hinted that if Iran does not accept the Geneva deal they will revive their consideration of a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Mr. Obama's own aides say they cannot determine whether the Israelis are bluffing.
 Iran's backpedaling from the Geneva deal -- which would require Iran to ship 2,600 pounds of low-enriched uranium to Russia by Jan. 15 for processing into fuel rods for a reactor in Tehran used for medical purposes -- will almost certainly be discussed when Mr. Obama meets the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on Monday evening. 
 In public, Mr. Netanyahu expressed support for the deal after it was announced. Privately, Israeli officials here said they expected it to fall apart because they doubted the Iranian government would part, even temporarily, with the fuel it had spent years accumulating. 
 Administration officials say they had been working closely with Russia each step of the way, and were pleased over the weekend that the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had raised anew the prospect of economic sanctions if Iran rebuffed the offer. Russia has an economic interest in the deal: it would reap considerable revenue for converting Iran's fuel -- a step that Turkey would not be able to perform -- and Russian officials appear to still be pressing the Iranians to take the deal. 
 ''Russian efforts may well prompt Iran to accept,'' an administration official said Sunday. ''There is still time for Iran to make the right choice'' before the board of the I.A.E.A. meets later this month.
 But few other American or European officials interviewed in recent days seem to believe that the Iranians will agree to send the fuel to Russia, Turkey or any other nation. Officials would not say which other nations would possibly accept the fuel. 
 Officials say they believe that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, who first suggested the country might be willing to export its uranium temporarily, may have never expected that suggestion to be considered seriously. Some officials speculate Mr. Ahmadinejad's offer may have been overruled by other Iranian authorities. 
 The idea of offering to help Iran use its stockpile to fuel the medical reactor attracted Mr. Obama because it would buy him time. Iran has generated enough fuel to make between one and two weapons -- if it were further enriched -- and it would take Iran roughly a year to replace the fuel it sent out of the country. That would take the pressure off some of the negotiations.
 For that reason, it touched off a nationalistic backlash in Iran, and Mr. Ahmadinejad was criticized by both reformers and hard-liners. ''The countries which were proposed to receive our 5 percent uranium were not countries that the Islamic republic trusts to trade with,'' Hosein Naghavi-Hosseini, a member of Iran's Majlis Security Council, said over the weekend, according to Iran's state-run press, ''because in the past, these countries have not held up their side of trade agreements.''
 Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, used the 30th anniversary of the takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran last week to warn Iranians against Mr. Obama's offers of diplomatic engagement.
 Mr. Obama is reported to have sent Ayatollah Khamenei two private letters this year, but he received only one response, mostly a litany of past grievances.

HEADLINE: Sober Mood at New York Post As Circulation Spirals Lower

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Three years ago, Col Allan, the editor of The New York Post, pumped his fist and waded into a cheering crowd at a Midtown restaurant, celebrating The Post's overtaking its rival, The Daily News, in weekday circulation. The Post trumpeted the news on a Times Square billboard and in its pages.
 More than any major American newspaper, Rupert Murdoch's Post had staked its name and future on selling more copies, cutting the price in 2000 from 50 cents to 25 and in 2001 bringing in Mr. Allan, who punched up the tabloid's irreverence, hard edge and love of gossip. Circulation -- which for The Post overwhelmingly means street sales -- climbed above 700,000 from about 440,000 in just six years, then shifted hard the other way.
 Nearly every paper in America has lost circulation, but The Post more than most -- down almost 30 percent in 2.5 years, to 508,000 in the most recent reporting period, against 544,000 for The Daily News. The slide accelerated after The Post's price returned to 50 cents last year. And this year, The Daily News has surged far ahead in online readership. 
 Mr. Allan, who called it ''a joyous occasion'' when The Post took the lead, now takes a more subdued view of the competition, saying in an e-mail exchange that ''whether we are a little in front or a little behind has no impact on our forward business plan.''
 Still, he voiced contempt for the industry's conventional wisdom that as advertising tumbles, some sales no longer make business sense, and circulation should be allowed to fall. 
 ''Publishers who believe maintaining circulation is impossible and financially undesirable should not be publishers,'' he said. ''They are defeatists.''
 With a proliferation of online news sources, it is harder than ever for a paper to be a must-read, said Donald Forst, the former top editor of New York Newsday, The Village Voice and The Boston Herald. Sites like Gawker and TMZ compete with The Post's influential Page Six for gossip, while the Internet allows organizations like The New York Observer and New York magazine to compete on breaking news.
 ''The tabloids still do the things they used to do, but a lot of it doesn't feel as compelling,'' Mr. Forst said. In particular, he said, ''there's so much gossip out there that you can go lots of other places, and I think it's hurt The Post especially.''
 Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, The Post has been in business longer than any other American daily. For decades under the ownership of Dorothy Schiff, it was the voice of Eastern liberalism. She sold it to the Australian-born Mr. Murdoch in 1976 -- one of his first American ventures -- and he quickly made it conservative and racier. He sold the paper in 1988, then bought it back in 1993, maintaining its smart, bare-knuckles sensibility and its doggedly conservative slant.
 The economics of The Post are not like those of other papers; it has not turned a profit in decades under the News Corporation and its chairman, Mr. Murdoch.
 The industry relies most on the circulation advertisers like best: home delivery and Sunday editions. But three-quarters of The Post's circulation is single-copy sales, and its sales are weakest on Sundays. It is a ''second read'' for many people, a discretionary purchase on the way to or from work, easily skipped when money is tight.
 And The Post does not stand alone, so the meaning of profitability is somewhat different from most newspapers. In 2007, Mr. Murdoch also bought The Wall Street Journal, a bigger and more prestigious paper. He has since decided to add a New York edition to that paper and a corps of local news reporters -- giving him a two-pronged, high-low strategy to take on competitors in New York, The Daily News, a tabloid, and The New York Times, a broadsheet. It is similar to his set-up in London, with the serious Times of London and the tabloid Sun. 
 The Post and Mr. Allan answer to a constituency of one, and Mr. Murdoch shows no outward sign of tiring of the paper or its editor. Though it has pushed out some of its roughly 300 editorial employees, pruned expense budgets, frozen salaries for years and eliminated some sections, like a short-lived Page Six magazine, The Post has actually done less newsroom cutting than most big papers.
 But in a nervous time for newspapers, people at The Post have reason to wonder about their future, starting with its losses -- as high as $70 million last year, according to some people briefed on the finances -- which have become a bigger concern for News Corporation executives.
 Since buying The Journal two years ago, Mr. Murdoch has shifted much of his attention to that paper, leaving some at The Post to wonder whether the creation of a metropolitan news staff at The Journal will affect the level of losses the company will be willing to absorb at The Post.
 ''People want to know what it means for us, whether he'll lose interest,'' said a Post reporter who, like several colleagues and people who have recently left, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of angering Mr. Allan and Mr. Murdoch. They say that while The Journal has a stylish new newsroom in the News Corporation building on the Avenue of the Americas, The Post's dingy quarters a few floors away need renovation.
 Before going to The Post, Mr. Allan was known in his native Australia for his red-faced tirades at employees who fail to deliver, competitive acumen and the occasional fistfight, a reputation that has not mellowed in New York. But employees say the fun, the ''band of brothers'' sense that they enjoyed about The Post, has eroded.
 ''The Post doesn't pay that well, and there have always been people who lived in fear of Col, but that's easier to take when things are improving, circ is rising, your pay is rising and papers are hiring,'' said a journalist who recently left the paper.
 A physically unimposing man with glasses and receding hairline, Mr. Allan, 56, looks more like an insurance executive than a boss famed for chewing people out, long drinking bouts at Elaine's and a genuine zeal for trash-talking the competition. Few people who have worked with him claim to have seen a soft side.
 ''I am a pussycat,'' he said, ''most of the time.'' But he was more forthcoming in a 2007 interview with New York magazine, saying, ''I drive hard, maybe a little too hard sometimes, and I am occasionally unreasonable, maybe.''
 For decades, Mr. Murdoch's favorite strategy was to slash prices and increase circulation, grabbing market share and weakening his competitors. But the steps The Post took to bolster circulation, notably the price cut, were expensive, and its losses mounted.
 News Corporation executives insisted that the circulation drive was not about mere bragging rights but was part of a plan to draw more advertising, improve the bottom line and undermine The Daily News. Lachlan Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch who was then a company executive, said in 2001, ''This paper has to get to profitability,'' and there have been similar pronouncements by others.
 ''Of course we believed greater circulation would improve the paper's financial performance,'' Mr. Allan said. ''In many ways, it did, exposing us to advertisers who remain with us today because we produce results for them. But we are living through a rapidly changing media landscape, and all publishers need to be nimble.''

HEADLINE: A Stratocaster for Max, and Other Mad Men Stories

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
 MAX JOHNSON, your life is about to be rocked.
 Max, a 13-year-old boy in Minneapolis, is lucky enough to be a neighbor of Donna Wiederkehr, who works with the Alliance for Family Entertainment of the Association of National Advertisers.
 At Sunday's closing session of the association's 99th annual conference, Richard McDonald, senior vice president for global marketing at the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, asked audience members whether anyone had someone in his or her life with a passion for music.
 Ms. Wiederkehr raised her hand and spoke about ''a neighbor's kid,'' and Mr. McDonald asked her to join him onstage.
 ''Why don't you take that guitar to whoever this kid is,'' Mr. McDonald said, handing Ms. Wiederkehr a blue Fender Stratocaster, worth about $700. 
 ''His name is Max Johnson and he just turned 13 on Tuesday,'' Ms. Wiederkehr said. ''You changed his life.''
 Here is a look at some of the other highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the three-day conference, which 1,200 people attended here last Thursday through Sunday.
 IT'S STILL THE ECONOMY, STUPID Concern over the perilous state of the economy ran throughout the discussions during the conference.
 ''There are families not eating at the end of the month,'' said Stephen Quinn, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart Stores, and ''literally lining up at midnight'' at Wal-Mart stores waiting to buy food when paychecks or government checks land in their accounts.
 Among the steps Wal-Mart is taking to address the changes in shopping habits, Mr. Quinn listed an overhaul of the retailer's private-label brand, Great Value, which is promoted in commercials describing how families can fix dinners with Great Value products ''for less than $2 a serving.''
 Eric E. Schmidt, chairman and chief executive of Google, began his speech by declaring, ''We know we have begun the recovery'' because searches on google.com for terms like ''restaurants'' and ''dancing'' are increasing. ''I think we should be optimistic,'' he said.
 David Jones, global chief executive at the Havas Worldwide and Euro RSCG Worldwide units of Havas, echoed that assessment. ''We will be out of this crisis faster than you think,'' he said, and enter 2010 ''in a much more positive frame of mind.''
 Rebecca Saeger, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Charles Schwab Corporation, said, ''We do feel optimistic.'' However, ''not as optimistic as David,'' she added, referring to Mr. Jones, whose Euro RSCG agency creates the reassuring ''Talk to Chuck'' campaign for Schwab.
 ''The biggest challenge we are facing in financial services today,'' Ms. Saeger said, is the public distrust of the industry. ''You can't go out and tell people to trust you,'' she added, because ''they just don't like us.''
 The feelings about the economy were underlined by the theme of the conference, ''Growth: Defying the Recession.'' And they were underscored each time Robert D. Liodice, president and chief executive of the association, came onstage: the Bee Gees song ''Stayin' Alive'' was played over the sound system. 
 THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT During the conference, attendees found famous faces on the agenda, courtesy of companies that sponsored dinner events.
 On Thursday, AOL brought in Simon Baker of the CBS series ''The Mentalist;'' the Bacon Brothers band, featuring the actor Kevin Bacon and his brother, Michael; and Eric Stromer of the HGTV series ''Over Your Head.'' All have appeared on aol.com.
 ''I'm a longtime AOL user,'' Mr. Bacon shouted from the stage between songs. ''My e-mail is -- never mind.''
 A&E Television Networks offered the actor Tony Danza as the entertainment on Friday. Mr. Danza, who sang, tap-danced, told jokes and played the ukulele, will be the subject of a reality series on A&E next year, ''Teach,'' in which he teaches English at Northeast High School in Philadelphia.
 ''It's a new genre,'' Mr. Danza said. ''It's called responsible reality.'' The audience applauded.
 And the Meredith Corporation imported Jane Krakowski of the NBC series ''30 Rock'' to sing on Saturday. It was the sixth year in a row that Meredith supplied the show for the closing dinner; previous performers included Sutton Foster, Audra McDonald and Kelli O'Hara.
 MADNESS TO HIS METHOD It is rare for a marketer to show parodies of marketing to other marketers. But such a display helped make a hit of a speech by Eric Ryan, a co-founder of Method, the cleaning-products company.
 Mr. Ryan played an unfinished version of a video clip that Method and its advertising agency, Droga5, intend to release online soon. The video is styled like a commercial for a make-believe product called Shiny Suds, featuring talking bubbles that serve as brand characters -- a spoof of the Scrubbing Bubbles products sold by S.C. Johnson.
 The Suds, however, are malevolent, representing what Method considers to be competitive products composed of harsh or even hazardous chemicals. The video is intended to encourage Congress to pass the Household Product Labeling Act, which would require such items to bear labels with ''complete and accurate'' lists of all ingredients.
 GERM OF AN IDEA Flu season was much on the minds of the conference organizers. Inside and outside meeting rooms, hand sanitizers were available from dispensers and pump bottles. ''Clean hands help prevent the spread of germs,'' the labels on the dispensers advised.
 BUY BUY BUY For the second year in a row, the number of companies sponsoring the conference -- paying fees that help the association defray the costs of the meeting -- fell compared with the previous year. There were 41, down from 44 in 2008 and 51 in both 2007 and 2006.
 Even so, the sales messages were almost everywhere. Yahoo handed out coffee in branded travel cups. The hotel room keys were festooned with ads for DirecTV. Newspapers left on room doorsteps were wrapped with ''belly bands'' promoting Nielsen. There were regular room deliveries of tote bags full of freebies.
 Some of the bazaarlike aspects of the conference may be muted next year as the association considers paring to perhaps 10 or 12 sponsors, and asking each to pay more than this year's did.
 DOWN MEMORY LANE There were several looks back during the conference at the history of the association, starting a commemoration of its founding in 1910. For instance, attendees were treated to vintage commercials from two members, General Mills and PepsiCo.
 The spot from PepsiCo, in black and white, was for Pepsi-Cola and featured a jingle, ''Now it's Pepsi, for those who think young,'' used from 1961 to 1964. The commercial showed couples at a lunch counter or soda fountain, dressed as formally as folks dress now for funerals.
 The spot from General Mills, also in black and white, was aimed at children; an announcer urged them to ''ask your mother to get Pillsbury cookie mix, the package with the big blue circle with the dots on it.'' The announcer extolled the chocolate chips in the mix as ''just like chocolate candy!''
 Mr. Liodice asked attendees to ''consider submitting some of your classic ads for us to show in the next year'' at other association events.

After weeks of political stalemate, Iraq approved a law on Sunday to administer a critical national election in January, a significant milestone for its fragile democracy and a step that will allow the rapid withdrawal of American combat forces early next year.
 The election, only the second national vote since the fall of Saddam Hussein, will be a crucial step toward popular sovereignty and stability in Iraq. But the election law had been stymied by a political battle over the northern province of Kirkuk, claimed by Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens, each of whom hoped electoral power would give them control of the region's oil wealth.
 The compromise reached Sunday, which satisfied all three groups, was hailed by Iraqi and American leaders as a triumph for Iraq's emerging democracy and a demonstration of Parliament's ability to resolve sticky sectarian disputes for the national benefit.
 ''Accomplishing this law is not a victory for anyone in particular, but a victory for the entire Iraqi people,'' said Faryad Raundozi, a member of Parliament's Kurdish Alliance. 
 The United States had said that a delay of the election could set back the scheduled withdrawal of American combat troops.
 On Sunday, President Obama called the Parliament's action ''a significant breakthrough'' that would ease fears about an American military withdrawal. 
 ''This agreement advances the political progress that can bring lasting peace and unity to Iraq, and allow for the orderly and responsible transition of American combat troops out of Iraq by next September,'' Mr. Obama said at the White House.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq said in a statement that the passage of the law had been a ''historic victory of the will of the people'' and a ''strong response'' to those seeking to undermine Iraq's democracy.
 American military commanders have said they intend to begin a rapid withdrawal of the 120,000 American troops still in Iraq after the election. The United States has pledged to withdraw all combat forces from Iraq by the end of next August, leaving about 50,000 troops in an advisory and support role. All American troops are scheduled to leave the country by the end of 2011.
 After the vote, the American ambassador to Iraq, Christopher R. Hill, said the withdrawal would proceed as planned. ''What is important is that with the election law, we are very much on schedule for the drawdown,'' he said.
 American and Iraqi officials hope the election will cement democracy here at a time when many people have grown discontented with their leadership and fed up with continued violence, corruption and high unemployment.
 The previous parliamentary vote, in 2005, was boycotted by many Sunni Arabs, an act that allowed the insurgency to fester and fueled subsequent sectarian bloodshed. This time, each of the major political parties and Iraqi's major religious and ethnic groups have all said they will participate.
 Khalid Ataya, the deputy speaker of Parliament, told members of the legislature that they were taking a momentous step in the country's young democratic history. ''The Parliament has done something important for the people of Iraq,'' he said. ''This is a big blow to terrorists.''
 As an indication of the election's importance to the United States, Mr. Hill was seen shuttling back and forth between the offices of various political parties all day Sunday in an effort to pressure them to reach a deal. 
 ''Go upstairs and vote!'' he shouted at a pair of slow-moving lawmakers as they climbed a set of stairs to the chamber before the session.
 The election had been scheduled for Jan. 16, but as the parliamentary session ended late Sunday, officials said it appeared that it would be delayed by a few days to give election officials time to print ballots and to make other preparations.
 For weeks, the legislature had wrestled with how to determine voter eligibility in Kirkuk, which sits on billions of barrels of oil. The issue threatened to undermine the election, and Parliament's inability to resolve it had become a symbol of Iraq's political dysfunction. 
 Tens of thousands of Kurds were forced out of Kirkuk by Saddam Hussein, who replaced them with Arabs in order to tighten his grip on the region's oil. Since the United States-led invasion that ousted Mr. Hussein in 2003, thousands of Kurds have moved back.
 Arabs and Turkmens in Kirkuk had favored using voter registration lists from 2004 or 2005, while Kurds wanted to use voter rolls from 2009 that reflected their substantially higher numbers. 
 The agreement reached Sunday, brokered by the United States and the United Nations, will use voter lists from 2009, but if the number of eligible voters in a particular area is deemed by members of Parliament to be suspiciously high, a committee overseen by the United Nations will be formed to determine whether fraud has occurred, according to a draft of the law.
 The compromise satisfied each of the groups competing for dominance in Kirkuk. ''We have passed a stage, a crisis, and no one is a loser,'' said Abbas al-Bayti, a Turkmen legislator.
 Osama al-Najafi, an Arab legislator, said: ''There will be no injustice for the people of Kirkuk. This is a great victory for their historical rights.''
 The election will also allow voters to choose individual candidates as part of an ''open list,'' as opposed to the closed-list ballot in which voters pick political parties, who in turn choose people to occupy seats in Parliament.
 The 2005 election used a closed list, which helped protect candidates from assassination, but it strengthened organized parties rather than individual candidates and was unpopular with voters.
 The new law, which also reserves a quarter of the next Parliament's seats for women, must be approved by President Jalal Talabani and his two vice presidents, which is expected to happen in a few days.
 Under the Constitution, the election must take place before the end of January, but an important Shiite religious observance comes during the last week of that month. 
 Hamdia al-Hussaini, a member of the Independent High Electoral Commission, the Iraqi government agency that oversees elections, said Sunday that the vote would have to be delayed at least several days past the scheduled date of Jan. 16. 
 ''It can't be held on the 16th because Parliament was late in passing the law,'' she said. 
 On Sunday, some Sunni Arab members of Parliament said they were unhappy about interference with the legislation by the United States, particularly the American insistence that elections not be delayed.
 ''Unfortunately, the Americans are insisting on certain dates more than they are insisting on the objectivity of their decisions,'' said Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni member of Parliament.
 Parliament has the final decision about when to hold the election.

HEADLINE: The Legacy Of 1989 Is Still Up For Debate

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The historical legacy of 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell and the cold war thawed, is as political as the upheavals of that decisive year.
 The events of 1989 spurred a striking transformation of Europe, which is now whole and free, and a reunified Germany, milestones that are being observed with celebrations all over the continent, including a French-German extravaganza Monday evening on the Place de la Concorde.
But 1989 also created new divisions and fierce nationalisms that hobble the European Union today, between East and West, France and Germany, Europe and Russia.
 Some of the intensity of those divisions is evident in the tug of war, in both Europe and the United States, over the achievements of 1989 -- whether they owe more to the resolute anti-Communism of Ronald Reagan or its inverse, the white-glove embrace of the East by many in Western Europe. 
 And while many in the West saw the wheel of history spinning inevitably, causing the rise of democracy and banishing serious rivals to American power, China forestalled its own revolution in 1989 and catapulted itself to prominence through an authoritarian capitalism that the leaders of Russia are now studying.
 ''The Chinese ended up with a Leninist capitalism, which none of us imagined in 1989, and which is now the main ideological competitor to Western liberal democracy,'' said Timothy Garton Ash, a chronicler of 1989 in his book ''The Magic Lantern.''
 It is a tribute to 1989, not unlike the French Revolution 200 years before it, that its meaning is hotly contested. Different groups in different countries see the anniversary differently, usually from their own ideological points of view.
 In general, said James M. Goldgeier of George Washington University, a historian of the period, ''the big question out there for 20 years is who gets the credit.'' 
 For many in the United States, he said, most of the credit now goes to President Ronald Reagan and his aggressive military spending and antagonism toward Communism. That view has largely eclipsed another American perspective, which was that globalization and democratization were so powerful that a Mikhail Gorbachev was inevitable, and that the cold war ended through ''soft power'' -- propaganda, diplomacy and the Helsinki accords.
 ''As the partisan divide over Reagan has dissipated, I think over time most Americans, if they think back at all, say it was Reagan who said, 'Tear down this wall,' and down it came,'' Professor Goldgeier said. 
 Robert Kagan, a historian with the Carnegie Endowment in Washington and an editor of The Weekly Standard, said conservatives won the debate. ''The standard narrative is Reagan,'' he said.
 This is not the case in Europe, Mr. Kagan said. ''If 90 percent of Americans say it was the U.S. being firm, 99 percent of Europeans think it was they being soft -- that the wall fell through Ostpolitik and West German TV.''
 For many Americans of both political parties, 1989 seemed a wonderful example of the embrace of universal values that happened to be theirs, and some believed it was only a matter of time before all dictatorships crumbled before the same forces of strength, openness, economic liberalism and people power. 
 Democrats argue that President George W. Bush learned the wrong lesson from 1989, about the utility of force, and Republicans argue that President Bill Clinton and President Obama learned the wrong lesson -- that ''engagement'' with totalitarian power, whether in China or Iran, will weaken or destroy it.
 For all the disagreements, however, said Ronald D. Asmus, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe in the Clinton administration and Brussels director of the German Marshall Fund, what happened was simply amazing.
 ''If someone asked me in '89 if we would have all these countries in NATO and the European Union, I would have been incredulous,'' Mr. Asmus said. ''We've lost sight of an incredible historical achievement -- the heart of Central and Eastern Europe is at peace. All problems are not fully solved, but they are tempered, controlled and contained, and we have a better chance of solving them.''
 Even the brief war last year between Georgia and Russia would have been very different without NATO, Mr. Asmus argued. ''These are not existential issues anymore,'' he said. ''They're not presidential problems, but assistant secretary of state problems.''
 Russia remains a challenge for both the United States and Europe, but a much safer one, argues Sergei Karaganov, who leads the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy in Moscow and was an adviser to the Russian presidents Boris N. Yeltsin and Vladimir V. Putin. 
 In Russia, Mr. Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, is widely despised for indecisiveness and for permitting the collapse of the empire, an event that Mr. Putin called the greatest geostrategic catastrophe of the last century.
 Not all Russians agree, but many do argue that the end of the Warsaw Pact should have led to the disbanding of NATO, or at least a decision not to expand the alliance to include states that were once part of the Soviet Union.
 ''The U.S. regarded itself as the victor in the cold war, but Russia does not regard itself as the loser,'' Mr. Karaganov said. ''At the very least we expected an honorable peace. Like Britain, we have never been defeated, and we remain ready to fight.''
 ''Hindsight is seductive, but there were a number of alternative futures from 1989,'' said Mary Elise Sarotte, who has just published ''1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe.'' ''The West chose a future that perpetuated a divided Europe and left Russia on the periphery.''
 One result of 1989 was the end of a bipolar world, but after a brief 20-year reign the period of American unipolarity is also ending, many Europeans say. 
 For Hubert Vedrine, a former French foreign minister who worked then for President Francois Mitterrand, 1989 led to a Western arrogance that is only slowly deflating with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and against Islamic radicalism.
 ''People mix the fall of the wall with the fall of Jericho in the Bible, as in, 'We've won; history is over,' etc.,'' he said. ''But to me it's the beginning, it's the prologue of an opera with a cymbal crash, the prologue of 15 to 20 years of Western arrogance.''
 A scramble for power and influence among several nations and blocs of nations -- Europe, China, Russia, India, Brazil and the United States -- now seems likely. Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations said, ''America is in relative decline, but has not yet accepted the changes, speaking of multilateralism but not accepting the consequences.'' In this transitional world, he said, ''nothing can be done without America, but nothing can be done by America alone.''
 But Americans are not likely to agree with this interpretation. Robert D. Blackwill, a longtime diplomat and adviser to Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, argues for the necessity of American leadership. ''I see no evidence that America is in decline,'' he said.
 In Central Europe itself, there are serious divisions over 1989, symbolized by the long and bitter rivalry in the Czech Republic between Vaclav Havel and Vaclav Klaus, between a softer collective polity, anchored by Europe, and a fierce individualist liberalism reluctant to give up sovereignty to the European Union that was so recently regained from the Soviet collapse.
 In the eyes of many in the old West, the events of 1989 enlarged but also diluted the European Union. The union has struggled ever since over how to deepen and solidify the alliance. ''There is a kind of melancholia toward Europe for part of the French, because in this whole, one has to negotiate with everyone,'' Mr. Vedrine said.
 For Mr. Garton Ash, the divide remains between Western and Eastern Europe. ''We hoped as Europeans that 1989 would be a second founding moment for the European project, and that this would become a pan-European memory and a shared cause for celebration,'' he said. ''But that hasn't happened. 'Eastern Europe' still exists in the collective memory and we haven't purged it.''
 Many people in the East, of course, suffered from 1989 and the sudden, even brutal switch to capitalism. ''They feel the transition was very tough on them and feel cheated and even betrayed, and are open to conspiracy theories about shady deals done at the round tables,'' Mr. Garton Ash said.
 ''It's not like the way in Britain we remember V-E Day,'' when Nazi Germany surrendered, he said. ''It's really quite divided.''

HEADLINE: No Clear Map for Democrats On Path to New Energy Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
On health care, President Obama and fellow Democrats face a straightforward calculus: sign an overhaul bill into law or suffer grave political damage.
 On energy, it is not so simple.
 Congress is unlikely, this year or next, to establish the ''cap and trade'' system for curbing carbon emissions that Mr. Obama and party leaders seek. Nor are world leaders at a climate conference in Copenhagen next month likely to strike a concrete deal to limit emissions in the name of curbing global warming.
 The Democrats' challenge, then, is to make enough progress to avoid defeat in the near term and achieve their priorities in the long term. Though advocates insist that transforming energy policy will bring economic and environmental benefits alike, rising joblessness has amplified attacks from critics who deride Mr. Obama's energy policy as a big-government ''cap and tax'' plan. 
 ''People really need to step back and get away from the quick-hit political slogans,'' said Senator John Kerry, right, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who has taken a leadership role on the issue. ''We're looking at an enormous opportunity, and we need to grab it.''
 But how to grab it is where Mr. Kerry, Mr. Obama and other Democrats disagree. 
 Divided on Emissions
 Long before the Democratic majority's breakthrough in approving health legislation over the weekend, the House passed a comprehensive energy bill. In the Senate, Mr. Kerry's partnership with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, signals the possibility of bipartisan cooperation.
 But while the Senate plans to consider health legislation soon, prospects for an energy bill capping carbon emissions appear shaky even next year. Skeptics argue that such a cap will inevitably raise energy costs when struggling Americans cannot afford it.
 ''People who turn the switch on at home are going to be disadvantaged,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat from Nebraska. ''As you turn on the lights, the electricity will cost more. Store owners, the same thing; manufacturers, the same thing.''
 Mr. Kerry said Mr. Nelson was ''wrong about that in terms of the net impact on states and on individuals.'' He added, ''While the unit price of gas or the unit price of electricity might go up individually, the overall costs of an individual at home and their total consumption will go down because of energy efficiencies.''
 Mr. Kerry wants to defuse such ''quick hit'' attacks with compromise legislation that includes incentives for expanding energy supplies through more offshore drilling and nuclear power. His proposal is also expected to offer carbon caps less stringent than the 20 percent cut from 2005 levels that Senator Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, pushed through her panel last week.
 The House-passed energy bill called for a 17 percent reduction, while also limiting the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory authority to curb emissions. Some environmental advocates said such concessions -- and more that might be needed to win a Senate vote -- might prompt the White House to abandon legislation altogether and simply use its regulatory power.
 First China, Then Copenhagen?
 By outlining his proposal before the Copenhagen summit, Mr. Kerry hopes to show enough commitment on the part of the United States to help negotiators move toward a deal. But European nations want much deeper reductions than those in any leading Congressional proposal.
 The United States might gain leverage through a bilateral deal with China, where Mr. Obama will travel in a few days to discuss energy issues. Because Beijing also wants more moderate reductions, ''China and the U.S. need each other,'' said Tim Wirth, a former Democratic senator from Colorado who is now president of the United Nations Foundation.
 The Obama administration has played down expectations for a breakthrough with Beijing, pointing instead toward cooperation on specific projects like the development of electric vehicles and ''sequestration'' methods to keep carbon out of the atmosphere. With regulatory steps to cut auto emissions, House action on energy and continuing progress on Senate legislation, ''We've got what we need to go to Copenhagen,'' said the White House energy policy coordinator, Carol M. Browner.
 Mr. Kerry favors a more ambitious approach, arguing that Mr. Obama should offer ''a proposal to China that's specific'' for reductions by the world's two largest emitters of carbon. ''He can get an agreement'' and generate momentum for the Copenhagen talks, said Mr. Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. 
 Administration aides said Mr. Obama had not decided whether to go to Copenhagen, where environmental advocates are sure to criticize the United States for failing to do more so far. For a president committed to international cooperation, Mr. Kerry said, skipping the talks would be a mistake.
 ''I don't think it's the right course,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''The president should go.''

HEADLINE: New York, Needing Cash, Pursuing Tax Delinquents

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Desperate for cash amid the worst fiscal crisis in years, New York State is pursuing tax debtors more aggressively than ever before, doubling the number of cases it is investigating and seeking to collect from delinquents ranging from JPMorgan Chase to an out-of-business convenience store on the Bowery. 
 Since the start of 2008, the state has filed more than 340,000 tax ''warrants,'' public notices of delinquency that can make it harder to get loans or sell property and can lead to garnished wages or even forfeiture proceedings. By the end of this year the state's Department of Taxation and Finance will have filed the largest number of warrants ever in a single year and settled about a million open cases, the most in state history.
 States across the country, strapped by plummeting revenues, are undertaking similar efforts, backed by improved disclosure laws and new technologies that allow them to more easily find delinquents. In Illinois, officials have started a pilot program using Internal Revenue Service databases to uncover sophisticated tax-avoidance schemes that use trusts and partnerships to hide income. In Minnesota and Georgia, enforcement officials have stepped up so-called residency audits, combing property and voting records to find people who live in the state but claim residence elsewhere to avoid state taxes. 
 New York, experts say, has been at the forefront of such efforts, with over 1.2 million active tax cases, almost twice the average caseload it had in years past. Thanks to the crackdown, New York officials say, overall revenue from enforcement actions is up by 40 percent during the past six months, bringing in an extra $185 million. 
 ''There are a lot of states interested in what New York is doing, and they have some envy,'' said Verenda Smith, an analyst at the Federation of Tax Administrators, a trade group.
 The crackdown has ensnared not only thousands of ordinary New Yorkers, but titans of finance, some major corporations and familiar names. The financier Marc S. Dreier, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for fraud, has an outstanding warrant for $1.26 million in unpaid income tax. Officials demanded $3.3 million in corporate taxes from the Walt Disney Corporation -- the company paid in July -- and $883,931 in withholding taxes from JPMorgan Chase, which gave out hundreds of millions in bonuses in the last year. 
 Tax officials have also sought $336,992 in unpaid income taxes from Andrew Stein, the former City Council president. Warrants for unpaid sales taxes have been issued to Bouley Bakery, an outpost of the chef David Bouley's culinary empire ($367,522); the BCBG Max Azria Group, makers of luxury apparel ($1.25 million); and the retail chain Steve & Barry's ($3.3 million), which declared bankruptcy last summer.
 They have even gone after tax delinquents who are behind bars. Last year, warrants for $2.4 million in unpaid sales taxes were issued to Kun Fuk Cheng, a former co-owner of a string of Albany-area Chinese restaurants. The address listed was the federal prison in Morgantown, W.Va., where Mr. Cheng is serving a 57-month sentence for income-tax evasion and other charges.
 And like scores of other businesses whose workers get paid mostly in cash, Ten's Cabaret, a Manhattan strip club, is on the hook for unpaid sales and withholding taxes ($538,113). 
 ''In every economic stratum, you're going to find some level of underreporting and cheating,'' said William J. Comiskey, the state's top tax enforcement official. ''It's true for the super-wealthy as well as those who are just making ends meet. I've been here two and a half years, and I'm still constantly surprised.''
 As Gov. David A. Paterson and state lawmakers battle over how to close a $3 billion budget gap for the current fiscal year, some want to take an even harder line.
 State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein and Assemblyman William Colton have proposed legislation that would use a Web site to make public the name of any tax delinquent who owes the state more than $5,000. Another bill would give state agencies the right to deny renewals of professional licenses -- from medical licenses to cosmetology licenses -- to people and businesses that ignore warrants. 
 ''We should always be vigilant about enforcing our tax laws, but it becomes even more important when we are in tough fiscal times, when millions of law-abiding people are paying their taxes the way they are supposed to,'' Mr. Klein said.
 Mr. Klein and Mr. Paterson have also proposed tax amnesty programs that would forgive some part of the penalties and interest tax delinquents owe in exchange for quickly paying the underlying tax bill. Such programs in other states have produced hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue. Budget officials estimate that Mr. Paterson's plan, which is aimed at those with older, larger tax bills, would reap about $250 million.
 ''We want to get to them sooner,'' said Robert L. Megna, the state budget director. ''A pizza shop, if he falls behind in his sales taxes a month or two, he ends up owing you a quarter of his receipts, plus penalties and interest. He can't pay you. So you need to find that guy before he gets too much in arrears. If you find him a year later, he's going to owe you his whole business.''
 The stepped-up enforcement is possible in part through better automation, more efficient use of third-party data and tougher disclosure laws. Using sales data from liquor wholesalers, for example, the state can identify bars and restaurants that may be underreporting how many drinks they sell. 
 Tax officials now routinely exchange data with banks to identify accounts owned by those with outstanding warrants. And under a new state law, any franchised company in the world that operates in New York State is required to submit an annual report of the sales activities of its franchisees.
 ''Every state I'm familiar with is interested in increasing voluntarily compliance through technological innovations that tell taxpayers they have to pay their taxes because they will be caught if they don't,'' Mr. Comiskey said. 
 About half of all outstanding tax bills are collected by the state before a warrant is issued. And large companies with big, complex tax bills face rolling audits that can take years to resolve.
 Though such negotiations normally take place in private, bankruptcy proceedings and other court action can provide an occasional glimpse into the sums at stake. According to claims filed in federal court in September that are still pending, the bankrupt financial giant Lehman Brothers owes New York State $1.2 billion in corporate, sales and withholding taxes dating back to 1994. (New York City has filed a separate claim totaling $627 million.)
 Tax officials say such negotiations help avoid more costly and time-consuming litigation. But some lawmakers question whether the state has been tough enough with bigger tax bills.
 ''Large corporations should not be treated any differently than the beer distributor in my district, who is juggling paying his rent and his payroll and his taxes,'' said State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr., a Bronx Democrat.
 A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase said that the company was in the process of satisfying both of the warrants the state had issued against it.
 ''As soon we learned of this from the government, we reached out to the state to correct the matter,'' said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli.
 Mr. Stein said he, too, was paying down his tax debt. Bouley Bakery, according to a restaurant spokesman, has paid its back taxes and interest and is seeking relief on some penalties. BCBG Max Azria and Steve & Barry's have also moved to satisfy outstanding warrants but are waiting for the state to formalize the paperwork for some of them, according to company spokesmen. 
 And that Bowery convenience store? After racking up almost a quarter of a million dollars in unpaid corporate taxes in recent years, according to state records, the store closed. A high-end women's boutique now occupies the address, selling $1,400 dresses rather than candy bars and coffee.
 Not everyone is in a rush to get right with the tax man. Gerald L. Shargel, a lawyer for Mr. Dreier, said that his client had other things to worry about. 
 ''When he puts his head on the prison pillow tonight,'' Mr. Shargel said, ''the unpaid taxes won't cause him to lose any sleep.''

The health system in the United States may be twice as expensive as those in Europe, and the population may be less healthy, but at least Americans have access to many more choices of doctors and insurers. Right?
 No, says Ab Klink, the Dutch health minister.
 Mr. Klink was in Washington last week to attend an annual meeting sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund, a private health care research foundation, and swap ideas with counterparts from other countries. At the meeting, the foundation released the results of a survey of doctors from 11 countries that reflected poorly on the United States. 
 For instance, just 29 percent of primary care doctors in the United States reported making arrangements for patients to see a doctor or nurse after hours, compared with 97 percent in the Netherlands and 89 percent in Britain. And doctors in the United States were many times as likely than doctors elsewhere to report that restrictions in insurance coverage caused major problems with the time that they or their staff were able to spend providing needed medication or treatment.
 Between meetings, Mr. Klink sat down with The New York Times. The Dutch are in the midst of a significant health overhaul to inject greater competition into the nation's insurance and hospital markets, but Mr. Klink also offered some pointed observations of the health system in the United States. 
 His first official visit to the United States as health minister came in 2007, and he came with the usual European preconceptions that this country had a wide open and fiercely competitive health insurance market with a myriad choices.
 ''And what struck me,'' he said, ''is actually the lack of competition you have.'' 
 Mr. Klink pointed out that nearly 40 percent of the nation's population gets care from Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Affairs, all of which have significant restrictions on the choices available to patients. ''We don't have these kind of public insurance groups in our country,'' he said. 
 And even among those in the United States who get insurance from their work, he went on, ''it's the employer who is making the choices of the health plans from which you can choose.'' 
 In the Netherlands, everyone chooses from a list of 10 or so insurers who offer a standardized health plan that can be enriched with other options. Those who cannot afford the premiums are given subsidies; premiums are based on the benefits offered, not on a person's age, health status or sex. 
 The government once set prices for nearly all medical services, but to inject some competition into the system, the government last year allowed prices to vary for about one-third of medical services. Next year that share will increase to half.
 Here is an edited transcript of the conversation:
 Q. HAVE PRICES SOARED?
 A. All the prices that we have liberated have on average gone down or stayed the same. This was quite a success. We are just beginning to have this competition, and the health insurance companies are only beginning to bargain prices. 
 Q. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF SERVICES WHOSE PRICES YOU LIBERATED?
 A. Knee and hip replacement operations, diabetes care and cardiovascular management, eye operations, etc.
 Q. AND HOW DO YOU ENSURE HIGH QUALITY?
 A. For about 80 percent of health care provisions, we are creating quality indicators. It's a problem we want to finish by 2011. Many, many people are interested in quality indicators for hospitals. We all have family and friends, and people call us when they have to go to the hospital and ask us, ''Which one is the best one?'' And I think it's quite important to have this double movement of liberalizing prices and having complete transparency on quality.
 Q. AND ARE YOUR QUALITY INDICATORS BASED ON MEDICAL PROCESSES OR ON PATIENTS' OUTCOMES?
 A. A combination. For instance, one indicator for diabetes care might be the level of glucose in patients, and the level of referrals to hospitals and the complications from patients -- such as infections or how many people had to come back to the hospital within 30 days. 
 Q. DOCTORS HERE COMPLAIN THAT SUCH COMPARISONS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SICKNESS OF PATIENTS.
 A. Yes, we are controlling for that. 
 Q. YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS FOR PATIENTS. HOW ARE THOSE PLAYING A ROLE IN YOUR REFORMS?
 A. We are trying to make sure that no one receives health care that is not coordinated. And that the general practitioners cannot negotiate any longer with insurance companies unless they are part of a coherent group that is offering coherent care. That is a change that we will implement in the coming years, and electronic medical records are critical for this.
 Q. THERE SEEMS LITTLE DOUBT THAT POOR PEOPLE GET BETTER CARE IN THE NETHERLANDS THAN HERE. BUT DO THE MIDDLE-CLASS AND RICH IN THE UNITED STATES GET BETTER CARE?
 A. The Dutch health care system offers top quality. We have some famous institutions in our country. So I do think we have a high standard of quality, and it's open for everyone. And if there is a fear that the rationing of care would lower quality, what I have tried to indicate is that we are not rationing anymore. It's all negotiable. And I'm quite sure that if someone could offer a high standard of quality which is even better than we have at this moment, the insurance companies would, if needed, pay more. 
 Q. YOU ARE VISITING THE MAYO CLINIC, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A MODEL THE WORLD OVER. WOULD WE LOSE OUR EDGE IN TOP-FLIGHT MEDICINE IF WE ADOPTED A SYSTEM LIKE YOURS?
 A. I cannot tell you that Dutch hospitals are better than the Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins. Probably it's the other way around. That's why we're visiting them. But it's not because this kind of quality would not be allowed in our system. We would love the Mayo to open a hospital in the Netherlands.
 Q. BUT IS THERE SOME QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF SUCH TOP-FLIGHT HOSPITALS?
 A. If you look at Kaiser Permanente or the Mayo Clinic, it's important to note that they were both started by people who really cared about patients and instilled a culture to offer the best health care possible, and they were able to keep this culture for many decades. And as far as I'm informed, prices in these institutions are not that different than those in other institutions or those in Holland. So I don't think the fundamental aspect of these institutions has to do with the liberal climate in your country.
 Q. HOW CAN YOU ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF SUCH PLACES?
 A. What I do not want is the rationing of care and what we call budgeting. So that hospitals get a certain amount of money, and there is no incentive for them to innovate. Because the aging of our society is a major threat for health systems in the future. Many people will want and receive health care, but if there is a shortage of labor, and demand will rise, so prices will go up enormously. 
 That's the main reason we tried to change the system and why innovation is so important. Without it, there won't be enough doctors or nurses, because competing parts of the economy will pay more.

HEADLINE: Promises on Open Space

 BODY:
In 1965, Congress came up with an elegant idea: Use some of the royalties from offshore oil and gas drilling to buy and conserve open space threatened by development. The dollars raised from depleting one natural resource would be used to protect another. Since then, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has invested more than $13 billion and added more than five million acres to the national parks, wildlife refuges and national forests. 
 Beginning in 1977, Congress annually authorized a spending level of $900 million (from a much larger royalty pool, which now totals $12 billion). But because Congress routinely diverted much of the money to the Treasury for deficit reduction, actual appropriations have been far less. In President George W. Bush's last year, only $155 million was appropriated for the fund. 
 President Obama promised more than $400 million this year and the full $900 million in 2015. Senators Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Max Baucus of Montana have a better idea. Last week, they introduced a bill that would guarantee financing of $900 million every year, beginning with the next fiscal year, and would insulate the fund from future raids. Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia is promoting the same idea in the House.
 There is plenty of evidence that, even in the midst of a recession, Americans are willing to spend money to protect open space. According to a tally by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, a conservation group, voters approved two out of three open space bond issues across 11 states last week, including a $400 million ''Green Acres'' measure in New Jersey. 
 More federal dollars are needed to help complete long-pending acquisitions from Hawaii to Yellowstone National Park to the Everglades. The money would also help hard-pressed states, like New York, whose own land conservation program has been severely squeezed by huge budget shortfalls. 
 A guaranteed source of revenue for land and water conservation is something the original architects of the fund had in mind. It's past time for Congress to honor their wish.

HEADLINE: A Squeeze on Customers Ahead of New Rules

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and LOWELL BERGMAN; Edmund L. Andrews contributed reporting.

 BODY:
 Banks are struggling to make money in the credit card business these days, and consumers are paying the price. Interest rates are going up, credit lines are being cut and a variety of new fees are being imposed on even the best cardholders.
One recipient of new credit card terms is Anita Holaday, a 91-year-old in Florida, who received a letter last month from Citibank announcing that her new interest rate was 29.99 percent, an increase of 10 percentage points.
 ''I think it's outrageous they pursue such a policy,'' said Susan Holaday Schumacher, Ms. Holaday's daughter, who pays her mother's bills. ''That rate is shocking under any circumstances.''
 While the average interest rates charged by banks are lower than Ms. Holaday's, her situation is not all that unusual. The higher rates and fees reflect the grim new realities of the credit card industry -- the percentage of uncollectible balances has hit a record even as a new law may further limit the cards' profitability. 
 Banks began raising interest rates and pulling back credit lines about a year ago as delinquencies crept upward and regulators discussed reforms. As banks have become more aggressive in making changes, lawmakers have accused them of trying to impose rate increases before many of the new rules take effect in February.
 On Monday, the Federal Reserve provided new evidence of the banks' actions. About 50 percent of the banks responding to the Fed's survey said they were increasing interest rates and reducing credit lines on borrowers with good credit scores. About 40 percent said they were imposing higher fees. The banks also said they were demanding higher minimum credit scores and tightening other requirements. 
 A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, released late last month, concluded that the 12 largest banks, issuing more than 80 percent of the credit cards, were continuing to use practices that the Fed concluded were ''unfair or deceptive'' and that in many instances had been outlawed by Congress.
 In response to voter complaints, the House of Representatives voted last week to make the law effective immediately. The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote has not been scheduled. The Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, meanwhile, is pushing legislation that would freeze interest rates on existing credit card balances until the law takes effect.
 Whatever the starting date, the law makes it much harder for banks to change interest rates on existing balances, and requires more time and notice before a new rate can go into effect. 
 In their defense, banking officials say they have no choice but to raise rates and limit credit. Because of the new rules and the prolonged economic malaise, they say it is now far riskier to issue credit cards than it was just a few years ago.
 ''We sell credit; we don't sell sweaters,'' said Kenneth J. Clayton, senior vice president for card policy at the American Bankers Association. ''The only way to manage your return is through the price of the product or the availability.''
 The nation's largest banks are scrambling to figure out a new business model that fits within the new rules and current economic conditions. Those banks made handsome profits over the last decade by charging high interest rates and penalty fees to a small group of customers who routinely paid late or exceeded their balances.
 Already, banks are shifting to a model in which a smaller pool of Americans will be eligible for credit cards, and customers with cards will probably pay more for the privilege through annual fees and higher interest.
 Meanwhile, the banks are in the process of shedding customers considered too risky. That means tens of thousands of Americans will no longer be able to splurge on Nike gym shoes or flat-screen televisions unless, of course, they have enough cash to pay for them. 
 Still, even consumer advocates have said that the banks were too quick in the past to give out credit. ''You know, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you keep borrowing and borrowing in order to consume now, eventually you crash and burn,'' said Martin Eakes, chief executive for the Center for Responsible Lending. ''That's what we're facing.''
 In the 12 months that ended in September, the number of Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover card accounts in the United States fell by 72 million, according to David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. There are 555 million accounts still in the marketplace, he said.
 In roughly the same time period, banks lowered credit limits by 26 percent, to $3.4 trillion, from $4.6 trillion, according to an analysis of government data by Foresight Analytics.
 Interest on credit card accounts, meanwhile, has increased to an average of 13.71 percent, up from 11.94 percent a year ago, according to federal records.
 As to credit card charge-offs -- industry lingo for uncollectible balances -- the number tracks the unemployment rate and, therefore, is hovering at around 10 percent.
 For the banks, this is uncharted territory. In the modern financing era, credit cards were long a profit center, producing tens of billions in annual profits with a default rate that hovered around 4 percent until the recession.
 ''We know we are going to lose a lot of money next year in cards, and it could be north of $1 billion in both the first quarter and the second quarter. And that number will probably only start coming down as you see unemployment and charge-offs come down,'' Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in an earnings call last month.
 Banking officials said that because the new law limits their ability to reprice credit as a customer's risk profile changes, they will instead have to price for future risk at the start, when a cardholder applies for a new card.
 That means fewer applicants will be approved for new credit cards, and those who are accepted will increasingly be charged annual fees or variable interest rates, rather than fixed rates. Currently, about 20 percent of credit cards charge annual fees, a percentage that is rising, said Bill Hardekopf, chief executive of LowCards.com. Current cardholders, too, will be affected.
 Asked to explain its rate increases, Citibank issued a statement saying the ''actions are necessary given the losses across the industry from customers not paying back their loans and regulatory changes that eliminate repricing for that risk.''
 Ms. Holaday Schumacher did not accept that explanation. She said she haggled with Citibank to try to get her mother's bills forwarded to her house in Washington and, during the process, two bills were inadvertently paid late, resulting in the rate increase.
 ''How unbelievably unfair for an older person who might not understand what this is all about,'' she said. Citibank declined to comment on the account.
 Still, many of the nation's banks are trying to repair their tarnished reputations with consumers.
 American Express and Discover Financial, for instance, have vowed to stop charging fees when cardholders exceed their credit limits. JPMorgan has started a program that can help consumers categorize their spending and pay down their balances more quickly.
 And Bank of America is promoting a line of consumer products so simple that the terms and conditions fit on one page. The BankAmericard Basic Visa, for instance, has no rewards and a single interest rate.
 Andrew Rowe, Global Card Services strategy executive at Bank of America, said the new products represented a sea change in the bank's attitude toward consumer products. Instead of benefiting from consumers who displayed risky behavior by penalizing them with fees, the bank is now trying to help them break those bad habits, he said.
 ''We succeed if our customers succeed,'' he said. ''That's the paradigm shift.''
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, for one, said he would welcome consumer products that were simpler and less risky. But, he added in an interview with the PBS documentary program ''Frontline'': ''It's a bit of a late conversion. It would have been nice to happen earlier.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Tuesday about banks' raising rates and fees on credit card customers ahead of new federal regulations misstated, in some editions, the current total of credit limits in the United States and those limits roughly a year ago. Total credit limits are now $3.4 trillion, not billion, which is a reduction from $4.6 trillion, not billion, a year ago. 
 THE CARD GAME: This is the fourth article in a series about the changing nature of the consumer credit business. It is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS program ''Frontline,'' whose report will be broadcast Nov. 24 (check local listings).

HEADLINE: Colts Game Should Provide Test of Brady's Health

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
Tom Brady looked a little weary and in need of a shave after the New England Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. Maybe he was just tired of everyone wondering if he was back to normal eight games into the season. It's time to answer that question honestly. 
 Is Brady ever going to look the way he did in 2007? Maybe not, considering that even the Patriots did not resemble their own fabled juggernaut by the end of that season and they no longer have Donte' Stallworth and Jabar Gaffney, who combined for more than 1,000 receiving yards that season. With Wes Welker and Randy Moss, the Patriots had one of the best receiving foursomes in N.F.L. history. 
 But does Brady look great for a player who missed essentially an entire season with a devastating knee injury? Considering that in his last three games, he has thrown for 1,020 yards (in three consecutive 300-yard games), 10 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, yes. Let it go. 
 ''We've analyzed every drop-back and throw and his inner feelings,'' said Phil Simms, CBS's lead analyst and a former Giants quarterback. ''Everybody predicted he'd come out and be on fire. We've seen just about every single quarterback that misses a little time in preseason struggle. So what do we expect of a quarterback who missed a whole year? To say it was a struggle is overstating it.'' 
 Peyton Manning had his own creaky comeback from off-season knee surgery last year, and although Manning has never missed a start, he could not immediately bounce back from an injury far less severe than Brady's. Perhaps the friends can compare scars Sunday night when their teams face off in their annual grudge match. 
 It's no accident the game is this week: the N.F.L. schedules it each year to coincide with the end of the baseball season and the start of the second half of the football season. It has often determined home-field advantage in the American Football Conference playoffs. 
 Last year, the two knee injuries took some of the luster off the game because both teams were struggling for survival, rather than playoff seeding. Not so this season. The Colts are 8-0, one of two unbeaten teams remaining, and the Patriots (6-2) are two games up in the A.F.C. East. 
 This game could produce an epic shootout because the Colts have a virtually nonexistent running offense. That's why, as much as any other game, this will be the ultimate test of Brady's health. Because of injuries, the Colts are starting two rookie cornerbacks, and safety Bob Sanders, one of the league's best defensive players, is out for the season with a biceps injury. Before his injury, Brady would have been expected to pick this defense apart.Houston quarterback Matt Schaub completed 32 of 43 passes for 311 yards, a touchdown and 2 interceptions against it Sunday in the Texans' 20-17 loss. In the Patriots' 27-17 victory Sunday, the Dolphins matched a rookie cornerback on Moss, and Vontae Davis did an admirable job, outjumping him for an early interception. But Moss's 71-yard catch-and-run touchdown was a thing of beauty. Welker ran a crossing pattern, drawing the safety to him. That left Moss, crossing the other way, in single coverage with Davis. Catch, stiff-arm, face plant, touchdown. 
 Until the injuries set in, the Colts had been playing a far more aggressive defense with more blitzing than under their former coach Tony Dungy. That would be the perfect formula to combat Brady, who, despite his statistics, has had only one pinpoint perfect game this season: against the Titans, when he threw six touchdown passes. But an inexperienced secondary leaves the Colts vulnerable now. Barring a collapse, both teams are going to the playoffs, almost certainly as division champions. The jockeying for January is under way. 
 ''I think the one thing about that game is you've got to play a great game to win,'' Brady said. ''You can't go out there and play your B game, because you won't beat those guys.''
 Freeman's Turn in Tampa
 When Josh Freeman was at Kansas State, he was thrown in as the Wildcats' quarterback when the player ahead of him got hurt. Freeman, 21, is the 6-foot-6, 248-pounder who on Sunday became the youngest quarterback to start and win a game in the N.F.L. He passed for 205 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Green Bay Packers as Tampa Bay (1-7) won. 
 With his build and mobility (he also had four rushes for 20 yards), Freeman would seem to have been an ideal candidate to run the Wildcat, or, as Pat White did for the Dolphins on Sunday, the spread option, when Freeman was a backup to Byron Leftwich and Josh Johnson. But the Buccaneers had something more in mind for him, and now that he's the starter, good luck wresting the ball out of his hands to add an offensive wrinkle. 
 ''You don't see somebody subbing in for Tom Brady,'' Freeman said in a recent interview. ''They run their stuff. Quarterbacking is a lot about playing in a rhythm. When you substitute, it can disrupt that. Teams realize that if you have your starter and he plays well, then the other guy comes in and plays great, all of a sudden it's a quarterback controversy. I think it's better for a team to run with one guy.'' 
 Freeman is surely that guy for Tampa Bay. He was the 17th overall pick, and several talent evaluators regarded him more highly than Mark Sanchez, who was taken 12 spots higher and is now the Jets' starter. Coach Raheem Morris loved Freeman in part because he knew him from one season when he coached at Kansas State. Freeman's size and mobility have drawn comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger, which may seem like a reach unless you were, until Sunday, a Buccaneers fan with no hope. 
 It has been a tough year in Tampa. The team is about $25 million below the salary cap, leading to speculation that the Glazer family, which owns the team, could be in financial trouble stemming from its acquisition of Manchester United. And there have been considerable questions about whether Morris, 33, is in over his head, particularly after he fired the offensive coordinator Jeff Jagodzinski 10 days before the season. But compared with the debacle on the other sideline -- Aaron Rodgers was sacked six times as the Packers lost their second in a row -- things look so sunny for the Buccaneers' future with Freeman that the team may want to consider bringing back the Creamsicle jerseys permanently. 
 Going for 2, and Making It
 When the N.F.L. debated adding the 2-point conversion starting in the 1970s -- it had been a part of the American Football League but did not make the leap when the leagues merged -- coaches resisted. Their reason: ''Coaches didn't like it because it was such a way to second-guess them,'' said Gil Brandt, a former Cowboys executive. 
 The 2-point conversion was added in 1994. And coaches were promptly proved correct. It is a great font for armchair quarterbacking because so many coaches cannot get it right. Dick Vermeil developed a chart when he was the coach at U.C.L.A. that was supposed to clarify the situations that made sense for the 2-point conversion, and maybe it has helped somebody along the way. But Jets Coach Rex Ryan and Dolphins Coach Tony Sparano botched it last week, when each went for the 2 points very early in his team's game. Phil Simms's suggestion? ''They should take the chart and burn it.'' 
 Being, well, Bill Belichick, Belichick has extensively researched the 2-point probability, even seeking out the work of a Rutgers statistics professor who had studied it. On Sunday, he turned his back on conventional wisdom and went for the 2-point conversion in the third quarter, far too early for most charts and for Simms's taste. But Belichick, whose flat-line sideline expression suggests the internal temperature of an Internal Revenue Service auditor, made the decision based on an amalgamation of his feel for the flow of the game -- Simms likes that part -- and a facility with numbers you would expect from an economics student. 
 ''We're up by 5, it's late in the third quarter, you kind of feel like that's not going to be the last score in this game,'' Belichick said. ''So you could go up by 6, but then you kick a field goal and now you're up by 9. Those things start to add up a little bit. There are a lot of different multiples there. Had it been later in the game it would have been an obvious decision. 
 ''We just felt like we were moving the ball pretty well, offensively. We felt like we had a good play; that was probably the most important thing. But I could have easily kicked it there and come in here and said I feel like I did the right thing, too. I think that one was right on the edge.''
 It worked for the Patriots, who took a 7-point lead late in the third quarter. But even Belichick does not always get it right. The Patriots failed on their previous 2-point tries this season. Still, with a 33 percent success rate, Belichick is near the league average, 35 percent.

HEADLINE: A Brand Favored by Muscle Men Wants to Appeal to More Women

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
SALES of vitamins and minerals are projected to grow more than 6 percent this year -- to $11.2 billion, from $10.6 billion in 2008 -- according to Mintel, a market research firm, and that bump may come not in spite of the economic downturn, but because of it. 
 ''Economy-conscious consumers concerned with avoiding illness, and thus avoiding sick days, turn to supplements to maintain good health,'' Mintel wrote in a recent report. 
 ''People tend to take better care of themselves when there are tough economic conditions,'' said Joe Fortunato, chief executive of GNC, the vitamin and supplement retailer. A healthy diet, exercise and supplements ''are a way to reduce health care costs down the road,'' Mr. Fortunato said.
 Revenue at GNC increased 2.5 percent in the first six months of 2009 over the same period a year ago, to $872 million from $851 million. 
 Now GNC is hoping to reach a broader audience with a new advertising campaign focusing on women, whom the company acknowledges it has been less successful in reaching than men striving to build muscles. 
 Ads for a new line of products for women called Wellbeing are beginning to appear in magazines including Self, Glamour, Yoga Journal and O, the Oprah Magazine, the first time GNC has placed ads in some of those women's titles. 
 The ads, by Arnell in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, feature black-and-white photographs of wholesome women, and resemble ads for antiwrinkle creams or cosmetics. 
 The products -- including be-Beautiful, which promises to revitalize skin, hair and nails, and be-Hot, which promises to ''maximize the results of your workout'' -- are packaged in pastel containers, with pills that also are pink or lavender. Those pills are smaller than the norm for GNC, and have a flavored coating, since company research found a common complaint among women was that vitamins were unpleasant to swallow.
 The goal was to ''create a brand that looks like it was designed for women, by women,'' said Beth J. Kaplan, president and chief merchandising and marketing officer at GNC. Containers have a clear window so women can glimpse pills that are ''smaller and colored and really quite pretty,'' Ms. Kaplan said. 
 General Nutrition Centers -- first called Lackzoom -- began as a small chain in Pittsburgh in 1935 selling yogurt, honey and grains. Today it has more than 6,700 locations internationally, about 5,300 in the United States, including 1,756 store-within-a-store locations at Rite Aid drugstores. 
 Mr. Fortunato said that as little as 6 percent of revenue was from basic vitamins like A or C, while the strongest sellers were proprietary blends, many offering nothing short of physical transformation. Different formulas, for example, promise weight gain, weight loss and weight maintenance.
 Mintel said that ''a dominant trend in the marketing of vitamins and minerals is advertising that spotlights gender-specific goals,'' reporting that products for women have grown the most sharply, with 86 ''female-related'' supplements introduced in 2008, more than double the 36 in 2007.
 According to GNC, while about half of its current customers are women, they often are buying items for their families rather than for themselves. 
 Along with trying to woo women with new products, it is redesigning stores with them in mind. 
 A concept store it calls the ''prototype for the future,'' also designed by Arnell, opened recently at the Ross Park Mall in suburban Pittsburgh. At 3,000 square feet, the store is considerably larger than the typical 1,300-square-foot GNC outlet, and it features brightly colored display cases and photographs on the walls of women doing yoga, men lifting barbells and close-ups of pastel-colored pills. 
 The goal of the new design is to draw women, yet not be off-putting to men.
 ''Men are mission-oriented in how they shop,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ''They come into a store very focused, and they know what they want -- they may ask a few questions, but they're very goal-oriented.'' 
 Women, on the other hand, ''are more about the shopping experience -- they want to look, browse, spend some time and they tend to be less goal oriented,'' she said. ''We've opened up the space enough so that men can be goal oriented and women can spend some time browsing.''
 What is ''a bit of a high-wire act,'' Ms. Kaplan said, is attracting new female customers while not alienating the males by being froufrou. GNC is watching the new store closely, and after tweaking the design will reconfigure stores elsewhere, but it declined to give a time frame for doing so.
 In 1995, the company redesigned about 30 of its stores as ''Live Well'' environments, named for the slogan it still uses today, but those stores neither lived nor did well. 
 ''They were 3,500 square feet, and they had hand-cut soaps and fragrances and waterfalls in the middle of the stores,'' said Mr. Fortunato. ''They were aesthetically pleasing stores for females, but they really shut off the sports fitness consumer.''

HEADLINE: Offering Hope In Haircuts For the Jobless

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It was clear that Sunday was shaping up to be a rare shot of Indian summer, the ideal day for wandering through a park or lazing around on stoops or eating outdoors. But Theresa Cheung, 27, a fashion designer, had somewhere to be at 9:45 a.m., and a warm, golden day would not deter her. Freakishly perfect days are hard to come by in November, but they're probably not as hard to come by as a good, free haircut at a New York salon. They're also not as useful on a job interview. 
 A few days earlier, Ms. Cheung was leafing through Time Out New York magazine when she noticed a write-up promising free haircuts at the Cristiano Cora studio in Greenwich Village to anyone who brought proof of unemployment, sort of a public service to style-conscious job seekers. Ms. Cheung researched the salon, which got strong reviews online, and where haircuts start at $100, and imagined there would be a mob scene -- women with expensive handbags but telltale split ends, out-of-work designers she had run into on interviews, unemployed fashion editors, not to mention every diligent coupon-cutter in town. Instead, she was second in line, with only a few people behind her. By 10:10 a.m., Ms. Cheung was in a stylist's chair, chatting about the plight of her career and her hair. 
 If only job hunting were this easy: Do your research, show up early, catch the worm. Ms. Cheung, who was a lingerie designer until she was laid off four months ago, has not found the search to be all that easy. She has cut back on all the nonessentials: the dinners out, the fancy bread, the $200 cut-wash-dry-hot oil treatments of yore (alas, color and other services beyond the scissors were not free at the salon). She had not had even a trim since March, and those wispy ends of her long, dark hair were starting to get on her nerves. They say you should never let them see you sweat -- they should also never see you brushing hair out of your eyes. 
 For someone down on her luck, Ms. Cheung looked fairly radiant as a stylist showed her how her new bob could go from corporate to punky with a few strategic tousles. It was not just the good haircut that was improving Ms. Cheung's mood. ''It's good to know you're not alone -- to be around people who understand your situation,'' she said. And not just any people -- people who looked, by the time the stylists were finished, like they had little to worry about except making sure no one messed with their hair.
 Around the sleek, white room, the people who showed up for the event, held on Sunday and Monday, to have their hair done spoke of a common theme: change. ''I'm trying to reinvent myself,'' said Carmen Ramirez, 39, a former fashion buyer from Washington Heights who is going back to school to learn medical billing. She had not had her hair cut professionally for a year, and it had grown to her waist. ''This is starting the change process -- getting a new cut,'' she said. 
 Cristiano Cora, who usually charges $300 a cut, was working on the long, dark locks of Hanan Zdeg, a painter and single mother who got by mostly on retail clothing sales until that work dried up. ''I'm just hoping for a transformation,'' Ms. Zdeg said. Into what, exactly? ''A pretty woman with easy, manageable hair.'' 
 ''You're already pretty,'' Mr. Cora assured her, sounding surprisingly paternal for someone with avant-garde sideburns. ''Tomorrow you're going to go out and look for an interview and get a job.'' 
 It's the Lily Bart dilemma Edith Wharton spelled out in ''The House of Mirth'': To gain access to wealth and fashion, one has to keep up appearances, but keeping up appearances can be impossible unless you've already got access to wealth and fashion. Mr. Cora and his staff, as well as some other stylists he had trained, were trying to help the clientele, many of whom worked in fashion or theater or marketing, sidestep this conundrum. Call it the good-hair school of economics. ''We're trying to prepare them so they can get working and feel good and come back into salons,'' said Jeanise Aviles, a stylist working on Ms. Ramirez's hair. ''Our business has slowed down, too.'' 
 For Andrea Friedland, an out-of-work marketing executive, a large part of the pleasure would come from telling her husband his cynicism was unjustified. ''My husband said nothing is free in New York,'' she said. ''Now I can go home and say, 'You're wrong!' ''
 Her husband thought maybe his wife would arrive to find students cutting hair. But even if there had been, how bad could their work have been for zero dollars? After all, it's only hair. It grows back. If only the job market would.

HEADLINE: Opening Up a Crowded Home After a Sister's Death

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
The Fields household is jam-packed. 
 Pots and pans are stacked atop the kitchen table. The refrigerator is close to overflowing. Crates of clothes cram the living room, and there are not enough beds for the family of seven living in the tiny two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in a housing project in gritty Morrisania in the Bronx.
 ''It's overcrowded,'' admitted Felicia Fields, 38, the head of the family. ''But we don't stress on it as long as we have love.'' 
 The sudden death of Ms. Fields's sister, Carol, from septicemia in June 2008 brought two more children into a space that already included Ms. Fields's children -- Justin, 10; Jasmyn, 14; and Johnathon, 19 -- and her fiance, Barron Smith. The fathers of Tichina Fields, 17, and Christopher Fields, 8, declined to take an active parenting role after Carol Fields's death, so Felicia Fields moved them from their apartment in Riverdale, and was eventually granted full guardianship. 
 ''I'm just grateful to keep them together, because I couldn't imagine a world without them,'' Ms. Fields said. ''I couldn't let them go to foster care.'' 
 Tichina, a straight-A student and a fledgling writer who became afflicted with cerebral palsy after suffering from bleeding in her brain after her premature birth, and Christopher, a train and bridge buff who has autism and attention deficit disorder, refused to eat for a while after the move. Christopher told a school counselor he wanted to go to heaven with his mother. But eventually they became enmeshed in the family fabric, wordlessly tapping away on their Game Boys alongside their cousins and swapping computer time for the completion of their chores. 
 ''The moment they came, I said, 'We're never going to forget about Mommy,' '' Ms. Fields said. ''Sometimes Tichina comes back and wants to talk, so we have our moment and we talk. I tell her it's O.K. to cry.''
 But lack of space is a major hindrance. Johnathon, Justin and Jasmyn share a bedroom, alternating between bunk beds and a mattress on the floor, and Tichina and Christopher sleep on the couch. 
 ''We can't even sit at the dinner table together like most families -- we have to eat separately,'' Ms. Fields said.
 A multitasker who is rarely without her Bluetooth earpiece, Ms. Fields makes $45,000 a year as a station agent for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Christopher receives $697 a month from Supplemental Security Income. While the family receives $334 in food stamps every month, rent is $660, cable and Internet service is $210, and Ms. Fields pays $308 a month to store her niece and nephew's beds and other possessions they could not part with. Mr. Smith, who is unemployed, does not contribute financially but helps out around the house, Ms. Fields said. 
 In lieu of gainful employment, Johnathon takes care of the brood in the afternoons and evenings, when Ms. Fields is at work. It is often there, in the booth, where her sorrows catch up with her: Her mother died four months after her sister, and she lost her brother, Samuel, in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. 
 ''In this family, we've had our share of tragedies,'' she said. ''I cry and sell the MetroCards at the same time. I wipe away tears. You've got to do what you've got to do.'' 
 Last January, a social worker from the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, approached Tichina at Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School, where the charity provides on-site services, and offered help in the wake of her mother's death. Ms. Fields received $500 in gift cards from Old Navy, Modell's and Pathmark, enabling her to buy clothes for the children and stock the refrigerator with food.
 ''Trust me, it came in handy,'' Ms. Fields said. ''When they handed me the gift cards, I burst out in tears. You don't think people care about your situation. But when life throws you lemons, you make lemonade. You move on.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Officer Revisits His Past in Vietnam

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: DA NANG, Vietnam 

 BODY:
Cmdr. H. B. Le, the first Vietnamese-American to command a United States Navy destroyer, had just stepped ashore on a formal port call, making an emotional return to Vietnam for the first time since he fled as a young boy on a fishing boat at the end of the war in 1975.
 A youthful and smiling man of 39, he bore on his shoulders the weight of the symbolism of cautiously warming military ties between Vietnam and the United States in the visit over the weekend. 
 But the symbolism became more nuanced when his welcoming ceremony was delayed by a dispute over a request to display the red Vietnamese flag with its gold star aboard the U.S.S. Blue Ridge, the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, which had just pulled into port.
 Two hours later the flag was finally raised high on the yardarm, seemingly in accord with the Vietnamese demand and contrary to American naval custom.
 The waiting generals began to smile again, the red carpet was rolled out and Commander Le was free to proceed with his return.
 ''Stepping ashore was awesome,'' he said after landing from his destroyer, the U.S.S. Lassen, which was anchored in Da Nang Harbor. ''To be able to return to Vietnam after 35 years and to be able to do it as commander of a United States naval warship was an incredible honor and a privilege.''
 He was returning to a very different Vietnam from the one he fled at the age of 5 with his parents and three of his siblings. Most people in this young nation, like Commander Le himself, have no memory of the war.
 In the last decade or more, Vietnam has opened its economy, increased trade with the United States and risen from postwar poverty even as the Communist government maintains control of the news media and political expression.
 The city of Da Nang today, with four new bridges, broad streets and an emerging high-rise skyline, is almost unrecognizable to those who were here during the war years.
 Despite the changes, the flag-raising dispute and the background of Commander Le's own story illustrated the complexities of a relationship that remains shadowed by the war, even as it moves tentatively forward.
 ''Gradual and steady,'' said Carlyle B. Thayer, an expert on the Vietnamese armed forces at the Australian Defense Force Academy, describing the evolving relationship. ''The Americans see a glacier moving, and they call it progress.''
 He said Vietnam had been slow to accept American overtures for closer military ties, hoping to balance Chinese influence in the region with an American presence, but stepping carefully to avoid offending Beijing.
 ''The two considerations that govern the Vietnamese are worries about China and deep suspicion of the United States,'' Mr. Thayer said. ''Suspicion is the underlying feature that puts a brake on progress.''
 The Vietnamese generals who greeted Commander Le -- whose full name is Hung Ba Le -- might have reason for mixed feelings.
 Commander Le's father, Thong Ba Le, who is now 68, was a commander in the wartime South Vietnamese Navy and for a time held a senior position here in Da Nang. In 1975 he fled the Communist military when his base came under attack by rocket and mortar fire. The family spent two days at sea before being rescued by a United States Navy vessel.
 While he was able to take his wife and his four younger children when he fled, he was unable to rescue four older children, who were trapped in Hue, Commander Le said. Two of these sons spent several years in Communist re-education camps, he said.
 Eight years later, the younger children were able to join the family in northern Virginia and the family became a model of the upward mobility achieved by some Vietnamese immigrants.
 A standout scholar and athlete in high school, Commander Le graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1992 and was commissioned as a Navy officer. He is married with two children.
 ''I'm a lucky guy,'' he said. ''My dad got me out of the country. He did what he had to do. He gave us opportunities to have a good life in the United States.''
 The dispute over the raising of the Vietnamese flag on the Blue Ridge was a small, but telling, glimpse into the relations between the two militaries. 
 According to United States Navy custom, the flag of the host nation is to be displayed only on the quarterdeck, beside the American flag, said a public affairs officer, Cmdr. Jeff Davis of the United States Seventh Fleet.
 The Vietnamese custom is to fly their flag high at a level equivalent to that of the visiting nation, he said.
 In previous port calls, the Navy has bent its traditions in honor of Vietnamese custom, Commander Davis said. But this time the Blue Ridge held to American custom.
 After two hours of difficult discussions, senior Vietnamese military and civilian officials began to walk off the pier. At just that moment, their flag inched its way upward and began to flutter side by side with the American flag.
 ''It's beautiful,'' a Vietnamese general said.
 The next morning, though, reporters noticed that the Vietnamese flag was flying six inches lower than the Stars and Stripes.

Well
 From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.
 A few days after two members of a family in Ames, Iowa, came down with the flu, they noticed their 13-year-old cat wasn't feeling too well either. And so began the first documented case of a cat with the new H1N1 virus, or swine flu. 
 The case has riveted pet owners and health officials. Companion animals have been known to contract flu from other species, but this appears to be the first time a cat has contracted influenza from a human. 
 Dr. Brett A. Sponseller, one of the veterinarians who treated the cat at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University, says there is no evidence that a cat could give a person the flu, and transmission is unlikely because cats with flu typically don't cough or sneeze.
 Dr. Sponseller says the cat is about 85 percent recovered. He was given fluids for dehydration and put on antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection. ''He's eating well, moving around well, and he's back in his window watching the squirrels outside,'' he said.
 TierneyLab
 From John Tierney's blog, nytimes.com/tierneylab.
 Chronic pain affects more than 70 million Americans, which makes it more widespread than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. It costs the economy more than $100 billion per year. 
 So why don't more doctors and researchers take it more seriously?
 That is the challenge raised by a new report from the Mayday Fund, a nonprofit group that studies pain treatment. The report, which been endorsed by an array of medical groups, advocates a revolution in the training of doctors, the financing of research and the education of law-enforcement officials. 
 ''The fact is that people aren't getting competent and cost-effective treatment for chronic pain,'' said Dr. Russell Portenoy, a co-chairman of the panel that prepared the report. 
 Dr. Portenoy said the current system had ''misaligned incentives'' -- encouraging procedures like injections and surgery, which can pay doctors 10 times as much per hour as doctors who treat pain in other ways. 
 Doctor and Patient
 From Dr. Pauline W. Chen's weekly column at nytimes.com/health.
 Nonadherence, or the failure to follow medical advice, is the most important cause of organ rejection in long-term transplant survivors. But teenagers are at particularly high risk. 
 For years, health care professionals in transplantation and other medical fields have struggled to address adolescent nonadherence, with little success. 
 This past month in the journal Pediatrics, researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York published the results of a one-year study showing that text messaging could significantly improve the rate of adherence among young liver transplant patients. 
 Using a program called CareSpeak, the researchers issued text messages to a group of 41 pediatric liver transplant patients that reminded them to take their medication.
 Those patients were more likely to take their medications than they had been before. Moreover, while 12 of the young people experienced rejection episodes in the previous year, only 2 did so during the study.

HEADLINE: A Hunt for Seeds to Save Species, Perhaps by Helping Them Move

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Pitcher's thistle, whose fuzzy leaves and creamy pink puffs once thrived in the sand dunes along several of the Great Lakes, was driven by development, drought and weevils into virtual extinction from the shores of Lake Michigan decades ago. 
 But in the 1990s, seeds collected from different parts of the thistle's range were grown at the Chicago Botanic Garden and planted with the help of the Morton Arboretum along the lake, in Illinois State Beach Park, north of Chicago near the Wisconsin state line. The plants from Indiana's dunes to the south are doing well; the plants that had come from the north are failing.
 With those mixed results in mind, scientists from the botanic garden are sending teams out across the Midwest and West to the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin to collect seeds from different populations of 1,500 prairie species by 2010, and from 3,000 species by 2020. The goal is to preserve the species and, depending on changes in climate, perhaps even help species that generally grow near one another to migrate to a new range. 
 ''In 50 to 100 years, because habitats or climates are so altered, we might end up trying to move species in a restoration context, in assemblages of species,'' said Pati Vitt, a conservation scientist and curator of the Dixon National Tallgrass Prairie Seed Bank at the botanic garden. 
 The garden is seeking permits to test the concept with the thistle, by pushing it into new, colder territory along the shores of Lake Ontario. ''It may be the best test case for moving an individual species outside its range,'' Dr. Vitt said. 
 But assisted migration, as it is called, is a hotly debated issue. On one side are those like the botanic garden scientists, who argue that the risks are better than doing nothing. 
 ''We recognize that climate change is likely to be very rapid and that seeds only disperse a few hundred yards, half a mile at most, naturally,'' said Kayri Havens, the botanic garden's director of plant science and conservation. ''They'll need our help if we want to keep those species alive.'' 
 Other scientists argue that tinkering with the complexity of habitats is courting disaster -- and huge expense.
 ''Even given our best science, we're not good at predicting which species will be invasive,'' said Jason S. McLachlan, a biologist at the University of Notre Dame who has studied postglacial population spread. ''And it's going to be especially complex as climates change.''
 The American beech, for example, was so rare during the ice age that it is rarely found in fossils. ''It may have been one of those rare and unusual species we think about saving with approaches like assisted migration,'' Dr. McLachlan said. Now, the beech is so abundant in Eastern forests, he said, it is shading out ''almost all other species.''
 Dr. McLachlan and other scientists have formed a working group on managed relocation, financed by the National Science Foundation and the Cedar Tree Foundation, to open up the discussion to citizens, economists, natural resource managers and policy makers. 
 While the debate proceeds, scientists at the botanic garden are building the seed collection and assessing the adaptability of different populations of species. Dr. Vitt and Dr. Havens recently showed off the new Rice Science Center, which has laboratories and a 420-square-foot seed vault with floor-to-ceiling stainless steel shelves. 
 When temperatures in the giant humidity-controlled freezer stabilized at minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit at the end of September, they moved collections of 800 Midwestern species -- some made up of 300,000 seeds -- from their old home in four large freezers, hardly different from the kind a large family might use to store home-grown produce and a side of beef. 
 ''The first time I walked in here, I started to cry,'' Dr. Vitt said. ''I know what having this will allow us to do in the future. It's the most important conservation work the garden can be doing.''
 The prairie effort is part of a Bureau of Land Management project called Seeds of Success, which intends to collect seeds of the entire flora of the United States, except for species already under protection and recalcitrant species, or those that cannot survive long-term storage. 
 That is 14,000 native plant species.
 Seeds of Success, started in 2001 in response to a Congressional mandate to plant native seed in restoring public lands destroyed by wildfire, began its far more ambitious initiative in June 2008. 
 A consortium of botanic gardens and other institutions have sent 65 teams across the country, which so far have collected groupings of 3,200 species. 
 ''We hope to collect 20 populations across the species' range so we can get 95 percent of the genetic diversity of the species,'' said Peggy Orwell, the plant conservation program manager at the bureau. ''Because frankly, we don't know what it is we're going to need when we're talking restoration in light of climate change. It's going to be one big experiment.'' 
 Seeds of Success sends one collection of every species to the Millennium Seed Bank Project, at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in Britain, which intends to collect 25 percent of the world's flora by 2020. Seeds are also stored at the National Center for Genetic Resource Preservation in Fort Collins, Colo., and the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station in Pullman, Wash.
 The Dixon seed bank at the Chicago Botanic Garden houses not only species from the tallgrass prairie, but also natives of the bogs, dunes and other ecosystems in the prairie region. It also includes the working collections of species singled out for restoration. 
 ''In the Midwest, we have about 200 that are going to be very important,'' Dr. Havens said. ''These are the matrix species, the bread-and-butter species that can be used in restorations after disturbance to really stabilize the community.'' 
 Climate models all show temperatures rising, but they do not agree on the prairie's future climate.
 ''Some models show us with more Virginia-like ecosystem, some say more like Texas,'' Dr. Havens said.
 In a paper to be published in the journal Biology Conservation and available now online, Dr. Vitt, Dr. Havens and three other scientists at the botanic garden outline a framework for assisted migration, calling first for a globally unified seed banking strategy, which involves collecting genetically diverse populations of each species, accompanied by provenance data like GPS coordinates, soil type and the structure of the surrounding plant community. 
 They also propose how to predict where species can be relocated. The scientists are just beginning to test their theories in seven climate change gardens planted this fall across the country. Each contains genetically identical clones of plants grown from seed collected in four hardiness zones (4, 5, 6 and 7). Three sites are in the Chicago area, with the others in Boston; Chapel Hill, N.C.; Seattle; and Washington. 
 Students and volunteers will collect data on the species, and can compare their gardens with others through a webcam system. ''If plants grown from seed collected in Zone 4, 5 or 6 can't withstand Texas conditions,'' Dr. Havens said, ''that's a good sign they're going to become extinct here, if there's no way for them to migrate on their own or human-assisted.'' 
 Collecting all the native species in the United States, as well as developing restoration techniques and growing huge amounts of seed will take about 10 years and cost about $500 million, Dr. Havens said -- a cost that she argues is well worth it.
 Dr.Vitt said: ''I won't be around in 100 years, but if the research isn't there, we won't know how to do it on that scale. That's why the seed bank is so important. 
 ''For now, we are trying to follow Aldo Leopold's maxim: 'The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to keep all the pieces.' ''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about an effort to collect seeds to save species, possibly by relocating them through a process known as assisted migration, misstated the surname of the plant conservation program manager at the Bureau of Land Management. She is Peggy Olwell, not Orwell.

HEADLINE: Google Set to Acquire AdMob for $750 Million

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In a push to expand its digital advertising empire to cellphones, Google has agreed to acquire AdMob, a fast-growing mobile advertising start-up, for $750 million in stock, the companies said Monday. 
 AdMob is one of the top sellers of banner ads on iPhone applications and Web pages that can be retrieved from mobile phones. The acquisition could help establish Google as an early leader in the small but rapidly expanding mobile phone advertising business.
 ''The deal shows that Google is serious about becoming a major player in the mobile advertising ecosystem,'' said Neil Strother, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''It puts Google in the front-runner position.'' 
 Mr. Strother and other analysts said that position could prove tenuous. The mobile advertising business, which has long been hailed as the next big thing, remains embryonic. Sales of mobile ads were just $160 million last year, according to the Kelsey Group, a market researcher, and the vast majority of it went to ads delivered by text message. By comparison, marketers spent more than $23 billion in online ads in 2008, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau. 
 The growing popularity of the iPhone and other powerful mobile devices ensures that mobile ads will become more ubiquitous, but predictions for the growth of the business vary widely. ''We see mobile as a huge growth opportunity for us,'' Susan Wojcicki, vice president for product management at Google, said in an interview. ''We see an opportunity working with AdMob to really accelerate our efforts in an important industry for Google.'' 
 Google is already ahead of its rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo, in one segment of the mobile advertising business: ads linked to search queries. The acquisition of AdMob, whose ad clients include Procter & Gamble, Adidas and Land Rover, will help it expand into display ads. 
 The all-stock deal is modest for Google, given its roughly $177 billion market value. But it is the company's third-largest acquisition, behind the $3.1 billion deal last year for the advertising specialist DoubleClick and the $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube in 2006. 
 As Google's core business of selling text ads has been slowing, the company has been looking for businesses that could bring new growth. It has focused in two areas in particular: display advertising, a business where it has lagged behind rivals like Yahoo, and mobile advertising. 
 Google's ambitious push into cellphones includes mobile applications like search and maps as well as the Android software for smartphones. AdMob also sells banners that appear inside apps made for smartphones running on Android, and the acquisition could help Google profit from that growing market.
 AdMob was founded by Omar Hamoui in 2006 while he was still a graduate student at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The company is one of a few mobile advertising start-ups that analysts say have outsmarted the giants of Web advertising and established themselves as leaders in the emerging business. Analysts said that the others, which include JumpTap, Millennial Media and Quattro Wireless, are likely to draw the interest of Google rivals like Microsoft and Yahoo.
 ''I suspect the market is ripe for consolidation,'' said Noah Elkin, an analyst with eMarketer. 
 AdMob has received $47 million in financing from Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and other investors and has about 140 employees. In an interview, Mr. Hamoui, who is chief executive, declined to disclose AdMob's revenue but said that sales had more than doubled in the last year. Google said it hoped to close the acquisition in the next several months. The deal is likely to be reviewed by regulators, but Ms. Wojcicki said she expected it would be approved. 
 ''We think that mobile advertising is a very competitive area, and we don't see a lot of regulatory concerns,'' she said. Critics of Google's rapid expansion, however, said they hoped the deal would face a thorough review. 
 ''We've reached a point in Google's evolution in which Washington agencies and Congressional committees need to look more closely at the company's dominance of Internet services,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who had opposed Google's acquisition of DoubleClick.

HEADLINE: Signs of Austerity on Arrival as General Managers Meet

BYLINE: By DAVID WALDSTEIN

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Baseball's general managers and their staffs arrived throughout the day at the Hilton hotel in O'Hare International Airport on Monday, most of them walking through subway-style tunnels from the main terminals and up into the lobby. There, the view across the street was not of some lavish Pacific seascape, but of the two main concrete parking lots that serve the airport.
 A year ago, these same meetings were held at the luxurious St. Regis Hotel in Dana Point, Calif., where the grand view beyond the marble swimming pool and palm trees was the dark blue Pacific Ocean. At the time, some noted the contrast of a sport spending lavishly to host its executives while the national economy was in the throes of a dire crisis. 
 So baseball scaled back this year, assembling 30 general managers and numerous player agents to these more moderate accommodations, perhaps another indication that teams will continue to show financial restraint regarding player salaries this off-season. 
 ''It's a different world,'' Chicago White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams said. ''Just from my own observations, I don't think we're out of the woods yet with sports getting slapped in the face by reality. That's just my own personal opinion. It's not just fun and games anymore. It's got to be a business. It's got to be run as it's supposed to be, as a business.''
 For many of the general managers, the relatively sparse setting of an airport hotel was an appropriate gathering place for a sport that continues to stress the need to reverse payroll excesses of the past, a process that began last year for many teams. 
 ''They want to send a message that they don't have any money,'' said one agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to impair future relationships.
 Next month, the larger and more active winter meetings will be held in Indianapolis, a city not known as a resort destination. But for many, the site of the meetings is virtually irrelevant. They may as well be tucked inside a missile silo, given how little the participants tend to get around during their two and a half days here.
 ''I never leave my room no matter where it is, anyway, so it doesn't really matter to me,'' Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said. ''It's room to room. Have you ever seen me leave these places with tans? Have you ever seen me with golf clubs?''
 Fresh off the Yankees' 27th World Series title, Cashman had far less time to prepare for these meetings than he did last year, when the Yankees did not make the playoffs and he vigorously pursued free agents like C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira. 
 Cashman said the Yankees had not even had time to convene organizational meetings to set the off-season agenda, so the meetings will be used primarily to gather information on potential trades with other teams. The organizational meetings come soon afterward.
 ''I've had phone conversations, but this will be the first year I've approached these meetings, because they've come so fast, without having the ability to strategize, game plan and anticipate,'' he said. ''We'll see what we can do, but I have a feeling that we'll be a little more cautious than anxious.''
 The highest-profile player expected to be shopped -- again -- is the Toronto right-hander Roy Halladay, who was on the market over the summer but was never moved. As for free agents, teams cannot discuss financial terms with them until Nov. 20, but they can express their level of interest in a player and the length of a potential deal. But the players available through free agency are not considered a powerful group. Outfielders Matt Holliday and Jason Bay and the right-hander John Lackey are expected to earn significant contracts, but the remainder of the free-agent class may find smaller offers than in years past. 
 Mets General Manager Omar Minaya stood in the lobby as curious guests wandered by. He told reporters that his goal was to add strength to both his rotation and the lineup.
 ''We have to find a way to slug more,'' he said, ''and I think the starting pitching we have to address.''
 An hour earlier, Houston Astros General Manager Ed Wade stood in another part of the modest lobby and spoke with a reporter as several airline flight crews ambled past headed for their rooms. For Wade, an airport hotel in the Midwest was perhaps the best location for these meetings.
 ''I think it makes a lot of sense,'' he said as a plane took off behind him. ''It's centrally located, and the focus can be on baseball and work. From the standpoint of what we need to do, and the real-world economy, it's the perfect place.''
 INSIDE PITCH
 Boston declined the $5 million team option on catcher Jason Varitek's contract, but he still has a $3 million player option. The Red Sox did pick up the $7.1 million option for catcher/first baseman Victor Martinez and signed the veteran knuckleballer Tim Wakefield to a two-year, $5 million deal. ... The Rays picked up the $10 million option for left fielder Carl Crawford, Tampa Bay's longest-serving player. ... Hideki Matsui is expected to file for free agency by Tuesday. Brian Cashman said he did not see Matsui as an outfielder for the Yankees, and indicated that Matsui's World Series performance had not changed their thinking.

HEADLINE: The Non-Travel Business

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
''If you can't beat 'em, join 'em,'' may be the best maxim to explain why travel companies are getting into the virtual meeting business, actually helping clients avoid flying halfway around the globe.
 Two of the world's biggest hotel companies, Starwood Hotels and Resorts and Marriott International, are outfitting some of their meeting rooms with telepresence suites, a high-end system that leapfrogs typical videoconferencing technology. Their goal is to rent the rooms to customers who are already embracing virtual alternatives to travel, but do not have telepresence suites everywhere they would like to use them. 
 ''Major multinational companies have this technology in their corporate headquarters,'' said David Townshend, Marriott's senior vice president for sales. ''But it's expensive, so they've looked to Marriott and some other providers to really extend their footprint into regional locations.''
 Telepresence technology has been around for several years, but analysts say the business model for public rooms, which rent for about $500 an hour, is converging with tight travel budgets to create a more compelling reason for companies to give it a try. The technology itself has also improved, eliminating the delays that can make the typical videoconferencing experience awkward.
 The telepresence suites are intended to make participants feel as if they are meeting face-to-face: when you walk into the room, there is half a conference table facing high-definition screens that project life-size images of people sitting in similar suites elsewhere in the world.
 To enhance the feeling of being in the same room, the other half of the table appears on screen, participants' eyes are at the same level and the walls are even painted the same color. 
 ''With telepresence, you really feel like you can look people in the eye and get a real sense of what they're about,'' said Richard Redelfs, a general partner with Foundation Capital, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has rented suites at a nearby Cisco Systems office to meet virtually with entrepreneurs in India.
 ''I'm a people person and that's the nature of the venture business, so I was a little skeptical about the experience,'' Mr. Redelfs said. ''But it's amazing. There's no latency in the system -- when you say something you get an immediate response. Psychologically, you really start behaving like you're face to face.''
 Although the company does not use telepresence often enough to buy its own suite, which can cost $200,000 plus charges for network services and support, renting one has turned out to be an efficient and economical way for all nine partners to size up the founders of far-flung start-ups before deciding on an investment. (A few partners still make the trip to meet in person before anyone writes a check.)
 That is precisely the type of business Starwood and Marriott are hoping to capture, along with revenue from customers who travel to metropolitan markets to use the telepresence suites for recruiting interviews, legal depositions and other small meetings.
 ''There's an opportunity for us not just to host a meeting but also to host room nights for people traveling to those hubs,'' said Mary Casey, a vice president at Starwood, which plans to have at least two telepresence suites open by the end of the year, with more following in 2010.
 Starwood locations in development include hotels in New York, Sydney, Toronto, Los Angeles and Chicago, while Marriott plans to open its first telepresence suite at the New York Marriott East Side in December, followed by hotels in San Francisco and Bethesda, Md. 
 Both hotel companies are working with Cisco, a leader in telepresence technology, with about 3,100 of its suites installed by customers worldwide. 
 There are other providers as well, among them Polycom, Teliris, Hewlett-Packard and Tandberg (which Cisco is seeking to acquire). And one of the challenges has been to link the technology of those various systems and getting network providers to talk to each other. Cisco, for instance, works with Tata Communications at Starwood's properties and the Taj Boston hotel and has worked with AT&T at the Marriott hotels. ''You've got to make it possible for all these various networks to hook up to each other,'' said Scott Morrison, a vice president with the technology research company Gartner. ''That will help grow the demand for these rooms.'' 
 The telepresence providers are also seeking to expand the number of suites by introducing more that can be rented by the public.
 ''The value goes up every time somebody else gets connected,'' said David Hsieh, a marketing vice president with Cisco, which hopes to have 50 public suites open by early next year. 
 In fact, some companies that have telepresence technology are incorporating it into their travel booking systems, Mr. Morrison said, so employees consider it as a choice in lieu of taking a trip.
 Seizing on that trend, travel companies like American Express and Carlson Wagonlit Travel plan to help clients weigh whether to use a telepresence suite and then to reserve a room. The move is meant to expand, not chip away at, their core travel booking business.
 ''Travel is about connecting people with each other, and traditionally that means putting people on planes, on trains and in automobiles, but the recession has changed that environment considerably,'' said Alicia Tillman, a vice president with American Express.
 ''Offering telepresence as a different option to still connect people with each other is a method that we fully expect our client companies are going to adopt and embrace.''

HEADLINE: As Confident Investors Race to Stocks, the Dollar Weakens Further

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
If the economy is getting stronger, why is the dollar getting weaker? 
 As the stock market surged anew on Monday and into Tuesday, and the price of gold marched ever higher, the dollar took its biggest tumble since July. The American currency sank roughly 1 percent against other major currencies, to its lowest level since the financial crisis broke out more than a year ago. 
 But the seeming disconnect between the value of the dollar and the value of stocks is, in fact, not much of a disconnect at all. A growing belief that wealthy nations like the United States will forge ahead with efforts to revive economic growth is luring risk-shy investors back into the world's stock markets. But with interest rates down and government spending up, the dollar is swooning. Many market participants assert that the currency is weakening with tacit approval from Washington policy makers. 
 While the faltering dollar will make everything from French wine to Korean televisions more expensive for American consumers, it will also make American exports more competitive overseas -- a lift for multinational corporations like Caterpillar, Intel and Pepsi. 
 Indeed, shares of multinationals paced a stock market rally on Monday that left some analysts wondering if a new bull market was building. The Dow leapt 203.52 points, or 2 percent, to 10,226.94, its highest level since October 2008. The broader Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.78 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,093.08. The Nasdaq composite index was up 41.62 points or 1.97 percent, at 2,154.06. And Asian markets opened strong Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei index rising 1.3 percent.
 If the stock market seems volatile lately, that is because it is. Since early September, the Dow has surged or plunged more than 1 percent during 18 separate trading sessions. 
 But while stocks seem to have regained their footing -- the Dow industrials are now up 16.5 percent for the year -- the dollar, once quite literally the gold standard of world currencies, is in retreat. The dollar has lost 16 percent of its value since March. It was hovering around $1.50 against the euro Monday.
 In the ''bad news is good news'' paradigm of Wall Street, the dollar's fall against nearly all the major currencies reflects the growing belief that major governments will keep interest rates low into 2010 and increase spending to revive growth. A weekend communique from the finance ministers of the Group of 20 wealthiest nations offered little support for the dollar: the G20 affirmed its support for keeping stimulus efforts in place but was silent on the dollar's prospects. 
 Some investors read the statement as a sign that governments would let the dollar weaken more, without intervening in the currency markets.
 ''It was a deafening silence, another excuse to investors to keep selling the dollar,'' said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist for Forex.com. ''A lot of it is sentiment-driven, and there the dollar is getting a vote of no confidence.''
 A currency is usually regarded as a barometer of a country's economic conditions. The stronger the currency, the thinking goes, the stronger the economy, and vice versa. But while a precipitous decline in the dollar might wreak havoc in the American economy and the markets, a moderate decline does not seem to be a big worry for Washington. Indeed, many economists contend that a devalued dollar helped the United States recover from the Great Depression.
 As the dollar has fallen recently, the price of gold, which has been on a tear in recent weeks, surged to yet another record. The metal reached $1,103.65 an ounce in late afternoon trading. Its price has fluttered at record highs lately amid a frenzy for it by hedge funds and wealthy speculators. Other commodities also rose, with the price of oil flirting with $80 a barrel. 
 Rock-bottom interest rates in the United States have cemented the dollar's reputation as a low-yield investment. Last week, in assessing the overall health of the economy, the Federal Reserve gave no indication that it planned to raise interest rates in the near future, stirring concern over inflation and prompting investors to reroute their funds toward gold, oil and the stocks. 
 ''When you have zero percent inflation, zero percent interest rates, zero percent money markets rates, and when you have metals and gold that have skyrocketed to astronomical levels, stocks look pretty good in comparison,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla.
 But for some investors, a swelling budget deficit and low interest rates are a recipe for future inflation, which would erode the dollar's value further. 
 In the midst of the crisis last year, investors the world over flocked to havens like United States Treasury notes. But now, with confidence growing about the global economy, many are shifting funds back into stocks, including many emerging markets. Brazil's stock market, for instance, has jumped more than 11 percent in the last five days. 
 ''If the world continues to heal, and investor confidence continues to rise, you will continue to see money leaving the safe, liquid arms of the U.S. Treasury and going back overseas in search of better returns and higher yields,'' said Rebecca Patterson, global head of foreign exchange and commodities at JPMorgan's private bank.
 Policy makers, meanwhile, may face pressure to intervene if the dollar plunges too rapidly. But in the short term, they may see political and economic benefits in a slow but steady depreciation of the currency: a falling dollar could push up exports and send customers at home flocking to American brands.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32 to 101 4/32. The yield fell to 3.49 percent, from 3.50 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and three-year notes:

HEADLINE: Foe of Gay Marriage Says It's Nothing Personal

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Every Sunday morning, the deep, melodious voice of State Senator Ruben Diaz Sr. rumbles across the congregation at his Bronx church. On weekdays, it echoes across the Senate chamber as he rails against Medicaid cuts or abortion. Earlier this year, it enthralled thousands at a boisterous rally against same-sex marriage.
 But ask him about the gay people in his own life, and Mr. Diaz's voice grows quiet. His smile vanishes.
 Two of his brothers are gay, he murmurs, one of them recently deceased. So is a granddaughter. There is an old friend who works for him in the Senate. And a former campaign aide. 
 ''I love them. I love them,'' says Mr. Diaz, who grew up one of 17 children in Puerto Rico. ''But I don't believe in what they are doing. They are my brothers. They are my family.'' 
 His voice rises again. ''So how could I be a homophobe?''
 For those fighting to expand gay rights, Mr. Diaz, a Pentecostal minister, represents the most outspoken and unpredictable of foes. He was forced to resign from the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board years ago for suggesting that the Gay Games would encourage homosexuality and spread H.I.V. In 2003, he sued the city to shut down a high school for gay and transgender students.
 As advocates push for a vote on same-sex marriage in the State Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Diaz is again speaking out, arguing that last week's election results show that the tide has turned against allowing gay people to wed. 
 And, given the Democrats' fragile majority -- the party has 32 senators to the Republicans' 30 -- Mr. Diaz's stubbornness often yields results. 
 ''The people of the nation don't want gay marriage,'' Mr. Diaz said in an interview Monday. ''They didn't want it in California; they didn't want it in Maine. And the people of upstate New York, after what happened to the candidate in the 23rd Congressional District, they sent a message they don't want gay marriage. Forget about it. People don't want it.''
 Mr. Diaz argued that the bill legalizing same-sex marriage should not be allowed to come to the floor, saying the Legislature has more important issues to attend to. 
 And some of his colleagues on Monday, while avoiding his provocative language, appeared to be moving to that position, worried that the political climate is too tense and the state's fiscal crisis too urgent for the issue to be taken up now. On Monday evening, it was not clear whether the Senate would consider the measure.
 The fight over same-sex marriage has thrust Mr. Diaz, 66, back into a familiar role -- dissenting from and exasperating Democratic Senate leaders and some of his colleagues.
 Earlier this year, he and three other Democrats initially refused to back Malcolm A. Smith, the Senate's top Democrat, for majority leader, throwing the Democratic caucus into chaos until Mr. Smith offered them perks and committee chairmanships. 
 Mr. Diaz is also the Senate's most outspoken opponent of abortion, and he once likened the harvesting of stem cells for research to Hitler using ''the ashes of the Jews to make bars of soap.''
 ''He always comes into conference or onto the floor with his mind made up, ready to argue,'' said Senator Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat who represents Manhattan and the Bronx. ''And he loves to argue.''
 But to Mr. Diaz and his friends, the senator's steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage seems at times incongruous. 
 Christopher R. Lynn, Mr. Diaz's chief counsel, who is gay and lives with his partner in Queens, said that he has undergone three back operations, and that every time he goes into the hospital, Mr. Diaz has been there.
 ''He is a true believer in Christian values, in treating people the way you want to be treated,'' Mr. Lynn said.
 Mr. Diaz describes Mr. Lynn as ''my brother.'' They often double-date with their respective better halves. Mr. Lynn has not been able to move Mr. Diaz on the issue of marriage.
 ''He said to me, 'For me to accept this, I have to turn my whole value system upside down,' '' Mr. Lynn said.
 Mr. Diaz, whose South Bronx district is the second-poorest in New York, also raises his voice loudly on behalf of the poor, leaving some liberals in the Capitol reluctant to criticize him for his social views because he has been a reliable ally on economic issues.
 ''I see people looking at me, like, 'Look at this guy,' ''Mr. Diaz said, rolling his eyes. ''And in the end, I get what want.''
 In many ways, Mr. Diaz seems conflicted. He relishes the role of the lonely dissident, sometimes practically taunting Democratic leaders to throw him out of the party. Still, the senator resents those who brand him a bigot for his views, and seems to plead for understanding.
 ''My religion doesn't allow me to dance,'' he said. ''But that does not mean I don't go to the party. My religion doesn't allow me to drink. But that doesn't mean I can't hang around with my friends. My religion is against gay marriage. It means, I don't agree with what you do. But let's go out. Let's go to the movies. Let's be friends.''
 Mr. Diaz grew up in Puerto Rico. His father, a carpenter, had five children with his mother; Mr. Diaz also had 11 half-brothers and sisters. He joined the Army out of high school, in 1960, and served in Fort Jackson, S.C.
 He moved to New York in 1965 and fell into drugs. Arrested for possession of heroin and marijuana, he got probation. Not long after, he found God. He became a pastor, a community leader, a city councilman, a senator. 
 Affection seems to flow to him from unexpected places. On a tour of his district, Mr. Diaz eagerly showed a reporter Christian Community in Action, an agency he founded in the burnt-out ruins of the Bronx to provide home health aides to the sick and elderly. There, Mr. Diaz greeted Vincent Ortiz, a supervisor he has known for 18 years. 
 ''We fight, of course,'' said Mr. Ortiz, who is gay. ''But it is mostly good years.'' 
 But then there are moments of coldness. Last year, Lisa Winters, who runs the Bronx Pride Community Center, a group for gay youth, requested a meeting with the senator. He never responded. She showed up anyway, with a group of gay teenagers, and was told that Mr. Diaz was not in. Moments later, she said, they saw Mr. Diaz leaving his office by a side door. 
 (The senator said he does not recall this happening. ''I never hide from anyone,'' he said.)
 This spring, Mr. Diaz led a small delegation of legislators to Puerto Rico, and at the end of the trip, he hosted a barbeque at his family's home. 
 His brother -- whom Mr. Diaz will not name because, he says, the brother is not openly gay -- was there to greet the guests. There was no discussion, Mr. Diaz said, about how he would vote on gay marriage.
 ''We don't need to talk about that anymore,'' Mr. Diaz said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officer Revisits His Past in Vietnam

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: DA NANG, Vietnam 

 BODY:
Cmdr. H. B. Le, the first Vietnamese-American to command a United States Navy destroyer, had just stepped ashore on a formal port call, making an emotional return to Vietnam for the first time since he fled as a young boy on a fishing boat at the end of the war in 1975.
 A youthful and smiling man of 39, he bore on his shoulders the weight of the symbolism of cautiously warming military ties between Vietnam and the United States in the visit over the weekend.
 But the symbolism became more nuanced when his welcoming ceremony was delayed by a dispute over a request to display the red Vietnamese flag with its gold star aboard the U.S.S. Blue Ridge, the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, which had just pulled into port. 
 Two hours later, this past Saturday, the flag was finally raised high on the yardarm, seemingly in accord with the Vietnamese demand and contrary to American naval custom.
 The waiting generals began to smile again, the red carpet was rolled out and Commander Le was free to proceed with his return.
 ''Stepping ashore was awesome,'' he said after landing from his destroyer, the U.S.S. Lassen, which was anchored in Da Nang Harbor. ''To be able to return to Vietnam after 35 years and to be able to do it as commander of a United States naval warship was an incredible honor and a privilege.''
 He was returning to a very different Vietnam from the one he fled at the age of 5 with his parents and three of his siblings. Most people in this young nation, like Commander Le himself, have no memory of the war.
 In the last decade or more, Vietnam has opened its economy, increased trade with the United States and risen from postwar poverty even as the Communist government maintains control of the news media and political expression.
 The city of Da Nang today, with four new bridges, broad streets and an emerging high-rise skyline, is almost unrecognizable to those who were here during the war years.
 Despite the changes, the flag-raising dispute and the background of Commander Le's own story illustrated the complexities of a relationship that remains shadowed by the war, even as it moves tentatively forward.
 ''Gradual and steady,'' said Carlyle B. Thayer, an expert on the Vietnamese armed forces at the Australian Defense Force Academy, describing the evolving relationship. ''The Americans see a glacier moving, and they call it progress.''
 He said Vietnam had been slow to accept American overtures for closer military ties, hoping to balance Chinese influence in the region with an American presence, but stepping carefully to avoid offending Beijing.
 ''The two considerations that govern the Vietnamese are worries about China and deep suspicion of the United States,'' said Mr. Thayer, a specialist on Vietnam at the Australian Defense Force Academy in Canberra, Australia. ''Suspicion is the underlying feature that puts a brake on progress.''
 The Vietnamese generals who greeted Commander Le -- whose full name is Hung Ba Le -- might have reason for mixed feelings.
 Commander Le's father, Thong Ba Le, who is now 68, was a commander in the wartime South Vietnamese Navy and for a time held a senior position here in Da Nang. In 1975 he fled the Communist military when his base came under attack by rocket and mortar fire. The family spent two days at sea before being rescued by a United States Navy vessel.
 While he was able to take his wife and his four younger children when he fled, he was unable to rescue four older children, who were trapped in Hue, Commander Le said. Two of these sons spent several years in Communist re-education camps, he said.
 Eight years later, the younger children were able to join the family in northern Virginia and the family became a model of the upward mobility achieved by some Vietnamese immigrants.
 A standout scholar and athlete in high school, Commander Le graduated from the United States Naval Academy with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1992 and was commissioned as a Navy officer. He is married with two children.
 ''I'm a lucky guy,'' he said. ''My dad got me out of the country. He did what he had to do. He gave us opportunities to have a good life in the United States.''Aboard the Vietnamese tug that brought Commander Le ashore was a man with quite a different set of memories: Chief Engineer Nguyen Van Ne, 50, said that as a child he had been terrified of American soldiers.
 ''They burned down my parents' house,'' he said. ''They burned it down because they thought we were Communists.'' But he said that those memories were in the past now, and that he would like to visit the United States ''just to go and have a look.'' He said that in the United States, people ''get a good education and they get ahead, like Commander Le.'' 
 Commander Le learned only a little of the Vietnamese language and very little about his father's past or his family's history.
 And so his visit on Sunday to his home city of Hue, 50 miles north of Da Nang, meeting the aunts and uncles who are his only relatives in Vietnam, was a voyage of discovery of his roots.
 ''Something I recently learned was that my dad was not the first Vietnamese naval officer,'' he said. ''Back in imperial times, my great-great-great-great -- four or five greats -- grandfather served with the emperor. He was like an admiral.''
 Commander Le prayed at the family's ancestral shrines, visited their graves and learned of what he said were his family's royal connections in the old imperial capital.
 ''I had noodle soup by the Perfume River, sitting on little plastic stools,'' he said. ''I definitely felt like a Vietnamese, just enjoying that food and the company of my family.''
 Although he hardly mentioned the war to his children, Commander Le's father has written accounts of his escape, bitter at what he calls the abandonment and failure of ideals of the withdrawing American military.
 He has refused to return to Communist Vietnam, saying he fears for his safety, although it is unlikely that he would face difficulties. Though he is proud to be an American, he said in a telephone interview, he still honors the red and yellow flag of the former South Vietnam as a symbol of freedom and democracy. The dispute over the raising of the Vietnamese flag on the Blue Ridge was a small, but telling glimpse into the relations between the two militaries. 
 According to United States Navy custom, the flag of the host nation is to be displayed only on the quarterdeck, beside the American flag, said a public affairs officer, Cmdr. Jeff Davis of the United States 7th Fleet.
 The Vietnamese custom is to fly their flag high at a level equivalent to that of the visiting nation, he said.
 In previous port calls, the Navy has bent its traditions in honor of Vietnamese custom, Commander Davis said. But this time the Blue Ridge held firmly to American custom.
 After two hours of difficult discussions, the senior Vietnamese military and civilian officials began to walk off the pier, abandoning the welcoming ceremony. At just that moment, their flag inched its way upward and began to flutter side by side with the American flag.
 ''It's beautiful,'' a Vietnamese general said, looking up.
 ''Each country has its own customs.''
 The next morning, though, reporters noticed that the Vietnamese flag was flying six inches lower than the Stars and Stripes.

HEADLINE: Paterson Presses Cuts, Saying New York Is 'on the Brink' in Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson took the rare step on Monday of addressing a joint session of the Legislature during its traditional off-season and used the speech to underscore New York's deepening financial crisis. 
 Mr. Paterson repeatedly used stark language to describe the gravity of the state's economic health as he prodded lawmakers to make cuts he has proposed to programs long considered sacrosanct. ''I will mortgage my political career on this plan,'' Mr. Paterson told lawmakers as he warned that New York was rapidly running out of cash to meet its obligations. 
 ''We stand on the brink of a financial challenge of unprecedented magnitude in the history of this state,'' he added. ''This is a historic moment. We're going to have to make historic decisions.'' 
 The state's budget crisis and the negotiations between the governor and lawmakers over how to confront it have raised a fundamental question: Can New York, which is more generous in its social welfare programs than any other state, afford to continue to finance its expansive health care safety net and generous education spending? 
 New York spends $2,283 per capita on Medicaid, far more than any other state and twice the national average, according to statistics compiled by the state budget division. Second is Rhode Island, which spends $1,659. The state also spends $14,884 per pupil on school aid, more than any other state and well above the national average of $9,138. 
 Mr. Paterson's speech came a day before lawmakers will reconvene for an extraordinary session called by the governor to take up his proposed budget cuts and potentially other issues, including legislation to legalize same-sex unions and overhaul the state's public authorities.
 A growing number of budget experts believe that New York can no longer afford to spend so much in the wake of the economic crisis, rising unemployment, the collapse of the stock market and the travails on Wall Street -- the state's main fiscal engine. While the state faces a deficit of more than $3 billion for the remaining four and a half months of this fiscal year, the greater worries among state officials are the unprecedented deficits the state faces in 2011 and 2012, after the expiration of federal stimulus financing and a temporary tax increase on the wealthy. 
 ''We're going to fall off a cliff unless we get our revenues and our expenditures in true sync,'' said Lt. Gov. Richard Ravitch, the administration's point man in budget negotiations with the Legislature. 
 He said that the state could no longer rely on its usual strategy of turning to an array of short-term solutions or ask more of the state's taxpayers, adding, ''We're at the outer limits of the elasticity of our tax system.''
 The governor's budget director, Robert L. Megna, met with top legislative staff members Monday to discuss the state's long-term prospects, and after listening to an hour of gloomy projections and data, he was not encouraged. 
 ''I didn't think it was possible,'' he said, ''but I'm more depressed than when I walked in.''
 Education and health care advocates have angrily opposed proposed cuts to Medicaid and school financing, the two largest parts of the state's budget, and the powerful labor unions that dominate debate in the capital are determined to fight them. They have a ready ally in Senate Democrats, who have balked at the governor's proposed cuts, making the prospect of any deals to address the state's long-term problems uncertain. 
 ''Our goal all along has been to close the gap without burdening New York State residents with additional taxes or service cuts, and to turn back midyear reductions to education and health care services,'' the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Carl Kruger, said in a statement Monday morning. He added in an interview Monday that cutting education ''is never the answer.''
 The Senate's plan relies on so-called one-shots that would do little to change the state's underlying financial situation. While the governor's spending plan includes significant midyear cuts in school aid along with Medicaid cuts, the Senate plan relies far more heavily on raiding funds from public authorities and would increase New York's debt burden by restructuring the state's tobacco bonds. 
 The Senate is also proposing to expand the hours that gambling is allowed in the state.
 ''If that's all they do tomorrow, it would be terribly irresponsible,'' said Elizabeth Lynam, deputy research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit organization. ''It's 75 percent one-shots.''
 Education advocates on Monday did not rule out waging another court battle against the state if cuts are made to education. 
 ''We're taking a look at things, we're thinking about what the ramifications of all these things are,'' said Geri Palast, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, an educational advocacy group that in 2006 settled a long-running lawsuit with the state over the distribution of school aid, particularly in New York City. 
 Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, another advocacy group, said ''school aid has to be off limits because of the constitutional obligations that are going unmet.''
 But a number of prominent Democratic politicians with liberal records said that cuts to education and health care were inevitable.
 ''To do nothing is not a solution,'' said Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Long Island Democrat and former assemblyman. ''The only way to try to get ahead of it, which we haven't done for many months now, is to deal with the cuts. Everything has to be on the table.''
 The comptroller's office numbers are more pessimistic than those from Mr. Paterson's budget office. They project that the deficit for the remainder of the current fiscal year stands at $4.1 billion, with deficits of $7.8 billion and $15.7 billion in the succeeding years.
 Mr. Ravitch, who helped steer New York City through its financial crisis in the 1970s, said, ''The numbers are real and my own personal view is that they're going to get worse.''

HEADLINE: A Word, Mr. President

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
If I were a close adviser of President Obama's, I would say to him, ''Mr. President, you have two urgent and overwhelming tasks in front of you: to put Americans trapped in this terrible employment crisis back to work and to put the brakes on your potentially disastrous plan to escalate the war in Afghanistan.''
 Reforming the chaotic and unfair health care system in the U.S. is an important issue. But in terms of pressing national priorities, the most important are the need to find solutions to a catastrophic employment environment that is devastating American families and to end the folly of an 8-year-old war that is both extremely debilitating and ultimately unwinnable. 
 We have spent the better part of a year locked in a tedious and unenlightening debate over health care while the jobless rate has steadily surged. It's now at 10.2 percent. Families struggling with job losses, home foreclosures and personal bankruptcies are falling out of the middle class like fruit through the bottom of a rotten basket. The jobless rate for men 16 years old and over is 11.4 percent. For blacks, it's a back-breaking 15.7 percent.
 We need to readjust our focus. We're worried about Kabul when Detroit has gone down for the count.
 I would tell the president that more and more Americans are questioning his priorities, including millions who went to the mat for him in last year's election. The biggest issue by far for most Americans is employment. The lack of jobs is fueling the nervousness, anxiety and full-blown anger that are becoming increasingly evident in the public at large. 
 Last Friday, a huge crowd of fans marched in a ticker-tape parade in downtown Manhattan to celebrate the Yankees' World Series championship. More than once, as the fans passed through the financial district, the crowd erupted in rhythmic, echoing chants of ''Wall Street sucks! Wall Street sucks!''
 I would tell the president that the feeling is widespread that his administration went too far with its bailouts of the financial industry, sending not just a badly needed lifeline but also unwarranted windfalls to the miscreants who nearly wrecked the entire economy. The government got very little in return. The perception now is that Wall Street is doing just fine while working people, whose taxes financed the bailouts, are walking the plank to economic oblivion.
 I would also tell him that rebuilding the economy in a way that allows working Americans to flourish will require a sustained monumental effort, not just bits and pieces of legislation here and there. But such an effort will never get off the ground, will never have any chance of reaching critical mass and actually succeeding, as long as we insist on feeding young, healthy American men and women and endless American dollars into the relentless meat grinders of Afghanistan and Iraq.
 We learned in the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson's Great Society was trumped by Vietnam, that nation-building here at home is incompatible with the demands of war. We've managed to keep the worst of the carnage -- and the staggering costs -- of Iraq and Afghanistan well out of the sight of most Americans, so the full extent of the terrible price we are paying is not widely understood.
 The ultimate financial costs will be counted in the trillions. If you were to take a walk around one of the many military medical centers, like Landstuhl in Germany or Walter Reed in Washington, your heart would break at the sight of the heroic young men and women who have lost limbs (frequently more than one) or who are blind or paralyzed or horribly burned. Hundreds of thousands have suffered psychological wounds. Many have contemplated or tried suicide, and far too many have succeeded.
 ''Mr. President,'' I would say, ''we'll never be right as a nation as long as we allow this to continue.''
 The possibility of more troops for the war in Afghanistan was discussed Sunday on ''Meet the Press.'' Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania noted candidly that ''our troops are tired and worn out.'' More than 85 percent of the men and women in the Pennsylvania National Guard have already served in Iraq or Afghanistan. ''Many of them have gone three or four times and they're wasted,'' said Mr. Rendell.
 More troops? ''Where are we going to find these troops?'' the governor asked. ''That's what I want somebody to tell me.''
 While we're preparing to pour more resources into Afghanistan, the Economic Policy Institute is telling us that one in five American children is living in poverty, that nearly 35 percent of African-American children are living in poverty, and that the unemployment crisis is pushing us toward a point in the coming years where more than half of all black children in this country will be poor.
 ''Mr. President,'' I would say, ''we need your help.''

HEADLINE: Still Chic, as Time Goes By

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Angela Ahrendts, in her three years as chief executive, has reshaped Burberry, pushing it closer to upscale rivals like LVMH and Hermes.
 Now Ms. Ahrendts, the 49-year-old American sitting atop one of the world's quintessentially British brands, hopes to adapt its trench coat to the age of the Internet. 
 (Her co-conspirator, Christopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, has already created trench evening and mini dresses.)
 In hopes of getting its 153-year-old label to appeal to a younger generation, Burberry started a social networking Web site on Monday, called artofthetrench.com. 
 It is the latest effort by Ms. Ahrendts and Mr. Bailey to increase sales by focusing resolutely on the brand's British heritage, its traditional trench coat and its classic pattern.
 ''It's our differentiator,'' Ms. Ahrendts said in a recent interview in her corner office at the company's headquarters here, pointing to the top of the Houses of Parliament as another example of a British icon. 
 She mentions Donna Karan as a brand that also capitalizes on its heritage and home, New York. 
 ''It's not so different from what competitors do,'' Ms. Ahrendts said. ''Maybe one was born from shoes and another from luggage, we come from a coat. It's our job to keep that category hot and cool and relevant for all ages.'' 
 After an 8 percent decline this year, the $226 billion global luxury goods market is expected to grow again next year as younger consumers and working women replace retiring baby boomers as the dominant consumer group, according to the business consulting firm Bain & Company.
 To prepare for that demographic shift, Ms. Ahrendts divided Burberry's clothing lines more clearly into Prorsum, which features high-end couture and evening wear worn by celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Liv Tyler; Burberry London, clothes for the office and everyday wear; and Burberry Brit, more casual weekend clothes. 
 Demand for the expanded children's line was so great this year that the company ran into production and shipping bottlenecks. In Burberry's new headquarters in London between the Thames River and the Tate Britain museum, its British heritage is visible despite its ultra-modern, sleek interior, done in white and brown. And the average age of employees here is 35. 
 Ms. Ahrendts recently revived a 108-year old company trademark, an equestrian knight carrying a flag with the words Prorsum -- Latin for forward. The image now features prominently in the headquarters' glass-walled entrance hall. 
 Inside, a photo of Emma Watson, the young British actress starring in the Harry Potter movies, modeling a $1,300 trench coat covers an entire wall. Next to it, a glass cube showcases a collection of the best-selling trench coat designs over the years.
 Seeking to clearly separate Burberry's clothing lines, the company is preparing to open its first stand-alone Burberry London and Burberry Brit stores this month. They will flank the entrance to the company's new Manhattan offices on Madison Avenue. It is in talks with a licensing partner to add a make-up and beauty line next year and working on expanding men's accessories, like bags and scarves.
 In her relatively short tenure, Ms. Ahrendts has done well by doing the surprising. 
 She continued the transformation toward a more upscale image started by her predecessor, Rose Marie Bravo. 
 Like many retailer bosses -- even when not faced with the worst recession since the Great Depression -- Ms. Ahrendts reduced costs and streamlined operations. 
 But she also took risks: expanding in the United States, in addition to the coveted Asian market, spinning off separate Burberry children's stores, adding more accessories like shoes and handbags, including the $6,200 Beaton bag carried by Victoria Beckham, and assuming greater control over pricing by opening more stand-alone stores.
 As a result, Burberry has done better than some of its competitors during the recession. Sales rose 4.6 percent, to $:343 million, or $568 million, in the three months ending Sept. 30, beating expectations. After a precipitous fall in 2008, shares have rebounded, doubling this year -- while other retailers are still in the doldrums. 
 The challenge for Ms. Ahrendts now is to maintain that momentum amid signs that the economic recovery will be weak and that consumers in markets like the United States and Britain will keep a tight grip on their wallets.
 Tall, charismatic and dressed from head to toe in Burberry, Ms. Ahrendts seems well aware of the tests. ''The biggest thing that keeps me up at night is how can we continue to evolve this organization in order to stay ahead of the curve,'' she said. ''My job is to always look two to three years ahead and look round the corner and see what's coming.''
 That is why Burberry is now focusing on how the Internet can help increase sales. Ms. Ahrendts said she got inspiration from her three children, who buy most of their clothes online. She is proud of Burberry's nearly 700,000 Facebook fans and that the company, founded as a maker of outdoor wear in 1856 by a draper's apprentice, Thomas Burberry, is attracting customers via Twitter and YouTube.
 Of course, the trench coat has come a long way, too. Originally designed as a coat for the British army in 1914, it was later associated with Audrey Hepburn's character in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and Humphrey Bogart's in ''Casablanca.''
 Ms. Ahrendts still remembers the first time she bought a Burberry trench coat. She was 21, fresh out Ball State University in Indiana, and on the hunt for a stylish but warm coat to wear to her first job, in sales at a small men's wear company in New York.
 She hopes a new generation will buy the coats to share their images and their adventures on the social networking site.
 Other luxury goods companies have stepped up online investments this year, too, in the hopes of attracting younger customers whose spending habits are less tied to the recession.
 Salvatore Ferragamo of Italy announced plans for an online store in October, following rivals Prada and Bulgari to the Web. Faberge, creator of the legendary Imperial Easter eggs, started selling its new jewelry collection almost exclusively via the Internet in September. 
 The recession had split luxury goods makers into two camps: Those more reliant on sales from jewelry and watches, like Bulgari, were hit harder than those selling clothes and less expensive or ostentatious items. And companies that depend more on department stores were hit harder because they had less control over pricing and inventories.
 Burberry gets about two-thirds of its revenue from clothes. Ms. Ahrendts cut its reliance on department stores so much that retail has surpassed wholesale as its biggest sales channel, 52 percent, to 37 percent. The rest is licensing. Since the company makes the trench coat in Britain, it has also benefited from a weak pound that attracted euro-rich tourists from the Continent.
 But the company has not fully escaped the economic downturn. Wholesale revenue fell 21 percent in the fiscal second quarter, and comparable store sales in Spain and the United States dropped. Burberry's dependence on tourists and the exchange rate for sales growth worry some analysts, and some are concerned that the fast expansion in the United States and emerging markets could detract from the brand's cachet.
 ''They've got the balance sheet to expand when others in the industry can't, which means they can really benefit once the market recovers,'' Katharine Wynne, an analyst at Investec Securities, said. ''But you have to make sure you keep that design heritage and retain that exclusivity.''
 Burberry still has a lot to do, Ms. Ahrendts said. It has just a 5.4 percent share of the global apparel market and 1.8 percent of the accessories market and plans to expand each. 
 ''At the beginning, it was all about writing the next chapter,'' she said. ''Now it's more about doing a blockbuster film.'' 
 She recently renewed her contract at Burberry and said she planned to be around for a while -- just like that first trench coat she bought almost 30 years ago and still wears sometimes.

HEADLINE: Missing in Health Bills: Solutions for Rising Costs

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As health care legislation moves toward a crucial airing in the Senate, the White House is facing a growing revolt from some Democrats and analysts who say the bills Congress is considering do not fulfill President Obama's promise to slow the runaway rise in health care spending.
 Mr. Obama has made cost containment a centerpiece of his health reform agenda, and in May he stood up at the White House with industry groups who pledged voluntary efforts to trim the growth of health care spending by 1.5 percent, or $2 trillion, over the next decade. 
 But health economists say it is impossible to know whether the bills, including one passed by the House on Saturday night, would meet that goal, and many are skeptical that they even come close.
 Experts -- including some who have consulted closely with the White House, like Dr. Denis A. Cortese, chief executive of the Mayo Clinic -- say the measures take only baby steps toward revamping the current fee-for-service system, which drives up costs by paying health providers for each visit or procedure performed. Some senators are also dissatisfied.
 ''My assessment at this point,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the Finance Committee, ''is that the legislation is heavy on health and light on reform.'' 
 There are a variety of ideas for attacking cost increases more aggressively, including setting Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals more rigorously and discouraging workers and employers from buying expensive health insurance policies that mask the true costs of treatment.
 Among other innovations being considered is a cost-cutting method known as bundling, in which health providers receive a lump sum to care for a patient with a particular medical condition, say, diabetes or heart disease. The House bill calls for the administration to develop a plan for bundling, while the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill gives it until 2013 to create a pilot program.
 Some experts would like to see such changes adopted more quickly, and senators of both parties say they will press for more aggressive cost-cutting measures when the bill comes up for debate. But drastic changes in the health care reimbursement system could cost the White House the support of doctors and hospital groups, who have signed onto the legislation and are lobbying hard to keep the current fee-for-service system from being phased out too quickly.
 The debate underscores a fundamental tension inside the White House between cost-containment idealists and pragmatists.
 The first group includes officials like Peter R. Orszag, the budget director, and Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, the medical ethicist whose brother Rahm is the chief of staff. The second includes Rahm Emanuel and Nancy-Ann DeParle, the director of the Office of Health Reform, who must contend with the realities of getting legislation passed.
 ''Let's be honest,'' Rahm Emanuel said in a recent interview. ''The goal isn't to see whether I can pass this through the executive board of the Brookings Institution. I'm passing it through the United States Congress with people who represent constituents.''
 He went on: ''I'm sure there are a lot of people sitting in the shade at the Aspen Institute -- my brother being one of them -- who will tell you what the ideal plan is. Great, fascinating. You have the art of the possible measured against the ideal.''
 Mr. Orszag would not be interviewed. But in an e-mail message sent through a spokesman, he said the current legislation ''lays the foundation'' for cost-cutting over the long-term, adding: ''Will more need to be done in the future? Absolutely.'' 
 Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican whose vote the administration is courting, convened a news conference on Monday with Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a member of the Republican leadership, to spotlight her concerns over cost containment. Ms. Collins said she had been meeting with a group of moderate Democrats who shared her views.
 ''I don't believe we need more pilot projects to show us that health care delivery reforms are necessary,'' she said in an interview. She added, ''I think people are much more upset over the cost of care than the administration is acknowledging.''
 Both the House and the Senate are proposing cost-saving measures. The House bill projects $440 billion in Medicare savings over 10 years; the Senate Finance Committee bill projects about $420 billion. White House officials say there will be additional, substantial savings in the private sector, as well. But how much is not clear.
 Still, it is one thing to wring savings out of a bloated system, quite another to change the way that system does business.
 Experts agree that the Senate Finance bill does more to put systemic changes in place. That is because the bill includes two measures that health economists favor: a tax on high-value ''Cadillac'' health plans, and an independent commission that would make binding recommendations on how to cut Medicare costs. 
 House Democrats strongly oppose the Cadillac tax, which would hurt, among other people, union workers with generous benefit plans. But Ms. DeParle said in an interview that she sensed fresh interest in the House in adopting the Medicare commission idea. ''There is a lot of support for cost containment,'' she said.
 Dr. Cortese, of the Mayo Clinic, said the bills could do more to reward quality care over quantity. He said he had met with Mr. Orszag and others at the White House and had proposed legislative language that would give Medicare three years to begin rewarding hospitals that are delivering better care at lower cost. 
 ''Our position has been focusing on paying for value,'' he said, adding, ''My take is there are people in the White House who understand exactly what I'm saying.''
 Yet a deal the White House made with the hospital industry could make it difficult to cut costs too deeply.
 The White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus of Montana, agreed to limit hospitals' payment reductions to $155 billion over 10 years. Those savings will come almost exclusively from ''an agreement to squeeze the prices a little bit across the board, rather than reforming the way payments work,'' said Mark McClellan, who ran Medicare under President George W. Bush.

HEADLINE: Conservative Group Rejects Crist

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS

 BODY:
The Club for Growth PAC, an antitax organization with considerable financial resources, announced Monday that it was endorsing Marco Rubio in his Florida Republican primary battle with Gov. Charlie Crist for the United States Senate. 
 The club, a conservative group, last week pounced on Mr. Crist's most recent statements that he was not really endorsing President Obama's $787 billion stimulus package when he appeared with the president last February and promoted the effort. The group immediately produced an advertisement against Mr. Crist, replaying the embrace between Mr. Obama and the governor at a rally.
 Mr. Rubio, a longtime state lawmaker and Republican leader in Florida, has attracted the attention of national conservatives as they search for candidates to energize their base. 
 In a statement, Chris Chocola, the club president, said: ''Marco Rubio is the real deal, one of the brightest young stars in American politics today, and a proven champion of economic liberty. He is a dynamic spokesman for the principles of limited government and economic freedom, and he will make a fantastic senator.'' 
 Mr. Rubio, 38, and Mr. Crist, 53, are seeking their party's nomination to run for the Senate seat vacated by Mel Martinez, a Republican.

HEADLINE: Lives During Wartime

BYLINE: HOME FIRES READERS


HIGHLIGHT: A selection of remembrances submitted by friends and family of veterans, and from veterans themselves.

 BODY:
Last week, the editors of Home Fires invited readers to send their recollections and photographs of members of the United States Armed Forces in acknowledgment of Veterans Day. Below is a selection of those remembrances submitted by friends and family of veterans, and from veterans themselves. 
Ronald E. Brown 
Yes, sir, the young man in the photo is me in 1970, at 21, 30 pounds lighter than when I'd arrived 13 months earlier. I had 10 days left in the Army, and I took both photos with a Canon FT 35-mm. The second snapshot is what I'm facing: My second pair of issue combat (jungle) boots, with my helmet sitting on top refers to "SHORT" as in "Short Timer" (Active Duty Time left to DEROS or rotation back to "The World"). My weapon ("Wilhemeina") stands ever-ready and always close by. The gal whose name is on helmet band, was the girlfriend who insisted on waiting-for-me she was good and married by the time I got back.
In the wake of what happened at Fort Hood, and the two wars our country is currently engaged in, I'd like to share this short poem, which I did not write (author unknown), but I never forgot.
WAR
Politicians talk about the need of it,Old men boast about the glory of it,And the soldiers just want to go home. 
Ronald E. Brown, U.S. Army, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) Vietnam 1969-70, Fort Hood, Texas, 1968-69.
David D. Overstreet This is the only picture I have of "Doc." 
I present you with two different versions of the same story.
From the 1/4 Marines Operations Log for 23 March 1969:
"231415 - Co "D" at grid XD676579 found 5 graves with 3 markers, proceded to check out area and was taken under fire by 7 NVA. Pulled back and fired 60mm, 81mm, 105, and 106 and had 2 air strikes. Had 3 friendly KIA and 4 friendly WIAs and 3 confirmed NVA and 4 probables."
"231720 - Co "C" at grid XD677575 went to retrieve 1 friendly KIA [from Co "D"] after air strike was run. Taken under fire by enemy sniper, snipers located in bunkers. Commenced search and clear, resulting in 6 enemy bunkers destroyed. KIA retrieved and Co "C" pulled back and called in air. Results 3 friendly WIA minor and 5 enemy KIAs confirmed." 
The three men killed in the engagement at 1415 (2:15 PM) were
HM3 David D. Overstreet, San Angelo, TX;LCpl Steve E. Byars, Lorida, FL; andPfc Norman E. Beck, Rockford, IL. s 
From an eyewitness, Lance Corporal J.A. Caldarulo (me):
This was a platoon patrol of our sector of the F.S.B. Argonne perimeter. After leaving behind the sick, lame and lazy, we numbered 20 to 25 men. We were led by the platoon sergeant since the platoon commanding officer was wounded during the initial assault. I was the R.T.O. for 1st platoon and was in the hip pocket of the platoon sergeant for the duration of the patrol.
The patrol route did not take us very far outside the perimeter, 300 meters at most, but was through thickly wooded jungle, on the hillside below the F.S.B. (fire support base) and visibility was extremely limited. The first half of the patrol went quietly, with the only interruption coming when we stumbled upon some fresh graves. There we found several recently dead North Vietnamese in shallow graves. After quickly checking the bodies for intel, we reburied them and continued the patrol. We were soon on the back leg of the route home to the F.S.B. when our point (Beck) walked upon a bunker and was shot dead where he stood. The next three or four guys behind him were wounded also, with "Professor" running back towards the HQ, hurdling a waist-high fallen tree, crashing on landing, rolling onto his back and scurrying with his hands and legs another couple of feet away from the enemy fire that had gut-shot him. His first words when he stopped scuttling away were, "They got me!". (it was surreally humorous, even at the time) 
In an instant it seemed, we had reacted to the fire and were returning same. Byers set his Pig up where Sarge told him and returned fire for but a few minutes into the fight, before he too was hit. The call went out for "CORPSMAN!"and "Doc" responded quickly. While he lay on his left side to avoid the withering fire coming from the bunkers I could clearly see him (5-10 meters) struggling to turn Byars over to access his wound. Doc's next move shall for the rest of my days on this earth live etched in my memory. He bounced up into a flat footed squat and began to flip Byers over. It was the last thing he ever did, for he fell over like a statue, never coming out of the squat, even in death. My life would never be the same.
The shock of my buddy checking out right in front of me, had put me into another dimension of thought, hate and anger. Time warped; had you asked me how long we were pinned down, I would have said four hours (I estimate now it was an hour); it seemed an eternity. One of the other platoons was sent down to help pull us out of the jam. And contrary to the A.A.R. above, we left all three of our K.I.A.s down there, as we had half a dozen wounded that had to be helped up the hill. I crossed the wire and reentered the F.S.B., jumped into a nearby mortar pit that was firing a cover mission for the platoon that had helped us pull out. I started helping pass the ammo, spitting on rounds when I could work up the saliva, all the while cursing the people, lands and gods of Vietnam, with tears streaming down my face. After a few minutes of watching me vent, Gunny jumped in the pit and took my arm and guided me back to my hole.
After the arty and airstrikes went in, they cleaned up the bunker complex and brought back our dead. Doc lay on our L.Z. wrapped in a poncho for a couple of days, as we still couldnt take any inbound choppers due to fire coming in from Laos. A dark time had come to my young (19) life. 
So here's to you "Doc" (raises a glass) -- it wont be long now.

The 44th Medical Brigade was sent home from Vietnam in early 1972. I was stationed at it's new home at Ft. Meade, Md. Each month, there was an awards ceremony. I learned what heroism was about at these events when the presiding officer told each soldier's story. One medevac copter pilot typified the heroic measures Army medics went through to save lives. As the pilot landed on a hot landing zone and patients were loaded on, his Huey came under fire. When he lifted off, one patient was hit and knocked out of the helicopter. The pilot lifted off, and then returned under fire to pick up the wounded soldier a second time. The pilot and crew evacuated him safely. I do not know their names, but he and his crew are remarkable Americans. I am sure the same kind of heroism happens regularly today. I am honored to have served with men and women like these. It makes me proud to be a veteran.
Frank Howard, Jr.
Canceled orders probably contributed to my father's safe passage through his army service during World War II. Slated to land on Omaha Beach on D Day, Frank Howard Jr.'s orders along with the other soldiers in Battery A 128th AAA Gunnery Battalion were canceled when General Patton's more seasoned troops who had seen action in Africa became available. A high percentage of those soldiers did not survive that landing. He also had orders to go to the Battle of the Bulge which were canceled when the fighting there ended. 
A newly-married Kansas farm boy, Frank recalls his time in the service to the day -- three years, one month and 18 days. He will turn 90 years old this November 30. He never shared his war experiences as a staff sergeant with his five children during our growing up years. But during his 70s and 80s he has recounted his experiences during his time in Europe, wrote a detailed account of them and had a several hour taped interview with me, his oldest daughter. In his later years, he also attended some of his battalion reunions.
Frank who grew up in Oakley, Kans., had graduated from Kansas State University and married Betty Woodall, a newly graduated nurse, before getting orders which took him to California, Texas and Tennessee before being shipped out on the Queen Mary to England. His battalion landed at D Day plus 13 and followed Patton's troops through England and other European countries before being sent back to Le Harve, where they served as security police until getting orders to come back home. Betty had been able to live with Frank until he went to Tennessee. She was when expecting their first child and returned to Colby, Kansas to live with her parents. Frank III was born and my father did not see him until he was almost two years old. At the train station my brother greeted this stranger who was kissing and hugging his mother at the train station with a kick in the shins.
My father once ordered his soldiers to throw some food rations off their truck to the starving people along the roadside who had been released from concentration camps. He told of this incident with obvious satisfaction. Some events such seeing bodies stacked like firewood remained distressing for a lifetime. Winter nights were often miserable, cold and wet in the pup tents. The food rations were not very appetizing, but being creative the soldiers sometimes were able to trade cigarettes or chocolate for eggs or fresh vegetables and at times even caught some fish. Once a cook made a special ice cream treat for the soldiers which a pilot froze by flying it a B-52 at a high altitude. After his return home, my father would sometimes have nightmares. A few years ago when in Lucerne, Switzerland, with my husband and me, he visited with a German World War II soldier who had been taken prisoner by the Americans and held in Louisiana during the war. We were struck by the geniality of the conversation, the laughter and the warmth displayed between the two men. My father has written many letters to senators and congressman about staying out of wars and was adamantly opposed to the U.S. engaging in the Iraq war. "This man does not know about war," he would say about President Bush. After the war Frank spent the rest of his life on his Kansas farm., but his service during World War II broadened his outlook. It is fair to say his experiences during that time life-altering.

As a United States Air Force weather officer and later chief forecaster of the U.S.A.F. weather detachment at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam (1968-69) I kept a detailed personal weather diary at Cam Ranh Bay during my tour of duty. Unlike in the United States, the two main seasons in Vietnam are the Northeast monsoon and the Southwest monsoon and each monsoon season brings different weather conditions inland and along the coast. My July 22, 1969, entry noted "a trough at 850 millibars set off some light rain between 0500 and 0630 local time, heavier rain fell after sunset. This has been an unusually rainy and cloudy month."
A few times a year I read through the weather diary and I can still see the weather events I experienced in Vietnam unfolding. Joel Rosenbaum, Eatontown, N.J.

He and his fellow soldiers rescued this trained hawk from a group of children who were teasing it. My son is an amazing young man, strong, brave, and a terrific soldier with a good heart. I am proud of him every day. He does something most Americans never do: He puts his life on the line for his country every single day. I thank him, his fellow soldiers, and all veterans for their service in the Iraq war and in all past wars. Thank you for everything you do and did for this country.

My father was drafted seven months before Pearl Harbor; if I recall correctly, it was supposed to be for a year, but he realized when Pearl Harbor was attacked that this would change. It turned out to befive years; eventually he would serve in North Africa and Italy.
Dad recalled the non-militaristic posture of the United States, reflected in the equipment available to them in the early days of his service. They trained using brooms (pretending they were guns) and sacks of flower (pretending, I guess, that they were bombs); there were signs that said things like, "tank."
Dad said his experiences at Fort Benning, Ga., were similar to those in "From Here to Eternity."
The war was of course hard on the whole family. Dad mentioned years later that as his father accompanied him to the point of their separation, he noticed his father (World War I generation, of course) was crying, the only time he had seen him cry. Dad had met Mom before the war -- at Manhattan Beach. The war separated them for years.
Dad did not say much about the war itself. But recently he recalled that the night before he was moved from Africa to Italy a transport ship like theirs had been bombed and sunk, killing all aboard.
In Italy, Dad was assigned to guard prisoners, which he recalled was not hard because the Italian soldiers were extremely grateful to have been captured by the Americans: they knew that if the Americans had not captured them, the Germans would have sent them to the Russian front.
Back in the U.S., he was assigned to guard duty one night with, due to the alphabet, Joe DiMaggio, whom Dad described as very nice. Dad (a talented weekend ballplayer before the war) helpfully advised DiMaggio to keep up his reflexes by playing ping pong.
The attached photograph was taken on the day my parents were wed at City Hall in Manhattan, April 15, 1943. It was a frustrating day, because they had trouble finding a Justice of the Peace who would agree to marry them, because Dad's parents' heritage was Catholic and Protestant and Mom's Jewish. 
After serving five years in the Army, Dad faced discrimination when he returned home. Before being drafted Dad had earned a degree in business from Columbia University, but when he returned from five years of service he was turned down for jobs due to his Italian name. Mom too had faced discrimination as many places would hire only Protestants, not Jews. Dad chose to contribute his skills to the New York City schools, as a math teacher and eventually a principal. Mom served as a Public Health Nurse. And: loving, wonderful parents.

Patrick AlexanderAfter serving for 15 months with the 173rd Airborne in 1969, it was time for my DEROS (date of expected return from overseas). I waited for several days at the huge base at Cam Ranh Bay for my final travel orders. Those of us in the transit center dealt with the boredom and anxiety in various ways. Since I was married, I stayed away from the local bars and "clubs" in order to avoid any kind of trouble. At various times during the day and night, a voice over a loudspeaker would announce the names of soldiers scheduled for the next "freedom bird" taking us back to "the world." At about 2 a.m., through the fog of sleep, I heard my name announced. Without dressing, I ran to the processing center dressed only in my olive drab boxer shorts. Upon handing me the packet with my orders, a captain told me, "Son, make sure you're in uniform when you arrive at the plane." 
The next morning, we boarded buses which took us to the air base. We rounded a corner, and, for the first time, saw our "freedom bird" -- a beautiful stretched Boeing 707, Pan Am.
The guys in the buses erupted in cheering and screaming. The cheering got even louder when we saw those beautiful Pan Am flight attendants step from the plane. Things were fairly quiet as we taxied into position for take-off, but, at the first indication that we were off the ground, the cabin erupted in cheering again. "My God," I thought, I'm finally getting out. Most of the flight is a blur in my memory -- a stop in Guam for refueling, sleeping, reading, playing cards. After many hours, the pilot came over the intercom and announced, "Gentlemen, we're approaching the west coast of the United States ... welcome home, boys." Absolute pandemonium broke out, followed by quiet as the plane circled and landed at McChord Air Force Base. As we disembarked, guys were screaming, cheering, crying, yelling. A friend told me later that I kept screaming, "They can't get me anymore ... they can't get me anymore." I have no memory of that at all. The next 24 hours were spent at Ft. Lewis, Wash., while the Army did more "processing." (jeez, how much processing does it take ?). We were given a steak dinner at the post. Finally, I boarded my flight dressed in my new Class-A uniform, bound for home. The flight to O'Hare was uneventful. As I neared the end of the jetway, I saw them -- my wife, my older brother, Mike, and Mom. Tears and hugs all around ... my big brother nearly crushed me he hugged me so tightly. A few days later, I sat in the office of my graduate school advisor discussing what courses I should take the next term. As he turned to answer a phone call, I sat there thinking, " This is so weird. Two weeks ago, I was getting shot at, now I'm talking about whether I should take Econ. 401. I'm home but it doesn't feel like home." It would take a number of years before it felt like home again. Someone once asked me what it was like to be coming home. Without even having to think, I replied, "Imagine taking all of the best Christmases you've ever had and putting them together. That's what it was like." Patrick Alexander, Ashland, Ore.
Franklin Don Kaminsky
Here is a picture of my father, Franklin Don Kaminsky, later changed to Kay. It was taken when he was about 20 years old in 1952. His hometown was St. Joseph, Mo. He served in the Navy during the Korean War but was never deployed anywhere but to Pensacola, Fla., where he met my mother. He is no great war hero, but they are still happily married for 55 years and still live in Pensacola. The picture was autographed by him to my mother. They married 6 months after meeting. Just another kind of story that can come from military service.

I am the son of immigrants. My father became an American citizen by serving in World War I. Many of my cousins, also the sons of immigrants, served in World War II. One was wounded, one killed, the others came home whole. I have never forgotten those sacrifices made to keep us free. I served in the United States Air Force in peacetime, my brother in the Navy, also in peacetime. Remember those who serve in peacetime as well, because by serving in peacetime and by being ready, we did not have to fight.

I glanced upward at the hovering CH-46 twin-rotor helicopter that had swept into the jungles of Vietnam to facilitate our escape. Within seconds, four Marines were jerked into the sky on a towline for a ride back to our combat base. 
The ride would be anything but routine. Tied in above me was Wilk's body, tightly stuffed into a canvas shelter halve, twisting in the wash of the quickening rotors. My body still trembled from the events that led to his death.
It all happened so fast. Not long before we were winding our way down a jungle trail trying to find the enemy. Our mission as reconnaissance Marines was to gather as much information as we could convey to our "handlers" in Da Nang. It was 1968 and the war in Vietnam was roaring.
How could I forget what happened next? We turned down the trail only to stumble upon a North Vietnamese listening post. The two were smoking opium, squatting over their AK-47 assault rifles. 
Our point man emptied his pump shotgun into the pair, tearing one in half. Wilk, tailing the point man, was fresh on his first combat patrol. Simultaneous with the blasts of the shotgun Wilk screamed and fell to the ground. He grasped for air but there was none to be found. 
I had my first fatality and our guy wasn't touched.
For years I was alone, haunted by the ghost of Wilk and others like him. There were no Veterans Day parades for me. I hid from the pain inside of me. I poured my soul into my books and earned two graduate degrees. Soon, I found myself working for the vice president. I was afraid that someone would learn my secret that I was too willing to let others pick up my slack.
War is never what it seems. There is no justice as to where the bullets fall. At best, we can be there for each other hoping and praying that the next step will not be our last. It is by grace that we become veterans, men and women who survived not for glory, but just to live another day.

Last week my father, a World War II veteran of D-Day, went to live in a nursing home. And once again, I had to tell the doctors to note on his medical chart that "he faints at the sight of blood." My dad served in the Navy aboard an L.S.T. (Landing Ship, Tank). It wasn't until several years ago, when World War II veterans came to be known as the "Greatest Generation" that he began to speak of the events of June 6, 1944, D-Day. L.S.T.'s were built to sail right up on to a shore with high tide and lower their front doors to let equipment disembark. The ship then sat and waited 12 hours for the next high tide to lift it off shore and sailed back out to sea. On D-day, my dad's L.S.T. landed and unloaded its cargo of tanks and soldiers on to Omaha Beach. He was given a gun and told to shoot at German planes above. For 12 hours he shot his gun and watched as soldiers on the beach, and in the water, were killed. Bodies were everywhere and the water was red with blood. 
There wasn't any official P.T.S. (Post Traumatic Syndrome) then. Soldiers pretty much dealt with their post-war stress as best they could. In my dad's case, he fainted when he saw blood and he still copes 65 years later by fainting. As recently as last June, he was rushed to an emergency room after inadvertently seeing blood during a routine skin procedure. 
So on this Veteran's Day 2009, I want to tell everyone at his nursing home and at the hospital that his fainting is not a weakness. It is a response to what he witnessed 65 years ago at Omaha Beach. I want to thank my father, Kent Thompson, and all war veterans everywhere for their courage to go on and live their lives peacefully while carrying the burden of their memories of war.

All three of us were in C Co., 4th Battalion, 64th Armor, 3rd Infantry Division. The picture was taken in the Karradah neighborhood of Baghdad in late April 2003, shortly after the city fell and after we had gotten the looting under control. We had just dropped off a load of supplies for this girls' school, and their teacher asked us if we would take a picture with her students, who were bubbling with excitement at our presence. We gladly obliged.

Earle W. Hamill
A photo of me with my father, Earle W. Hamill, who served this country in World War II, the Korean conflict and Vietnam, now buried with honors in Section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery with my mother who worked at the Pentagon, where they met in 1950. 
For over a decade prior to his passing, I would drive from my home on Long Island to Washington, where my widowed father resided to see him on Veterans Day. He'd get dressed in a dark suit, put his medals on and we'd go to the Vietnam Memorial for the day so he could comfort visiting soldiers and share his memories of his time there. 
I'd just watch as my father as he listened to others' tearful memories of service there. I missed my father when he was in Vietnam for more than a year during my childhood, he was never the same when he returned having seen so much there that he never spoke of. So I understand families struggles today with deployed family members to Iraq and Afghanistan. This photo shows the pride I felt being with my father on Veterans Day and his love for this country as a patriot proud of his service. In my father's memory I'm in the process of joining the Daughters of the American Revolution so I can serve in some way to preserve the flag standard and to honor our first patriot, Robert Hamill, who fought alongside George Washington at Bunker Hill during the Revolutionary War.

That fall and winter of 1968-69 I wore my pea coat with the 2nd class chevron still attached, as much for provocation as for warmth. I was, truth be told, spoiling for a fight, gangway Che and Mao. But though I daily strode through Sproul Plaza I was never accosted by The Revolution, never reviled by Movement heavies, never even given a second look by CHAOS provocateurs. Indeed, the grimacing irony was such that I couldn't really figure out who had served and who was camouflaged in zeitgeist mufti. During the Berkeley Wars army fatigue jackets were de rigueur, and Navy pea coats highly coveted, and on that fabled 60s battleground the militant factions wore the uniform in mix and match derision. No wonder I soon sold my sea bag, along with my prized pea coat. Being a veteran at Berkeley meant being conscripted into an army of liberation theology, one wearing its contempt for military service on its sleeve. 
The large chip on my shoulder I had brought up to Berkeley in the summer of 1968 had nothing to do with Vietnam, everything to do with being a veteran. I had, after all, only seen the watery parts of the world, and though my ship, a destroyer out of Norfolk, did make it to the South China Sea, to well within North Vietnam's territorial waters, in fact, I was sitting in a classroom in La Jolla by then, missing out on the Conradian salvos of Operation Sea Dragon. No, it was that other V word that set me apart from my classmates, four years younger and a lot more conversant in 60s culture. The military was anathema by then, something alien and fit for ridicule, all but inconceivable to upper middle class students safe from the draft, and my four years in the Navy stood as an open invitation to wonder what had possessed me in the first place.
In fact I was proud of my service, and try though I did I could not reconcile my blue-collar patriotism, visceral to the point of fists clenched, with the virulent hostility to all things "imperialist" that passed for the common wisdom in those interminable days of rage. BRING THE WAR HOME. Although I came to loathe the war with a passion, my estrangement from the 60s was very nearly complete, and it wasn't until I discovered who the real veterans on campus were -- nearly a thousand strong as it turns out -- that I could forgo the bristling stance and turn my hypos to fraternal account.
Thanks to the campus chapter of Veterans For Peace I learned to be a veteran. A veteran on the Berkeley Campus, no easy feat with two intramural wars raging. Moreover a veteran committed to peace, tutoring the martial campus in the irenic arts. Ceasefire Now. Thanks to the power vacuum created by the incessant war of attrition, On Strike Shut It Down, we became - for an all too brief, almost apocryphal time - Big Men on Campus. The administration couldn't go more out of its way to accommodate us, and the Plateglass Revolution couldn't think to avoid us. (No one dared spit on a veteran, and indeed we were met with the grudging respect of the ultras in the Movement.)
The Berkeley Wars might have had a far different storyline had we exerted our authority, but that was asking too much. Reentry to civilian life was difficult enough without having to take responsibility for the ivory tower under siege. Instead we became exemplars, role models even, and because we were antiwar and spoke from (often harrowing) experience those middle class students who scorned the military came to think twice about the lockstep uniforms they wore. For those of us who savored that fraternity and got a fleeting glimpse of that lost treasure, every Veterans Day since has been a memento mori, of the fugitive peace we brought home during that well-nigh apocalyptic time of defiance and despair.

John Bedway
The photo above is of my father, John Bedway, at the Haydock Park Race Course, site of a U.S. Army Recovery Center during World War II. My father, who died in 2007, spoke often of his service in this little-known unit of the Army, set up at a racetrack where each horse stall was converted into a two-bed billet. He'd been assigned to the infantry, but two weeks after landing as a private in England in 1944, he was pulled out and told he was going to help set up this recovery unit, for "soldiers who can't perform their duty, but the docs can find nothing wrong with them." 
The men had to be kept busy and fit -- the Army didn't want to send them back to the States. My father was chosen, he said, because the Army had been combing soldiers' records for anybody with a background that could help in the rehabilitation of soldiers, and my father had four years of teacher training at the University of Cincinnati, and was a physical education major. I interviewed him many times over the years, and the quotes below the picture are from my notes. After ten months with this unit, my father, after passing the officers' training course in Fontainebleau, served with the First Division in Europe and on Occupation duty in Germany until May 14, 1945.

Joseph O'NeillOn Veterans Day I have particular reason to have the military veterans in my life in my thoughts and I'd like to share those thoughts.
Not long ago, I had gotten to the point where I was completely out of resources. There was something really big I wanted to accomplish in life and I needed help to do it. I didn't know where to turn. And then I thought of my late father's two older brothers. So, I wrote to them.
My Uncle Jim O'Neill was a master aircraft mechanic. During WW II, he distinguished himself in the Army Air Corps, rising to be at the age of 28 the youngest master sergeant in the service. At the height of the war effort, he was responsible for keeping 60 warplanes in the air.
My Uncle Dan O'Neill was an infantryman. He went to war with an eyesight deficit that made it necessary for him to fire his rifle from his left shoulder. As a result, every time he fired, the hot ejected shell flew before his eyes. Every time, he risked being blinded. 
Not only that, the rifle he carried was fitted with a telescopic sight. He told me that that was the last thing you wanted to have on you if the Germans caught you. They would take you for a sniper and shoot you on the spot. That man fought all the way across Europe that way.
My Dad, Joe O'Neill, was the youngest of the brothers. He enlisted in the Navy at age 16 just as the war was winding down. He was a plank owner of the cruiser U.S.S. Little Rock. She was still in commission when I was in the Navy in the 1970s. A truly proud and beautiful ship. 
All the men in my father's family, myself and my brother Sean included, have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Not one of us in three generations has been drafted. 
The first of us was my grandfather Daniel O'Neill, who arrived in New York City as an immigrant in 1914. Three years later, he was in the trenches of France with the New York 69th. 
When I had set a great goal for myself and I really needed help to achieve it, these are the men I thought of. When I sought their help, support and inspiration, I was not disappointed.
A short time after I wrote to my Uncle Dan, an envelope arrived in the mail. It contained exactly what I needed to complete my task. It also contained the sad news that Uncle Jim had passed away.
I later wrote them a note telling them how proud I was of them. I wrote, "Thank you for everything you've done."
And to all the other veterans who happen to read this Veterans Day message, thanks to you, too.
Terry O'Neill, U.S. Navy, 1974-78, Albany, N.Y.
John B. Merrell II
My father lost his leg in France on Friday, November 13th 1944. He stepped on a land mine when he was out at night looking for a member of his military group who had not returned from patrol.
When I was in my 20s he told me this story for the third or fourth time but this time he told me that the person he was looking for had already returned but had not used the correct password so they all thought he was still out there in the cold dark night. I was devastated to hear this. It took me years to work it out. But the story in our house was "I could have died the next day." Blowing off his foot and losing his leg got him back safe and sound. 
My dad was never bitter about his leg. He was transported to England and then back to Utah. When they fitted him with his first wooden leg -- he refused to use crutches. He said he was just going to learn to walk on it. The second week he had the leg, one of the famous big bands of the time (Gene Krupa's, we believe) turned up to entertain the wounded soldiers and they asked if any of the amputees thought they could jitterbug. My dad said yes and got up to dance with a local dance school instructor.
He was 19. We have a newspaper clipping about it. He never complained about his leg. When I was a kid he would suffer from phantom nerves. In the middle of dinner he would suddenly slam his leg into the floor to deal with the pain. He would wince and say, "Wow, that was an interesting one," but he would never, ever, say it hurt. My dad loved the outdoors. I spent every vacation of my life out in the wilderness of the Western United States either in a 24-foot boat we had or the old Chevy station wagon and later a 4-wheel-drive International he specially ordered. I used to say that if he hadn't lost his leg we would have been up and down every mountain in sight. He loved that. He never let it slow him down. In the Vietnam War era he would sometimes go up to L.A. to the veterans hospital. He'd hear about a young amputee from someone and go up to tell them they could make it through. He died of leukemia 12 years ago complicated by Hepatitis C which he most likely got from the transfusions he received with the amputation. He was a man who loved his country. Gladly served and never complained. He gave freely to others and was a model of someone who took his lot in life and just kept going. Dee Ikeda, Long Beach, Calif.
Anne-Marie Hislop and FamilyWhile a Navy veteran myself, Veterans Day always brings my Uncle Vincent to mind. Whenever her brother Vinny's name came up in a conversation, my Mom would sigh and say, "Vinny was never the same after the war." Uncle Vinny spent much of World War II carrying the dead, maimed and wounded off the battlefields as the U.S. Army slogged its way up the boot of Italy. Although he did not die until 1968, Uncle Vinny's life never really came together after that war. War is indeed hell.

Written June 15, 1968, to his wife, from Dong Ha, about nine miles from the DMZ.Dear Maxie,
Our company got hit pretty bad today and we're still having reports come in. So far we have five killed and 16 wounded. No telling how many it will be when it's all over because information gets to us last. I know two of the people who were killed. One was an officer, our executive officer who's about my age, the other I know was a real nice guy. What makes it bad is that we don't know for sure who else was hurt and can't even do the paperwork on the ones we know because we don't have all the info yet. We've got our work cut out for us for the next couple of days. The less seriously wounded are back here now and say that they were attacked this morning by human waves of NVA. They just kept coming in such number that they couldn't kill them all. They get all hopped up on pot before they attack so they're almost crazy before they come to make them extra brave. Our people were mowing them down like grass but they still kept coming. They counted over a hundred known dead and no telling how many other dead or wounded. Where do they all come from? 
Our company is right up by the border of Laos and it must be the main headquarters. One thing for sure - the bombing pause has cost the lives of some real decent people - people killed by politics. Since we slacked up on the bombing they almost had a freeway to move men and supplies south. It's making it rough. I wish that we'd either fight this war right or get out completely. One of the corpsmen had just gotten married a little over a week ago on R&R in Hawaii and got killed. What a waste. What a waste. Damn it - I'm all for peace and no bombing, too - but if we're going to fight this war we should fight it whole hog - they are. It just makes me sick - and mad to know that guys are being killed over here who shouldn't have been - because we're worried about someone else will say. Tell it to the guys that are dead. Tell them it's for world opinion. I'm sure they'll understand.
Bet you really look good now. I miss your terribly. It's unfair for everyone else to see you looking so good when your own husband can't see you. I'm going to make up for lost time when I see you again - that's a promise. I'm going to kiss every square inch of your beautiful body when I get back just out of happiness in seeing you again and make sure that it's really you. Just wait - you'll see (and feel)!
I love you, Maxie, more than one person could love another and I always will. Nothing will ever stop me from loving you. You are my life - my reason for living. I love you.
Gary Canant, Leawood, Kan.
Charles M. Engberg
My father, Charles M. Engberg, proud patriot and man of peace, served in the U.S. Army, active 1942-1946 and Army Reserve 1948-1978.
He was to most people an ordinary man, and he would want people to remember him as such, but to his family, he was far from ordinary. He did not tell us much until his later years of his time in that bitter cold winter of the Battle of Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge). He recalled how his commanding officer insisted on dry socks and attention to foot care for his soldiers, and the rest of his life, my dad was meticulous about his footwear. Growing up in the 50s and 60s, we children watched him polish his insignia, his boots, and go off in that meticulously cared for uniform for weekend drills for summer Reserve and National Guard exercises. We were amused more than anything, as children. What we did not know in those years, he shared with us closer to the end of his life: He was always ready for "The Call." His equipment was always at the ready, his personal effects in order, should the call come to again to serve country in another land. He was at his core a peaceful man. He hated war, but understood that there are times it will come. He left that legacy for us to pass to our children. We hope he was actually an "ordinary man," that many others share his deep commitment to this country that has given us so much. 
Thanks, Dad, for giving us all so much. Julie Engberg, El Dorado Hills, Calif.
Ed Good
My father, Ed Good, decorated World War II and Korean War hero received one of the highest honors this year for his 89th birthday. He received over 200 birthday cards from friends, family and from many across the country he never met thanking him for his military service. A classroom of elementary children in Florida made special birthday cards which he found very touching. My father is quoted in the local newspaper: "When you get those kids thanking you, that's really what you fought for." Ed Good served as a captain during both wars and was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded in World War II. He received many other medals as well. We were so touched and blessed by the outpouring of support from good loving people. I am proud of my father and all our veterans who served this great country. God Bless America!Cathy (Good) Welker, Brighton Mich.
John Brinton
Our father, John Brinton, joined the Navy at 17 to become a gunner on an aircraft carrier during World War II. He spoke of harrowing gun battles with kamikaze pilots in the South Pacific and how when the pilots missed their landing they were just bulldozed overboard, pilot and plane, to make way for the next incoming aircraft. He counted his service to his nation as one of the things he was most proud of in his life. He never spoke about what happened but broke his silence right before his death. My brother, his namesake, followed in his footsteps and volunteered to serve during the Vietnam War. A young man with a natural spiritual nature, he went into the Army at 19 and never came back. His body came back, but the man who was my brother was left in the jungles of Vietnam. He was a grunt soldier commanded to do terrible things, for which you can sometimes find him in a darkened corner crying and praying to God to forgive him. 
He has P.T.S.D. and can be up and over the back of a couch from a dead sleep in less time than it takes for the sound of slamming screen door to reach your ears. He came back and was told there was nothing wrong with him, to "man up". And so he did whatever it took to do it, and self medicated. No one, no one survives war. Death is a matter of degrees. My brother has taught me that. I have seen him die each day as he valiantly struggles to be the man he was before he went to war. Although he did not physically die on the battlefield, he has no less given his life in the service of his country. And we as his family have offered up our father and our brother to our country, to the American ideal, in the belief that our country was worthy of the sacrifice we have all made.

HEADLINE: Trucks, Trains And Trees

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
TapajOs National Forest, Brazil
 No matter how many times you hear them, there are some statistics that just bowl you over. The one that always stuns me is this: Imagine if you took all the cars, trucks, planes, trains and ships in the world and added up their exhaust every year. The amount of carbon dioxide, or CO2, all those cars, trucks, planes, trains and ships collectively emit into the atmosphere is actually less than the carbon emissions every year that result from the chopping down and clearing of tropical forests in places like Brazil, Indonesia and the Congo. We are now losing a tropical forest the size of New York State every year, and the carbon that releases into the atmosphere now accounts for roughly 17 percent of all global emissions contributing to climate change. 
 It is going to be a long time before we transform the world's transportation fleet so it is emission-free. But right now -- like tomorrow -- we could eliminate 17 percent of all global emissions if we could halt the cutting and burning of tropical forests. But to do that requires putting in place a whole new system of economic development -- one that makes it more profitable for the poorer, forest-rich nations to preserve and manage their trees rather than to chop them down to make furniture or plant soybeans. 
 Without a new system for economic development in the timber-rich tropics, you can kiss the rainforests goodbye. The old model of economic growth will devour them. The only Amazon your grandchildren will ever relate to is the one that ends in dot-com and sells books. 
 To better understand this issue, I'm visiting the Tapajos National Forest in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon on a trip organized by Conservation International and the Brazilian government. Flying in here by prop plane from Manaus, you can understand why the Amazon rainforest is considered one of the lungs of the world. Even from 20,000 feet, all you see in every direction is an unbroken expanse of rainforest treetops that, from the air, looks like a vast and endless carpet of broccoli.
 Once on the ground, we drove from Santarem into Tapajos, where we met with the community cooperative that manages the eco-friendly businesses here that support the 8,000 local people living in this protected forest. What you learn when you visit with a tiny Brazilian community that actually lives in, and off, the forest is a simple but crucial truth: To save an ecosystem of nature, you need an ecosystem of markets and governance. 
 ''You need a new model of economic development -- one that is based on raising people's standards of living by maintaining their natural capital, not just by converting that natural capital to ranching or industrial farming or logging,'' said Jose Maria Silva, vice president for South America of Conservation International.
 Right now people protecting the rainforest are paid a pittance -- compared with those who strip it -- even though we now know that the rainforest provides everything from keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere to maintaining the flow of freshwater into rivers.
 The good news is that Brazil has put in place all the elements of a system to compensate its forest-dwellers for maintaining the forests. Brazil has already set aside 43 percent of the Amazon rainforest for conservation and for indigenous peoples. Another 19 percent of the Amazon, though, has already been deforested by farmers and ranchers. 
 So the big question is what will happen to the other 38 percent. The more we get the Brazilian system to work, the more of that 38 percent will be preserved and the less carbon reductions the whole world would have to make. But it takes money.
 The residents of the Tapajos reserve are already organized into cooperatives that sell eco-tourism on rainforest trails, furniture and other wood products made from sustainable selective logging and a very attractive line of purses made from ''ecological leather,'' a k a, rainforest rubber. They also get government subsidies.
 Sergio Pimentel, 48, explained to me that he used to farm about five acres of land for subsistence, but now is using only about one acre to support his family of six. The rest of the income comes through the co-op's forest businesses. ''We were born inside the forest,'' he added. ''So we know the importance of it being preserved, but we need better access to global markets for the products we make here. Can you help us with that?''
 There are community co-ops like this all over the protected areas of the Amazon rainforest. But this system needs money -- money to expand into more markets, money to maintain police monitoring and enforcement and money to improve the productivity of farming on already degraded lands so people won't eat up more rainforest. That is why we need to make sure that whatever energy-climate bill comes out of the U.S. Congress, and whatever framework comes out of the Copenhagen conference next month, they include provisions for financing rainforest conservation systems like those in Brazil. The last 38 percent of the Amazon is still up for grabs. It is there for us to save. Your grandchildren will thank you.

HEADLINE: Removing a Barrier

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
This city, which once moved rivers to create a new urban design, is now moving a major highway away from its downtown and opening up approximately 20 acres for development. This newly accessible area is within walking distance of Providence's historic waterfront and commercial downtown. 
 The property in question is known as the Iway surplus land, named for the $610 million federal and state highway project that is relocating Interstate 195 to the outskirts of Providence. 
 The land won't be available for another year or two, when the road work is finished. But it is already generating considerable excitement among city and state officials, who see a rare opportunity to strengthen the city and state's economies and to connect neighborhoods to the Providence River waterfront, which has been cut off for years.
 Brown University and Johnson & Wales University have already expressed interest in buying some of the land. Both universities want to expand their into a neighborhood called the Jewelry District, a warren of streets that the interstate had previously cut off from downtown Providence. 
 As for the rest of the development parcels, which are owned by the state's Department of Transportation as a result of the construction decades ago of the old highway system, there are expected to be 20 in all, ranging in size from a half-acre to three acres.
 The surplus parcels are situated between the city's hospital district, its downtown and its educational institutions, and the vision is for a mix of uses that will foster a new ''knowledge-based economy'' centered on Providence's educational and medical institutions. ''This is an extraordinary once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our city,'' said Providence's mayor, David N. Cicilline.
 The idea is to make Providence more like Boston, which is known for its universities and hospitals, said J. Michael Saul, the interim executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation. The surplus parcels, valued at about $60 million, make this a possibility, Mr. Saul said.
 For the most part, the parcels in question are covered by asphalt or otherwise obscured by the old I-195, the main highway leading to Cape Cod from Interstate 95. That road cut a swath through the southern edge of Providence, creating a barrier between the downtown and a number of neighborhoods. The Iway project is moving the highway split south by about a half-mile, in the process uncovering land that hasn't been seen in years.
 In a similar fashion, about 20 years ago the city uncovered the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers, which were largely paved over in downtown Providence, and moved the point of their convergence for aesthetic purposes.
 Next year, the old highway overpass will be demolished and the city will begin to create a new street grid, which will better connect surrounding neighborhoods to the waterfront, said Michael P. Lewis, director of the state Department of Transportation. This work will continue into 2011 and 2012, while the state prepares the surplus land for development.
 In total, the surplus land measures 39 acres, but only about 20 of them will be marketed for development. The remaining land will be used to create new streets and open space.
 The city has already claimed eight acres straddling the Providence River. This is to become a new city park featuring a sculpture garden and a terraced amphitheater, among other design elements. Construction will begin in another year or two.
 In addition, neighborhood groups have been lobbying the city and state to take one 1.3-acre waterfront parcel, the site of an abandoned nightclub called Shooter's, and turn it into a public destination and transportation hub, where ferries could take tourists and commuters from Providence to Newport.
 This site might also have a shore dinner hall or other restaurant, a marina and open space for festivals and markets. The city's zoning allows for the development of an eight-story residential building on the site, but opponents say such a structure would be unsightly and squander a valuable public asset.
 ''We don't want that taken away from future generations,'' said Rita Williams, co-chairwoman of the Head of the Bay Gateway, an advocacy group that was formed a few years ago to preserve the Shooter's site for public use. 
 Aside from the debate over the Shooter's site, there is general agreement that the remaining surplus land should be dedicated to mixed-use development, with the overarching goals of creating jobs, expanding the city's tax base and revitalizing urban neighborhoods.
 This vision was laid out in a marketing study that the state commissioned for the surplus land. That study, by Chan Krieger Sieniewicz, an urban design planning firm in Cambridge, Mass., warned that it would probably take years to develop all of the parcels.
 ''This is especially so given the current economic downturn, which lowers confidence about immediate redevelopment prospects and thus may skew decisions away from ultimate highest and best-use scenarios,'' the report states.
 The report details Rhode Island's economic woes, which include an unemployment rate of 13 percent, a struggling housing market with a glut of new condominiums in Providence, and a loss of population. Providence's economy is ''deteriorating'' and demand for real estate is ''very weak,'' the report states.
 As a result, the state should sell sites to Brown and Johnson & Wales as soon as possible to create momentum for future development, the report advises.
 Brown University wants to buy four acres of surplus land in the Jewelry District, where it already owns property and intends to spend $45 million to renovate an existing building to serve as the new home for its Warren Alpert Medical School. According to Richard Spies, Brown's executive vice president for planning, work on the 135,000-square-foot medical school would begin next spring and should be completed by the fall of 2011.
 ''We have strong interest in the whole area,'' Mr. Spies said of the district, where large jewelry companies once flourished.
 Johnson & Wales University, which already has a sizable presence in Providence, wants to buy 1.75 acres next its downtown campus to build dormitories, according to the university's president, Irving Schneider. With 8,000 out-of-state students and only 4,000 dormitory beds, additional housing has become a top priority, he said.
 Both schools have offered to pay market value for the land, and state and city officials say they want to sell it to them. But any sale to the universities or other nonprofit institutions must be accompanied by agreements to compensate the city for a loss in tax revenue because of their nonprofit status, Mayor Cicilline said. ''The interests of the taxpayers have to be protected,'' he said. Negotiations on this point are under way. 
 The state's Economic Development Corporation has been assigned with the task of marketing and selling the surplus parcels. The agency plans to hire a managing director to oversee the disposition of the parcels, keeping in mind the goals identified by the city and state for the land. ''I'm hoping out of this we will have a robust knowledge-based economy,'' Mr. Saul said.

HEADLINE: What Happens in Vegas

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
CHARLIE PALMER opened a huge new restaurant in Manhattan this year, Aureole, a big, sprawling series of rooms on the ground floor of the Bank of America building on 42nd Street. He has around a dozen more, in Las Vegas, Reno and California's wine country, among others, as well as a hotel, a catering outfit and a shop in Sonoma County that sells the sort of candles and bowls that you see in the homes of people who spend a lot of time shuttling among New York, Sonoma and Las Vegas. 
 Mr. Palmer is a big-business restaurateur, a best seller, the Dean Koontz of the saute and oven set. It wasn't always so. In 1988, he was just a brash young chef who had cooked at the River Cafe, who struck out on his own to open a creamy, luxurious town house restaurant, Aureole, on the Upper East Side. The food was American, audacious, often excellent and expensive despite a sour economy. It was New York to its core. 
 Bryan Miller, writing in The New York Times, awarded the place two stars in 1989, and three in 1991. (Eight years later, William Grimes took it back to two. Some of us, without stars to give, covered it for free newspapers available in banks and bars and Laundromats.) Mr. Palmer wasn't big business then. He was just talented and possibly brave.
 Times change. In 2007, Mr. Palmer announced plans to move the restaurant south, into bigger digs. The result is a Las Vegas event restaurant airlifted into Manhattan, a corporate cafeteria with a soundtrack of smooth jazz in the George Benson style. The food can be quite good. It can also be the opposite.
 Aureole, as the New York expression goes, is meh. 
 The notion may have been to cater to the corporate titans of Bank of America, as well as to the fashionable shoes from Conde Nast, whose headquarters are next door. There is a formal dining room for their kind in the restaurant's rear, placed behind glass walls as if at the zoo, with a big wine list and busboys standing ramrod straight in the corners. It is the most pleasant part of the restaurant, the sort of room where you might go to celebrate the imminent consummation of a deal or the arrival in New York of a client from far away, where such a dining room might count as both exotic and familiar. 
 In that room, in the restaurant's early days, you could find a terrific hunk of Alaskan halibut served with baby carrots, fresh garbanzo beans, preserved lemon and a saffron-hued mussel sauce. There was also a rich and quintessentially Palmer pairing of lobster tail and pork belly, the two fatties squaring off over summer squash and chanterelles, with gooseberries set against the fragrance of almonds and wine. 
 An appetizer of pan-roasted shrimp with cauliflower, segments of blood orange, pickled ramps and curry butter arrived on the table extremely sweet and clean, with a mild bite from the curry. A main course of Colorado lamb loin with Tuscan kale, black garlic, lima and cranberry beans, with cherry tomato confit, was terrifically flavorful, straightforward and clean. 
 It is nice in that dining room, quiet, and if your order goes well with the kitchen, you can have a good meal. If it doesn't, you'll be staring down a listless Wiener schnitzel, pale and greasy beneath a thick lemon-caper sauce, with too-tart applesauce. Or at dry veal tenderloin with charred onions, sweetbreads cooked as if to explain why some don't like them, sweet peaches, pickled ramps and a veal sauce run through with lovage: a meat dessert. One meal ended with a cheesecake made with blue cheese that tasted exactly like what you'd get if you mistakenly made a cheesecake with blue cheese. Your mileage may vary.
 Times are hard for Bank of America, of course, as for Conde Nast and for many of us besides. Is a fixed-price dice roll in Aureole's formal dining room worth $84? We shall see.
 In the meantime, the bulk of the business is out in the bar, which takes up much of the restaurant's space. It's loud out there, informal in the corporate sense of the word: men with their jackets off, their striped shirts shiny, their watches big, all of them eating burgers, sliders, fries, draining beer, smiling at clients, on the sell. It's a tough scene. At every table someone's either shouting or lap dancing his phone. 
 It's an extremely good hamburger, though, a big two-hander of rich beef, white Cheddar, applewood-smoked bacon and a pickled-ramp dressing that gives plain mayonnaise a run for its money. With it you'll want some of the restaurant's spectacular battered onion rings as well as an order of the papas fritas: a cone of excellent French fries beneath a shower of shredded aged Manchego, some chorizo bits and a saffron aioli that could use more garlic than those fellows eating it would ever abide. 
 There are also fantastic little pastrami pork-belly sliders with raclette, coleslaw and Russian dressing (they're even on the formal dining room menu at lunch now), three two-bite wonders that are smoky and wonderful, a funny little riff on a deli favorite. And of course Mr. Palmer's signature appetizer, the sea scallop ''sandwich,'' which Christopher Lee, Mr. Palmer's executive chef for the restaurant, who cooked at the old Oceana and received accolades for his command of Gilt, has updated with a napping of sugar snap peas, passion fruit and chives. 
 There is much to enjoy about eating hamburgers on the company dime, of course, or in eating swordfish with creamed spinach, barley and Muscat grapes, especially if you're drinking a delightful Oregon pinot noir from Domaine Serene along with it, and talking with friends. 
 But note well those grapes, and the passion fruit above. Sweetness is all over these menus. There is apple with the crab cake appetizer (and a fine horseradish dressing as well); a great deal of honey in the mustard that accompanies a deconstructed beef tartare. Fluke sashimi arrives above a tight rectangle of diced edamame, with a yuzu eggplant puree and a shallot ginger dressing that is only slightly tempered by soy. There is caramel popcorn and a funnel cake to accompany the seared foie gras.
 All of this adds up, in more ways than one, even before you get to dessert. (Yes to the caramel panna cotta and milk chocolate pudding pie.) Everything on the table fits into a diagram of sweet, sour, less sweet, unspicy, plain. 
 The restaurant is a love letter to an America we see reflected back at us in unflattering light: relatively happy, unthinking, desirous mostly of sugar and fat. That's Vegas for you. It's not New York.

HEADLINE: Revolutionary Road

BYLINE: By KARRIE JACOBS. 
Karrie Jacobs, the author of ''The Perfect $100,000 House,'' is a columnist for Metropolis Magazine.

 BODY:
WITH the unemployment rate at 10.2 percent and job creation creeping along despite increased spending on infrastructure, we should look with new eyes at a resource we've failed to take full advantage of: the Interstate highway system. 
 Much of President Obama's stimulus package has gone to maintaining our roads, and rightly so. But as we invest in the highways that accelerated suburban sprawl and deepened our addiction to oil, we should use the opportunity to invent new uses for the almost 47,000-mile long Interstate system.
 Consider it a kind of adaptive reuse: the old foundry reborn as a luxury loft building, the abandoned industrial bakery transformed into a chic urban mall. It's been a long time since we've been able to see beyond the traffic and the exhaust fumes. But if we expand the highway system's uses in anticipation of a time when we are no longer dependent on the internal combustion engine, we may also appreciate the beauty in its graceful overpasses, lofty bridges and complex cloverleaf interchanges. 
 The most obvious use for the Interstate's corridors is rail transportation. If we are going to spend billions rehabbing the highways, shouldn't we, at the same time, invest in adjacent rail lines like the 800-mile high-speed rail system voters approved last year in California
 The corridors are also perfectly suited for the transportation of energy. Power generated from rural wind farms and solar plants could run through lines buried under the highways to big cities where electricity is needed. The plug-in hybrid vehicles that will someday use the highways could charge up from this grid. And when left idling, these cars would also be able to supply power back to the grid at times of peak demand, while their owners work or shop by the roadside. 
 Instead of continuing to write off the no man's land beyond the highways -- that sprawl of gas stations, motels and fast-food restaurants -- we should look at this acreage as a resource. Cars and trucks will soon have to pollute less, and they will also make less noise. There's no reason that this land can't be transformed into urban hubs, places where people might actually want to live, work or shop, change trains or go for a stroll. 
 The highway system can't always be a ghetto for the internal combustion engine. There will be many opportunities for job creation and development once we reclaim it for ourselves.

HEADLINE: Small-Business Recovery

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''Help Small Businesses Hire Again,'' by Mark Zandi (Op-Ed, Nov. 3), is very much on target. A full and robust recovery will not take place until small businesses, the heart of job creation in our economy, start adding to their payrolls. 
 I head Gov. David A. Paterson's Small Business Task Force, which is made up of a diverse group of leaders in business and entrepreneurship, government and education. Under the governor's direction, turning the climate around to enable small businesses to flourish is our top priority. 
 To that end, New York State has doubled its financing of alternative lending institutions and quadrupled the participation of minority- and women-owned businesses in government contracting.
 We have traveled across the state to listen to the concerns of business owners and service providers. We have created an interactive guide to ease access to the more than 140 state programs that can help businesses. And next month, the task force will be providing a detailed report and recommendations on topics ranging from strategies to duplication in licensing to improving access to capital. 
 The governor convened this task force as a means of tapping into the experience and creativity of our state's business leaders. In the face of difficult economic times, he remains committed to building the potential of our state's small-business community -- a community critical to job creation and growth and leading to a statewide economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Saving New Orleans Culture, One Sandwich at a Time

BYLINE: By JOHN T. EDGE

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
 THIS month, New Orleans is having a party for the po' boy. 
 At the New Orleans Po-Boy Preservation Festival on Nov. 22, as brass bands play and celebrators hoist drinks, serious-minded panelists will tell tales of long-lost po' boy shops. They will speak of the import of this city's signature sandwich, piled with roast beef and gravy or corn-flour-breaded and fried shrimp, slathered with mayonnaise, paved with sliced pickles and sliced tomatoes, strewn with shredded lettuce, wrapped in butcher paper. 
 Cooks, from restaurants as varied as Emeril's and Jack Dempsey's, will fry, stuff, dress and wrap for what is expected to be an overflow crowd. 
 And in what organizers are calling a French Bread Fight, a combatant portraying Jared Fogle, the calorie-conscious Subway pitchman, will square off against a combatant representing John Gendusa, the baker who, in 1929, fashioned the first modern New Orleans-style, French bread loaf, the base on which po' boys have since been built. 
 If all goes the way it's planned, as fragments of crust fly and a partisan crowd shouts, Mr. Gendusa will beat Mr. Fogle with a loaf of stale bread. 
 Such sturm and staging is good fun, but the sobering thought is this: If a sandwich needs a street festival, for which press coverage has been curried and stale bread weaponized, then that sandwich might be imperiled. 
 Po' boy preservationists recognize a range of culprits, inside and outside the city limits.
 A creeping monoculture is the most frequently cited threat, exemplified by chains like Subway and Quiznos, which are making inroads south of I-10. 
 Katherine Whann, who, along with her brother Sandy Whann, operates Leidenheimer Baking Company, the city's dominant baker of po' boy bread, frames the struggle in practical as well as cultural terms. 
 ''Most po' boy shops don't have off-street parking,'' she said, from a perch at Hermes Bar in the French Quarter, as she bit into an oysters Foch po' boy, stuffed with fried oysters, smeared with pate. ''They don't have advertising budgets. They don't have Jared. But what they do have is a history in this place.''
 A problem that's more difficult -- possibly reflecting a drop in expectations set by fast-food purveyors -- is that the quality of some po' boy shops has declined. 
 Of course, many still hew to tough standards. 
 The uptown stalwart Domilise's Po-Boys, in business more than 75 years, cranks out textbook roast beef po' boys and fried oyster po' boys, cooking each batch of bivalves to order, and piling all on Leidenheimer bread, delivered twice daily. 
 At Zimmer's Seafood, a working-class market established in 1980 in the city's Gentilly neighborhood, the proprietor Charleen Zimmer buys Louisiana shrimp from her cousin. (Her husband, Craig Zimmer, works a shrimp boat, too.) 
 When a customer orders a fried shrimp po' boy, she reaches first into a bin of iced shrimp, then for a coating of corn flour. And her bread could not be fresher, for Mrs. Zimmer buys sesame-seeded loaves from her neighbor, John Gendusa Bakery. 
 But a recent tour of old-guard makers found that some paradigmatic players, like Mother's, a tourist favorite in the central business district, are not aging well.
 In suburban Metairie, Radosta Grocery, a beloved checkered-cloth joint, still cooks top rounds for roast beef po' boys. But Don Radosta, an owner, said slicing lettuce for sandwiches is now too laborious. Instead, he buys shredded iceberg, delivered in plastic-wrapped bundles. And he's not alone. 
 Preservationists rail against the lowering of standards. In response, they're setting standards of their own and, perhaps, kindling a renaissance. 
 Benjamin Wicks, proprietor of Mahony's Po-Boy Shop on Magazine Street, open since the summer of 2008, is a raver and ranter with the heart of an old-timer. He makes money selling soft-shell crab po' boys but also offers po' boys made with liver cheese, a cold-cut analogue to liverwurst, to signal his respect for the sandwich's Depression-era roots. 
 At the close of a recent lunch, Mr. Wicks, 32, a veteran of white tablecloth New Orleans restaurants like Rio Mar, sat at the back of his cottage restaurant, boasting of fried shrimp po' boys made with Louisiana shrimp and Creole tomatoes, and of grilled shrimp po' boys, shingled with fried green tomatoes and slicked with remoulade sauce. 
 He talked of how to glaze a ham with a slurry made from root beer extract so that the resulting hunk of protein tastes of both sassafras and pig. And he spoke of his reliance on the downy crumb and parchment crust of bread from Leidenheimer. 
 But he said far too many of the po' boy makers in his hometown are complacent, even lazy. He questioned the culinary patriotism of competitors who use powdered and bagged mixes for their roast beef gravy. 
 He revealed that his gravy owes its consistency to the use of a hand blender, with which he churns bits of beef chuck and vegetables into a puree. (That gravy reaches its true potential when Mr. Wicks builds a French fry po' boy, stacking hand-cut fries like cordwood inside a length of dressed loaf, before ladling on the beef.) 
 With a sense of incredulity that played just shy of cocky, Mr. Wicks asked rhetorical questions about everything from frying shrimp to dressing sandwiches, as in: ''How hard is it to keep a deep-fryer clean and full of peanut oil?'' And, ''How can people put tomatoes on their po' boys that taste like they came from McDonald's?'' And, ''Why don't people care about making great po' boys?'' 
 When he opened, Mr. Wicks joined a cadre of neo-traditionalist makers whose ranks included, among others, Jacques Leonardi of Crabby Jack's, a restaurant-cum-roadhouse on Jefferson Highway, open since 2002, famous for roasted duck po' boys. 
 Also in the mix were Wanda and Skip Walker, who earned their reputation beginning in 2001 at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, with roasted pork and coleslaw po' boys. (At Walker's Southern Style Bar-B-Que, a hutch by the Lake Pontchartrain levee, the Walkers now sell their smoked and pulled pork, tucked into a French-Vietnamese pistolette roll from the nearby Dong Phuong Oriental Bakery.) 
 And then, in late 2003, Jay Nix reopened Parkway Bakery & Tavern, a 1912 vintage bar and sandwich shop in Mid-City, where he served straightforward roast beef po' boys, crafted with an attention to detail and ingredients that tasted somehow transcendent. (He later moved on to curiosities like surf-and-turf po' boys of roast beef and fried shrimp, gobbed in roast beef gravy.) 
 Back in the summer of 2004, Katherine and Sandy Whann of Leidenheimer's attempted to forge a coalition of neo-traditionalists and quality-focused old-guard po' boy makers, a cadre with the common goal of elevating the ''status of the po' boy sandwich in and around New Orleans as a delicious and nutritious cultural treasure.''
 The Whanns called meetings. They conceived a New Orleans Po-Boy Preservation Society. They talked of a festival. They spoke of co-op marketing. 
 They talked of proving that po' boys were healthier than fast food. (Recently, Leidenheimer financed a nutritional analysis that Katherine Whann said found that a gravy-dressed roast beef po' boy, on Leidenheimer bread, with mustard, lettuce, tomato and pickles, has fewer calories from fat and less saturated fat than a comparable tuna sandwich from Subway.)
 The hope had always been that future generations of New Orleanians would reject -- on economic, cultural and gastronomic grounds -- fast-food simulacra of their totemic sandwich. 
 ''I know, for a bread baker, it seems an act of self-preservation,'' said Katherine Whann. ''But it's also about pride in place.'' 
 Then came the levee failures and the flooding that followed Hurricane Katrina. Bakeries and po' boy shops struggled mightily to get back in business. By 2007, the Oak Street Association had taken up the Po-Boy Preservation Festival idea. In November of that year, they staged the first one, in the Carrollton neighborhood of New Orleans. 
 Crowds thronged the streets. Leidenheimer threw in support. Momentum continued to build. And so did the emotional tempo, leading -- as shots follow beers in a French Quarter dive bar -- to plans for the forthcoming French Bread Fight. 
 Revivalists, in church or on Broadway, know the need for an unexpurgated text revealing new truths. That's where Michael Mizell-Nelson, a University of New Orleans historian, came in. 
 Researching a violent 1929 streetcar strike, during which 1,100 members of the Amalgamated Association of Electric Street Railway Employees walked off their jobs, Dr. Mizell-Nelson confirmed how the sandwiches acquired their name and their form. 
 Similar sandwiches existed before the strike, Dr. Mizell-Nelson learned. And the term ''poor boy'' was already in use, applied to, among other groups, orphaned children. 
 But in 1929 a sandwich called the poor boy was something new. Fashioned to be wider, to accommodate generous and equitable slices from a loaf, the bread was first baked by John Gendusa at the request of the New Orleans restaurateurs Bennie and Clovis Martin. (Today, Jason Gendusa, great-grandson of the founder, still works the ovens at John Gendusa Bakery, playing a feisty David to the Goliath that is Leidenheimer.) 
 The Martins were onetime streetcar workers who, at the height of the strike, pledged to feed their former colleagues at their sandwich and coffee stand. ''Whenever we saw one of the striking men coming,'' Bennie Martin later recalled, ''one of us would say, 'Here comes another poor boy.' '' 
 Over time, by way of various elisions, both vernacular and purposeful, po' boy or po-boy became the widely accepted renderings of poor boy. In the process, as vowels and consonants were swallowed, the roots of the sandwich were, too. 
 ''I can't imagine there's another American food item that owes its birth to labor violence,'' Dr. Mizell-Nelson said. ''That's the forgotten story.'' 
 Dr. Mizell-Nelson believes in the power of public history. He believes that if people know their history, they're likely to be better stewards of their present. 
 But if the Po-Boy Preservation Festival fails to compel New Orleanians to take action to preserve their legacy, he's willing to take other steps. 
 Radicalized by his study of the strike, Dr. Mizell-Nelson envisions ''civil disobedience bread actions'' wherein po' boy devotees target chain restaurants, ''arm customers with loaves'' and demand they serve their sandwiches on po' boy bread, with its velvet interior, its crepitant exterior, its only-in-New-Orleans back story.
 A tack like that may not be a typical professor's path to tenure. But it might win the French Bread Fight. 
 Recipe: Mahony's Beef Po' Boys Adapted from Benjamin Wicks Time: 3 hours 45 minutes
 Adapted from Benjamin Wicks
 Time: 3 hours 45 minutes
 1 cup all-purpose flour
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 7pounds beef chuck roll, sliced into 2-inch-thick portions
 1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed
 6 to 7 stalks celery, cut into 3/4-inch dice
 2 yellow onions, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch dice
 2 green bell peppers, cored and cut into 3/4-inch dice
 2 jumbo carrots, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch dice
 1 cup peeled garlic cloves, each clove halved lengthwise
 7 cups dry red wine
 2 tablespoons dried rosemary
 2 tablespoons dried thyme
 1 bay leaf
 1/3 cup chopped parsley leaves
 5 loaves French or Italian bread
 Mayonnaise, shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes and sliced pickles to dress sandwiches.
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place flour in a large, wide bowl and season generously with salt and pepper. Add beef, dust well on all sides and shake off excess.
 2. Place a large, heavy Dutch oven or roasting pan with a lid over medium-high heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom and heat until shimmering. Working in batches, add beef and sear well on all sides. Transfer beef to a platter and set aside.
 3. Add celery, onions, peppers, carrots and garlic to pan; if necessary, add more oil. Saute until vegetables are tender and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Add wine and 3 cups water. Stir, scraping the bottom of the pan. Add rosemary, thyme, bay leaf and parsley. Stir well, add beef, and stir again to mix well.
 4. Cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until beef is very tender, about three hours. Transfer beef to a deep platter and keep warm. Remove and discard bay leaf. Using a hand-held immersion blender or stand blender, puree vegetables and any remaining bits of meat in pan juices to make sauce. Cut beef into slices. Slice each bread loaf in half lengthwise and crosswise, spread one side with mayonnaise, thickly layer in meat, wet with gravy, and top with lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.
 Yield: Enough for 10 sandwiches.
 Note: Extra beef and sauce can be refrigerated or frozen.

HEADLINE: Trustee's Art on His Museum's Walls Raises Flag

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG and ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
One day in the mid-1980s, Dakis Joannou, a Greek Cypriot industrialist, was exploring the art galleries of the East Village in Manhattan when he came upon a basketball suspended in a tank of liquid. Captivated, he invested $2,700 in ''One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank'' by a little-known artist named Jeff Koons. It was, he said, as if a whole new world had opened up to him.
 Twenty-five years -- and 40 Koonses -- later, Mr. Joannou is considered one of the most important contemporary art collectors in the world. And the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan is preparing to showcase his vast collection in a three-story exhibition, with Mr. Koons, now an art superstar, as the guest curator.
 The show, slated to open in March, is generating anticipatory chatter in the art world. But it is also leading to buzz of a different kind, about the propriety of turning over a public museum to a private collector who also happens to be a museum trustee and a chief patron of the curator. 
 Private collection shows appeal to many art museums because they can display great works that are otherwise inaccessible. Over the last decade, though, as prices rose in the art market, the museum industry came to believe that such shows required extra vigilance about potential conflicts of interest. In this case, critics say the New Museum, which in its 32-year history has evolved from a scrappy alternative space into a mainstream institution, is jeopardizing its integrity by giving too much power to a board member with a vested interest in the artists he collects. 
 ''Maybe it is a fantastic collection, but the museum is a public trust: nonprofit, tax exempt and government supported,'' said Noah Kupferman, a former specialist at Sotheby's who teaches a course called Fine Art as a Financial Asset at New York University. ''It is supposed to be an independent arbiter of taste and art-historical value. It is not supposed to surrender itself to a trustee and donor whose collection stands to be enhanced in value by a major museum show.''
 As the New Museum sees it, exhibiting Mr. Joannou's collection, which has never been shown in the United States, is a gift to the public, providing a creative model for public-private partnerships in difficult economic times.
 ''We think the public will be the beneficiaries of Dakis's very generous agreement to allow works from his foundation to cross the ocean,'' said Lisa Phillips, the New Museum's director, referring to Mr. Joannou's Deste Foundation Center for Contemporary Art in Athens. 
 ''I understand why some people might consider it a perceived conflict,'' she continued. ''But we're confident that the initiative is artistically and intellectually important and ethically legitimate, consistent with our mission and our vision.'' 
 Mr. Joannou dismissed concerns. Speaking by phone from his home in Athens, he said: ''Sure, I am a trustee. Would it be different if I weren't? Some people may think some things. For me, it's a nonissue. I know who I am and what I am doing.''
 Museums have always depended on collectors for loans and donations, and some have a long history of exhibiting private collections. But a decade ago, ''Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection'' at the Brooklyn Museum prompted an ethical debate.
 ''Sensation'' is best remembered as a battle from the culture wars, in which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani denounced as ''sick stuff'' artwork like Chris Ofili's ''Holy Virgin Mary'' with its appended elephant dung. But because the collection's owner, the advertising mogul Charles Saatchi, was an active trader in the contemporary art market, ''Sensation'' also heightened concerns about museums renting out their reputations, being manipulated by collectors or ''acting more like commercial galleries,'' said Erik Ledbetter, director of international programs and ethics at the American Association of Museums.
 This prompted the association, which accredits but does not regulate museums, to issue guidelines for exhibiting borrowed objects, stressing ''transparency, intellectual integrity and institutional control,'' Mr. Ledbetter said. While the New Museum is not accredited by the association, all museums are considered to be bound by its standards.
 The guidelines stress the potential for conflicts if board members become lenders, Mr. Ledbetter said. He offered these ''cautionary flags'': a show devoted to one collector; a show in which the collector is a board member, donor or underwriter; a show in which the museum gives away or pools curatorial judgment with the collector.
 ''Any one of those things can be managed,'' he said, ''but when you layer them on top of each other, it's more complicated.''
 The New Museum show raises all the association's cautionary flags except one: Mr. Joannou is not underwriting the exhibition.
 In a phone interview that she limited to 20 minutes, Ms. Phillips expressed exasperation that the museum was being challenged. Several art world blogs, especially Tyler Green's well-read Modern Art Notes, have been critical. 
 ''We're not the first to do an exhibition of a private collection, and we won't be the last,'' she said.
 There are abundant recent examples of private collection shows at American museums, but none that involve both a trustee and a guest curator close to the trustee. 
 This year alone, the Brooklyn Museum, which was showing private collections decades before ''Sensation,'' gave over a gallery -- and curatorial control -- to works by Hernan Bas, a young Miami artist, from the Rubell Family Collection. (The Rubells are not affiliated with the museum). The Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited Old Master drawings from the collection of its trustee Jean Bonna, although it organized the show itself. 
 And the National Gallery of Art, using its own curator, is now showing modern art from the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Collection; in this case, all the works have been donated or promised to the museum.
 That is what many institutions, like the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of Art, require to deal with potential conflict: a gift. ''The minute you enter into a relationship with a private collection, you have to make sure that it's in ink that the stuff is coming to you,'' said Maxwell Anderson, director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
 The New Museum does not maintain a permanent collection, and is therefore not positioned to receive gifts.
 Some museums ask the lender to sign an agreement promising a moratorium on sales so that art is not whisked straight from museum walls to an auction block. Ms. Phillips said Mr. Joannou ''is aware that the museum has a policy of not exhibiting work from a trustee if they are intending to sell.'' Further, she said, Mr. Joannou buys much more than he sells. 
 The selection of Mr. Koons as curator, Ms. Phillips said, was ''the resounding choice'' of the museum's curators, partly because he has been ''engaged in conversation and debate with Dakis'' for the last 25 years.
 Mr. Joannou's rise as a collector paralleled Mr. Koons's as an artist. Mr. Joannou became not only Mr. Koons's patron, acquiring such trophy works as a giant balloon dog and a stainless steel train filled with bourbon, but also his close friend. Mr. Joannou, 69, served as best man at Mr. Koons's first wedding and is godfather to his son. Mr. Koons, 54, designed the exterior of Mr. Joannou's yacht, ''Guilty,'' and created a giant wedding cake for his daughter.
 ''I am extremely, extremely curious to see how Jeff will deal with the work of his peers -- and of his own,'' Mr. Joannou said of the coming exhibition.
 Dan Cameron, a former New Museum curator who is now artistic director of the Prospect New Orleans art biennial, said the choice of Mr. Koons made him uncomfortable. ''I am a big fan of Jeff's,'' he said, ''but he is not a fair or impartial or even interesting interpreter of what Dakis does.'' 
 An assistant to Mr. Koons said he was too busy to talk to a reporter.
 Mr. Joannou, the chairman of an international construction firm, has more than 1,000 pieces in his collection with concentrations of works by Mr. Ofili, Maurizio Cattelan, Urs Fischer, Robert Gober, Kiki Smith and others. His collection, periodically exhibited at his Athens foundation, has been shown in Paris and Vienna. 
 In discussing the New Museum show, several museum leaders cautioned against what Thomas Campbell, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described as ''overly puritanical'' judgments about ''the delicate dance'' between museums and collectors.
 ''The Met wouldn't be the Met -- the Met wouldn't have the collections it has -- if it hadn't been for private collectors,'' he said.
 And several figures in the art world defended, and applauded, the New Museum for its Joannou show. Amy Cappellazzo, the international co-head for postwar and contemporary art at Christie's, called Mr. Joannou a ''collector of record and a tastemaker'' with a ''fantastic collection that will bring back to New York a lot of things that haven't been seen here in decades.''
 Richard Armstrong, the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, agreed. ''I think it's useful for the entire food chain of the contemporary art world that private collections go on view -- and if they become more valuable in the process, that doesn't hurt anyone.'' 
 Art business experts expressed no doubt that a museum show enhances the art's value --regardless of whether it is taken right to market. ''Showing at a museum gives credence to the works a collector has assembled and does add value to the asset,'' said John Arena, senior vice president in custom credit at U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management.
 Contemporary art, in particular, can benefit from a museum's stamp of approval. ''When contemporary art comes into a collection, it is still wet,'' said Mr. Kupferman of N.Y.U., who also works in the financial sector. ''It has not withstood the test of time. In financial terms, an Old Master is kind of like a utility stock. Contemporary art is like a dot-com. It can lose its value -- poof.''
 Marcia Tucker, a former curator at the Whitney, founded the New Museum in 1977 as a laboratory for emerging and under-recognized artists. Ms. Phillips took the reins in 1999, and over the last decade, the museum, whose succinct mission is ''new art, new ideas,'' has grown considerably in ambition, profile and attendance. 
 Two years ago, Ms. Phillips oversaw the museum's move into its new $48 million home on the Bowery at Prince Street, where each nook and cranny has a sponsor (the Ruth E. Horowitz stairs, the Jerome L. and Ellen Stern restrooms), as does Ms. Phillips herself (the Toby Devan Lewis director).
 Mr. Cameron said he believed the new building signaled a ''dramatically different direction,'' more mainstream and aligned with the art market. Its exhibition schedule increasingly features artists who are already established on the contemporary art scene, and the museum's critics consider it to be overly enmeshed in what can seem like a dizzyingly insular circle of art world insiders.

HEADLINE: American Wages Out of Balance

BYLINE: By EDWARD HADAS, MARTIN HUTCHINSON and ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
American workers are overpaid, relative to equally productive employees elsewhere doing the same work. If the global economy is to get into balance, that gap must close. 
 Of course, workers in the United States should earn more than their peers in China, Moldova or Vietnam. Americans take advantage of the higher productivity that makes their country rich: better education and infrastructure, abundant capital and a strong work ethic. But how much higher should American wages be? 
 The answer depends in large part on two measures: the difference in productivity in making goods that can be traded across borders, and the quantity of such goods. Both measures point to a narrowing wage gap. 
 Many factors are raising productivity in poor countries. Fast development, cheap capital and more efficient shipping all help. Cheap communication via the Internet reduces costs and makes it easy to trade many more goods and especially services. 
 The global wage gap has been narrowing, but recent labor market statistics in the United States suggest the adjustment has not gone far enough. 
 One indicator is unemployment, which has risen unexpectedly rapidly. The 7.3 million jobs lost are more than triple the 2 million during the 1980-82 recession. Some of that huge increase reflects the sharp decline in gross domestic product, but there could be another factor: the recession shows that many workers are paid more than they're worth. Another possible sign is the huge surge in reported productivity, which has begun while output is declining. That suggests that some production is being outsourced, often to lower-paid foreign workers. 
 The big trade deficit is another sign of excessive pay for Americans. One explanation for the attractive prices of imported goods is that American workers are paid too much relative to their foreign peers. 
 Global wage convergence is great for the poor but tough on the overpaid. It's possible to run the numbers to show that American manufacturing workers should take average real wage cuts of as much as 20 percent to get into global balance. 
 The required cut may be smaller. But if American wages get stuck above global market-clearing levels, as in the 1930s, the result could well be something approaching Depression-era levels of unemployment. 
 Anything would be better than that. Both moderate inflation to cut real wages and a further drop in the dollar's real trade-weighted value might be acceptable. 
 Incompetence Is Legal
 The case against two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, was the closest anything came to a trial over Wall Street's role in the financial crisis. Their acquittal suggests that blame is not easily apportioned -- and that mistakes, not conspiracies, offer the more likely explanation.
 The men typified the credit crisis. They ran hedge funds packed with subprime mortgage bonds and collateralized debt obligations, one of which was cranked up on leverage. Their collapse in mid-2007 precipitated a crisis of confidence about how to price these opaque instruments that, combined with deteriorating house prices, rapidly led to multibillion-dollar write-downs at financial institutions worldwide.
 Snippets of their e-mail exchanges released last year by the authorities implied that the two knew the market was doomed and purposefully lied to investors about it. The messages also indicate that Mr. Cioffi had even taken his own money out before the crash. 
 But the jury agreed with the defense that they were in fact just debating the state of the market while trying to save the funds. As for Mr. Cioffi's cash, that went straight into another fund he ran to meet investor demands that he have some skin in the game.
 Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive at Lehman Brokers, also kept his stake in the firm as it hurtled toward bankruptcy. So did the former leaders of Bear Stearns, Alan Schwartz and Jimmy Cayne. 
 There's little doubt they were guilty of excessive optimism -- even of downright incompetence. But as the exoneration of Mr. Tannin and Mr. Cioffi appears to make clear, neither is yet a crime.

HEADLINE: Historic Sounds of Newport, Newly Online

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
As the future of the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals continues to unfold, its recorded past has suddenly been thrown open. 
 Recently the festivals themselves almost disappeared, amid the financial collapse of their producing company, the Festival Network LLC. They returned last summer in a new guise, at their usual site, once George Wein, the founder of both festivals, regained the right to hold music events there. 
 It's a complicated story. But if you want to know why the Newport Jazz Festival has been so important to American music, it's easy: you just have to hear the recorded evidence. Bits and pieces have emerged over the years, in live recordings by Ellington, Coltrane and others. Now Wolfgang's Vault, the online concert-recording archive, intends to fill in the gaps. 
 The company, based in San Francisco, bought the archives of the Newport festivals from the Festival Network last year. Bill Sagan, founder and chief executive of Wolfgang's Vault, says the archives include many, many tapes: 1,000 to 1,200 individual performances, dating at least to 1955, the festival's second year, and continuing to the end of the century. It is not a complete audio record -- certain years contain only a small number of performances, or are missing completely -- but it is a major one nonetheless.
 Since the purchase, Wolfgang's Vault has spent almost $5 million, Mr. Sagan said, on making audio transfers and mixes of the tapes. (Neither Mr. Sagan nor Chris Shields of the Festival Network would reveal the amount spent on acquiring the archive itself.) On Wednesday the company will begin posting free streams of a handful of performances from the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival, at wolfgangsvault.com: the first offerings include Count Basie, Dakota Staton and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. By next Tuesday, when more are added, there will be 27 sets from that year's jazz festival, including some by Ahmad Jamal, Joe Williams, Thelonious Monk and Horace Silver. The plan is to have hundreds more online in the coming months, from other years of Newport Jazz and from the Newport Folk Festival as well. 
 For jazz fans, this is serious business. There are chillingly good performances in the 1959 crop, from half-inch three-track tapes mixed for stereo, made with stage microphones that pick up the nuances of the drums and the growls of the band members. They're strong enough in some cases to deepen our understanding of canonical artists, like Basie, or restore the reputation of nearly forgotten ones, like Staton. (The concerts can also be downloaded for $10 to $13 in higher-quality audio.) 
 Projects of this kind have in the past been plagued by questions involving copyright. When Mr. Sagan bought the archive of Bill Graham Presents six years ago, there was a lawsuit from performers and record labels, but it was eventually dismissed. 
 Mr. Sagan said he had done due diligence regarding copyrights with the Newport material and is paying the performers or their estates a generous royalty rate. 
 But there is uncertainty over who made the recordings. Mr. Sagan's contract with the Festival Network says that Mr. Wein made the tapes and originally owned both the tapes and rights to them. Mr. Wein, for his part, says he never made recordings until much later. 
 ''I never made tapes back then,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''I was never an archive person, either. I just didn't pay any attention to it.'' Speaking of the rights, he added, ''If the tapes are from the '50s, chances are they were owned by record companies.'' 
 Fifty years ago, according to the jazz historian Phil Schaap, only record companies were generally willing to lug high-quality gear to a concert site. (It's fair to assume, also, that the 1959 tapes were not made by the Voice of America, which did record a great deal of the festival, but made its tapes in mono.) Mr. Sagan said his agreement with the Festival Network is specific on the subject of the recordings. ''In the agreement,'' he said, ''Festival Network represents that they or a predecessor company recorded these recordings. They secondarily represented that they owned these recordings, and they thirdly represented that they owned the intellectual property and copyrights to these recordings. And when they made those representations, George Wein was an employee of the company.'' Mr. Shields, chief executive of the Festival Network, was unavailable for comment on Tuesday. Meanwhile, we have great and vivid jazz: Staton's blue wails; the gruff, excited shouts of the Basie band's brass section during an aggressive solo by the trombonist Al Grey; the masterful attack-and-release of the Ahmad Jamal trio on ''Poinciana.'' 
 Enjoy it while you can.

HEADLINE: Calming the Black Friday Crowds

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
A year after an unruly crowd trampled a worker to death at a Wal-Mart store, the nation's retailers are preparing for another Black Friday, the blockbuster shopping day after Thanksgiving. Along with offering $300 laptops and $99 navigation devices, stores are planning new safety measures to make sure the festive day does not take another deadly turn.
 Last year, frenzied shoppers at a Wal-Mart in Valley Stream, N.Y., trampled Jdimytai Damour, a temporary store worker who died soon afterward. To prevent any repeat, Wal-Mart has sharply changed how it intends to manage the crowds. 
 That new plan, developed by experts who have wrangled throngs at events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics, will affect how customers approach and enter the stores, shop, check out and exit. Each store will have its own customized plan. The hope is for an orderly Black Friday, a seemingly incongruous notion.
 The most significant change at Wal-Mart is that the majority of its discount stores (as opposed to its Supercenters) will open Thanksgiving morning at 6 a.m. and stay open through Friday evening. Last year, those stores closed Thanksgiving evening and reopened early Friday morning. By keeping the stores open for 24 hours, Wal-Mart is hoping for a steady flow of shoppers instead of mammoth crowds swelling outside its stores in the wee hours of Friday. 
 In another new twist this year, shoppers at Wal-Mart will not have to sprint toward a pile of flat-screen televisions and scuffle with one another to get one. Rather, customers will be able to enter the store at any time and line up at merchandise displays for the must-have items on their lists. When the products go on sale Friday at 5 a.m., workers will supervise the lines, giving shoppers the merchandise in the order in which they joined the line -- until the goods are out of stock. 
 (Only a small percentage of stores will not be open 24 hours; most Wal-Mart Supercenters are already open 24 hours.)
 Another problem in the past was the bottleneck at store entrances. Like many big-box retailers, Wal-Mart does not have multiple entrances and exits to spread around customer traffic. So this year the chain will put workers in front of its stores to direct customers and keep them moving. 
 ''We are committed to looking for ways to make our stores even safer for our customers and associates this holiday season,'' said David Tovar, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, adding that the retailer was ''confident our customers can look forward to a safe and enjoyable shopping experience at Wal-Mart.''
 Aggressive shoppers are common the day after Thanksgiving. So crowd control plans, which vary by retailer, are critical. And they are especially important now, given the economy. Newly frugal consumers want more for less, and stores plan to drum up sales with stunning deals. 
 This year, for the first time, the National Retail Federation created a comprehensive set of guidelines for crowd control at stores. The guidelines note that special markdowns and historically low discounts have led to larger crowds.
 ''Retailers are very much trying to make themselves stand out in an environment like this,'' Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for the industry group, said in a conference call this week. But she added that ''retailers need to understand that many of these sales and promotional periods might draw customers who are more insistent about getting a good deal.''
 The federation said retailers were performing dress rehearsals with their employees. Some stores plan to serve drinks to shoppers, or offer entertainment while they are in line, to maintain calm. Also, the stores say that creating a rapport with customers makes news of sellouts and long lines more palatable.
 Indeed, Peter Conway, general manager of a Best Buy in Westbury, N.Y., has made a habit of arriving at his store at 7 p.m. Thanksgiving night to chat with shoppers lined up outside. 
 ''I'm outside talking with my customers, just getting to know them, seeing what they're there for,'' he said. ''I'm very clear with them: 'There's not going to be any running.' ''
 For years, Best Buy has controlled crowds by sending teams of workers into the parking lots to dole out tickets for its so-called door-busters -- hot items like digital cameras and laptops at exceedingly low prices. Tickets are given out about 3 a.m. and each customer is allowed one ticket for each door-buster item they intend to buy.
 ''They know if they have a ticket, they're guaranteed they have that product,'' Mr. Conway said. ''It creates ease of mind.''
 To keep shoppers from running aimlessly around its stores, Best Buy employees hand out maps, and they mark popular items with colored balloons that can be seen from anywhere in the store.
 Many retailers, including Kohl's and Toys ''R'' Us, said they were not changing their crowd management plans because they had not had problems. 
 After the death of Mr. Damour, Wal-Mart settled a case with the district attorney of Nassau County in New York. Wal-Mart agreed to create a $400,000 compensation fund, give $1.5 million to social service programs, and offer 50 jobs to area high school students each year for three years.
 Rhett Asher, the National Retail Federation's senior asset protection adviser, said during a conference call that big box stores and mall stores had different security issues. Malls are more bustling, public places with multiple entrances -- so there tend to be fewer problems. Indeed, crowd control is not as much of an issue for Macy's as it is for big-box stores, a spokesman said, because multiple entrances serve to disperse crowds.
 Still, retailers of all sorts are making preparations. In just the last month, crowds of deal-hungry shoppers have created problems. In one instance, Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic said on Twitter that he would give away copies of his NBA Live 2010 basketball video game to the first five people who showed up at a particular GameStop store. Chaos ensued. Also last month, a woman at a Burlington Coat Factory store in Ohio said she had won the lottery and would treat her fellow shoppers to new clothes. When it turned out she was lying, a riot broke out. 
 ''No matter how seamless and airtight you think this is,'' Ms. Davis said of retailers' plans, ''the unexpected can happen.''

HEADLINE: Lloyds to Cut 5,000 Jobs; HSBC Says Profit Improved

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The Lloyds Banking Group, the British lender bailed out by the government, said on Tuesday that it would cut 5,000 jobs in its insurance, retail and administration departments by the end of next year.
 The bank, which had already announced the elimination of about 8,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, said it expected about half of the latest cuts to be among contractors and temporary staff.
 Lloyds is continuing to integrate HBOS into its operations after the government brokered the ailing bank's takeover by Lloyds. 
 At the same time, conditions in the British retail banking market remain challenging.
 ''As long as labor markets continue to deteriorate, there is more risk for banks because of potential mortgage and credit card defaults,'' said Andrew Popper, chief investment officer at SG Hambros Bank in London. 
 In separate announcements Tuesday, HSBC and Barclays said it was too early to announce a recovery of the retail banking market. Barclays said its profit for the third quarter fell to $:1.08 billion ($1.8 billion), down 54 percent from a year ago, because of steeper charges for losses on loans.
 In contrast, HSBC, which has a much smaller exposure to the British retail market than its two rivals, said profit for the quarter was ''significantly ahead'' of the year-earlier period and loan-loss provisions declined. The bank will release detailed figures when it reports its six-month and full-year results in March.
 ''I believe that the biggest jolt has now passed through the global economy,'' the HSBC chief executive, Michael Geoghegan, said in a statement. ''But it is too early to claim victory, especially while unemployment is still rising in the West.''
 Mr. Geoghegan, who recently moved to Hong Kong from London as HSBC focuses on expanding its footprint in Asia, went on to predict a ''two-speed recovery'' in which emerging markets would lead economic growth. HSBC generates almost half of its revenue in Asia and benefited from its exposure to emerging markets during the recession. That more than compensated for difficult conditions in Europe and the United States.
 Barclays -- which, like HSBC, avoided a government bailout last year -- said there had been some encouraging signs from the economy but that write-offs for bad loans would remain high at least until the end of the year. The $10.37 billion in write-offs Barclays took over the last three quarters was ''significantly above'' the figure for the same period a year earlier, the bank said.
 Write-offs could peak toward the end of the year or the beginning of next year, about three months earlier than previously predicted, Barclays said. Write-offs for the full year are expected to be at the bottom of the range of $15 billion to $16 billion the bank previously announced, Barclays said. 
 HSBC investors had been growing increasingly concerned about the bank's consumer finance business in the United States, where loan-loss charges had ballooned. But HSBC said Tuesday that charges for bad loans at the business were ''encouragingly lower'' in the third quarter than in the first half of the year.
 Barclays has expanded its securities business, which helped offset rising loan-loss provisions at its retail bank during the most recent quarter. It stepped up the hiring of bankers in Europe and Asia after its acquisition of the assets of Lehman Brothers in the United States. 
 More recently, the bank also added to its retail unit. It agreed to buy Standard Life's banking assets in October to expand its savings and mortgage business in Britain. In a management shuffle last week, the bank moved its commercial banking operations closer to that of the investment bank so it could sell more products across the divisions. Robert E. Diamond Jr., the president of Barclays who is in charge of its investment banking operations, also gained control of commercial banking.
 Barclays said on Tuesday that it would continue to look for takeover opportunities in Spain, Portugal and Italy to expand its retail banking franchise.
 Barclays said pretax profit in investment banking and investment management fell 38 percent, to $:1.97 billion, in the first nine months of the year, from $:3.15 billion in the period last year.

HEADLINE: A Cheap Nest for Fledgling Firms

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
When Lindsay Napor expanded her Manhattan-based development company earlier this year -- moving out of free work space provided by an investor -- she turned to the most logical place for the company's new offices: New Jersey.
 ''We were planning on moving out of New York,'' Ms. Napor said, ''because to go from nothing to standard New York rents would have been a nonstarter for us.'' 
 The company, called Ecological, which specializes in sustainable construction, had four employees, but planned to add 35 to 40 people in two years. ''We were actually looking at space in Newark, because it was easy to get to for most people, and much cheaper,'' she said.
 Then, Ms. Napor heard an announcement during a Yankees game that changed the course of her business career. She learned that the city was soliciting fledgling companies for a new program that provided cheap office space in a business incubator.
 Since June, Ms. Napor and other Ecological employees -- now numbering a dozen -- have worked out of two offices and 10 cubicles at 160 Varick Street at Vandam Street in SoHo. 
 Ecological pays about $4,000 a month in rent -- or about one-quarter of what the company would have paid in Newark. ''This has allowed us to focus on growing the business rather than on how to afford our rent,'' she said, ''enabling us to hire more people more quickly to get the business off the ground quicker.''
 The 16,500-square-foot incubator, using one floor of the Varick Street building, serves 27 fledgling companies -- 22 housed in the space and five companies with offices elsewhere that use its services, including a receptionist, meeting rooms and a mailing address. These companies are in a range of businesses, including information technology, communications, real estate development, fashion and film.
 The incubator space is being provided at cost by Trinity Real Estate, and it is leased and managed by the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, the college's school of technology. Polytechnic pays only maintenance and operations costs. It, in turn, covers its expenditures through the rents it charges the companies in the buildings.
 Seth W. Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the city's business development arm, said the economic recession had offered the perfect opportunity for the city to initiate the incubator, using $100,000 in seed money. Three more incubators in other sections of Manhattan, including one for the food industry and one for fashion, are to open soon, and a handful are in the planning stages in other boroughs.
 Bruce Niswander, the director of New York University's Office of Innovation Development, is in charge of running the incubator. He said a number of students from N.Y.U. and other universities work at companies there. They are paid by the university, and the companies are billed for the students' hourly services.
 ''Small businesses typically have a difficult time hiring full-time people, so this arrangement eliminates that problem,'' Mr. Niswander said. ''It gives the businesses access to extreme talent that they otherwise wouldn't have, and for the students, it's a much-needed type of training and education outside the classroom.''
 Mr. Niswander is not an unabashed advocate of incubators. Many, he said, fail to realize their goal of enabling companies to grow and thrive. ''You can go to a lot of incubators, and if it's not done properly -- if it's just real estate -- the tenants have been there four, five, six years,'' he said. 
 At 160 Varick, fledgling companies are allowed to lease space in blocks of no more than six months, and these leases are renewed only if the businesses meet agreed-upon targets.
 Another key for a successful incubator is to choose companies ripe for growth, Mr. Niswander said. The Manhattan venture selected only 27 of more than 300 applicants. The goal is for those companies to move into the wider marketplace in 18 months.
 ''We pick companies specifically for their potential to add employees,'' he said. ''Adding employees means you quickly have more need for space than you've got room for here. If you get funded for that growth, then you're on your way, and you really don't need this environment.''
 The incubator also offers training seminars for business owners, as well as networking opportunities with venture capital sources and potential clients to nudge companies along, said Micah Kotch, operations director with N.Y.U.'s Office of Innovation Development.
 ''We don't want to be competing with commercial office space providers,'' Mr. Kotch said. ''Our mission is to help a company here find a market for their product.''
 Some companies may end up modifying their product or service. For example, rather than initiating new development, Ecological now primarily serves as an outsourced sustainability department for the owners of real estate portfolios, Ms. Napor said. One client is the Hampshire Real Estate Companies, which owns and operates 259 properties.
 ''Using the knowledge we have in sustainability, we can help building owners as a strategy in their portfolio to increase the value of those assets,'' she said.
 Exploiting that niche, Ecological has landed $2 million from investors, which will help finance a future move, Ms. Napor said. Ecological is beginning negotiations with Trinity Real Estate about taking office space in one of its market-rate buildings.
 Carl Weisbrod, Trinity's president, said his company offered the three-year lease for the incubator after a lease fell through, but also in the hope of creating opportunities for New York City businesses.
 ''It's not only in the interests of the city of New York, but clearly in the interests of real estate owners generally,'' Mr. Weisbrod said. ''We like to see businesses grow in the city and occupy more and more space.''
 David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the city hoped to end its participation eventually, after the incubator survived beyond its three-year lease at 160 Varick.
 ''Ideally, we would prove that the model is sustainable and wouldn't need city involvement at a certain point,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Making the Face of Modernism Familiar

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
The architect Eero Saarinen was often knocked for being the equivalent of a talented P.R. man. And on the surface at least, few architects did more to glamorize postwar corporate America. General Motors, I.B.M., CBS -- all eventually came knocking at his door. His architecture offered them the veneer of a supremely confident, progressive America, with all the roughness smoothed away. It made it easier to forget about those Soviet warheads and mushroom clouds.
 The curves and glossy surfaces are as seductive as ever in ''Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future,'' which opened at the Museum of the City of New York on Tuesday. But the story it tells is more conflicted. 
 Organized by Donald Albrecht, the museum's curator of architecture and design, the show carefully peels back some of the gloss to reveal the anxieties and contradictions buried underneath. As Saarinen tinkers with his symbolic language, he also mines deeper architectural veins. Eventually even the hardened skeptic is forced to accept that his buildings can be both sophisticated works of propaganda and gorgeous -- and humane -- architectural creations.
 The show begins by establishing Saarinen's cosmopolitan credentials: a cultivated childhood in Finland with forward-thinking artistic parents; classical training as a sculptor in Paris; a stint in the office of the industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes; the early partnership in suburban Detroit with his father, Eliel, a Modernist who had emigrated to America in 1923.
 The younger Saarinen came to prominence just as the United States was emerging as a superpower and searching for ways to express its newfound economic prosperity. He was part of a generation of architects that sought to propel Modernism from the margins into the mainstream, making it acceptable to ordinary Americans.
 Some of his early projects demonstrate the depth of that challenge. A model of a 1939 design for the proposed Smithsonian Gallery of Art in Washington, a composition of low marble forms arranged along a reflecting pool, oozes civic confidence. But the project was rejected by the public: Congress refused to finance it, with opponents contending that it was too modern and clashed with John Russell Pope's neo-Classical National Gallery of Art, which had just opened across the Mall.
 By the time you enter the next gallery, and the 1950s, corporate America had come to realize that architecture could serve as a valuable public relations tool, and the work of Saarinen and his Modernist allies had become part of popular culture. There's a picture of Saarinen on the cover of Time magazine and a spread in Vogue (written by his fashionable wife, Aline). In another room an advertisement shows a rosy-cheeked Santa sitting in a form-fitting Saarinen chair with a bottle of Coke -- a benign picture of the McCarthy era. Such images reinforce Saarinen's image as a propagandist for establishment America. And many of his commissions -- the corporate headquarters and suburban office parks -- reinforced the sweeping shifts that reflected the dark side of the postwar era: the racial tensions and white flight, the excesses of the consumer culture, the suburban isolation.
 Yet Saarinen cannot simply be dismissed as a capitalist cheerleader. His designs, which became increasingly flamboyant over the years, were an effort to tap into the technical innovation and visual freedom he found in American industrial design as well as an early break with the doctrine that form follows function. The crisp glass facades of his General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Mich., the first of a series of suburban office parks he completed in the 1950s, were held in place with an aluminum frame and neoprene seals that came straight from windshield design. And although Mies van der Rohe could have designed the taut facades of the I.B.M. Manufacturing and Training Facility in Rochester, Minn., he would have probably abhorred the sparkling blue panels of the exterior.
 Similarly, the contoured forms of the furniture he created for the office of General Motors' chief designer, Harley Earl (shown here in a dreamy composition of sinuous lines that hints at the expressionism of his later work) resemble streamlined car dashboards.
 That freedom eventually found its greatest expression in buildings that concerned mobility, like New York's TWA Terminal and the Dulles International Airport Terminal. The TWA Terminal, in particular, was seen as a betrayal of the belief that form should express structure. To the Modernist mind, its winglike concrete roof, supported by an invisible steel frame, was structurally dishonest. But its curved forms were a perfect metaphor for the American ideal of a mobile society.
 When doubt surfaced, it tended to be about what symbolic form this emergent America should take. In the final section of the show we see Saarinen working through a gamut of possible designs for the American Embassy Chancery in London. The work ranged from classically modern to neo-fascist, sensual concave facades to rigid boxes. All of them struggle to fit into the context of the neighborhood. But it is as if Saarinen could not put his finger on a fixed image that America should portray to the world.
 The endless searching momentarily pierces the armor of self-confidence and hints at what gave the best architecture of this period its depth: a sense that all was not as it appeared on the surface, that there were more troubled waters -- political, social, psychological -- bubbling somewhere underneath.
 The difference between Saarinen's era and our own is that we no longer want to appear so naive. The most serious architects today have not solved the contradictions at the core of Saarinen's work; they prefer to open them up to public scrutiny.
 ''Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future'' continues through Jan. 31 at the Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street; (212) 534-1672; mcny.org. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A design review on Nov. 11 about ''Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future,'' at the Museum of the City of New York, referred incorrectly to the roof of the TWA Terminal Saarinen designed for Idlewild Airport, now John F. Kennedy International Airport. While the concrete is heavily reinforced with steel, the roof is not supported by a steel frame. (A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Nov. 17; this correction was delayed because the writer did not immediately respond to the complaint.)

HEADLINE: Hoodie Magic Wears Off for McDaniels

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Perhaps the most significant development of the latest ''Monday Night Football'' game was the severe devaluation of the hoodie. Just a few weeks ago, Broncos Coach Josh McDaniels was the latest genius from the Bill Belichick family of geniuses and the one brave enough to mimic the master's taste for haute couture. Now, we'll have whatever Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin is wearing, please. If the master himself loses to the Colts this weekend, the hoodie might find its way back to the clearance rack at Big Lots. And the fashion world will rejoice. 
 Two losses have quickly dropped McDaniels and the Broncos from the realm of the charmed teams, writes Bill Williamson on ESPN.com, while the Steelers have quickly become the team no one wants to play, writes Alex Marvez on Foxsports.com. What's most scary, writes Ross Tucker of SI.com, is that it's not just the Steelers' defense doing all the damage. Tomlin gained major points in the coaching compassion department by de-activating Ryan Clark, saving him from the decision to play at altitude and endanger his health. 
 Perhaps the worst part of all for the Broncos was watching their stadium taken over by towel-waving Steelers fans, for which the Denver Post's Woody Paige scolded Broncos fans.
 It could be worse for the Broncos. They could be the Chiefs, who are not only bad (O.K., rebuilding) but also employed the implosive running back Larry Johnson. That is until they unceremoniously dumped him on Monday. Joe Posnanski writes in the Kansas City Star that Johnson lost his teammates' respect a long time ago and Jerome Bettis writes on SI.com that although he believes Johnson can still play in the N.F.L., he's not worth the trouble. The Redskins (insert groaning sound here) may actually take a flyer on him because they don't have enough headaches as it is. The Cardinals, meanwhile, may be planning to rid themselves of their lingering migraine, a k a receiver Anquan Boldin, writes Paola Boivin of The Arizona Republic.
 There are heads throbbing all over college football, and Ray Ratto writes on CBSSports.com that the one attached to California running back Jahvid Best should make people re-think how concussions are treated in football. Oregon might have ordered up some extra Advil along with its decision to reinstate LaGarrette Blount, the player who punched a Boise State player this season, writes Dennis Dodd on CBSSports.com. And Memphis might just head straight for the darkened room after it fired Coach Tommy West and then listened to him say the university should drop its football program if it won't support it better. The Commercial Appeal's Geoff Calkins could not agree more.
 And this fact might give you a headache, courtesy of an in-depth look at college football coaching salaries by USA Today: 25 coaches make more than $2 million a year, double the number from two years ago. Recession, schmecession.
 College basketball kicked off its season Monday night and if you didn't notice, Seth Davis of SI.com is not surprised because he believes it is set up to start with a whimper. There were a few issues of note to consider, including whether North Carolina can stay at the top, writes Jason King of Yahoo.com, whether you really want to consider Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim in the same breath as Dean Smith and Adolph Rupp even after 800 victories, and whether Isiah Thomas can rehabilitate his image by coaching Florida International, writes Terence Moore of Fanhouse.com.
 Seton Hall's team is dealing with something far more serious: the report that one of its players was drunk while causing a horrific crash on the Garden State Parkway.
 The N.H.L.'s latest car crash is only metaphorical -- the Phoenix Coyotes/Wayne Gretzky mess -- and Gretzky graciously told the assembled news media at Monday night's Hall of Fame inductions that he is not bitter about how the league has treated him. But here is a real bronzed-headscratcher: a bust of the legendary coach Toe Blake is up for sale on eBay for $10,000.
 The tempest continues in tennis over Andre Agassi outing himself as a drug user in his autobiography, with Marat Safin the latest to chime in and say Agassi should return his money and Grand Slam titles. But Jay Mariotti of Fanhouse.com wonders why everyone is bashing Agassi when he is the rare athlete willing to tell the truth about drug use.
 Meanwhile, Michael Phelps continues his battle with the controversial swimsuits, missing two finals while wearing his pokey old one. 
 Just give the man a hoodie.

SO exclusive is this restaurant on an industrial stretch of Queens Boulevard in Long Island City that it isn't open to the public and it doesn't even have a name.
 But: linens? Check. Floral centerpieces? Check. Sleek gold-ish decor? Check. Daily printed menu? Why certainly: a recent luncheon offered white bean soup with Parmesan crisps and grilled salmon with ratatouille sauced in Provencale herb emulsion. 
 This restaurant's existence goes to the heart of an issue that could dominate New York's first major restaurant labor donnybrook in years: the capability of the staff at Tavern on the Green, members of New York Hotel Trades Council. 
 All the cooks and waiters in the 60-seat dining room and kitchen at the union restaurant are workers in New York hotels, receiving instruction in fine-dining serving skills and high-end culinary techniques at a two-year-old training kitchen and restaurant. 
 The diners are exclusively employees of the union's large health-and-welfare building there. They pay only $10 for their fancy lunches. ''We want our members to have the highest understanding of their professionalism,'' said Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council, which represents some 400 employees at Tavern. 
 The union is facing off with Dean J. Poll, the restaurateur to whom the city Parks Department awarded the Tavern operating license starting Jan. 1. Mr. Poll, who runs the non-unionized Boathouse restaurant in Central Park, has notified the union that he will push for a new contract that would nullify the current agreement. If he perseveres, Mr. Ward has said, the union ''will strike this guy for a hundred years.''
 While Mr. Poll has mainly addressed work rules, pay and other costs, many Tavern watchers -- including operators who chose not to pursue its license -- said the staff was just not up to the needs of a contemporary fine-dining restaurant. 
 While some readers of The New York Times who commented online about previous articles on Tavern said they enjoyed their experiences there, others said its kitchen and service left much to be desired. One reader recalled ''undistinguished food, served with cold indifference.'' 
 To elevate the skills of union members, the Long Island City training center spends $1 million to teach some 800 students a year in eight courses in food service, hotel engineering and information systems. Costs are shared by the union and the employers' bargaining group, the Hotel Association of New York City.
 Restaurant instruction includes a 48-week course teaching the versatile position of tournant, sometimes called roundsman or swing cook: those skilled at working at all kitchen stations. There is also a 24-week a-la-carte server course, and an 8-week banquet server course. 
 And so, on a recent morning, eight students were navigating the restaurant's bright, well-appointed 2,000-square-foot kitchen. 
 ''I just try not to make mistakes,'' said Peter Komninos, a 34-year-old student who is a bellman at the Belvedere Hotel in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Komninos was the pastry chef du jour, and Pablo Trobo, the chief instructor, schooled him in making creme caramel. ''I never made flan before,'' Mr. Komninos said. Now he was arraying 32 portions in bowls known in the trade as ''monkey dishes.''
 ''You heat it up too much, it burns,'' Mr. Trobo said. ''It has to be at the perfect temperature.''
 Course graduates receive a certificate ''that they can use to improve their station,'' said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the hotel association. ''The goal is for employees to better their skills and move up the ladder.'' 
 In a city abundant with trained waiters and cooks looking for work, the course ''is laudable, and adds to the students' value, but so would work experience at Gramercy Tavern,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in New York. ''Restaurateurs are looking to match their service with their customers. And it's the person that matters, as much as the training. Just because you've completed a course doesn't mean you can cook.'' 
 Maria Ortega, a 27-year-old hostess at Adour Alain Ducasse in the St. Regis New York, said she took the a-la-carte waiter course ''because I'm interested in management, and I want to know all the jobs.'' 
 Carlos Ramos, 46, a hotel bartender, said he hoped the courses would lead to a job as an ''A-list waiter.'' Bartenders make $48,000 to $52,000, he said, but ''an A-list waiter could make $85,000 to $100,000 if you are willing to work hard -- 5 a.m. to midnight on three functions a day.''
 So far, 51 Tavern employees have taken, or are taking, one of the culinary-program courses. One of them, Rodrigo Ponce de Leon, 46, is a dining-room captain at Tavern who took the tournant course because, he said, ''I want to learn about every aspect of the business.'' 
 Another, Francis Butters, 44, also a captain at Tavern, said that in this economic climate, ''it helps to be as knowledgeable about your job as possible.''

HEADLINE: Gloomy Energy Report Sets the Stage for Climate Negotiations

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As the world heads for tough negotiations over a global climate deal next month, an influential forecasting agency said on Tuesday that current energy policies were not sustainable, and that a vast transformation of energy use was required to fend off the worst consequences of global warming.
 In the absence of a global deal to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, energy consumption will soar over the next decades. This would result in a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, according to the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations that is based in Paris. 
 ''Continuing on today's energy path, without any change in government policy, would mean rapidly increasing dependence on fossil fuels, with alarming consequences for climate change and energy security,'' the agency said.
 The warning was contained in the annual World Energy Outlook, a 698-page publication that focuses this year on policies needed to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide.
 A part of the report was released last month as a map for policy makers considering how to make significant reductions. Government officials from about 190 nations will meet next month in Copenhagen to try to hammer out an international deal to replace the agreement known as the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012. 
 But international negotiators have signaled that an agreement is unlikely to be reached this year in the absence of a broad consensus on how to share the costs of switching to lower-carbon technologies and fuels. 
 The recession, the energy agency said, offers an opportunity to make big strides in lowering emissions. As a result of reduced economic activity this year, global emissions are expected to fall as much as 3 percent, the steepest decline in 40 years.
 Without a new global agreement, carbon emissions will rise by 40 percent by 2030, the agency said. More than half of that growth will come from China alone, with the rest coming from other developing nations. 
 The agency's forecasts are based on the assumption of no changes in energy policy from governments.
 Global electricity demand, for example, would rise by 76 percent by 2030, requiring the addition of five times as much production capacity as exists today in the United States. Much of that would come from burning coal; its share of the global energy mix would grow by 2 percentage points to reach 44 percent in 2030.
 The recession, which has slowed the growth in demand and allowed governments to introduce energy-saving programs, provides some breathing room.
 As a result of some of these policies, like stricter fuel economy standards for cars, the energy agency has reduced its forecast for oil demand in coming years. 
 Forecasters now expect global oil consumption to grow 1 percent a year in the next two decades, reaching 105 million barrels a day by 2030, from 85 million barrels a day in 2008. That estimate is lower than last year's forecast for 2030 of 106 million barrels a day. It is also well below the 120 million barrels a day that the energy agency had projected a few years ago.
 If the world agreed on stringent emissions limits, oil demand would reach just 89 million barrels a day by 2030, the agency said. That would represent a modest increase of four million barrels a day over current consumption levels. 
 As economies recover, energy demand will rise. After two years of declines because of the recession, government forecasters in the United States projected on Tuesday that global oil consumption would rise again next year. 
 The Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, projected that oil demand would grow by 1.26 million barrels a day in 2010, almost entirely because of a rebound in demand from developing nations. Oil consumption in the developed world will rise by only 100,000 barrels a day next year, the agency estimated. 
 The recession has not only reduced energy demand this year, it has also curbed investments in new supplies.
 In the oil and gas sector, most companies have announced cutbacks in capital spending, as well as project delays and cancellations, the International Energy Agency said. It estimated that investment budgets for 2009 had been cut by around 19 percent compared with last year, a drop of over $90 billion.
 The cost of reducing carbon emissions -- through energy efficiency, more investments in renewable power, electric vehicles, expansion of nuclear power, and building carbon capture and storage technology for coal-burning power plants -- would be high. 
 But for each year of delay in an agreement, the world will eventually have to spend an additional $500 billion to cut emissions, the agency said.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Takes a Breather And Shares Close Flat

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A day after a spirited rally sent the Dow to its highest levels since the beginning of the financial crisis, Wall Street took a moment to breathe, with stocks showing little or no gains on Tuesday. 
 From the opening bell to the close, the enthusiasm of Monday's rally, which pushed the Dow up more than 200 points, seemed to have dissipated. The dollar remained weak, and a rush for gold slowed slightly.
 At the end, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.03 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,246.97. The broader Standard and Poor's 500-stock index declined less than a point to 1,093.01, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 2.98 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,151.08. 
 The stock exchanges will be open Wednesday on Veteran's Day, but the bond markets will be closed.
 Shares of financial companies, particularly regional banks, were among laggards. Zions Bancorp declined 7.66 percent, to $13.26; SunTrust fell 3.38 percent, to $20.29; and Huntington Bancshares 3.55 percent, to $3.80. Bank of America, however, rose 1.65 percent, to $16.03, after it said that its integration with Merrill Lynch would generate more savings than expected. American Express rose 1.6 percent, to $39.68, on reports that worldwide credit card spending had increased by 3 percent in October -- a sign that consumers might be more optimistic about spending.
 The dollar, which has lost 16 percent of its value since March, continued to trade near $1.50 against the euro and fell against other currencies as well. While the dollar is considered a safe-haven investment, low interest rates have kept its yield down, and in response investors have thrown their money to Wall Street in search of higher returns. The price of gold, which in recent weeks has hit record highs nearly every day, climbed slightly, to $1,105.60 an ounce.
 Even as the stock market continues an eight-month rally, there are concerns over the speed of a recovery. On Tuesday, the presidents of the Federal Reserve banks in San Francisco and Atlanta suggested that unemployment, which hit a 26-year high in October, could continue to remain high for several years. Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, said growth was sustainable but that it would not happen fast enough to bring down unemployment anytime soon. 
 ''High unemployment, weak job growth and paltry wage increases are a recipe for sluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery,'' Ms. Yellen told a real estate group in Phoenix.
 Also on Tuesday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who heads the Senate banking committee, released a proposal to overhaul the financial system. He called for establishing an agency to protect consumers and for giving the government more authority to break up companies that pose a threat to the stability of the system. 
 Oil prices settled down 38 cents, at $79.05 a barrel, as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico began to subside.
 Investors expect earnings reports from major retailers later this week, including Macy's, Wal-Mart and J. C. Penney. As the holiday season approaches, those results will give a snapshot of the state of consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of the United States economy. 
 Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said investors were ignoring signs that consumer spending might be weak in the coming months, given cost-cutting by companies and a steady rise in the unemployment rate.
 ''Nobody wants to fight the rally,'' he said. ''The market is showing a natural pullback at this point, and we will probably see a consolidation phase for awhile.''
 In London, shares of HSBC were about 4 percent higher after the bank said its profit in the quarter ended in September was ''significantly ahead'' of a year earlier. Shares of a rival, Barclays, were down 5.1 percent after profit declined 54 percent. And the Lloyds Banking Group's shares dropped slightly after the bank announced plans to lay off an additional 5,000 workers.
 Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Ohio, said Wall Street would probably continue to inch upward, with occasional downturns, as investors gunned for a strong finish to 2009. 
 ''There's a lot of money on the sidelines that has missed out on stocks being up,'' Mr. Mayland said. ''And time to the year-end is getting short.'' 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32, to 101 8/32. The yield fell to 3.47 percent from 3.49 percent on Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: 2 Bear Stearns Fund Leaders Are Acquitted

BYLINE: By ZACHERY KOUWE and DAN SLATER

 BODY:
It was, prosecutors claimed, a clear case of Wall Street crime -- and a chance to bring to account two culprits of the subprime age.
 But jurors disagreed, and on Tuesday, two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers were found not guilty of securities fraud in federal court in Brooklyn, in what legal experts called a setback for prosecutors hoping for easy victories in this era of bailouts and foreclosures. 
 The verdict, the first in a major criminal case stemming from the current financial crisis, brought to an end a two-year ordeal for the managers, Ralph R. Cioffi and Matthew M. Tannin. They had been led away in handcuffs in June 2008 and accused of lying to their investors about the precarious state of the funds they oversaw.
 Investors lost $1.6 billion when the funds, heavily invested in mortgage securities, collapsed in the summer of 2007. The fiasco presaged the financial turmoil that would later upend Wall Street and the broader economy. 
 The three-week trial riveted the financial and legal communities, which viewed it as a bellwether for other cases, both criminal and civil, involving the financial industry. The jury of eight women and four men, drawn mostly from working-class neighborhoods, essentially found that while Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin may have made bad investments, making a bad investment was not a crime. 
 The jurors, who waded through a stack of financial lingo and complex investments, reached their verdict after six hours of deliberation. 
 The case turned on e-mail messages between Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin which, prosecutors claimed, showed that the money managers knew their investments were souring but nonetheless assured their investors that the funds were sound.
 In interviews Tuesday, several jurors said the men's apparent salesmanship did not cross the line into fraud. 
 ''There was a reasonable doubt on every charge. We just didn't feel that the case had been proven,'' said Ryan Goolsby, one of the jurors.
 Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin still face civil action by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said on Tuesday that it expected to proceed with its case. 
 Emerging from the Federal District Court in Brooklyn Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Cioffi pumped his fist as he rushed to a car with his lawyers, his family in tow. 
 Susan Brune, Mr. Tannin's lawyer, said: ''This has been a tremendous team effort. I am thrilled for Matt and his family.''
 From the start, the government presented its case as one of ''black-and-white lies'' that violated the basic trust between Wall Street professionals and the investing public. The defense focused on the investment strategy of the hedge funds and the nuances of the e-mail messages between the two men. 
 Dane Butswinkas, Mr. Cioffi's main lawyer, told jurors during the trial that prosecutors had taken e-mail messages out of context and provided ''misleading sound bites'' to try to prove a criminal conspiracy. ''When you look at the world through dirty glasses, everything looks dirty,'' he said in closing remarks last week.
 ''They tried to make these guys the poster children for the recession,'' said Thomas E. Peisch, a partner at the law firm of Conn Kavanaugh Rosenthal Peisch & Ford in Boston, who was not connected with the case. ''The lesson is that the government has to be pretty careful in the future about the cases it selects to prosecute because they obviously didn't even come close to selling it here.''
 In a statement, the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York expressed disappointment with the outcome. ''But the jurors have spoken,'' the statement said, ''and we accept their verdict. Honesty and integrity are the principles upon which our financial markets function. Enforcing and protecting those principles will continue to be one of the principal efforts of this office.''
 Mr. Cioffi was also found not guilty of insider trading charges on accusations that he moved $2 million he had invested in one of the failing funds to another less risky fund while telling investors he was adding to his position.
 The verdict is expected to have wide-ranging implications for how the government approaches similar white-collar cases. 
 It has been closely watched by law enforcement and other prosecutors, especially in light of the recent contentions of insider trading centered around the billionaire Raj Rajaratnam.
 ''These acquittals provide a cautionary tale for white-collar investigations premised on facially 'smoking gun' e-mails,'' said John Hueston, who prosecuted Enron's former top executives, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay. ''The texting, twittering, BlackBerry-toting jurors of today understand that an e-mail capturing a concern, doubt or momentary distress does not reflect thought over time, much less a vetted public statement.''
 One of the main documents in the case was an e-mail message that Mr. Tannin sent from his private Gmail account to the e-mail account of Mr. Cioffi's wife. He wrote that the subprime market -- the market to which the funds were tied -- ''looked pretty damn ugly,'' and that if a recent report was correct, ''then the entire subprime market is toast.'' Days later, during a conference call, Mr. Tannin told investors that ''we're very comfortable with exactly where we are.''
 When the defense asked that the entire e-mail be read before the jury, a different picture emerged, according to a juror, Aram Hong, the director for food and beverage at a hotel. The complete e-mail, said Ms. Hong, suggested that the defendants were considering two options. The first was to close the funds, and the other was to approach the flagging subprime mortgage market as a buying opportunity. ''They decided, 'We need to make a decision now. And we need to be aggressive whichever way we go,' '' Ms. Hong said. 
 Defense lawyers argued much the same throughout the trial. 
 ''The entire market crashed,'' Ms. Hong said. ''You can't blame that on two people.'' 
 Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008 and was taken over by JPMorgan Chase. 
 Given the resentment directed at Wall Street these days, some legal experts warned that jurors might be quick to convict two high-flying money managers like Mr. Cioffi and Mr. Tannin. But Jenny McCaughey, the jury forewoman, said: ''We made a point of saying, 'We're not going to look at the fact that we're in a recession, or that the markets are down. Because that wasn't relevant to the case.' ''

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
It was a sad homecoming of sorts. On Tuesday, Eric Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, returned to Fort Hood, Tex., where he was a division commander in the mid-1990s, to pay tribute to two veterans affairs employees who died in the shootings there last week. 
 But the visit also underscored Mr. Shinseki's current mission: to modernize his problem-plagued agency, which was struggling to care for aging veterans even before the flood of young ones from Iraq and Afghanistan began.
 For months, Mr. Shinseki has been crisscrossing the country as President Obama's pinstriped evangelist for veterans' care, raising concerns about a coming tide of post-traumatic stress cases, traumatic brain injuries and other physical and psychological scars of battle. 
 Having led soldiers in Vietnam as a young West Point graduate, until a mine tore off part of his right foot and nearly ended his Army career, he can speak about the ''baggage'' of war with deep feeling. 
 ''All of us who went through combat, we were carrying a little bit of baggage from the experience, the stress,'' he said in an interview before the Fort Hood shootings. 
 Even before the shootings, Mr. Shinseki was in a rush, telling people he figured he would have three years -- the average tenure of a cabinet secretary, he says -- to revamp the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 In nine months, he has pushed the department to make it easier for veterans to receive compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder. The agency has expanded the list of illnesses presumed to have been caused by Agent Orange, smoothing the way for an estimated 200,000 Vietnam-era veterans to receive benefits. And he has requested what would be the largest single-year increase in the department's budget in three decades, $15 billion, or 16 percent.
 Mr. Shinseki has also pledged to streamline the backlog-plagued disability compensation system and is pushing to revamp an archaic computer system so electronic records track a veteran from enlistment to death. 
 Perhaps most ambitious is his goal of getting 131,000 homeless veterans off the street in six years. ''I don't think you can do this sort of thing if you don't put a big number on the table,'' he said. 
 But as much as anything, Mr. Shinseki talks about bringing ''a change of culture'' to the department. Widely viewed as indifferent or obstructionist by veterans' groups, it needs to become more of an advocate for the people it serves, Mr. Shinseki says.
 ''I think what's important for me is to make sure we aren't seen as adversarial,'' he said. 
 Veterans advocates who describe the department as a bastion of antiquated technology and hostile paper pushers, say he will need to do that and more to improve the sprawling agency, the government's second largest after Defense. 
 ''He faces one of the greatest rebranding challenges in American government,'' said Paul Rieckhoff, an Iraq veteran and founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ''When I came home, my father, a Vietnam-era vet, said: 'Don't go to V.A. I wouldn't go unless I was on fire.' ''
 The problems are daunting. Nearly 8 million of the 23.4 million veterans are enrolled in the veterans system, which administers compensation for disabled veterans and runs the nation's largest health care system. 
 And the numbers are growing, partly because of the two wars, partly because of the recession, partly because the department has expanded certain programs and partly because it has reinstated benefits for hundreds of thousands of veterans who lost them several years ago. 
 At the same time, the department is widely criticized as inefficient or incompetent. Thousands of veterans have reported records being lost or destroyed. Applicants for compensation wait months for claims to be processed and years more for appeals to be adjudicated. And although the health care system is widely praised, it has had its share of scandals, including botched prostate surgeries and improperly cleaned colonoscopy equipment. 
 ''They can't do it the way they've done it in the past,'' said Bob Wallace, executive director of the Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ''It won't work.'' 
 Mr. Shinseki, who grew up in Hawaii, the grandson of Japanese immigrants, has been in this kind of rush before. When he became the Army chief of staff in 1999, he pushed hard to modernize his hidebound service to prepare for new kinds of warfare. 
 Over protests, he ordered active-duty soldiers to wear black berets -- once worn only by elite Army Rangers -- as a symbol of unity and excellence. He also championed a lighter, eight-wheeled armored vehicle called the Stryker that is now in used in Afghanistan.
 ''If you don't like change, you are going to like irrelevance even less,'' General Shinseki was fond of telling his commanders. (He has resurrected the line.)
 He became perhaps better known for running afoul of Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense in the Bush administration, when he said, on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that far more troops would be needed to secure the country. He was marginalized by the Pentagon leadership, but time proved him right. 
 Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, said Mr. Shinseki has been pleasantly open about missteps, as when the administration proposed passing on some health care costs to veterans. There was an outcry among veterans, and Mr. Shinseki helped kill the proposal. 
 Later, when the agency was slow to send checks to veterans attending college on the post-9/11 G.I. bill, Mr. Shinseki ordered offices to open on a Saturday to issue payments to eligible students.
 ''Before, they would have said, tough, live with it,'' Ms. Murray said. 
 But amid the plaudits, some advocates wonder how well a general can run a bureaucracy filled with unionized civil servants. He can hire and fire at will only a few dozen of the department's 298,000 employees. And some friends worry whether Mr. Shinseki, famously plainspoken and earnest, can survive in sharp-elbowed Washington.
 ''He's less likely to shape things to be palatable,'' said Maj. Gen. Eric Olson, who is retired and served three times under Mr. Shinseki. ''He's more likely to go in and say: 'This isn't right, this isn't how things should be done. Why can't we fix it?' And that's not always the way to get things done in Washington.'' 
 Mr. Shinseki acknowledged that he does not always know what works best in Washington. But in his four years as Army chief, he said, ''I got enough done without having to do something unnatural for me. I think what's natural for me is trying to tell the story that soldiers need told. It's not my story, it's their story.''
 He suggests that he was as surprised as anyone when Mr. Obama, whom he had never met before the election, asked him to join the cabinet. 
 When friends express skepticism about whether he is enjoying his job, he says he tells them: ''I get up every day and look forward to coming to work. The day isn't long enough to solve the problems. I wish it was longer because there is lots to do.''

HEADLINE: Mideast Path: Step Up or Step Back?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Call White House, Ask for Barack,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 8):
 Mr. Friedman is advocating what some Israelis want and no Palestinian wants: a perpetuation of the status quo, and for the United States to ''just get out of the picture.'' He claims that we Americans want peace more than the Israelis and the Palestinians.
 Certainly that is not true of the Palestinians, who are suffering horribly in Gaza and are oppressed and deprived of freedom and human dignity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
 Most thinking Israelis -- including Ehud Olmert, Ariel Sharon and Ehud Barak, all conservatives -- have recognized that a continuation of the status quo will be a catastrophe for Israel, as a single nation continues to evolve between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. With a majority of Arab voters, Israel will soon cease to be a Jewish state, or else be forced to become a truly apartheid regime. 
 Instead of waiting for Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas to beg us, which won't happen, America needs to put forward on our own initiative a plan for two states, perhaps based on the Arab initiative, which calls for diplomatic and economic recognition of Israel within its secure borders, side by side with Palestinians in a viable and contiguous state.
 As President Obama and other world leaders know, a quiescent America will bring nothing but catastrophe.
 Jimmy Carter Atlanta, Nov. 8, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While it is no doubt true that the two-state solution is very nearly moribund, Thomas L. Friedman's notion of benign neglect will hardly ameliorate the prospects for peace in the Middle East.
 Should the United States leave the Palestinians and the Israelis to their own devices, the chief beneficiaries will be Islamic fundamentalism and the Jewish settler movement. 
 A better solution to the peace process impasse might be to revisit cowboy diplomacy. 
 After withdrawing our support for Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority -- and threatening Hamas with military strikes for aiding and abetting global terrorism -- the United States should warn Israel that its annual $3 billion in foreign aid may no longer be a fait accompli. 
 But if both parties formally agreed to forge a viable two-state solution -- with borders, parliaments and mutual diplomatic recognition -- without any preconditions, the United States would rescind its earlier stipulations.
 Peace may yet come -- but not necessarily on the wings of a dove. For as Machiavelli noted long ago, ''it is better to be feared than loved.''
 Rosario A. Iaconis Mineola, N.Y., Nov. 9, 2009
 To the Editor:
 George W. Bush did little to promote peace between the Palestinians and Israel. What were the results?
 During those eight years, tensions in the Middle East increased. Egypt and Jordan came under intense pressure to take a more belligerent stand against Israel. Israel has come under rocket attack. Jewish settlers have become more aggressive in their attacks against Palestinians.
 Expansion of settlements continues to make it almost impossible for moderate Palestinians to maintain support. Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem are being systematically eroded by increased Jewish development, leading to further tensions.
 Many experts agree that the policy of the Bush years has made the situation in the Middle East far worse. Historically, Menachem Begin candidly admitted that the agreement he signed with Egypt was due to the active involvement of Jimmy Carter. Without American influence, any chance for an agreement to end hostilities is nil.
 Marvin Bograd East Windsor, N.J., Nov. 9, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I've long suspected that the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians was hopeless. But I dared to hope. 
 One of the people keeping hope alive for me was Thomas L. Friedman, who seemed always to imply that peace was worth the seemingly hopeless struggle, that at long last a viable solution would emerge.
 Now he counsels the United States to give up the effort. Perhaps he is right; maybe we have been enablers of a kind for too long. But to truly disengage from the process would involve discontinuation of financial support for Israel and the Palestinians.
 Would any administration really be able to do it? It would be political suicide. But without an end to support, our backing away from the negotiations would have no meaning.

HEADLINE: Cultural Bent Hangs Over Oracle's Battle for Sun

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
Oracle's battle with European regulators over its acquisition of Sun Microsystems boils down to a conflict about the importance of free software and the government's role in protecting it.
 The verbal salvos heated up this week after the European Union issued formal objections on Monday to a bid by Oracle, the giant software maker, to buy Sun for $7.4 billion. 
 Oracle immediately pilloried the objections, saying they were based on ''a profound misunderstanding'' of the software market. 
 On Tuesday, the European Union struck back, with a spokesman for the union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, dismissing Oracle's criticism as ''facile and superficial.''
 At one level, the sharp exchanges fit a familiar pattern in antitrust disputes between Brussels and American technology companies, including Microsoft and Intel. The Americans tend to portray the European authorities as technically clueless bureaucrats, while the Europeans cast the big American businesses as arrogant bullies.
 But the Oracle case also reflects very different views of open-source software by antitrust officials in the United States and Europe. The European regulators want Oracle to sell off a unit of Sun that manages the most popular open-source database program, MySQL. Like all open-source products, MySQL code is distributed free, and the company tries to make money by charging corporate customers for technical support and extra features.
 The European antitrust officials fear that Oracle, the largest maker of proprietary database software, will have little incentive to sustain and invest in MySQL, a potential rival.
 The United States Justice Department does not share the European concerns. After the Brussels decision on Monday, the American antitrust regulators made an unusual statement, saying that it had concluded there was a ''large community of developers and users of Sun's open-source database'' who would likely keep maintaining and improving MySQL regardless of Oracle's future decisions about the product.
 Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the trans-Atlantic ''megawar'' over open-source software was not surprising.
 ''It makes sense that the Europeans come to the defense of open-source companies because the big proprietary companies are nearly all American,'' he said. (The exception is SAP, the large German maker of business management software.)
 European governments have long viewed open-source software as a potential tool of economic development and independence. 
 The vision was laid out nine years ago in a report by a technology advisory group to the European Commission. Open-source software, the report concluded, presented ''a great opportunity'' for the region that could perhaps ''change the rules in the information technology industry,'' wresting the lead in software from the United States and reducing Europe's reliance on imports.
 Several European countries have policies that encourage government agencies and municipalities to consider open-source software like MySQL and Linux, an alternative to the Windows operating system from Microsoft.
 The wider economic role of open-source software, legal experts say, appears to have figured into the thinking of Europe's antitrust regulators. 
 ''There is a greater sensitivity to the importance of open-source software in Europe,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. ''They value the competition from open-source software -- and the need to support that competition -- more than in the United States.''
 Dennis Oswell, an antitrust lawyer with the firm Oswell & Vahida in Brussels, said the move against Oracle also reflected a greater willingness by European regulators to move against potential threats to competition before there is evidence of harm.
 ''The Europeans are keen to police markets prospectively -- even lightning-quick ones like technology -- to ensure effective competition in the future,'' Mr. Oswell said. By contrast, he said, American regulators ''see low prices and competitive markets today and say, 'O.K., let's not worry too much about what might or might not happen tomorrow.' ''
 The review of the Oracle-Sun deal proceeded on different timetables in the United States and Europe, though the investigators did make some joint calls on Sun and Oracle customers as part of their inquiries.
 After the acquisition plan was announced in April, the investigation by both sets of regulators focused mainly on Java, a widely used programming language and Internet technology created by Sun, according to a person close to Oracle, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the company.
 By August, the person said, the focus of Europe's investigation had switched to MySQL, which took Oracle somewhat by surprise. The European authorities asked Oracle to divest MySQL, and Oracle resisted.
 Ms. Kroes first publicly raised concerns about MySQL in September -- two weeks after the Justice Department's antitrust division had approved the Oracle-Sun deal. She said at the time that nurturing open-source software was vital when the world was emerging from an economic slump.
 Ms. Kroes met last month with Safra A. Catz, Oracle's president, but made no progress. Oracle's stance was that MySQL and Oracle database products rarely competed head on. MySQL is a fast, lightweight database, used mainly in software applications for the Web. Oracle's database, by contrast, is a heavier program intended for running more mainstream corporate applications like sales management. 
 ''Europe is absolutely right that there is a competition problem in enterprise and database software markets, but MySQL doesn't actually compete with Oracle,'' said Roger Burkhardt, chief executive of Ingres, an open-source database company that does compete directly with Oracle in the corporate market.
 MySQL, the person close to Oracle said, is more naturally a competitor to Microsoft's database software, SQL Server. And Oracle has every reason to keep investing in MySQL to challenge Microsoft, the person said. A public hearing in the Oracle case is scheduled in Brussels for Nov. 25. The European Union's ruling is due on Jan. 19. 
 The European setback is a new and uncomfortable experience for Oracle and its chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison. 
 His company has had two previous deals cleared in Europe without conditions: Oracle's acquisition of PeopleSoft in 2004, and its purchase of Siebel Systems a year later. Both were makers of proprietary business software.

HEADLINE: Administration Names Agriculture Official to Run U.S. Aid Agency, Ending Delays

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After months of delays because of tangled vetting procedures, the Obama administration on Tuesday named a former executive with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to run its main foreign aid arm, the United States Agency for International Development. 
 The official, Rajiv J. Shah, a medical doctor and health economist now at the Agriculture Department, would take over an agency whose power and profile have eroded in recent years, but which is enmeshed in some of the administration's toughest challenges, including Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 Dr. Shah's appointment, if confirmed by the Senate, would bring an end to 10 months of leadership drift at the agency that has deeply frustrated Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton placed development at the heart of her diplomatic agenda, but she has struggled to find a candidate who could navigate the exhaustive confirmation process.
 Paul Farmer, a renowned physician and anthropologist who has run public health programs in Rwanda and Haiti, was one of several candidates who withdrew his name for the post, citing the intrusiveness of the process. In July, Mrs. Clinton publicly vented her anger, saying the confirmation process was ''ridiculous'' and ''frustrating beyond words.''
 The leadership vacuum at the agency has become especially acute as the Obama administration has stepped up the deployment of civilian personnel to Afghanistan. The Agriculture Department has taken the lead in one of the most ambitious efforts: sending agricultural economists to advise farmers on how to wean themselves off poppies and move into legal crops.
 Dr. Shah, 36, served as the director of agricultural development and managed a $1.5 billion investment in a vaccine fund for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. At the Agriculture Department, he is the chief scientist and under secretary for research, education and economics. He is also active in the administration's global food security initiative.
 ''He's an extraordinary talent,'' Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said. ''He's brilliant, but has not lost his common touch in his capacity to reach people.''
 In a statement from Singapore, where she was traveling, Mrs. Clinton said Dr. Shah would bring ''an impressive record of accomplishment and a deep understanding of what works in development.''
 Dr. Shah, whose family immigrated to the United States from India, also has political connections, having campaigned for President Obama and served as a health policy adviser to former Vice President Al Gore during Mr. Gore's presidential campaign.
 Development experts said they were pleased by Dr. Shah's appointment, but even more pleased that the administration had finally found someone to fill the job. Because Dr. Shah has already been confirmed by the Senate once before, the administration is hopeful that he will be approved quickly.
 ''This administration has inherited a very weak and fragmented Usaid and aid infrastructure,'' said David Beckmann, the president of Bread for the World, a Christian group that advocates for hunger relief. ''By getting someone in that position, Mrs. Clinton has taken a step forward.''
 Mr. Beckmann called for Mr. Obama to restore the agency's profile by giving Dr. Shah a seat on the National Security Council, and for Mrs. Clinton to give back its independent budget and policy-making authority, which had been subsumed by the State Department.

HEADLINE: Parade of Poor Play

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Ever since the Yankees won the World Series, I have been receiving messages from fans around the world deploring the domination by New York and its cable television swag.
 For readers who detect parochial chest-thumping from New York, I would suggest they take a careful look at the Big Picture: the records of all of New York's professional teams. 
 This will make them feel better immediately: the standings reveal that New York teams are not doing so well. In fact, some of them downright stink. 
 Without counting the Yankees' regular-season record of 103-59, New York's pro football, basketball, hockey and soccer teams and its other allegedly major league baseball team have a record of 112 victories, 150 losses and 12 ties for the seasons current and just concluded. Stop chuckling out there. 
 Take the two teams in the N.F.L., which practices socialism at the top by carefully parceling out network receipts in equal shares. No cable television advantage here. Only a month ago, both the Jets and the Giants were undefeated with 3-0 records, and I could hear babbling on sports-talk radio about an all-New York Super Bowl.
 Today, however, the Jets have a 4-4 record while the Giants are 5-4, after losing four straight, including a hideous 21-20 loss at home on Sunday to San Diego, on a touchdown in the closing seconds. 
 It's too soon to make this judgment, but there may not be a New York team in the N.F.L. playoffs this season, meaning there will not be any chance for a parade like the one for the Yankees in Lower Manhattan on Friday. 
 The region's two basketball teams constitute a virtual civic disgrace, because we all think of ourselves as point guards, control freaks, direction-givers and finger-pointers. 
 The Knicks are 1-7 after Monday's 95-93 loss to Utah, and the Nets are 0-7. Does this make people feel better out there on the Steinberg map? I thought it would.
 The Knicks are being reinvented, the equivalent of a once-popular restaurant that invites the public to partake of dusty appetizers and stale entrees while the owner decides whether to become a French restaurant or a sushi emporium. 
 The friendly folks from Cablevision are stalling the remaining fans, at extremely high prices, while saving their money for next year when they could conceivably sign a star free agent. 
 Can LeBron James save the Knicks' franchise? There is actually no proof he has the single-mindedness or the imagination or the ferocity or the skill of Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson or Kobe Bryant. 
 James is no fool, and he has probably figured out that in this cyberworld, he can sell jerseys and tickets and video games from his native northern Ohio rather than try to rehabilitate some hoop slum in Manhattan. New Yorkers with memories await a basketball renaissance some year, but certainly not this one. 
 Meanwhile, the Nets are still in their holding pen across the river in New Jersey, winless and close to homeless. To make it worse, one of their players, Chris Douglas-Roberts, has swine flu, and is said to be resting comfortably. Best wishes for his recovery. 
 The Nets are trapped in the most dismal sports location in the United States -- with one football stadium under construction, another perfectly good football stadium about to be demolished, a vestigial sports arena, a grotesque amusement center and parking garages looming over the swamplands, ugly as sin.
 The Nets wanted to escape to Brooklyn, but their owner, Bruce C. Ratner, has been thwarted for a few years because of the economy and land-use niceties there. (Forest City Ratner, Mr. Ratner's company, was the development partner for the Manhattan headquarters of The New York Times Company.) 
 Now there is a prospective buyer for the Nets, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, a Russian businessman. We will see how that plays out. The Nets really should move to the Prudential Center in Newark to receive an energy boost from a city that finally has competent leadership. 
 Newark is the home of the most successful New York metropolitan area team outside of the Yankees: the Devils, of the N.H.L., are 11-4. They are in the same division as the Rangers (10-7-1) and the Islanders (6-6-5). 
 The Islanders, who are being used as a bargaining chip for a real estate development plan, have lost all charm and glory from their four Stanley Cups a quarter-century ago, and are ripe for relocation. 
 And New York has no college powerhouse. St. John's is no longer a national power in basketball, and Rutgers has sputtered in its Gatsby-like attempt to become one in football. The absence of big-time college teams is generally a good sign for education, so I applaud the vacuum. It shows that New York-area universities have good priorities.
 Did I mention the Red Bulls, who just concluded their season with 5 victories, 19 losses and 6 draws, one of the worst records in the 14-year history of Major League Soccer?
 And did I mention the Mets, who played the 2009 season in a new stadium named for a tottering financial institution, and produced a record of 70-92?
 But New York does have the Yankees, with their $206 million payroll from cable television and their 27th championship. The Yankees go into hibernation now, while the bulk of the New York teams stumble forward. Does the rest of the world feel sorry for us? Didn't think so.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Aid Is Said to Be Reaching More

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After a slow start, the Obama administration's mortgage relief program has reached one in five eligible homeowners, a government report said Tuesday. 
 More than 650,000 borrowers, or 20 percent of those eligible, have signed up for trials lasting up to five months, the Treasury Department said Tuesday. The modifications reduce monthly payments to more affordable levels.
 Started with great fanfare in March, the plan got off to a weak start, but now nearly 920,000 loan modification offers have been sent to more than 3.2 million eligible homeowners. That works out to 29 percent, up from 15 percent at the end of July.
 In California, about 130,000 homeowners have been enrolled in the ''Making Home Affordable'' loan modification plan, which President Obama introduced in February. That works out to about 19 percent of homeowners who were either two payments behind or in foreclosure at the end of last month, according to Treasury Department data.
 Two other hard-hit states, Arizona and Nevada, had similar rates of assistance as California, at 22 percent and 18 percent. Florida was much lower, at 12 percent, possibly because of high numbers of investor-owned properties that did not qualify for the $50 billion program.
 Government officials say they are pressing the industry to improve performance, but many housing advocates have been disappointed with progress.
 And economists doubt the Obama administration will reach its broad goal of helping three million to four million borrowers within three years.
 To make the preliminary trials permanent, borrowers must complete a big stack of paperwork and show they can make their payments on time.

HEADLINE: America's Closest Arab Allies Fret as Their Influence Slips Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
Even before Mahmoud Abbas announced that he would not seek re-election as the Palestinian president, throwing the Palestinian Authority into chaos, America's closest Arab allies, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, had begun to despair over Washington's Middle East missteps, government officials and political experts said.
 With Israel having rebuffed American calls to freeze settlement-building, and with the prospects for substantive peace talks fading, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are increasingly viewed in the region as diminished actors whose influence is on the wane, political experts say.
 They have been challenged by Iran, opposed by much smaller Arab neighbors, mocked by Syria and defied by influential nonstate groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. 
 Even while Iran has been focused on its domestic political crisis, and Syria has struggled with an economic and water crisis, their continued support for Hamas and Hezbollah has preserved for them a strong hand in matters like the formation of a new government in Lebanon and efforts to reconcile Palestinian factions, officials and analysts said. 
 Officials in Saudi Arabia and Egypt acknowledge all this; they admit that they are no longer masters of their universe. What they do not agree upon is how to respond.
 King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has decided that Arab unity is the only way to re-establish the kingdom's role and to blunt Iran's growing influence. The king has begun a diplomatic drive to smooth relations with two Arab leaders who have insulted and admonished him in the past, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and, more recently, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. 
 Egyptian officials say they wish the king well but have declined to participate in his reconciliation initiative because they think it will fail as long as Syria determines that the advantages of playing the spoiler outweigh the gains of pushing for peace.
 ''If there is no peace, then all those who bet against peace are winning,'' said an Egyptian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid increasing tensions with the United States or Saudi Arabia. ''And all those who act and bet there will be peace are losing, like us. We are losing because we are putting this bet.'' 
 The great promise of President Obama's June speech in Cairo, officials and political commentators said, was severely damaged when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, on her recent trip to the Middle East, praised as ''unprecedented'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to slow the building of settlements. That left the leadership of Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- the two regional American allies most committed to negotiating with Israel -- exposed, embarrassed and weakened, political analysts and government officials said.
 ''Egypt's role is receding regionally, and its cards are limited,'' said Emad Gad, an expert in international relations at the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''Their main card, which is reconciliation and peace, is receding.''
 Egypt says these efforts will come to nothing until there is progress in the peace process, an approach the Saudis have not accepted.
 Even as its vast reserves of oil money have expanded its global influence, Saudi Arabia finds itself unable to exert its will even on its own border, where it blames Iran for stoking an uprising against the government in Yemen; or in Lebanon, where its chief source of influence, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, was assassinated. Even its goal of leading the Persian Gulf states, under the umbrella of the Gulf Cooperation Council, has faltered.
 ''Saudi's role in the last 10 years has declined,'' said Abdulkarim H. al-Dekhayel, a political science professor at King Saud University in Riyadh. ''The leadership now feels it has to try to reset the agenda.''
 The Saudis have decided that the key to re-establishing a strong hand in the region rests broadly in Arab unity and specifically in Syria. Syria has close economic and political ties with Iran. It hosts the political leadership of the militant group Hamas. It shares a border with Iraq and has been accused of allowing militants and weapons to cross over. It has a close alliance with Hezbollah. All of these are excellent tools for undermining Saudi efforts to blunt Iran and push for peace with Israel.
 ''The relations between the Arab countries, if they are solid, if the understanding is there, if the cohesiveness of their policy exists, then there is no worry,'' said Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's longtime foreign minister. ''It is only when there is division, and looking for other alternatives between the Arab countries, that creates problems.''
 But Saudi Arabia's challenge is also one of leverage, political analysts and Saudi officials said. How does Saudi Arabia persuade Syria to switch from the antipeace camp, to the pro-peace camp?
 The Saudis have hinted at two strategies. One involves giving Syria much needed economic assistance. The other, though not stated directly, involves Lebanon. Syria has made it clear that it views events in Lebanon as central to its national security, as well as its pride. Saudi Arabia has tried in recent years to keep Lebanon in its orbit through proxies and cash infusions. But lately it has suggested that it might not object to Syria reasserting political control there. 
 ''What is recognized is that Lebanon is more important to Syria than any other Arab country,'' said a Saudi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to antagonize officials in either country. ''It's in its backyard. We understand that. But what we are looking for is some kind of Arab unity to stop foreign intervention in our Arab affairs.''
 Egyptian officials, for their part, have been trying to reconcile the Palestinian factions, which have been at odds since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. While that is looking ever more remote, the Egyptians believe that a deal between Hamas and Fatah would already have been reached as a result of their mediation efforts if not for intervention by Syria, officials said.
 Egyptian officials say they would be delighted if Saudi Arabia succeeded, not only in mending relations with Syria, but also in persuading the Syrians to sever ties with Iran, stop supporting Hamas and actually support the Arab initiative, which offers Israel peace in return for withdrawal to 1967 border lines, establishment of an independent Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital and a ''just solution'' to the refugee problem. 
 But the Egyptians said they simply did not believe that would happen.
 ''Does the West give any support to those moderates on the Palestinian front, on the Arab side, that advocate peace, that say, 'It is not about resistance any more, but what we want can be achieved through negotiations?' '' said the Egyptian government official. ''The answer is, 'No.' Do we have an empty hand? The answer is, 'Yes.' ''

HEADLINE: Senate Plan To Overhaul Wall Street Is Unveiled

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate banking committee proposed a financial overhaul on Tuesday that included consolidating bank regulators, creating a consumer financial protection agency and imposing new restraints on exotic financial instruments and credit rating agencies.
 The 1,136-page plan by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, differs in major respects from both the White House and House plans. Even before it was made public, it had encountered sharp resistance from Republicans and powerful business interests in Washington. With fewer than 20 days left in the legislative session, it is all but certain that Congress will not deliver on President Obama's request to repair the financial regulatory system by the end of the year. 
 Still, the long-awaited Senate plan is significant as a starting point for lawmakers who are increasingly talking about trying to complete legislation in the first three months of 2010. While the measure will inevitably be revised, it lays down the first marker by Mr. Dodd and other senior Democrats on the banking committee. 
 Mr. Dodd has said he hopes to move the bill through the banking committee quickly, with votes beginning in three weeks. In recent days he has been rewriting major portions to gain support from more Democrats on the committee.
 ''The financial crisis exposed a financial regulatory structure that was the product of historic accident created piece by piece over decades with little thought given to how it would function as a whole, and unable to prevent threats to our economic security,'' Mr. Dodd said at a Capitol Hill news conference where he was joined by seven Democrats on the banking committee who also spoke in support of the plan. ''I will not stand for attempts to protect a broken status quo, particularly when those attempts are made by some of the same special interests who caused this mess in the first place.''
 In the House, Representative Barney Frank has guided the Financial Services Committee through meetings that could lead to passage of a comprehensive bill by the full House as early as next month. His committee has already approved a host of major regulatory changes and is expected to complete work soon on a measure that would give the government greater authority to seize large and troubled financial companies.
 But in the Senate, where 60 votes are required to move contentious legislation through the chamber, Mr. Dodd has considerable work ahead of him. 
 Senior administration officials said the Dodd plan was a good starting point that, while different from the White House plan in major ways, embraced its core principles and addressed many of the problems that had been identified as causes of the financial crisis. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said that the legislation ''moves us one step closer toward comprehensive financial reform.''
 Mr. Dodd and his staff had held regular meetings with Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, but those talks recently broke down. Mr. Shelby is opposed to several central provisions of Mr. Dodd's bill, most notably the creation of an agency to protect consumers from abusive and deceptive mortgages and credit cards. Mr. Dodd has yet to get a Republican to support his plan. Moreover, several provisions will probably be opposed by moderate and conservative Democrats with ties to industry groups that have raised objections to the measure.
 Edward L. Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, said the proposal ''would tear apart the existing regulatory structure only to create a new one that would produce conflicts among regulators, undermine the state-chartered banking system and impose extensive new regulatory burdens on those banks that had nothing to do with creating the financial crisis.''
 Officials at the Consumer Federation of America issued a statement that applauded the proposed new consumer protection agency and the provisions protecting investors. 
 The Dodd proposal would create an agency to monitor and address systemic risks posed by large financial companies. It would give the agency the authority to write tougher capital standards and to break up companies if they posed a threat to the financial stability of the nation.
 The proposal would merge the current federal supervisory oversight of the banking system from four agencies into one new agency. It would create a separate division within that agency to regulate smaller banks. The biggest losers under such a plan would be the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, two of the bank agencies that would go out of the business of day-to-day supervision of thousands of institutions.
 Both the White House and the House plan do not go that far in consolidating agencies. Rather, they would merge the four bank agencies into three by combining the Office of the Comptroller, which regulates federally chartered banks, with the Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises savings and loans. They would not change the authority of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to regulate banks.
 One big winner under Mr. Dodd's plan is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would get greater authority and more resources. 
 Adopting a proposal by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, the plan would permit the commission to retain the fees it charges Wall Street. By being self-financed, the commission would not only have a larger budget, but also be free of the political constraints of relying on Congressional appropriations. Last year the commission received about $1.5 billion, which it turned over to the Treasury, while it received about $880 million in appropriations, Mr. Schumer said. Democratic and Republican leaders of the commission have sought such authority for decades, but Congress, which prefers to use the power of the purse as a tool to supervise the agency, has never agreed.
 Mr. Dodd's plan would impose tighter restrictions on the largely unregulated derivatives market. It would require many derivatives to be traded through clearinghouses where they could be monitored. 
 The measure would require that hedge funds with more than $100 million in assets be registered with the S.E.C. and disclose financial information.

HEADLINE: Under Attack, Fed Chairman Studies Politics

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the Federal Reserve under more intense attack than at any time in decades, Ben S. Bernanke, the professorial chairman of the central bank, was schooled last month in how to handle the increased political demands of his job. 
 For months, he had warned -- without anyone on Capitol Hill appearing to listen -- that a seemingly innocuous bill to let Congress ''audit'' the Fed would gravely threaten the central bank's independence. 
 It was alarming enough that the bill's author was Representative Ron Paul, the quixotic Texas Republican whose new book, ''End the Fed,'' had just landed on the best-seller lists. Despite vigorous protests by Mr. Bernanke, nearly 300 House lawmakers and 30 senators had endorsed Mr. Paul's bill. 
 But when he sat down shortly after 8 a.m. on Oct. 1 at the Rayburn House Office Building for coffee and muffins with Representative Barney Frank, the rumpled and wisecracking chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, he took in some blunt advice. 
 Voters had become suspicious and unnerved by the Fed because of its trillion-dollar efforts to bail out the financial system, Mr. Frank warned. If the Fed really wanted to survive the disgruntlement in both parties, he continued, Mr. Bernanke would have to step back and let him devise a compromise. 
 Reluctantly, the Fed chairman agreed to reduce his own visibility on the issue and let Mr. Frank take the lead.
 It was just one example of how the Fed has been forced to scramble as its power comes under more fire than at any time in decades.
 On Tuesday, a new threat opened up: Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, declared that the Fed had been an ''abysmal failure'' at regulation. He introduced a bill that would strip virtually all of its power to regulate banks, including financial institution considered too big to fail. 
 There will be a fight. Mr. Bernanke and the Fed has powerful political supporters, from lawmakers like Mr. Frank and President Obama. But the Fed chairman is being forced to nurture those ties as never before and to carefully map out which battles are worth fighting. 
 ''Ben Bernanke turns out to have better political instincts than anybody thought,'' Mr. Frank said in an interview last week. ''They accept the fact that I know what I'm doing up here.'' 
 On one front, the Fed faces populist anger from both left-wing Democrats and right-wing Republicans about its power and secrecy. At the same time, officials are locked in brutal but arcane battles about who should oversee Wall Street and big banks as Congress tries to pass a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation. 
 Last summer, the central bank hired an experienced Democratic hand and former lobbyist, Linda Robertson, to help deal with members of Congress. Mr. Bernanke alone has met privately with about 40 senators and many House members in the last few months, sometimes to dissect arcane policy issues and sometimes just to explain what he does in plain English. 
 At one recent meeting, Senator Sherrod Brown challenged Mr. Bernanke's bona fides as a regular guy by giving him a pop quiz on baseball statistics. Mr. Bernanke, a passionate fan, passed. 
 Mindful that Democrats now control the White House and Congress, Mr. Bernanke put up virtually no opposition to President Obama's proposal for a new consumer agency that would take over the Fed's authority over consumer lending issues. Similarly, he avoided a bruising turf battle by agreeing that the Fed would share responsibility with other regulators to monitor systemic financial risk.
 But Fed officials have been steely in protecting their two top priorities: the Fed's political independence on monetary policy and the Fed's role as undisputed overseer of financial institutions deemed ''too big to fail.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke took over the Fed nearly four years ago with less political experience than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. And because he was forced to bail out companies and credit markets in such visible ways, Mr. Bernanke has enjoyed little of the mystique and distance that Mr. Greenspan used to his advantage. 
 No fight illustrates Mr. Bernanke's political challenge better than the one over Mr. Paul's bill to audit the Fed. 
 The maneuvering is still under way, involving intricate negotiations outside of public view. But, aided by the pledge of help from Mr. Frank and backing from the administration, Fed officials cautiously predict they will get what they want.
 Mr. Paul's bill would require the Government Accountability Office, an arm of the Congress, to complete a wide-ranging assessment of the Fed's financial operations by the end of 2010. The audit would delve into bailouts of individual firms, short-term loans to banks, currency swaps with foreign central banks and the Fed's effort to prop up mortgage lending by purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-related securities. 
 Mr. Bernanke initially reacted to the bill in almost apocalyptic terms. The G.A.O. audits, he told a House hearing in late June, could lead to a Congressional ''takeover'' of monetary policy that would be ''highly destructive to the stability of the financial system, the dollar and our national economic situation.''
 That did not go over well with many lawmakers, who were competing to describe the Fed in dark and conspiratorial tones.
 Senator Jim DeMint, a conservative Republican from South Carolina, denounced the Fed on the Senate floor in July as an ''unelected central bank'' that enjoyed a ''monopoly over the flow of our money'' and operated in ''almost complete secrecy.''
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-leaning independent from Vermont who sponsored a Senate version of Mr. Paul's bill, attacked the Fed for being beholden mainly to Wall Street. 
 ''People are frightened,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''How do you explain to them that the Fed has spent $2 trillion to help many of the same banks that got us into this crisis in the first place?''
 As the summer wore on, even centrist lawmakers were getting impatient with Mr. Bernanke.
 ''What he failed to do was convince me that this would somehow damage the Fed,'' said Representative Dan Maffei, a centrist Democrat from Syracuse who co-sponsored Mr. Paul's bill. Representative Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, a senior Democrat on the financial services committee who is sympathetic to the Fed, said the popular anger became too deep to ignore.
 By mid-July, Mr. Frank had begun to agree. Meeting privately with the Fed chairman that month, Mr. Frank warned that he might have to embrace a version of Mr. Paul's bill. By September, he had begun exploring possible compromises.
 Fed officials say they were alarmed, but focused on making their case in private rather than in public. Mr. Bernanke met privately with dozens of House and Senate members, even taking calls at home on weekends, and won praise for his willingness to listen and answer their questions.
 ''The best weapon the Fed has is Bernanke himself,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. 
 What Mr. Bernanke insisted on, and what Mr. Frank vowed to prevent, was Congressional interference in Fed deliberations over monetary policy. 
 But whenever discussion got more specific, Fed officials insisted that monetary policy extended to many if not most of the Fed's emergency credit programs. 
 Mr. Frank said he would ''wall off'' deliberations on basic monetary policy, and delay the release of information about the Fed's financial operations to prevent traders from capitalizing on its moves. 
 Exactly what that means in practice remains unclear. Mr. Paul says he is delighted that his bill has gotten so far. But details matter, and Fed officials say they are quietly confident details will break their way.

HEADLINE: Virtuous Bankers? Really!?!

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The Great Vampire Squid has gotten religion.
 In an interview with The Sunday Times of London, the cocky chief of Goldman Sachs said he understands that a lot of people are ''mad and bent out of shape'' at blood-sucking banks.
 ''I know I could slit my wrists and people would cheer,'' Lloyd Blankfein, the C.E.O., told the reporter John Arlidge. 
 But the little people who are boiling simply don't understand. And Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi, who unforgettably labeled Goldman ''a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money,'' doesn't understand.
 Banks, Blankfein explained, are really serving the greater good. 
 ''We help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital,'' he said. ''Companies that grow create wealth. This, in turn, allows people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth. It's a virtuous cycle. We have a social purpose.''
 When Arlidge asked whether it's possible to make too much money, whether Goldman will ignore the people howling at the moon with rage and go on raking it in, getting richer than God, Blankfein grinned impishly and said he was ''doing God's work.''
 Whether he knows it, he's referring back to The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism -- except, of course, the Calvinists would have been outraged by the banks' vicious -- not virtuous -- cycle of greed and concupiscence.
 Blankfein's trickle-down catechism isn't working. Now we have two economies. We have recovering banks while we have 10-plus percent unemployment and 17.5 percent underemployment. The gross thing about the Wall Street of the last decade is how much its success was not shared with society.
 Goldmine Sachs, as it's known, is out for Goldmine Sachs. 
 As many Americans continue to struggle, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, banks that took government bailout money after throwing the entire world into crisis, have said they will dish out $30 billion in bonuses -- up 60 percent from last year.
 The saying used to be, whatever happens, the lawyers win. Now, it's whatever happens, the bankers win.
 Under pressure from regulators, who were trying to ensure that long-term performance was rewarded, the banks agreed to award more in stock, deferring cash payments. 
 But as The Times reported this week, the Goldman executives who got stock options instead of bonuses last year, at market lows, got a windfall -- so it had nothing to do with bank employees' performance.
 ''The company gave its general counsel, for example, 104,868 stock options and 14,117 shares in December, when the bank's stock was around $78,'' Louise Storywrote for The Times. ''Now the bank's shares have more than doubled in value, making that stock and option award worth nearly $12 million.''
 As one former Goldman banker told Arlidge, the culture there is ''completely money-obsessed. ... There's always room -- need -- for more. If you are not getting a bigger house or a bigger boat, you're falling behind. It's an addiction.''
 It's an addiction that Washington has done little to quell. President Obama has not been strong on the issue, and Timothy Geithner coddles the wanton bankers whenever they freak out that they might not be able to put in their new pools next summer.
 The bankers try to dismiss calls for regulation as populist ravings, but the insane inequity of it cannot be dismissed.
 No sooner had the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd announced his plan to overhaul financial regulation Tuesday than compensation experts declared it toothless.
 The banks and their lobbyists wheedled concession after concession out of Washington and knocked down proposed inhibition after inhibition. Now the banks are laughing all the way to the bank.
 ''Saturday Night Live'' was tougher on Goldman Sachs than the government, giving the firm flak about commandeering 200 doses of the swine flu vaccine -- the same amount as Lenox Hill Hospital got -- while so many at-risk Americans wait.
 ''Can you not read how mad people are at you?'' demanded Amy Poehler. ''When most people saw the headline 'Goldman Sachs Gets Swine Flu Vaccine' they were superhappy until they saw the word 'vaccine.' ''
 Seth Meyers chimed in: ''Also, Centers for Disease Control, you sent the vaccine to Wall Street before schools and hospitals? Really!?! Were you worried the swine flu might spread to the Hamptons and St. Barts? These are the least contagious people in the world. They don't even touch their own car-door handles.'' 
 And as far as doing God's work, I think the bankers who took government money and then gave out obscene bonuses are the same self-interested sorts Jesus threw out of the temple.

HEADLINE: Falling Far Short Of Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 Reduce the growth of health care costs. Bend the curve. Find the game changers. Reform the delivery system.
 Yawn.
 Health care reform has always had two main goals. The first -- insuring the uninsured -- carries grand overtones of social justice. The second -- making the health care system more efficient -- can seem abstract, technocratic and a bit nerdy.
 Just listen to Rahm Emanuel, President Obama's chief of staff. He recently dismissed critics who say the current bills don't do enough to change health care by referring to them as ''the executive board of the Brookings Institution'' and ''people sitting in the shade at the Aspen Institute.'' The goal, Mr. Emanuel told my colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, is to pass a bill through Congress, not to figure out what the ideal bill may look like.
 Certainly, a bill that can't pass Congress won't help anyone. But I think it's important to step back and understand precisely what health experts mean when they argue for reforming the delivery system. 
 It is not simply about bending the curve, or slowing the growth, of Medicare's projected spending. It's also about preventing thousands of needless deaths from hospital infections. It's about making sure you get the best cancer treatment, even when that treatment is not the most profitable one. It's about keeping health costs from denying most families a decent pay increase, as has happened in recent years.
 Making the medical system more efficient is, in short, about saving lives and giving Americans a long overdue raise. It is arguably the single most important step that the federal government could take to improve people's lives. 
 And the bill that the House of Representatives passed last weekend simply does not get it done.
 That is not a judgment based on some civics class ideal, either. The House bill falls far short when compared with a bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last month. It also fails to live up to Mr. Obama's campaign proposals and recent speeches. As Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, told me: ''The president and the White House have been much better than Congress on these issues. The Congressional challenge is to live up to presidential rhetoric.''
 You can argue, however, that these comparisons are actually reason for optimism -- that the very existence of the Senate Finance bill suggests that Congress still has a good chance to live up to the challenge.
 Jonathan Gruber, an economist who helped devise the universal coverage plan in Massachusetts, says the Senate's version of health reform does considerably more to control costs than he expected. A panel of experts led by Mark McClellan, a doctor and economist who used to run Medicare (and now happens to work at the Brookings Institution), concluded that the Senate Finance bill would help ''slow long-term spending growth while building the high-value health care system our nation urgently needs.'' That panel also suggested some smart changes to the bill.
 All along, Mr. Obama's aides have said they knew that Congress might pass bills with serious flaws. The White House strategy was to stand back and work with Congressional leaders to fix those flaws once the legislation entered its endgame. 
 The endgame is here.
 For anyone who cares about reducing medical costs and improving outcomes, there are probably six big issues to follow in the coming weeks. Let's take them one at a time: 
 THE EASY STUFF Each year, about 100,000 people die from preventable infections they contract in a hospital. When 108 hospitals in Michigan instituted a simple process to prevent some of these infections, it nearly eliminated them.
 If Medicare reduced payments for the treatment of such infections, it would give hospitals a huge financial incentive to prevent them. The Senate bill takes a small step in this direction by cutting payments to hospitals with high infection rates by 1 percent. The House bill merely requires hospitals to report their rates publicly. There are also other basic patient safety areas in which the bills can do much better.
 WHAT WORKS? Earlier this year, I used prostate cancer as an example of how our fee-for-service medical system leads to higher costs and worse outcomes. There are a handful of possible treatments for early-stage prostate cancer, and the fastest-growing are the most expensive. But no one knows which ones work best. 
 Modern medicine is full of such uncertainty. Again, the federal government could make a big difference here by giving Medicare a moderate amount of money for research, which would pay for itself many times over. The stimulus bill began paying for such research, but the health reform bills fail to pick up where the stimulus leaves off.
 A FED FOR HEALTH Twice a year, an outside advisory board sends Congress a list of suggestions for Medicare payment rates, based on the available evidence. Congress generally ignores them, in deference to the various industry groups that oppose any cuts to their payments. 
 We already have a wonderful model for how to avoid such interference. It's called the Federal Reserve. The Fed is charged with setting interest rates based on economic conditions, not politics. The Senate bill would create such a commission for Medicare. Unfortunately, it initially applies to doctors and home health care providers but not hospitals, thanks to a deal between the hospitals and the White House. It expands to include everyone in 2019. The House bill has no such commission. 
 Whether one ends up in the final bill will be a good test of Mr. Obama's endgame leadership.
 THE MCALLEN PROBLEM Both bills would create some promising voluntary programs meant to reward doctors and hospitals that provide good care rather than more care. But the doctors and hospitals providing the most expensive, wasteful care -- like those in McAllen, Tex., described by Dr. Atul Gawande in a recent New Yorker article -- surely will not sign up for these programs.
 And the language in the current bills suggests that Medicare officials cannot make the programs mandatory without new legislation from Congress, which is an invitation for lobbying from places like McAllen. Giving Medicare the authority to expand even a single successful program would be a big improvement. 
 CHOICE Last week, the Democratic leaders in Congress sent out another e-mail message bragging that for people who didn't like their insurance, health reform would provide ''affordable choices for you that can't be taken away.'' That isn't true. The bills would do nothing to expand the choices of people with employer-provided insurance.
 Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, has been obsessively trying to change this -- to give even a small slice of people with the most expensive employer plans a chance to buy insurance on the exchange for small businesses and the uninsured. It's not yet clear if he will succeed. 
 THE CADILLAC TAX Along with the Medicare commission, this tax is the biggest single difference between the Senate and House versions. Right now, health insurance -- unlike income -- is not taxed, effectively creating a subsidy for the costliest plans and health care providers. Labor leaders have helped persuade the House to keep the tax exclusion intact, largely because many of the most generous insurance plans are held by older unionized workers, who, in turn, have a lot of influence in their unions.
 But the tax exclusion is terribly costly for the rest of us. If it were to disappear, employers would have an incentive to sign up for well-run insurance plans, leaving more money available for workers' salaries. If the Senate's tax on so-called Cadillac plans were enacted, the average household would be making an additional $1,000 every year (in today's dollars) by 2019, according to an analysis of Congressional estimates by Mr. Gruber. In my house, $1,000 a year counts as real money.
 Are Congress and the White House likely to succeed on all six of these issues? Of course not. But if the final bill were just moderately better than the Senate Finance version, it would be a major victory. Even that Senate bill, as it is, would be worth celebrating. It has the potential to reduce cost growth significantly and to improve health -- in spite of all the recent criticism on those counts.
 And if the final bill ends up looking like the House bill? Well, then the criticism will have been far too tame.

HEADLINE: Chairman Says G.M. Can Repay Taxpayers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
The chairman of General Motors, Edward E. Whitacre Jr., said Tuesday that the automaker would be able to repay all of its government loans and would begin doing so soon. 
 A government report released last week concluded that taxpayers are unlikely to receive full repayment of the more than $81 billion lent to rescue G.M. and Chrysler. But Mr. Whitacre, speaking at a small college near his home in Texas, insisted that G.M. intended to repay its full debt to the Treasury Department, excluding the nearly $1 billion lent to the old part of G.M. that remains in bankruptcy. 
 The new company would pay back $6.7 billion in cash that it owes. The remaining portion of the $50 billion that G.M. borrowed was given to the Treasury in the form of stock, which the government hopes to recoup from money raised through a public offering.
 Government officials and Fritz Henderson, the company's chief, have wanted G.M. to become a public company as soon as 2010. Mr. Whitacre, however, suggested that it could take longer, saying that the timing of a public offering ''depends on how quickly we become profitable. I think I can see that on the horizon, but I can't promise an exact date.''
 Mr. Whitacre, a former chairman and chief executive at AT&T who came out of retirement in July to lead G.M.'s post-bankruptcy board, said the company was ''much better positioned for success than I thought was possible back in July.'' 
 G.M., though it does not have to follow financial reporting regulations while it is privately held, plans to detail its recent financial performance later this month.
 ''There is a sense of urgency at G.M. to repay the money we owe as soon as possible,'' he said. Later, while answering questions from audience members, he said, ''Can G.M. pay back its loans? You bet. I can't tell you when but it won't be very long and it's sooner than you think.''
 Mr. Whitacre spoke at Texas Lutheran University, a school of 1,400 students outside San Antonio where he taught classes after retiring from AT&T in 2007. He mainly discussed the critical role that G.M. and other manufacturers play in the United States economy. 
 He also invited any of the nearly 2,000 dealers G.M. has decided to eliminate as part of its restructuring to directly contact him. A handful of the dealers are still appealing, and many have reacted angrily to the letters they received in June telling them that they must stop selling new G.M. cars by October 2010.
 ''We're not geniuses,'' said he said. ''We might have made a mistake or two. Probably did somewhere along the way. We'd be happy to relook at any situation reevaluate it and maybe the answer comes out differently.''

PERSON: Sheldon Dorf 

HEADLINE: Sheldon Dorf, 76, Founder of Comic-Con

BYLINE: By GEORGE GENE GUSTINES

 BODY:
Sheldon Dorf, who turned his passion for comic books and newspaper strips into a vocation by founding one of the world's biggest annual comic-book conventions, died in San Diego on Nov. 3. He was 76. 
 The cause was complications of diabetes, said his brother, Michael.
Mr. Dorf started Comic-Con International in San Diego in 1970, having organized a similar show in Detroit in the '60s. 
 Generating interest was a challenge at first. After a test run with fewer than 100 attendees, the first official Comic-Con drew around 300, but it quickly expanded. The convention, which now includes previews of science-fiction films, television series and video games, has become an important fixture on Hollywood's promotional calendar. Last year 126,000 people attended the four-day event at the San Diego Convention Center, according to David Glanzer, Comic-Con's director of marketing and public relations. 
 ''This convention made a major difference in the economy of San Diego,'' said Mark Evanier, a comic-book historian who has attended the show annually since it began. It proved, he said, ''what a convention could do for the local economy and to revitalize a city.'' 
 Shel, as Mr. Dorf was known to his friends, was born in Detroit on July 5, 1933, and discovered his love of comics early. ''When we were kids, we'd go to the drugstore and try to get there the day the comic shipment arrived,'' his brother said. 
 Mr. Dorf was also an avid reader of newspaper comic strips and would send fan letters to cartoonists, including Chester Gould, who created ''Dick Tracy,'' and Milton Caniff, who created ''Terry and the Pirates'' and ''Steve Canyon.'' The boys' father once took them to Gould's home in Woodstock, Ill., Michael Dorf recalled, adding, ''This was the days before celebrity security.'' 
 It was the start of a long friendship with Mr. Gould. Mr. Dorf's ability to befriend his idols served him well in getting the comic-book convention off the ground, a task he began when his family moved to San Diego. 
 ''Shel said he was naturally very shy, but he seemed to have a preternatural ability to talk to anyone,'' said Mike Towry, who met Mr. Dorf in 1969 because of an advertisement in a pennysaver about the sale of comic books. 
 Mr. Dorf asked Mr. Towry, then 14, and two friends if they would be interested in participating in a comic convention. ''Of course we said yes,'' Mr. Towry recalled. 
 Helping to seal the deal was Mr. Dorf's ability to deliver comic-industry giants to his audience. He telephoned Jack Kirby, perhaps the industry's most influential artist, who had recently moved to Irvine, Calif., and had him speak to the boys. Later they visited him in person. 
 When Mr. Kirby created the New Gods, a race of good and evil beings on parallel worlds -- one led by the wise Highfather and the other by the despot Darkseid -- for DC Comics in 1971, he used the boys as models for the San Diego Five-String Mob, a rock band that was also a team of assassins for the fearsome Darkseid. He also used Mr. Dorf as the basis for Himon, an inventor among the New Gods. Mr. Dorf also served as the model for Thud Shelley, a football player in the ''Steve Canyon'' newspaper strip. Mr. Dorf was that strip's letterer for 14 years.
 Mr. Dorf is survived by his brother. 
 The growth of Comic-Con eventually caused Mr. Dorf to part ways with it. He described its mushrooming as ''an ordeal'' in a 2006 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune. But the convention's current organizers admire his foresight at publicly celebrating the creators of comics and his early recognition of the validity of their work as art. 
 ''It's interesting to look at this with 2009 eyes,'' Mr. Glanzer said, ''but in 1970 that wasn't the case.''

HEADLINE: Dollar's Drop Lifts Shares, Gold and Oil

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a quiet day on Wall Street: the bond market was closed for Veterans Day, and there were no economic reports on the calendar. 
 But the news that the dollar had weakened to a 15-month low set off a chain reaction that, by the end of Wednesday, had energized three pillars of the nation's economy -- stocks, gold and oil. 
 Wall Street indexes climbed higher, led by gains in financial stocks, while the price of gold reached another record and oil prices continued to rise. 
 The dollar dropped to its lowest level since 2008 and ended the day just below $1.50 against the euro, at $1.4976.
 Persistently low interest rates in the United States have meant meager returns for currency traders, who earn more when rates are high, leaving them looking to the booming stock markets for more lucrative payoffs.
 Many analysts worry that the eight-month stock rally has exaggerated the health of the broader economy. Indications that wealthy nations like the United States will continue to finance stimulus efforts, however, are luring risk-averse investors back into the stock markets. 
 On the flip side, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates close to zero for what economists predict will be at least six months has left the dollar struggling. 
 ''People want their money in anywhere but dollars right now, whether in commodities, foreign equities or equities themselves,'' said Andrew J. Neale, portfolio manager for Fogel Neale Partners.
 In Tokyo on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he considered a robust dollar an important part of an economic recovery. 
 ''I believe deeply that it's very important to the United States, to the economic health of the United States, that we maintain a strong dollar,'' Mr. Geithner said, according to news reports.
 Some analysts, however, believe that behind closed doors, policy makers in Washington are happy to see a slow and steady depreciation of the dollar. The weak dollar makes American products cheaper overseas, buoying sales, and makes imports more expensive, encouraging consumers at home to buy American. 
 On Tuesday night, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher, seemed to hint at that view, saying the drop in the dollar's value had not been ''disorderly'' and that rates were likely to remain low for an extended period, Reuters reported.
 ''Sentiment is still negative, and the comments of the Federal Reserve have only fanned the flames,'' said Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 As the dollar fell, gold reached $1,117.40 an ounce at the stock market's close on Wednesday, setting another record high as hedge fund managers and wealthy speculators continued to buy the precious metal. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended trading up 44.29 points, or 0.43 percent, at 10,291.26. The broader Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,098.51, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 15.82 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,166.90. Crude oil settled at $79.28 a barrel, up 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The zeal from strong trading days in Europe and Asia seemed to help perk up Wall Street. The FTSE 100 in Britain closed 0.69 percent higher, the DAX in Germany climbed by 0.98 percent and the CAC 40 in France increased by 0.76 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose by 1.61 percent, while the Nikkei in Japan was flat. 
 A report from China showed the country's industrial output and retail sales grew 16 percent from a year earlier, giving investors hope that the global economy was on track for recovery.
 As the market continues to rise, many investors have seemed content to ignore signs that consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the United States economy, might not grow at a rapid pace, given the country's high level of unemployment. 
 ''The consumer is still not spending well,'' Mr. Neale said. ''Until there's some sign of strength in the jobless market and housing market, then the consumer will remain on the sidelines.''

HEADLINE: Charity Bankruptcy Leaves Many Donors in Distress

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS

 BODY:
A CAUTIONARY tale for donors who entered into two time-tested, long-term giving arrangements -- charitable gift annuities and donor-advised funds -- has emerged from bankruptcy court. 
 At the National Heritage Foundation, 9,000 donor-advised funds totaling $25 million in value were wiped out under a reorganization plan approved on Oct. 16 by the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria. The money in those funds was used in part to make lump-sum payments to 107 people with charitable gift annuities at the foundation, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
People who work at charities and experts in philanthropy say the National Heritage Foundation is an outlier rather than a sign of a core problem in the sector. But even this rare event raises the possibility that in a weak economy, similar cases could follow. 
 Still, the outcome of the case highlights a legal reality that some donors don't focus on when they contribute to such funds: once given, the money belongs to the organization receiving it and it is not always clear what it may do with the funds. 
 ''By approving the use of donor-advised funds to pay creditors, the court concluded that they were assets of the bankruptcy estate,'' said Kenneth M. Misken, a lawyer with McGuireWoods in McLean, Va., who represents the seven-member creditors' committee that negotiated the plan.
 In contrast, charitable gift annuities are a liability, because in exchange for a gift, the nonprofit promises to pay a fixed amount of money annually to the donor and perhaps the surviving spouse for the rest of his or her life. 
 Richard L. Fox, a lawyer with Dilworth Paxson in Philadelphia and author of ''Charitable Giving: Taxation, Planning, and Strategies'' (Thomson Reuters, 2008), said the court's finding was unfair to donors, adding, ''I don't think any donor ever envisioned that if the charity does something that screws up its finances that the donor-advised fund is going to be invaded.'' 
 Of course, contributors to many other donor-advised funds have suffered recently, as account values plummeted. When that happens or a fund goes bust, the recipient charities lose out and the intent of donors is thwarted. 
 Jane Wilton, general counsel of the New York Community Trust, one of the country's largest community foundations, said the organization discouraged donors who regularly add funds to the accounts and make grants, rather than letting money accumulate, from taking market risks. At many donor-advised funds, contributors can recommend a variety of investment approaches.
 To set up a donor-advised fund account, contributors make an irrevocable donation to the charity offering the program -- which may be affiliated with a university, religious organization or financial institution -- and may claim an income tax deduction. After the donation, contributors can make recommendations about which charities should receive grants from the account, and the sponsoring charity generally honors their wishes. But it is not required to. 
 Maurice and Theresa Townsley of Monterey, Calif., donated cash and property totaling $1.2 million to an account with the National Heritage Foundation. They later learned that the foundation had pledged most of their donation as collateral for a bank loan taken out before the bankruptcy. With court approval, the foundation applied those funds to pay off the loan in September.
 The Townsleys, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, and eight other donors have each filed a separate case, accusing the foundation of deceiving them into making donations. The court has not yet ruled on this issue. When the foundation filed for bankruptcy protection, about 200 people with donor-advised fund accounts filed claims; all were rejected except for the nine asserting misrepresentation. 
 The foundation describes itself as providing various support services for donors and says on its Web site (www.nhf.org) that it ''has become the 'gold standard' of donor-advised funds.'' However, Kim Wright-Violich, president of the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving, said the foundation had a long history of run-ins with the Internal Revenue Service and of practices that were subsequently outlawed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
 Jan H. Ridgely, vice president of the foundation and daughter of its founder and chief executive, J. T. Houk II, said what happened to donors was ''tragic and unavoidable,'' caused by a $6.2 million judgment awarded to a Texas family that then became a creditor. The board of directors includes her mother, Marian, and brother, John T. Houk III. 
 Faced with shrunken endowments, charities are seeking to bolster giving by heavily marketing gift annuities, emphasizing the income stream they offer. Most charities base their payments on the suggested maximum rates from the American Council on Gift Annuities (available at www.acga-web.org). These are lower than those of annuities from commercial insurance carriers because gift annuities factor in an assumption that when the donor dies the charity will get about 50 percent of the initial value of the amount transferred.
 Many people holding these assets are retired. For example, the UJA-Federation of New York has about 900 annuitants whose average age is 78, said William Samers, the organization's vice president of planned giving and endowments. But he cautioned donors shopping for gift annuities that these investments are not a certainty. They are backed by the assets of the charity, and if the endowment dries up or the organization shuts, the payments will stop. In a bankruptcy case, the annuity holder becomes an unsecured creditor. 
 That's what happened to William N. Anderson, 78, a retired salesman in Traverse City, Mich., who had gift annuities with the National Heritage Foundation. Starting in 2000, he invested a total of $235,000 in three separate annuities, each paying about 8 percent annually. Together they provided monthly income to him of $1,700. 
 Under the reorganization plan, the foundation must provide each annuity holder a lump sum based on various factors. Court papers show that the total payments for all the annuitants will be $14.5 million.
 Mr. Anderson said he was disappointed that the three charities he had designated to receive whatever was left when he died will get nothing, although he has been told he will be paid $131,239 under the reorganization. 
 ''That will roughly compensate him for what he would have received had the annuity remained in effect,'' said Lawrence P. Katzenstein, a lawyer with Thompson Coburn in St. Louis, and creator of Tiger Tables Actuarial Software, which computes the value of the interests transferred and those retained through a variety of charitable giving tools. 
 To avoid getting burned, experts recommend checking a charity's track record and financial stability. The organization's tax return, called Form 990, is generally available upon request or on its Web site. Ask, too, for audited financial statements to compare assets to liabilities, including pending or recently resolved lawsuits. 
 Note that ratings of charities, like those available on charitynavigator.org, tend to be based on grant-making efficiency, rather than on how much a charity holds in its endowment to cover liabilities, said Laura H. Peebles, a director in the national office at Deloitte Tax in Washington. 
 Choose a charity that has been in the business for at least 15 years and has a reputable financial institution managing its assets, said Mr. Samers at the UJA-Federation of New York. 
 The charity must be licensed to offer annuities in any states where it issues them, and requirements vary, Mr. Fox said. (Fora state-by-state summary, see www.acga-web.org/regs/regsoverview.html) New York and California are among the more rigorous; Arizona is considerably less so. The most important criterion is how much money the charity must set aside to meet its liability -- known as the reserve fund. 
 A conservative approach, whether required by state law or applied at the charity's own initiative, is to keep more in the reserve than the charity owes. Ideally it should also have a substantial endowment. In order to back up annuities, these funds must be unrestricted, meaning they are not set aside for other purposes.

HEADLINE: Job Woes Exacting a Heavy Toll on Family Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: THE WOODLANDS, Tex. 

 BODY:
Paul Bachmuth's 9-year-old daughter, Rebecca, began pulling out strands of her hair over the summer. His older child, Hannah, 12, has become noticeably angrier, more prone to throwing tantrums. 
 Initially, Mr. Bachmuth, 45, did not think his children were terribly affected when he lost his job nearly a year ago. But now he cannot ignore the mounting evidence.
 ''I'm starting to think it's all my fault,'' Mr. Bachmuth said. 
 As the months have worn on, his job search travails have consumed the family, even though the Bachmuths were outwardly holding up on unemployment benefits, their savings and the income from the part-time job held by Mr. Bachmuth's wife, Amanda. But beneath the surface, they have been a family on the brink. They have watched their children struggle with behavioral issues and a stress-induced disorder. He finally got a job offer last week, but not before the couple began seeing a therapist to save their marriage. 
 For many families across the country, the greatest damage inflicted by this recession has not necessarily been financial, but emotional and psychological. Children, especially, have become hidden casualties, often absorbing more than their parents are fully aware of. Several academic studies have linked parental job loss -- especially that of fathers -- to adverse impacts in areas like school performance and self-esteem.
 ''I've heard a lot of people who are out of work say it's kind of been a blessing, that you have more time to spend with your family,'' Mr. Bachmuth said. ''I love my family and my family comes first, and my family means more than anything to me, but it hasn't been that way for me.''
 A recent study at the University of California, Davis, found that children in families where the head of the household had lost a job were 15 percent more likely to repeat a grade. Ariel Kalil, a University of Chicago professor of public policy, and Kathleen M. Ziol-Guest, of the Institute for Children and Poverty in New York, found in an earlier study that adolescent children of low-income single mothers who endured unemployment had an increased chance of dropping out of school and showed declines in emotional well-being. 
 In the long term, children whose parents were laid off have been found to have lower annual earnings as adults than those whose parents remained employed, a phenomenon Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, mentioned in a speech last week at New York University.
 A variety of studies have tied drops in family income to negative effects on children's development. But Dr. Kalil, a developmental psychologist and director of the university's Center for Human Potential and Public Policy, said the more important factor, especially in middle-class households, appeared to be changes in family dynamics from job loss.
 ''The extent that job losers are stressed and emotionally disengaged or withdrawn, this really matters for kids,'' she said. ''The other thing that matters is parental conflict. That has been shown repeatedly in psychological studies to be a bad family dynamic.''
 Dr. Kalil said her research indicated that the repercussions were more pronounced in children when fathers experience unemployment, rather than mothers. 
 She theorized that the reasons have to do with the importance of working to the male self-image, or the extra time that unemployed female breadwinners seem to spend with their children, mitigating the impact on them. 
 Certainly, some of the more than a dozen families interviewed that were dealing with long-term unemployment said the period had been helpful in certain ways for their families. 
 Denise Stoll, 39, and her husband, Larry, 47, both lost their positions at a bank in San Antonio in October 2008 when it changed hands. Mrs. Stoll, a vice president who managed a technology group, earned significantly more than her husband, who worked as a district loan origination manager. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Stoll took unemployment much harder than she did and struggled to keep his spirits up, before he landed a new job within several months in the Kansas City area, where the family had moved to be closer to relatives. He had to take a sizable pay cut but was grateful to be working again. 
 Mrs. Stoll is still looking but has also tried to make the most of the additional time with the couple's 5-year-old triplets, seeking to instill new lessons on the importance of thrift. 
 ''Being a corporate mom, you work a lot of hours, you feed them dinner -- maybe,'' she said. ''This morning, we baked cookies together. I have time to help them with homework. I'm attending church. The house is managed by me. Just a lot more homemaker-type stuff, which I think is more nurturing to them.''
 Other families, however, reported unmistakable ill effects.
 Robert Syck, 42, of Fishers, Ind., lost his job as a call-center manager in March. He has been around his 11-year-old stepson, Kody, more than ever before. Lately, however, their relationship has become increasingly strained, Mr. Syck said, with even little incidents setting off blowups. His stepson's grades have slipped and the boy has been talking back to his parents more.
 ''It's only been particularly in the last few months that it's gotten really bad, to where we're verbally chewing each other out,'' said Mr. Syck, who admitted he had been more irritable around the house. ''A lot of that is due to the pressures of unemployment.''
 When Mr. Bachmuth was first laid off in December from his $120,000 job at an energy consulting firm, he could not even bring himself to tell his family. For several days, he got dressed in the morning and left the house as usual at 6 a.m., but spent the day in coffee shops, the library or just walking around. 
 Mr. Bachmuth had started the job, working on finance and business development for electric utilities, eight months earlier, moving his family from Austin. They bought something of a dream home, complete with a backyard pool and spa. 
 Although she knew the economy was ultimately to blame, Mrs. Bachmuth could not help feeling angry at her husband, both said later in interviews. 
 ''She kind of had something in the back of her mind that it was partly my fault I was laid off,'' Mr. Bachmuth said. ''Maybe you're not a good enough worker.''
 Counseling improved matters significantly, but Mrs. Bachmuth still occasionally dissolved into tears at home.
 Besides quarrels over money, the reversal in the couple's roles also produced friction. Mrs. Bachmuth took on a part-time job at a preschool to earn extra money. But she still did most, if not all, of the cooking, cleaning and laundry. 
 Dr. Kalil, of the University of Chicago, said a recent study of how people spend their time showed unemployed fathers devote significantly less time to household chores than even mothers who are employed full-time, and do not work as hard in caring for children. 
 Mr. Bachmuth's time with his girls, however, did increase. He was the one dropping off Rebecca at school and usually the one who picked her up. He began helping her more with homework. He and Hannah played soccer and chatted more. 
 But the additional time brought more opportunities for squabbling. The rest of the family had to get used to Mr. Bachmuth being around, sometimes focused on his search for a job, but other times lounging around depressed, watching television or surfing soccer sites on the Internet. 
 ''My dad's around a lot more, so it's a little strange because he gets frustrated he's not at work, and he's not being challenged,'' Hannah said. ''So I think me and my dad are a lot closer nowbecause we can spend a lot more time together, but we fight a lot more maybe because he's around 24-7.''
 When Rebecca began pulling her hair out in late summer in what was diagnosed as a stress-induced disorder, she insisted it was because she was bored. But her parents and her therapist -- the same one seeing her parents -- believed it was clearly related to the job situation.
 The hair pulling has since stopped, but she continues to fidget with her brown locks.
 The other day, she suddenly asked her mother whether she thought she would be able to find a ''good job'' when she grew up.
 Hannah said her father's unemployment had made it harder for her to focus on schoolwork. She also conceded she had been more easily annoyed with her parents and her sister.
 At night, she said, she has taken to stowing her worries away in an imaginary box.
 ''I take all the stress and bad things that happen over the day, and I lock them in a box,'' she said.
 Then, she tries to sleep.

HEADLINE: The Chain Store as Patron of the Arts

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
WHEN Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts opens its new visitor atrium this month, it will also inaugurate Target Free Thursdays: free concerts featuring professionals from Lincoln Center organizations like the New York City Opera and the New York Philharmonic as well as performances by students from the Juilliard School and other artists. 
 On Nov. 21, El Museo del Barrio started Target Super Sabado, which provides free tickets on the third Saturday of every month for exhibitions, concerts, gallery tours, art-making workshops, film screenings and spoken word recitals. 
And Alvin Ailey's American Dance Theater's celebration of the 20th anniversary of its artistic director, Judith Jamison, includes Target Twenty Night on Dec. 3, a performance for which every ticket is $20. Tickets went on sale Oct. 3; people started lining up at midnight; the box office opened at 9 a.m. and the performance was sold out by noon.
 These programs are among many that Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, has made available recently to cultural organizations all over the country. Despite an economic downturn that has seen many corporations and foundations cut back or eliminate their charitable giving, the company has maintained its philanthropy -- giving 5 percent of its income, or $3 million a week, to causes in the arts, education, social services and volunteerism. 
 Applying its brand message -- ''Expect More. Pay Less'' -- Target is sponsoring more than 2,200 free days and reduced price performances at 100 museums and performing arts organizations nationwide, from the Seattle Art Museum to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., to the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Calif.
 ''Target is an unusual company in the magnitude of its cash support for the arts,'' said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center. ''They back it up with a significant amount of advertising. There is a strong identity of a national company and lots of notice around it.'' 
 Mr. Levy, an expert on nonprofit fund-raising, said the retailer's support has become essential to arts groups ''at a time when companies are struggling with respect to their earnings.'' 
 The Minneapolis-based Target Corporation, which has more than 1,600 stores nationwide, has been supporting cultural institutions since 1946. ''We remain committed to the arts and committed to making it affordable to families,'' said Laysha Ward, the company's president for community relations. 
 The danger with any corporate sponsorship is that the company might place restrictions on the nature of the art. Ms. Ward said that while Target was careful to select programs that fit with its image, it did not involve itself in artistic content. ''We're not looking to censor,'' she said, adding that Target does not dictate what a cultural organization ''should and shouldn't present.''
 In an effort to make the arts accessible to schoolchildren and cultural experiences affordable for children and families, the company pays for trips to the theater or symphony, for artists' residencies and for workshops in schools. In 2009, more than 1,100 of its recipients of grants for field trips will attend an arts-related outing, including visits to museums, music halls and theaters. 
 As part of its ''Dream in Color'' campaign, Target has announced its sponsorship of five Congressionally designated heritage months at the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies: Hispanic Heritage (Sept. 15-Oct. 15), American Indian Heritage (November), Black History (February), Women's History (March) and Asian Pacific American Heritage (May). The events include performances, discussions, films and classroom resources.
 Target is the main supporter of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's community programs, including its annual Halloween extravaganza and the BAMkids Film Festival. 
 ''They've been an ongoing partner,'' said Karen Brooks Hopkins, the president of BAM. ''They've continued to be supportive, and they've continued to work with us on the composition of the programs.'' 
 The free events have become a Target signature -- Friday nights at the Museum of Modern Art, Monday nights at the Chicago Children's Museum, Saturday nights at the Brooklyn Museum. 
 The company sponsors $1 Friday nights at the Boston Children's Museum, and it pays for free general admission on the first Sunday of every month, with family programs, at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Attendance at the Studio Museum in Harlem has doubled as a result of Target Free Sundays, and the retailer is preparing to open a store in Harlem.
 ''Our goals and Target's goals lined up around this issue of access -- providing free, no-barriers access to arts and culture,'' said Thelma Golden, director of the museum. ''To make the museum part of the day-to-day life of our neighborhood has allowed our audience to see the museum as a place they can come to again and again.
 ''It opens up the possibility for different groups of people to find each other,'' Ms. Golden added. ''They are families from the neighborhood looking for something to do with their children, people who come after their worship services.'' 
 IN Long Beach, Calif., the company sponsors free exhibits at the Museum of Latin American Art, including performances in the sculpture garden, workshops, lectures and youth programs.
 It also supports free park concerts by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. In February, the Phoenix Symphony held the fifth annual Music in the Park, a free event that included jazz, drumming, flamenco and urban funk.
 The company supports the Millennium Stage at the Kennedy Center in Washington, which presents free daily performances. And at Target Play Dates at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, children can participate in a free theater workshop while parents watch a reduced-priced matinee. 
 The company's support also extends to design. In October, it granted a $10,000 sponsorship to the Architecture + Design Education Network, an affiliate of the Association of Architecture Organizations, which works to educate the public about the architectural environment. 
 In part, the company seeks to honor the creativity it values in its own stores, Ms. Ward said, like the work of designers including the architect Michael Graves. ''He's designed teapots to toilet brushes for us,'' Ms. Ward said. ''Art is integral to how we do business. It's in our DNA.''

HEADLINE: Two-Year Colleges, Swamped, No Longer Welcome All

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Sonja Taylor applied to LaGuardia Community College this summer with every expectation of being admitted. She planned to study business, bringing her closer to her dream of owning a restaurant.
 But her application arrived in August, after the college had closed the floodgates because of a surge of interest from prospective students. So Ms. Taylor, 20, became one of thousands of students shut out this fall as most of New York City's community colleges were forced to abandon their all-are-welcome admissions policies for the first time.
 ''Enrollment has been growing steadily, but this was a tidal wave for us this fall,'' said the college's president, Gail O. Mellow, pointing out that the student body had risen by almost 50 percent in the past decade. ''I've never seen anything like this. We used to pretty much be an open door.'' 
 Historically, the city's six community colleges, which are part of the City University of New York, have taken applications until about a week before the start of classes, allowing time for students to apply for financial aid, get immunized and register for classes. 
 But this year, all but one of them had to close admissions earlier.
 LaGuardia stopped accepting applications on July 30. The Borough of Manhattan Community College stopped in late June, while Bronx, Hostos and Queensborough Community Colleges cut off applications in the first half of August. Kingsborough Community College did not change the application period.
 Applications to the community colleges for the 2010 spring semester are up 19 percent from the same time last year. LaGuardia, which has 52,000 students, including 17,500 degree-seeking students, has imposed a Nov. 15 deadline for spring applications. 
 For years the colleges have offered an affordable avenue to higher education for low-income students, many of them the first in their families to attend college. The only requirements are a high school or graduate-equivalency diploma. So the early cutoffs caught many, including Ms. Taylor, off guard.
 ''During these times I need some type of college degree in order to get a good job,'' she said. ''I was disappointed because it's a really good college and it's right there. It's close to my home.''
 The State University of New York also saw a spike in applications to its community colleges, with Suffolk County Community College reporting a 20 percent jump in enrollment over last fall. The two-year colleges did not restrict enrollments across the board, but some limited registrations in certain programs like nursing, said Megan Galbraith, a SUNY spokeswoman. Many colleges increased class sizes and added class sections. 
 Across the country, many community colleges have felt similar pressures. The battered economy drove many workers back to school to retool their skills, while others have eschewed a four-year degree in favor of a more affordable two-year program.
 Education experts say that the Obama administration also put the nation's 1,200 community colleges on the radars of more students this summer. Praising the colleges' role in developing the work force, President Obama called for $12 billion in new federal financing for community colleges and set a goal of five million more graduates by 2020. 
 While such money would go a long way toward meeting that goal, for now community colleges, like all publicly financed colleges, are struggling with budget cuts just as they face the greatest demands. 
 ''The community college is a second-chance institution for the country,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. ''Most people would agree that this is not a good time in terms of the economic competitiveness of the country to be turning people away.'' 
 Last month, Gov. David A. Paterson proposed midyear budget cuts for many state agencies. Higher education would be hit especially hard. CUNY's chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, said the cuts would result in a ''deficiency of about $9 million in operating aid'' to the community colleges.
 Dr. Goldstein said he faced a ''moral dilemma'': turning away students who may have nowhere else to go, or continually expanding enrollments but jeopardizing quality. 
 At the Borough of Manhattan Community College, the president, Antonio Perez, said the decision to close enrollment on June 22, which the admissions office announced on its Web site a week earlier, had been difficult. ''It's almost like trying to stop a large ship in the middle of the ocean,'' he said. ''I expect we will be turning away students next semester as well.''
 A new community college that CUNY has been planning for a few years is still on track. But the college, which is scheduled to open in 2011 or 2012 on the West Side of Manhattan with only about 3,000 students, would not do much to alleviate overcrowding in the rest of the system. 
 At LaGuardia, signs abound of a college under stress. Classes now begin as early as 6:45 a.m. The line for the 170 computer work stations in the library can snake around the stacks at lunch time, and the wait sometimes stretches to 45 minutes. 
 Still, Ms. Taylor, who plans to apply for the spring semester, is eager to join the throng. She is now working on commission as a telemarketer, making cold calls for a company selling credit card terminals. ''I can make 200 calls and probably sell four products the whole day,'' she said.

HEADLINE: In Surprise, Lou Dobbs Quits CNN

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER and BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Months ago the president of CNN/U.S., Jonathan Klein, offered a choice to Lou Dobbs, the channel's most outspoken anchor. Mr. Dobbs could vent his opinions on radio and anchor an objective newscast on television, or he could leave CNN. 
 For a time, Mr. Dobbs did tone down his TV rhetoric, but on Wednesday he made a more drastic decision: He chose opinion. 
 Mr. Dobbs told viewers that he was resigning from his CNN job immediately. Sitting before an image of an American flag on his studio set, he said ''some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN and to engage in constructive problem solving as well as to contribute positively to the great understanding of the issues of our day.'' 
 He remained vague about how he would contribute ''to the national conversation,'' saying that he was considering ''a number of options and directions.'' 
 The abrupt announcement caught even some of his closest staff members by surprise. They were told about the decision only hours before Mr. Dobbs's 7 p.m. program. CNN, a unit of Time Warner, said it would name a replacement for Mr. Dobbs on Thursday morning. 
 Mr. Klein said in a statement that ''Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere.'' 
 ''All of us will miss his appetite for big ideas, the megawatt smile and larger than life presence he brought to our newsroom,'' he said. 
 Mr. Klein and Mr. Dobbs declined interview requests. 
 Well known for his opposition to illegal immigration, Mr. Dobbs was an outlier at CNN, which has sought to be seen as the neutral turf of cable news.
 ''If CNN wants to be seen as the thoughtful, unbiased, middle of the road alternative to Fox News on the right and MSNBC on the left, this decision goes along with that,'' said Geneva Overholser, the director of the School of Journalism at the University of Southern California.
 She said the anchor's decision also makes sense ''if he really wants to be Lou Dobbs, man of opinion.''
 Mr. Dobbs's show drew an average of 631,000 viewers in October, putting him in third place behind Fox News and MSNBC. Like those for other CNN programs, his ratings have declined in recent months.
 His contract was not to expire until the end of 2011, people with knowledge of his deal said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because contract information is typically treated confidentially. Mr. Dobbs told viewers that Mr. Klein had agreed to release him from his contract early. 
 People inside CNN have speculated for months that Mr. Dobbs could pick up and move to another network, a possibility that gained momentum in September when he met with Roger Ailes, the chairman of the Fox News Channel. 
 At the time Mr. Dobbs was characterized by people close to him as a potential hire for the Fox Business Network. But a Fox representative said Wednesday, ''We have not had any discussions with Lou Dobbs for Fox News or Fox Business.'' 
 Mr. Dobbs quit CNN once before, in 1999, after disputes with the network's president at the time, Rick Kaplan. That time, he also exited midweek, on a Tuesday. He became the chief executive of Space.com, an astronomy news source, but returned to the network two years later. 
 ''I'm grateful for the many opportunities that CNN has given me over these many years,'' Mr. Dobbs said, noting that he is ''the last of the original anchors here on CNN.'' 
 Over the years Mr. Dobbs evolved from being a sober business anchor to a commentator who labeled himself ''Mr. Independent.'' The issues at the top of his agenda -- ones that he mentioned again on Wednesday in explaining his departure -- include immigration policy, the growth of the country's middle class, climate change, and the military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. He had saved his most ideological remarks for his afternoon radio show, which made its debut in March 2008. It is on the radio show that he talked repeatedly about the conspiracy theory claims that President Obama is not a United States citizen. When he mentioned the citizenship issue on CNN over the summer, he raised the ire of his bosses and provoked criticism from progressive groups. 
 More recently, his coverage of immigration provoked protests by Hispanic groups. On Wednesday one of the groups, Presente.org, which had called on CNN to fire the anchor, declared a ''victory.''
 Roberto Lovato, a co-founder of the group, said, ''We are thrilled that Dobbs no longer has this legitimate platform from which to incite fear and hate.''
 Speaking on CNN Wednesday, Mr. Dobbs said he would strive to strengthen the public discourse from an as-yet-unnamed podium. 
 ''As for the important work of restoring inspiration to our great free society and our market economy, I will strive as well to be a leader in that national conversation,'' he said.
 He concluded his last CNN broadcast by saying, ''I'll see you next on the radio.''
 Then he crossed 58th Street in Midtown Manhattan, walked into an Irish pub frequented by colleagues and was greeted with a round of applause.

HEADLINE: When Jet Lag Comes With the Freebies

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT was really easy to convert my frequent flier miles into a free round-trip business-class ticket to Europe.
 Just kidding. It was a nightmare. The United Airlines Web site said no, that was the craziest thing it ever heard of anyone trying to do. The customer service representative who answered the phone also kept saying no, no, no, no until, in desperation, I made it clear that if necessary I was willing to add more than 200,000 miles and throw in such deal sweeteners as my engagement ring and my firstborn (sorry, Zoe). Woo-hoo! This was the first and possibly only time I'd ever fly in comfort to Europe.
 I made the most of it both ways. The return flight was even better than going over, though, because by then I was a pro. The instant I boarded in London, I started fiddling with all the buttons in the commodious armrest -- massage function, I'll never forget you -- and loaded up on as much free stuff as possible: travel socks, warm nuts and Champagne. When someone I knew from home coincidentally boarded a few minutes later and headed back to economy, it only heightened the ecstasy for me. 
 It wasn't until I staggered off the plane in San Francisco nearly 10 hours later, clinking down the gangplank or whatever they call it with my bags stuffed full of eye masks, mini Toblerone chocolates and travel toothbrushes, that I realized there was a problem. It hit me suddenly: exhaustion, a wad of fuzz in my brain, persistent waves of nausea. And it made no sense that it was so painfully bright outdoors at, I checked my watch ... 2 p.m.?
 Jet lag. After eight days of travel through three foreign countries, it finally laid me low. It's one of those purely modern problems we've created for ourselves with our fancy technology. I wonder if Charles Lindbergh was the first to suffer, after flying overseas in the Spirit of St. Louis across all those time zones that travelers once traversed decorously by sea to allow the biological clock to adjust more gracefully.
 At home that first night, I congratulated myself on staying awake until 8 p.m. local time before falling into a deep, black, dreamless sleep that lasted a thousand years. I awoke, refreshed and yet completely disoriented, to look at the bedside clock.
 It was 3 a.m.
 There are a lot of things you can do at that hour when your circadian rhythms are out of whack (believe me, I've become an expert, after nearly a week of suffering like this), and some of my favorites include sorting laundry, ironing napkins and sitting bolt upright in a chair in a dark room while staring in despair at a wall.
 But none of that would be so bad if there weren't a flip side to my predicament; by day, I am seized unexpectedly by an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep wherever I am. On Tuesday, a sudden-onset nap in the parking lot at the supermarket gave me new insight into the plight of my grandmother, a narcoleptic famously prone to pulling off the road in a panic. She would abruptly throw the car into park and nod off without further comment.
 I tried to tough out my situation. I even gave myself little pep talks (again, at 3 a.m.) about how great it was, finally, to suffer from a malady that, while annoying, at least wasn't a direct side effect of aging. My friend Molly, who lives in England, had recently told me that her daughter, who was then 3, had needed weeks to adjust back to local time after a trans-Atlantic flight.
 Weeks.
 Weeks?
 Another thing you can do at 3 a.m. is look up all the names of jet lag researchers -- and I mean all of them, every one in the world, as well as all their parents' names and all their parents' names, and it's still barely 3:45 -- and wonder if they would be upset if you called for advice in the middle of the night. I mean, it's their job, right?
 Or you can write them an e-mail message, containing a lot of jet-lag induced typos (''Would you like to set an time to talk?''), mistakes you notice only after you hit the send button.
 Then you can wait until a decent hour, at which time you can finally talk on the phone to Dr. David Neubauer, who is the associate director of the Johns Hopkins University Sleep Disorder Center. 
 ''Is it always this bad?'' I asked him.
 There are a few rules of thumb. Traveling west can be easier on the system than going east, but only if you're passing through a few time zones like, say, from New York to California. Humans are wired to be most alert in the early evening, so if you arrive in a time zone that's three hours earlier than the one you're used to, your biological clock is more likely to adjust gracefully and allow you to stay up later without ill effect. An eight-hour shift, though, like the one I experienced from Europe to California, will do you in.
 But for a person like me, who traveled through eight time zones, preventive measures would have been the best bet. Sleeping extra hours for a few days before a long trip makes it easier, after you arrive, to adjust. Before going to Europe, I should have aimed for a few nights of at least eight hours of sleep. (''Most people only get six or seven,'' Dr. Neubauer said, ''so several nights of eight will give you sleep in the bank.'')
 After jet lag sets in, the best cures are light exposure and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the biological clock. In general, the best thing to do is to be up and outdoors during daylight hours to help your body adjust.
 But someday soon, there may be an app for that. 
 Daniel Forger, a mathematician at the University of Michigan who has been working with sleep researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston to develop a software program to alleviate jet lag, says that the right routine can cut recovery time in half.
 If you tell the software the direction you're traveling, the number of hours' difference in time zones at your destination and what your schedule will be when you arrive, Professor Forger said, ''it will tell you when to go outside and get a lot of light, and when to stay in and go to sleep.'' 
 But the software probably won't be publicly available for another five years, he said. It's a time frame that sounded perfectly reasonable to me because it will take me at least that long to save up enough frequent flier miles for business class.

STROLLER RECALL 
 Stirs Park Slope
 There are two major health threats in Park Slope, Brooklyn, at the moment, if you believe some of the neighborhood's young and hyper-conscientious parents. 
 ''There's swine flu and Maclaren strollers,'' said Dara Kass, a mother of two, at a Starbucks on Seventh Avenue.
 In Park Slope, where baby buggies create traffic jams on the picturesque sidewalks, a palpable sense of anxiety ensued after the Maclaren stroller company announced a voluntary recall on Monday of about one million strollers after the fingertips of 12 children in the United States were amputated in the hinges of its foldable model.
 ''This is an alarmist neighborhood, so people are going to be anti-Maclaren until they fix the problem,'' said Ms. Kass, who added that she had received countless frantic calls and e-mail messages from friends and relatives.
 Maclaren is sending out safety kits with a protective shield for the hinges. But after the reports surfaced, several parents said they could not access the company's Web site to register for them. 
 Ms. Kass, who owns four strollers for her two children, who are 2 weeks and 2 years old, said she would not use either of her two Maclaren strollers until she received the parts. 
 Other parents in the neighborhood seemed to share her concerns. ''You do wonder sometimes, are we being overly worried?'' Jessica Carey said while browsing in the Barnes & Noble bookstore on Seventh Avenue. ''But having a baby, I know literally anything can go wrong.''
 Ms. Carey said she had planned to buy a Maclaren stroller this week for her 5-month-old. But because of the recall, she said, she would wait.
 Brynne Sterling, who was walking with her 16-month-old child on Seventh Avenue, said a friend had e-mailed her about the recall. ''I just read the words 'amputated fingers,' '' she said, with a cringe. ''I went ahead and registered right away.''ANDREW KEH
 TAKING
 QUESTIONS
 This week on the blog, Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, is answering readers' questions about citywide entrepreneurship initiativeslike . Here is an excerpt:
 Q. What do you say about all the choice business ending up in Jersey City, Hoboken and Newark? New Jersey seems to have a better formula.
 A. While New Jersey and the rest of the region are, of course, home to a number of important corporations, New York City remains an unrivaled business center.
 For instance, the city is home to more than 40 Fortune 500 companies. It is home to more fashion companies than Paris. Media companies headquartered here generate approximately half the nation's revenue in magazines, books and broadcast television, and a quarter of the nation's revenue in newspapers and cable television. 
 The city's small businesses -- there are more than 225,000 with fewer than 100 employees -- are equally important, making up 98 percent of its business enterprises.

HEADLINE: Shopping for Clothing, Donating Time

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
IN the newly expanded Banana Republic store opening in New York City's SoHo district this month, shoppers may be surprised to discover, amid the displays of red double-breasted peacoats and cowl neck sweaters, a representative from a local volunteer group asking if they would like to donate some time. Think of it as consumerism meets volunteerism.
 Beginning with events on Nov. 13 and 14 at five of its New York City stores, including the SoHo location, the retailer will introduce a new charitable concept by trying to play matchmaker between its customers and dozens of organizations where they might like to volunteer. Representatives from groups like Project Sunshine, Free Arts NYC and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York can recruit shoppers to work for their respective causes, and perhaps give them something more to think about than whether to head home with one of those cashmere striped hoodies. 
''Fashion is important to our customers, but it's not the only thing they care about in their lives,'' said Jack Calhoun, president of Banana Republic. ''Our customers are pretty involved in their communities.''
 The program, called One+All, is being coordinated with ServiceNation, a public service campaign that promotes volunteerism in America, and it will be expanded to other cities beginning next year, according to Banana Republic. 
 The idea to connect shoppers with charities or volunteer groups in their own neighborhoods appealed to Banana Republic executives as an extension of its new efforts to make its stores more inviting to local people, whether in New York or California or Ohio.
 For example, the new design prototype in SoHo, which is also being tested in the company's Scottsdale and Las Vegas stores, has a residential feel, with smaller sales areas to fit various wardrobe needs, rather than the open, cookie-cutter mall layouts of the past. Merchandise is tailored to fit the neighborhood, with more casual clothes for downtown shoppers and suggestions available for what to wear to dinner, say, at Balthazar around the corner.
 Mr. Calhoun said that employees at many of its stores had independently organized charity campaigns in the past, like a group in Kansas City, Mo., that had adopted a local family for the holidays. Gap Inc., Banana Republic's parent company, has a corporate culture that encourages volunteerism, said Mr. Calhoun, who serves on the national board of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and on the board of San Francisco Opera.
 But the One+All campaign will go further, he said, in that the Banana Republic staff will actually be training executives from volunteer groups by showing them what they do best, which is how to sell a product.
 ServiceNation represents a coalition of 240 organizations, including groups that benefit a broad range of causes, like Habitat for Humanity, Dress for Success, the Boys & Girls Club of America, God's Love We Deliver and Mentoring USA.
 Matching potential volunteers with causes that most engage them personally has historically been a challenge for nonprofits, but a bigger issue for many of them since the start of the recession has been that they have had to pare down their skilled employees, like lawyers and accountants, said Greg Propper, the executive director of ServiceNation. Since Banana Republic caters to a largely professional clientele, those organizations may be able to find volunteers there who have just the skills they need.
 ''When a customer walks into a Banana Republic store, they'll feel almost like they are at a mini-volunteer fair,'' Mr. Propper said. 
 Banana Republic executives, well-versed in pushing the merits of lightweight wool blazers or crewneck cardigans, are training the volunteer representatives on how to make an ''elevator speech,'' Mr. Propper said, ''a quick pitch to identify their needs, made in the time it would take to get from the lobby to your office.
 ''If you signed up to work with Habitat for Humanity, the first instinct might be to hand you a paint brush to paint a house,'' he said, ''but you may be really good at accounting.''
 During the first events in New York, the charities will be spread out in five stores, each for about 90 minutes. At the SoHo flagship at 552-554 Broadway, customers can learn about opportunities at the Red Cross, Baby Buggy and Catholic Charities USA, while the Hetrick-Martin Institute and the Citizens Advice Bureau will be making competing pitches at the store at 1976 Broadway on the Upper West Side. It's like speed-dating for volunteers. 
 ''Our goal is to engage every segment of life in volunteer service, whether at colleges, places of worship or at retail,'' Mr. Propper said. ''Everybody has a role to play. Everybody can do something.''

HEADLINE: L.I. Harvests May Signal A Comeback for Scallops

BYLINE: By SINDYA N. BHANOO

DATELINE: GREENPORT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Bone-tired but grinning, Peter Wenczel and his son Ben eased their 26-foot work boat toward the dock here one recent afternoon, its deck piled high with bags of scallops. 
 ''We got limit!'' Ben Wenczel, 22, shouted, referring to the state's daily limit of 10 bushels per person for commercial scallop fishing.
 For the baymen of Long Island's eastern shore, out in force this month in their orange waterproof jumpsuits and knee-high galoshes, the November opening of the scallop season has not always been so rewarding. 
 Beginning in 1985, multiple surges in toxic marine algae known as brown tide have decimated Peconic Bay's scallop population, resulting in years of dismal, economically devastating harvests.
 But last year, the baymen realized that the scallops might finally be making a comeback. The yield was more than three times that of 2007, and this year's harvest is expected to be at least as good if not better, scientists working in the area say. 
 The recovery resulted partly from dedicated efforts by scientists to rebuild the scallop population, said Stephen Tettelbach, a professor of biology at Long Island University.
 Dr. Tettelbach is in the fifth year of a five-year, $2.3 million bay scallop restoration project, financed by Suffolk County, that has released nearly five million scallops into Peconic Bay waters. Working with researchers from Cornell Cooperative Extension -- a university outreach group -- and the State University at Stony Brook, Dr. Tettelbach has helped create densely packed scallop sanctuaries, primarily in Orient Harbor, Hallock Bay and Flanders Bay. 
 Part of their strategy is to increase the rate of spawning and fertilization. ''Successful fertilization occurs when scallops are released into the water column close together,'' he said. 
 In a separate effort, the Nature Conservancy in New York has released hundreds of thousands of baby scallops into the Peconic Bay since 2002.
 Yet, considerable mystery still surrounds the onset and the waning of brown tide, said Christopher J. Gobler, a professor at Stony Brook who studies toxic algae.
 Scientists know that the toxins in brown tide, which tints the water a coffee brown, slow the rhythmic movements of scallop gills and prevent feeding. Brown tide also blocks sunlight from reaching the bay's bottom, where eelgrass beds grow and scallops nest.
 More perplexing is why brown tide comes and goes. It generally blooms in stagnant estuaries that are not regularly flushed with fresh waters and in those where nitrogen concentrations are higher. 
 ''We know if a water body is more likely to get brown tide,'' Dr. Gobler said. ''But it can also break suddenly, and we have no idea why.'' 
 In the late 1990s, nitrogen levels in Peconic Bay dropped to 0.2 milligrams from 0.4 milligrams per liter, and brown tide faded away, but scientists are not sure why the nitrogen decreased, he said.
 Dr. Gobler hypothesized that the rise in nitrogen levels in the 1980s was related to fertilizers used in potato farming that may have entered the groundwater and then run off into the bay. Many potato farms have since been replaced by vineyards, which use less fertilizer, he said. 
 But after testing, he found that nitrogen levels in local groundwater had not changed in most places and had increased in some areas. 
 Dr. Gobler is now involved in a new federally financed effort to determine why brown tide blooms occur when nitrogen levels are high.
 For now, regardless of the science, the Long Island baymen are simply happy to enjoy a brown-tide-free Peconic. 
 On opening day of the scallop season, which ends in March, the Wenczels drove their catch to the Southold Fish Market in a pickup. Euphoria reigned in the back room, where baymen cheered one another on as they raced to shuck scallops. Cries of ''Knock 'em off!'' were heard as they slid the butterlike meat into buckets.
 Scientists predict that this year's Peconic Bay harvest will amount to tens of thousands of pounds, meager compared with the hundreds of thousands of pounds caught in the 1970s and early '80s. 
 But to a new generation of baymen like Ben Wenczel, for whom bountiful harvests are a marvel, hope is growing that scallop fishing will re-emerge as a reliable source of fall and winter income. His first 10 bushels, about 80 pounds, sold for $12 a pound, bringing in nearly $1,000. The cash will help to cover the rent on the apartment he shares with his girlfriend, he said.
 Another bayman, Gregory Winters, 19, said he would use the profits to pay his tuition at Suffolk County Community College, where he is studying criminal justice. 
 His father, Peter Winters, 46, surveyed the scene while sipping a bottle of beer, his scallops already shucked. ''Maybe it's coming back,'' he said. ''We hope so.''

HEADLINE: A Patchwork of Food Assistance for Pets

BYLINE: By CARLA BARANAUCKAS

 BODY:
ANIMAL shelters have reported a steep rise in the number of cats and dogs being surrendered as owners face unemployment, home foreclosures, evictions and other financial hardships. But animal welfare groups and even churches are stepping up with bags of kibble and containers of cat litter to help owners keep their pets and to prevent more from being sent to shelters, and sometimes death.
 No national network coordinates pet food assistance. Instead, efforts have sprung up at a grass-roots level as individuals and groups have recognized the problem. The means of offering aid to pet owners varies with each organization. The Humane Society of the United States keeps a long list of programs on its Web site headlined ''Having Trouble Affording Your Pet?'' And the society acknowledges that there are probably many more programs the organization is not aware of.
The Tree House Humane Society in Chicago, which focuses on cats, has provided food assistance for more than 30 years, said Ollie Davidson, the society's programs manager. 
 The society, which also provides food for dogs, has seen demand almost double over the last year, giving out more than 44,000 pounds of pet food this year, Mr. Davidson said. About 20 percent of the food distributed was for dogs and about 80 percent for cats. If current trends continue, the organization expects the number of those receiving pet food assistance to grow to 200 next year, from 157.
 ''Most of our food is coming from donations of people,'' Mr. Davidson said, but with the sharp increase in demand the organization is applying for grants to help cover the costs.
 Mr. Davidson said the grant applications emphasize that the food aid program is about much more than feeding hungry animals. ''We're helping people,'' he said. ''In times of stress, it's always good to keep people with their pets.''
 Jennifer Fulton, president of the Northland Pet Food Pantry in Kansas City, Mo., said the demand was huge. ''We started giving out food in May of this year, and the response has been incredible,'' she said. ''We had people feeding their pets before they were feeding themselves.'' But now 155 families with pets are being helped. 
 PAWS Chicago, a no-kill animal shelter, started a crisis-care program and a food bank last year, ''when we saw the whole real estate thing happening and people were losing their homes,'' said Paula Fasseas, who founded the organization in 1997. The organization provides temporary foster care for pet owners who are struggling because of the economy. In addition, the shelter has worked with the Petco Foundation, providing dog or cat food and litter for up to three months, said Rochelle Michalek, executive director of the shelter. 
 Sandra Jauga, a maintenance worker in Chicago who said she had been out of work since falling off a ladder this year, turned to PAWS Chicago for help when her workers' compensation claim was denied. Ms. Jauga, a single mother of four, said Roxy, her beagle-pit bull, would not be able to eat without the aid. ''I'm really grateful for the help,'' she said. ''If you have to get rid of the dog, what's going to happen with the dog? Where is it going to go?''
 With a mission of making Chicago a no-kill city, the shelter visits Chicago's animal pounds regularly to rescue animals that have not been reclaimed or adopted. By providing pet food to people facing financial hardship, the organization is trying to keep more animals from being surrendered to the pounds.
 For its part, the Petco Foundation has been involved with pet-food banks since it began in 1999, said Paul Jolly, the executive director. ''We have always been involved in the food bank concept simply because it keeps people with their animals.''
 Mr. Jolly said that Hurricane Katrina was a drastic lesson for the country about how strong the bond between people and their pets can be. ''Katrina pointed out that pets are part of the family, too,'' he said.
 The Petco Foundation, based in San Diego, has partnerships for pet-food assistance with about 75 organizations across the country. In January, the foundation is introducing a program with Feeding America, a hunger-relief charity whose members supply food to more than 25 million Americans each year. 
 Under the program, ''We Are Families Too,'' 750 Petco stores will have bins where customers can donate pet food, Mr. Jolly said. In addition, the foundation will supplement the donations with food from Petco and other vendors. Distributors will often donate food approaching its expiration date.
 Help is also available from tiny, grass-roots organizations in smaller towns. 
 The Young at Heart pet rescue of Palatine, Ill., which focuses on finding homes for cats and dogs over age 5, established Nina's Pet Food Pantry with a donation from Steve and Laurie Weiner of Buffalo Grove, Ill., in memory of their Portuguese water dog, Nina. The pantry collects donated kibble from individuals and pet-food distributors, mixes the various brands and types of food and repackages it in plastic zip-top bags for distribution at two human food banks, said Karen Ortolano, a spokeswoman for the organization. (Combining the food assures a uniform quality and makes it easier for the animal to make the transition to what the group calls its ''rescue mix.'')
 After Nina died about a year ago, Mr. Weiner said he could understand the pain of separating from a family pet. ''I'm thrilled that dozens of pets don't know how close they came to having their lives changed,'' he said, adding that a relationship with a pet is a 24/7 commitment for the life of the pet. ''You don't move away from them or they don't go off to college,'' he said. His family continues to help with the pantry program, staying involved in the rebagging of the food. ''Just last week I was knee-deep in pet food with latex gloves on, sifting and sorting,'' he said. 
 Some of the food-pantry programs encourage or even require pet owners to spay or neuter their pets. Spay and Neuter Kansas City is one group that makes pet altering a requirement. Gloria Harris, pet outreach program manager, said the organization provides low-cost spaying and neutering services for low-income pet owners. If there is not enough money to feed a pet, there probably is not enough for a litter of puppies or kittens, she said.
 In October, the organization held its ''doggy food raiser,'' collecting 12,000 pounds of the 20,000 pounds of food it will distribute this year, Ms. Harris said. 
 Part of the campaign was tied to the Kansas City Chiefs-Philadelphia Eagles National Football League game this season. Fans were asked to pledge a bag of dog food every time the Chiefs sacked Philadelphia's quarterback, Michael Vick. Although the quarterback was sacked only once, 500 pounds of food was collected. 
 But the pet-food banks are not simply the work of animal welfare groups. Northeast Community Lutheran Church in the urban core of Minneapolis serves about 300 people a month at its Little Kitchen Food Shelf, according to its Web site. But the church, which also provides vaccines for companion animals, found that people struggling financially also needed food for their pets. Now people are also offered food for their pets.
 ''We know that pets being dropped off at humane societies tend to be on the rise in this current economy, so its obvious that pets are suffering,'' said the Rev. Craig Pederson, the pastor.
 Jennifer Schultz, coordinator of the Little Kitchen, said she knew the demand was great because the church had received calls from people who live in the suburbs and needed help feeding pets.
 Dwayne Pough, a Chicago cook who has been out of work for several months, said help from PAWS Chicago made a big difference for his American Staffordshire, Malachi. ''Man, it was crucial because he's a big dog and he eats a lot,'' Mr. Pough said. ''I get food stamps, and you can't buy dog food with food stamps. Actually, I was down to my last bag with maybe two more feedings when they came through. It was a life-saver, really.''

 Re ''Home, Alone'' by Penelope Green (Home, Nov. 5):
 Find a place to live where someone had been clearly and obviously happy, purchase it for $2.12 million, renovate for another another half-million dollars and move on without ever really moving in. 
 My only empathy lies with the now extinguished hedonist hippie vibe that was, incredibly, still lingering around the place and can probably no longer be replicated in our culture at this time.

 To the Editor:
 The article about the dream house undone by divorce was a shocking waste of space.
 My husband and I also lost a loft after having worked on it for two years from raw space. We lived in it for 10 weeks. We did not divorce, as the couple in the article did.
 Yes, it is only a house. However, we did not have several million dollars going into the purchase or coming out of it. I find it insulting that The Times would use this much space to discuss how well-to-do people struggle with divorce or selling their home. In light of what ''ordinary'' people are going through, what possible value does this story have?
 It may not be ''fun'' to keep telling stories about people who are not rich, but it is the reality for most Americans.

 Re ''What the Goat's Bones Knew'' by Julie Scelfo (Currents, Nov. 5):
 What happened to a human being to make him arrive at the point where he looks at a living, feeling goat that wants to enjoy freedom and life's pleasures and sees nothing but an object to be hurt and killed to make flatware and food?
 John Gerrard's need to photograph this destructive behavior and his justification -- ''I'm an artist'' -- tell us much about the psychology of this man.
 Why are you promoting him?

 Re ''Getting Real About House Prices'' by Kate Murphy (Home, Nov. 5):
 The article quotes a Wellesley College economics professor as saying, ''The Realtor has the incentive to start high to get a bigger commission. ...''
 Nothing could be further from the truth. Why would a real estate broker want to invest time and money in trying to futilely sell something that is overpriced.?
 I have no doubt that Ms. Murphy could find any number of ''experts'' who would say the exact opposite; i.e., that real estate brokers will underprice a property in order to make a quick sale.
 For some reason, it seems that it's perfectly acceptable to impugn the integrity of real estate brokers (I am one). As with most professions, there is a range of professionalism and honesty, and to make wholesale assumptions is both facile and inaccurate.

HEADLINE: Leaving a Bank For a Foundation Proved Rewarding

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
IN 1994, Marley Kaplan saw an ad for a half-time job at a not-for-profit organization. The pay: $25,000 a year.
 That was a steep cut for a woman who had been earning a six-figure income in investment banking. And Ms. Kaplan, then 45, did not have a wealthy husband or any family money to make up the difference.
But after 14-hour days in banking, she no longer found it that interesting. When the small investment bank she had founded dissolved in 1993, Ms. Kaplan, of Paterson, N.J., gave herself a year to live off her savings and try to find a new direction. 
 She visited public schools, the Head Start preschool program and nonprofit organizations, and she interviewed at the American Chess Foundation, then a small organization with a single full-time employee. The foundation supported high-level and professional chess players, as well as Chess-in-the-Schools, a program founded in 1986 to teach chess to children from poor urban neighborhoods. 
 ''At the time, the program was helping 3,000 kids,'' she recalled. ''It would pay a chess player to go out and explain to the kids how the pieces move,'' on a budget of about $200,000 a year.
 Alan Kaufman, then the foundation director, recalled of Ms. Kaplan: ''She had no experience in nonprofits, and more important, she did not play chess. But I was very impressed by her and her references. I thought she would do a good job.''
 In 1997, the foundation changed its name to Chess-in-the-Schools and spun off other efforts. 
 There have always been people working in law, on Wall Street or elsewhere in the corporate world who were determined to work for a nonprofit organization, whatever pay cut was required. In the wake of last year's economic collapse, more people are thinking about such choices at an earlier age, said Debra Oppenheim, a partner at Phillips Oppenheim, a search firm in the not-for-profit world. 
 ''In general,'' she said, ''people looking to go into the not-for-profit world are financially secure enough the change does not affect their lifestyle.'' 
 Not so Ms. Kaplan. ''I had some savings, but after the first year, I had to change my life,'' she said. ''It was incomprehensible to people. I no longer bought expensive clothes. I stopped taking taxis. I had a good friend from college who was getting married. I could not even fly to her wedding in Chicago. My friend was really mad, but I was living month to month.'' 
 But the work thrilled her. ''Every time I see the kids, it is overwhelming to realize that what we can give them will change their lives,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ''And these kids deserve it.''
 Today Ms. Kaplan is president of Chess-in-the-Schools, which now teaches 20,000 new children a year, with an annual budget of $3 million. Since 1986, it calculates, it has taught chess to 425,000 children on the theory that the game helps them develop basic analytical skills that lead to academic success. 
 On a recent Saturday, 450 children ages 8 to 17 were playing in a chess tournament at Intermediate School 318 in Brooklyn. There was barely a sound in the room as students from schools across the city played 30-minute games, grouped by ages. 
 Helping out was Rochelle Ballantyne, 14, who learned chess from her grandmother and began playing when she was 6. When she was ready for middle school, she decided to go to I.S. 318, which is known for its chess program, even though the school was nearly an hour from her home in Brooklyn.
 Today Ms. Ballantyne is a star player, ranked among the top 10 female players under 16 in a recent national tournament. Her goal is to become a criminal defense lawyer. ''I like using ideas, and I like to talk a lot,'' she said. ''I go into New York twice a week for the College Bound program.'' 
 In addition to chess instruction, Chess-in-the-Schools offers college preparation to its young players: ''tutoring, SAT preparation and the opportunity to talk to a college counselor,'' Ms. Kaplan said. 
 The program was the brainchild of the late Faneuil Adams, a Mobil Oil executive, and the chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini. Over the years, it has gathered support, particularly from the philanthropist Lewis B. Cullman, a chess player himself, who donated $1 million in 1991 and has matched that gift every year since. 
 ''It was the concept of using chess as an educational tool that appealed to me,'' Mr. Cullman said. ''After a game, a player can go over his or her moves and study their mistakes. How many activities are there where you can go over what you did, step by step?'' 
 Some years ago, Mr. Cullman financed an annual tournament for rookie players. Someone pointed out a first grader who was a budding player, and Mr. Cullman took him on. Eventually, the child said ''checkmate,'' and ''he was in seventh heaven,'' Mr. Cullman recalled. ''I was a bit taken aback.'' The boy, Evan Alvarez, is now a sophomore at Columbia on a full scholarship.
 But college preparation is only one of the program's goals; helping children make friends is another. 
 ''I have had parents say a child can't go to so-and-so's friend's house because they don't know who or what is there,'' said Robert Romano, a teacher at Public School 226 in the Bronx, and an enthusiastic supporter of the program. ''And they don't want them out in the streets because it is dangerous. But they will let them go to play chess.'' 
 P.S. 226 has 400 students, no gym and no auditorium -- and 100 would-be chess players, said Mr. Romano, a health teacher and data specialist. 
 For these players, winning is not crucial. As Mr. Romano sat in a classroom, waiting for students to return from matches, Kadiatou Diallo, a fourth grader, appeared. 
 ''How did you do?'' he asked her. 
 ''I lost,'' she said.
 ''That's the wrong answer, '' Mr. Romano told her. ''You didn't lose. You learned.''

HEADLINE: Something to Rah-Rah-Rah About for Christmas

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
GAP is celebrating the coming holiday season with glee -- or perhaps that should be ''Glee.''
 Television advertising for the Gap division of Gap Inc. -- its first commercials for Christmas since 2006 -- takes the expression ''holiday cheer'' literally by featuring energetic young people performing as singers and cheerleaders. There is even a special Web site (cheerfactory.com), which is to go live on Thursday, where visitors will be able to send customized versions of 10 fanciful cheers to friends and family through e-mail messages, Facebook and Twitter.
 ''Glee,'' the new hit series on Fox Broadcasting, is centered on students at an Ohio high school who belong to the glee club and cheerleading squad. The show's vibrant musical numbers are best sellers on iTunes. 
 Gap is not alone in being gleeful, or cheerful, in its holiday advertising. For instance, TV commercials for Wal-Mart Stores feature a song from the musical ''Mame'' called ''We Need a Little Christmas.'' The song is sung in the show by characters who are trying to cheer themselves up before a holiday season during the Great Depression. The Wal-Mart campaign is created by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 And the J. C. Penney Company, in its national Christmas campaign, is taking ''a very upbeat tone,'' said Mike Boylson, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Penney in Plano, Tex. The Penney campaign, which carries the theme ''Giving matters,'' is created by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 What also matters is whether the Christmas campaigns from the nation's major retailers will stimulate shoppers to spend money when the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent. Most analysts are forecasting that holiday sales will be flat compared with last year.
 That would be better than a downturn, as occurred when the financial crisis shredded consumer confidence in 2008, but still disappointing given that in October retail chains posted the second consecutive month of sales increases -- their best performance in more than a year.
 The Gap campaign -- created by Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Boulder, Colo., owned by MDC Partners -- includes, in addition to the commercials, print advertisements, a presence on Facebook and a four-city tour by a troupe of cheerleaders and drummers who will ''appear in unexpected places when you least expect it,'' said Ivy Ross, executive vice president of marketing for the Gap brand at Gap in San Francisco.
 Although the development of the campaign ''started before we saw 'Glee,' '' Ms. Ross said, ''there's no accident to'' the resemblance between the series and the ads.
 ''We were very conscious of the environment we're in,'' she added, and the idea was to produce a campaign that was ''optimistic and bold,'' countering the concept that ''some people say you can't be happy this year because we're going through a crisis.''
 Because ''we're going through hard economic times,'' Ms. Ross said, the goal was ''to liberate our customers to celebrate the holidays.''
 And ''instead of holiday carols, cheers are the biggest call to action,'' she added.
 The fast pace of the commercials, and their choreographed cast members, call to mind successful Gap spots in the 1990s in which khaki-clad dancers performed to musical genres like swing.
 ''The element that is similar is the high energy,'' Ms. Ross said. ''It's saying: 'Smile a little bit, don't be burdened by what you think you should be doing. There are no shoulds.' '' 
 The Christmas campaign is the first work for Gap from Crispin Porter, which also creates ads for the Old Navy division of Gap Inc. Those ads, which feature mannequin characters known as supermodelquins, have helped fuel large sales gains at Old Navy.
 The reason Gap will resume running Christmas commercials is that ''we really felt we wanted to wait till we had something to talk about,'' Ms. Ross said.
 ''This is the time to get back on TV,'' she added, because Gap sells clothing ''that stands the test of time'' and offers ''a lot of value for your money'' -- both concerns of consumers in a tough economy.
 To underscore those messages, one commercial will promote a ''buy one, get one'' sale on merchandise from Nov. 25 to Nov. 27. 
 The dancing cheerleaders spell out the retail acronym for such sales, chanting, ''B-o-g-o!''
 At Penney, Mr. Boylson said, the Christmas campaign will also emphasize ''more things that are affordable,'' telegraphed by citing ''easy-to-understand'' sale prices for items (slippers at $19.99) rather than the percentage reduction from regular prices (slippers at 30 percent off).
 ''We do a lot of consumer research,'' Mr. Boylson said, ''and customers still want style,'' but they are being ''more prudent and selective'' in how they shop.
 ''Last year, we were reacting to the sudden drop'' in demand after it happened, he added, but for ''this year we planned it upfront'' to concentrate on value.
 Like Gap, Penney will supplement ads in traditional media with a presence in social media.
 ''We'll be leaking out our best deals'' for Nov. 27, the so-called Black Friday of big sales, on Facebook and Twitter, Mr. Boylson said. 
 And Penney will buy commercial time on YouTube on Nov. 26, Thanksgiving Day, to run its first Christmas commercial, he added.

HEADLINE: Galas Dispense With Some of the Froth

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THE world of charity galas and fund-raising parties has always been a world of fantasy and illusion: white voile-draped dinner tents, towering long-stemmed centerpieces, big society bands and black tie or tails. A little buttery beef and champagne, a winning bid for a high-ticket auction item, and blow the check dry. From museums to hospitals to foundations and other not-for-profits, it's New York's institutional gravy train -- over 275 events last month alone, from Carnegie Hall's opening night gala to Project Migration's wine-tasting party.
 But the illusions this past year, during the Great Recession, have been of a different order, and there's a new rags-to-riches story at the ball: how do you take an undraped tent, short-stemmed flowers, a DJ and business attire or worse -- casual dress -- and make a glittering evening out of it?
''Your challenge is to strike the balance between not being overly opulent, and getting people to come out,'' said Chad Kaydo, editor in chief of BizBash, an events-industry trade publication and Web site. ''People still want to have a good time.'' 
 Nicholas Apps, director of special programming and events at the Museum of Modern Art, said of its annual fund-raiser in May, ''We knew we had to rethink the look and the price point once the downturn occurred -- it would be harder to sell $100,000 tables, and it had to look attainable.''
 The museum set up white-sofa lounge seating instead of sit-down tables; served paella, family-style, instead of lobster and a three-course meal; and dropped ticket prices for an after-party to $100 from $250. Like most clients during the last year, they also bargained with their vendors on discounts and donated services.
 David Rockefeller and other board members sat on white sofas and got paella, too.
 ''Trust me, we were all holding our breath,'' Mr. Apps said. ''I'm still working here, so I guess we did something right.'' The museum roughly doubled the number of after-party tickets it sold, from 2008, and that success has now changed pricing policy on all its events.
 ''It's a double-edged sword,'' said Sean Driscoll of recessionary strategies. Mr. Driscoll's Glorious Food provided the food at Mr. Apps's May event. ''We're in the service business. I employ all this wait-staff who rely on us.'' Mr. Driscoll said business had been down 10 to 15 percent during the last year, that two waiters per table at a dinner might more likely be ''one and a half,'' and the menu would be chicken, which is ''more reasonable than beef,'' as it was at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center Cabaret benefit at the World Financial Center last month. 
 Bronwyn Keenan, associate director of special events at the Solomon R. Guggenheim museum, got the food for its Art Awards on Oct. 29 from two restaurants in Brooklyn, Roberta's, a fashionable pizza parlor in Bushwick, and Marlow & Sons in Williamsburg. Ms. Keenan said she routinely asks wineries and companies like Perrier for sponsorship donations now, ''to chip away at catering line items.'' Rob Pruitt, an artist, designed the awards evening as an ''installation,'' which spared the budget an event designer.
 At the Central Park Conservancy's Halloween ball on Oct. 27, the party tent's ceiling went undraped, which Frank Alexander, who created the evening's decor, estimated was a savings of roughly $25,000. Costumed guests reveled under a weather balloon with a projected moon and cardboard bats instead. The ten-piece band of two years ago was replaced by a one-man band -- DJ Tom Finn -- and cocktail service was consolidated at a single bar, rather than provided by staffed stations at the perimeter. 
 ''They don't want to look like they're spending what they're raising,'' Mr. Alexander said of the Conservancy and other clients. 
 ''It's bringing us back, and forcing us to be more creative,'' he said of the recession's impact. ''This whole thing has been a learning experience.''
 Raul Avila, a designer who, with John Myhre, created the ''El Morocco'' party for the Costume Institute's gala in May at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said his company reuses items. Mr. Avila, an alumnus of the late Robert Isabell's event business, even acknowledged the idea of artificial flowers, which would have been considered a near-obscenity in the recent past.
 Andrew Pascoe, a floral designer who worked with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's Spring Ball in May at the Plaza Hotel and with the Boys' Club of New York on their fall dance, held last week at the Edison Ballroom, said he was being asked for arrangements that were ''not so flamboyant-looking.'' For Mr. Pascoe, that means more candles and shorter stems (hydrangeas, not French tulips), more local and seasonal flowers (branches of cherry blossom in the spring) and fewer flown-in exotics like Hawaiian orchids. 
 ''But they still want everything to be beautiful,'' Mr. Pascoe said of clients, with the ghost of a sigh. As he spoke, his shop in Oyster Bay was painting autumn leaves -- readily available and in dirt-cheap abundance -- gold for an event. 
 Live auctions went underground, as organizations like the Robin Hood Foundation, at its May fund-raiser, devised other ways for guests to give. David Stark, one of the event's designers, embedded wireless devices in table centerpieces to transmit party-goers' donations privately. The foundation scrapped its public luxury-ticket auction -- an open exchange of charity for a bit of bragging rights -- which last year offered V.I.P. concert privileges and a night of ''hanging out'' with the Jonas brothers. 
 Some of the year's success stories could reflect not only austerity, but a changing of the guard between generations of philanthropy as well. 
 The Public Art Fund's spring benefit was a bowling party, held at Lucky Strike Lanes -- blue-collared, not blue-blooded, in spirit -- with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and roughly 300 art-world types in attendance, from curators to collectors. Bowling shirts took the place of gift bags, artists acted as team captains and also designed trophies.
 ''You were eating sliders and popcorn and drinking beer,'' said Susan K. Freedman, the fund's president, of the event, which sold out. ''We couldn't get people to leave.''
 Ms. Freedman is now stumped about next spring.
 ''Too bad there aren't more things like bowling,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Switzerland Limits Bank Compensation, but Not Too Harshly

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Switzerland announced watered-down measures to limit bank compensation Wednesday, imposing no caps on bonuses and excluding all but the country's biggest financial services companies from mandatory compliance.
 The announcement signified a victory for the Swiss banking industry, which had argued in August that a stricter draft went ''too far in its depth and scope, thereby imposing excessive constraints on entrepreneurial freedom.'' 
 The country's economy is highly dependent on financial services, a sector that employs about 195,000 people, and officials and industry leaders had said they feared driving business elsewhere if the measures were too rigorous. 
 The Swiss regulator called for high-level executives to have a significant part of their pay deferred for a minimum of three years to ensure it was better linked to risk.
 It said it was imposing no limits to bonuses but said such payments ''must actually have been earned by the company over the long term.'' 
 The aim, the authority said, was ''to prevent high variable remuneration being granted merely as a result of entering into large risks and generating short-term, unsustainable earnings.''
 The policy takes effect Jan. 1. But implementation is mandatory only for companies that are required to have at least 2 billion Swiss francs ($1.98 billion) in equity capital, or as solvency for insurers, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said. That covers the country's seven largest banks and five largest insurance companies.
 Alain Bichsel, a spokesman for the market regulator, declined to identify the affected institutions. But they are expected to apply to the country's two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as well as large insurers like Swiss Life, Swiss Re and Zurich Financial Services.
 The regulator also encouraged all institutions to take the guidelines into account when determining their bonus policies. Mr. Bichsel said the authorities had the right to impose the new terms on any bank if they felt its remuneration policies were leading it to take undue risks.
 Bankers have lobbied hard to head off such measures. Attempts to enforce global pay caps faltered at the Group of 20 meeting in September, after the United States and Britain refused to go along. 
 Many economists say that bonuses contributed directly to the global crisis by encouraging people to lend and trade recklessly with no regard to the long-term effects of their actions. 
 Proponents of pay limits argue that bankers would not have taken excessive risks if their paychecks had been tied to the true value of those investments, while opponents say bonuses are necessary to attract and retain the best banking talent. 
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve last month outlined the process for its review of the industry's pay practices, also focusing on the structure more than the amounts of individual bonuses.
 The British government asked the country's five biggest banks and the London units of overseas-based banks, like Goldman Sachs, to comply with the Group of 20's bonus rules, and the Financial Services Authority has pressed executives to avoid paying large bonuses before replenishing their banks' capital or increasing lending. 
 Two banks under direct government control, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have agreed to ban bonuses altogether for employees earning more than about $65,000.
 On Tuesday, European Union finance ministers and central bankers meeting in Brussels, agreed on a draft policy that they said would help to prevent ''remuneration policies that generate unacceptable levels of risk.'' Switzerland is not a member of the European Union.

HEADLINE: Little Cargo, Loads of Debt

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
When Eastwind Maritime, a medium-size carrier company, went bankrupt this summer, few banks in the United States took notice. 
 But in Europe, where banks hold over $350 billion of increasingly dubious shipping industry loans, the inability of Eastwind, which is based in New York,to handle its debt of more than $300 million set off an anxiety attack on lending desks across the Continent.
 The collapse of Eastwind Maritime, analysts say, while small, could well be a harbinger of more carrier failures to come.
 And for Europe's struggling banks, already plagued by a toothless economic recovery and continuing losses in real estate, the emergence of yet another questionable category of loans adds to fears that many of them are lagging their counterparts in the United States in overcoming the financial crisis. 
 In Britain, for example, where the economy shrank a further 0.4 percent for the third quarter, the government had to put an additional $:43 billion ($71 billion) into the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, both essentially under national control, because of continuing trouble with their real estate loans. 
 And in Spain, where loans to companies working in the real estate sector are estimated to be almost 50 percent of gross domestic product, a consensus is growing that many banks are underreporting the value of their stricken loan portfolios. 
 Now there is more to worry about. Banks with large shipping industry portfolios -- among them Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, and HSH Nordbank and Commerzbank in Germany -- could face meaningful write-downs as ship owners confront plummeting charter rates from a 25 percent drop in global trade. 
 ''Peak of defaults is generally one year after the trough of the economy,'' said Scott Bugie, a European bank analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''In the U.S., the debt workouts have been faster and the economy also bottomed out before Europe.''
 HSH Nordbank, a leading lender to the shipping industry, set aside close to $800 million in provisions for its shipping-related loans this spring, and it has already received 13 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in support from its owners, the regional German states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. 
 And while global trade appears to be gradually on the mend, a glut of previously ordered ships due in the coming years is expected to limit the extent of a meaningful price recovery.
 ''The problem is that there will be more bankruptcies and foreclosures if the ship owner can't operate his ship,'' said Anthony B. Zolotas, a shipping industry banker at Eurofin in Athens. ''At that point he will give the keys to the bank and say, 'Sorry, mate, I just can't do this anymore.' '' 
 Banks in Europe have stubbornly resisted taking write-downs for their shipping industry debts. They concede that the global cargo sector is troubled, but as long as companies continue to pay interest on their loans -- which most are still doing -- the banks contend that there is no need to write them off. 
 ''Our book is of very high quality, and to date we have not had to make a single provision this year for possible loss,'' said Lambros Varnavides, who oversees shipping loans for R.B.S. 
 ''If the market remains low or becomes weaker,'' he said, ''it is likely that some provisions may be required even for us.'' He adds, however, that he would expect to recover those provisions once the markets rebound. 
 But as competition for business drives cargo revenue well below what it costs to send a ship across the ocean, analysts say that ship owners may soon be the next group of borrowers unable to manage their debts.
 Many see parallels to the way banks in the United States and Europe adopted an overly optimistic view of their exposure to subprime mortgages in late 2006 and early 2007.
 As with Eastwind, small undercapitalized subprime lenders began to fail when home owners realized that the size of their mortgage had surpassed the value of their house, and stopped making the payments on their loans. 
 Although the pile of shipping industry debt does not compare to the trillions of dollars in toxic mortgage securities that infected balance sheets worldwide, the essential dynamic of plummeting ship values, burdensome debt and disappearing equity is much the same.
 Cato Brahde, an analyst at Tufton Oceanic, a hedge fund that specializes in the shipping industry, says that history shows that the stronger the trade-driven boom, the longer the down cycle that follows, with the slump possibly persisting anywhere from three to 10 years.
 The current bust began in the summer of 2008. And after what he called the ''biggest order book of all time,'' that suggests that most of the pain for the shipping industry is still to come.
 ''We estimate that there will be a 50 percent oversupply in container ships,'' Mr. Brahde said. ''And in the next five or six months you will see more banks repossessing ships. It is not life or death, but for those with real exposure there will be problems.''
 Like all carriers, Eastwind built its fleet of 55 ships by relying on the generous terms of its eager bankers. At the top of the cycle, when the average five-year-old vessel was valued at about $88 million as of June of 2008, the company seemed a pretty good bet. 
 But with the 45 percent plunge in freight rates for container ships, the values of the ships that secured the bank loans have dropped, too. 
 For example, Aozora Bank, a Japanese bank that in addition to being one of Eastwind's top lenders is a major creditor of Lehman Brothers, found to its dismay that the value of the 12 Eastwind ships it now controlled was considerably lower than its $77 million exposure, according to Eastwind's bankruptcy filing. Other big lenders include the Bank of Scotland, part of the Lloyd's Group, and Nordea Bank, based in Sweden. 
 It is that type of negative equity situation, which was at the heart of the subprime crisis, that could threaten banks if it occurs on a wider scale.
 Most vulnerable is HSH Nordbank, which is exposed to the industry's weakest segment, container ships. It has $50 billion in shipping loans, or about seven times its equity. 
 The exposures of other major ship lenders include Commerzbank, with $37 billion; R.B.S. with $25 billion; and Lloyds TSB with $23.9 billion, according to estimates made by ING Bank.
 With the exception of HSH Nordbank, the shipping industry loans of the other banks represent a small percentage of their overall loan books -- not enough, taken on their own, to make a balance sheet buckle.
 But the fact that shipping industry debts are concentrated in some of Europe's weakest banks suggests that the loans may well cause more problems than bankers are now willing to admit. 
 As a private company, without a Greek billionaire or friendly government to back it, the end came quickly for Eastwind once creditors refused to extend more loans. 
 So quickly, in fact, that some of the company's ships, which are a main mover of Chiquita Brands fruits and vegetables, were left stranded in open water. 
 In one case, a ship belonging to Eastwind lacked the money to pay for fuel, according to the company's bankruptcy filing. Another even lacked sufficient funds to provide food and water to its crew.
 While the ships eventually found their way to port, it may well be their bankers that soon find themselves at sea.

HEADLINE: Dollars That Turn Into Bees, And Other Gifts Given Twice

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
THIS holiday season, consumers are expected to cut back both their spending on holiday gifts as well as their giving to charity.
 Last month, the National Retail Federation predicted that holiday retail industry sales would decline 1 percent this year, to $437.6 billion.
At the same time, the nation's largest charities expect private donations to drop 9 percent this year from last, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual Philanthropy 400 study, released last month. 
 The good news is that just because you're cutting back, you don't have to be stingy. Savvy consumers are finding ways to combine giving presents and giving to charity with the help of new holiday gift options from many charities, a growing number of online donation gift card services and new ways to tie making donations into traditional shopping. 
 ''People have been trying to find ways to both do good and give to others over the past couple years, and it has intensified with the recession,'' says Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
 A number of charities, recognizing this, have started offering new ways for donations to double as gifts beyond just the traditional ''a donation has been made in your name'' card. 
 With traditional donations dwindling, ''charities are trying to tap into a new source of revenue, which is gift giving,'' said Vinay Bhagat, founder of Convio Inc., a software provider and consultant to nonprofits. ''They are getting creative about gift giving.'' 
 This holiday season, for the third year, the Humane Society of the United States is running a promotion allowing a person to make a gift of $50 or more in someone's name; the recipient will receive a seal ornament in a gift box with a personalized card. 
 Oxfam America, meanwhile, has expanded its four-year-old Unwrapped program, through which donations in honor of recipients are made to communities in need. It will now include more affordable gifts under $25, including $12 manure, $12 soap and $18 honey bees. Recipients receive a card with the item's image, while those in need get the item or whatever they need most. 
 By going direct to nonprofits for their holiday shopping, gift givers could also opt for other creative items like a museum membership or benefit tickets. But the risk associated with buying directly from a charity is that you might pick one that your gift recipient wouldn't want to support.
 To avoid that situation, a number of Web sites have cropped up in recent years that allow gift givers to give a gift card that can be used to make a donation to a charity of their choosing. Such sites include CharityGiftCertificates.org, TisBest.org, NetworkforGood.org and JustGive .org. 
 Cyndi Davis, 53, an accountant in Queensbury, N.Y., estimates she is spending a little more than $1,000 on gifts and donations this holiday season, down from about $2,000 last year. Her cost-cutting method: combining her holiday and charitable giving. Most everyone on her list is getting a charity gift card from CharityGiftCertificates.org along with a small gift like a scarf or leather gloves. ''I'm making it a lot easier for myself, '' she said.
 Elsewhere, new offerings link charitable giving with more traditional holiday shopping. This season, for instance, American Express is offering its first gift card tied to charity. For every one of the $25, $50, o$10 or $200 denomination United Way Charity Gift Cards sold, American Express will donate $3.95 to the United Way. 
 Retailers and manufacturers, meanwhile, are increasingly offering to make donations to certain charities when consumers buy selected items or shop on special days. Customers who shop at J. C. Penney between Dec. 4 and 13, for instance, can round up their purchase to give proceeds to a Penney nonprofit that supports local after-school programs, and the retailer is also selling certain merchandise whose net proceeds benefit the program.
 But charitable shoppers should be sure to keep in mind that different giving options have different tax ramifications. When consumers buy cause-related merchandise from for-profit firms, the tax deduction generally goes to the firm. American Express, for instance, gets the tax deduction for the United Way donations. 
 And even when buying directly from charities, combining a physical gift with a donation can result in a lower deduction than just giving money in someone's name. Any donation of $50 or more to the Humane Society, for instance, is tax deductible -- except for $3.60 for a magazine and $7.60 for the ornament.
 Most of the donors' choice gift card sites, which tend to be nonprofits, charge a fee, but the fees and donation are typically tax deductible.

HEADLINE: As G.E. Struggles, a Rival Steps Up

BYLINE: By ROB COX and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
It is only fitting that United Technologies is poised to buy assets from its cross-state rival General Electric. At least in the eyes of shareholders, United Technologies -- the manufacturer of Otis elevators, Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters -- has emerged as the more successful of the two industrial conglomerates, both based in Connecticut. 
 G.E. is the larger of the two, with a $169 billion market cap. But it is hobbling its way out of the credit crisis, diverting cash away from dividends and selling assets to shore up its balance sheet. Next week, it is expected to sell a controlling stake in NBC Universal, the broadcaster it has owned for decades. 
 United Technologies, with its $63 billion market value, appears in robust health, quietly buying assets. It is also said to be in talks to acquire fire alarm and security systems operations that G.E., led by Jeffrey R. Immelt, has put on the block for some $1.5 billion. 
 Both companies are sprawling industrial corporations with concentrated portfolios in the aerospace, power and infrastructure. 
 Their main point of difference, however, explains why they find themselves at such remarkable odds. G.E. made a huge bet on finance while United Technologies stuck to its manufacturing knitting. Lately, G.E.'s decision has been dreadful for its shareholders. 
 In the last year, United Technologies, headed by Louis R. Chenevert, has returned 40 percent including dividends. That is 10 times G.E.'s total shareholder return. 
 That period -- which includes the recent panic that especially hurt GE Capital -- may not seem a fair one to choose. Yet since February 2007, when the first problems in subprime became apparent, United Technologies' shares are essentially unchanged while G.E.'s have lost half their value. 
 Go back a decade, and the picture is similar. Investors who rolled their dividends back into United Technologies stock have had a 185 percent return, while G.E.'s shareholders are down about 55 percent. 
 Today United Technologies stock commands a valuation of more than three times its assets minus liabilities. That is about double the premium to book value for G.E. shares. Put it all together, and United Technologies is in position to swoop in and buy businesses from G.E., whose big bet on finance is forcing it to shrink and its shareholders to suffer.
 Tech Battle Lines Blur
 Not so long ago, the technology business consisted of a series of silos where dozens, if not hundreds, of companies fought for supremacy. From these skirmishes emerged a handful of giants. 
 Cisco dominated networking while Oracle ruled in databases. With their core businesses maturing, however, these companies are crossing the traditional frontiers of battle. 
 Hewlett-Packard's just-announced $2.7 billion purchase of 3Com is the latest in this blurring of the borders in tech land. The acquisition of 3Com, a maker of network switching and routing gear, is the most aggressive foray yet by H.P. into Cisco's turf. Of course, Cisco arguably fired the first volley in this campaign in March, when it jumped into the server market, where H.P. and I.B.M. had long cavorted.
 The fight isn't limited to these companies. Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems in April. It snatched Sun away from the clutches of I.B.M. and entered the hardware business, pitting Oracle directly against H.P. Even bystanders have been drawn into the fray this year; Dell bought Perot Systems and Xerox acquired ACS, bringing them up against I.B.M. and H.P.
 What's driving this hostility? Electronic gadgets continue to cheapen in cost and increase in functionality, making technology more of a commodity. Information technology budgets, meanwhile, have shrunk. Global spending is expected to decline 4 percent this year, Gartner predicts. To cope with this deflation, companies are moving onto one another's turf, hoping to earn a bit of extra revenue from bundling extra goods and services together. 
 How well all these moves will work is unclear. Growth dependent on acquisitions often fails to arrive. And integrating technology firms is notoriously difficult. With that in mind, perhaps the best strategy is to welcome invasion and sell out, naturally at a hefty premium for shareholders.

HEADLINE: American Adviser to Kurds Stands to Reap Oil Profits

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ and WALTER GIBBS; Mohammed Hussein contributed reporting from Baghdad, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: OSLO 

 BODY:
Peter W. Galbraith, an influential former American ambassador, is a powerful voice on Iraq who helped shape the views of policy makers like Joseph R. Biden Jr. and John Kerry. In the summer of 2005, he was also an adviser to the Kurdish regional government as Iraq wrote its Constitution -- tough and sensitive talks not least because of issues like how Iraq would divide its vast oil wealth. 
 Now Mr. Galbraith, 58, son of the renowned economist John Kenneth Galbraith, stands to earn perhaps a hundred million or more dollars as a result of his closeness to the Kurds, his relations with a Norwegian oil company and constitutional provisions he helped the Kurds extract. 
 In the constitutional negotiations, he helped the Kurds ram through provisions that gave their region -- rather than the central Baghdad government -- sole authority over many of their internal affairs, including clauses that he maintains will give the Kurds virtually complete control over all new oil finds on their territory. 
 Mr. Galbraith, widely viewed in Washington as a smart and bold foreign policy expert, has always described himself as an unpaid adviser to the Kurds, although he has spoken in general terms about having business interests in Kurdistan, as the north of Iraq is known.
 So it came as a shock to many last month when a group of Norwegian investigative journalists at the newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv began publishing documents linking Mr. Galbraith to a specific Norwegian oil company with major contracts in Iraq. 
 Interviews by The New York Times with more than a dozen current and former government and business officials in Norway, France, Iraq, the United States and elsewhere, along with legal records and other documents, reveal in considerable detail that he received rights to an enormous stake in at least one of Kurdistan's oil fields in the spring of 2004.
 As it turns out, Mr. Galbraith received the rights after he helped negotiate a potentially lucrative contract that allowed the Norwegian oil company DNO to drill for oil in the promising Dohuk region of Kurdistan, the interviews and documents show.
 He says his actions were proper because he was at the time a private citizen deeply involved in Kurdish causes, both in business and policy. 
 When drillers struck oil in a rich new field called Tawke in December 2005, no one but a handful of government and business officials and members of Mr. Galbraith's inner circle knew that the constitutional provisions he had pushed through only months earlier could enrich him so handsomely. 
 As the scope of Mr. Galbraith's financial interests in Kurdistan become clear, they have the potential to inflame some of Iraqis' deepest fears, including conspiracy theories that the true reason for the American invasion of their country was to take its oil. It may not help that outside Kurdistan, Mr. Galbraith's influential view that Iraq should be broken up along ethnic lines is considered offensive to many Iraqis' nationalism. Mr. Biden and Mr. Kerry, who have been influenced by Mr. Galbraith's thinking but do not advocate such a partitioning of the country, were not aware of Mr. Galbraith's oil dealings in Iraq, aides to both politicians say.
 Some officials say that his financial ties could raise serious questions about the integrity of the constitutional negotiations themselves. ''The idea that an oil company was participating in the drafting of the Iraqi Constitution leaves me speechless,'' said Feisal Amin al-Istrabadi, a principal drafter of the law that governed Iraq after the United States ceded control to an Iraqi government on June 28, 2004.
 In effect, he said, the company ''has a representative in the room, drafting.''
 DNO's chief executive, Helge Eide, confirmed that Mr. Galbraith helped negotiate the Tawke deal and advised the company during 2005. But Mr. Eide said that Mr. Galbraith acted solely as a political adviser and that the company never discussed the Constitution negotiations with him. ''We certainly never did give any input, language or suggestions on the Constitution,'' Mr. Eide said.
 When the findings based on interviews by The Times and other research were presented to Mr. Galbraith last weekend, he responded in writing to The Times, confirming that he did work as a mediator between DNO and the Kurdish government until the oil contract was signed in the spring of 2004, and saying that he maintained an ''ongoing business relationship'' with the company throughout the constitutional negotiations in 2005 and later.
 Mr. Galbraith says he held no official position in the United States or Iraq during this entire period and acted purely as a private citizen. He maintains that his largely undeclared dual role was entirely proper. He says that he was simply advocating positions that the Kurds had documented before his relationship with DNO even began. 
 ''What is true is that I undertook business activities that were entirely consistent with my long-held policy views,'' Mr. Galbraith said in his response. ''I believe my work with DNO (and other companies) helped create the Kurdistan oil industry which helps provide Kurdistan an economic base for the autonomy its people almost unanimously desire.''
 ''So, while I may have had interests, I see no conflict,'' Mr. Galbraith said. 
 Kurdish officials said that they were informed of Mr. Galbraith's work for DNO and that they still considered him a friend and advocate. Mr. Galbraith said that during his work on the Constitution negotiations, the Kurds ''did not pay me and they knew I was being paid by DNO.''
 Mr. Istrabadi, who was also the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations from 2004 to 2007, said the case was especially troubling given the influence of Mr. Galbraith's policy views. In his writings -- some of them on the Op-Ed page of The Times and in the New York Review of Books -- he is generally identified as a former ambassador or with some other generic description that gives no insight into his business interests in the area. 
 Mr. Galbraith, for many years on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has a long relationship with the Kurds. In 1988, he documented Saddam Hussein's systematic campaign against the Kurds, including the use of gas. He served as United States ambassador to Croatia between 1993 and 1998. In September, he was fired as the No. 2 official with the United Nations mission in Afghanistan after he accused the head of the mission of concealing allegations of electoral fraud. 
 Views of Mr. Galbraith's business ties are harsh within the central Baghdad government, which has long maintained, in stark opposition to Mr. Galbraith's interpretation of the Constitution, that all the oil contracts signed by the Kurdish government were illegal.
 Referring to the Constitution negotiations, Abdul-Hadi al-Hassani, vice chairman of the oil and gas committee in the Iraqi Parliament, said that Mr. Galbraith's ''interference was not justified, illegal and not right, particularly because he is involved in a company where his financial interests have been merged with the political interest.''
 Citing what he said were confidentiality agreements, Mr. Galbraith refused to give details of his financial arrangement with the company, and the precise nature of his compensation remains unknown. But several officials, including Mr. Galbraith's business partner in the deal, the Norwegian businessman Endre Rosjo, said that in addition to whatever consulting fees the company paid, he and Mr. Galbraith were together granted rights to 10 percentof the large Tawke field and possibly others. 
 An internal DNO document dated Dec. 3, 2006, which was first obtained by Dagens Naeringsliv, indicates that a company called Porcupine, registered in Delaware under Mr. Galbraith's name, still held the rights to the 5 percent stake at that time, while a company associated with Mr. Rosjo held the other 5 percent.
 Mr. Eide, the DNO executive, said that as far as the company knew, Mr. Galbraith's work was proper.
 ''To our knowledge, Mr. Galbraith in 2004 was working as a businessman with no political assignments,'' Mr. Eide said. ''Given our network model and limited experience and knowledge from the region at that time, our evaluation concluded that we should use Mr. Galbraith to advise DNO in the first stage of the project.''
 As revelations began appearing in recent weeks, Mr. Galbraith at first issued qualified denials stating that he had never been party to any arrangement in Iraq technically referred to in the oil industry as a production-sharing contract. But industry insiders say that the rights could have been couched in different terms -- not an ownership stake, but a conditional right or option to become part of such an agreement at a future date.
 Estimating the value of any stake in the Kurdish fields is difficult given the political uncertainties. But Are Martin Berntzen, an oil analyst at Oslo's First Securities brokerage, said the Tawke field alone has proven reserves of about 230 million barrels, a figure likely to increase as new wells are drilled.
 ''Given no political risk, a 5 percent stake should be worth at least $115 million,'' he said, though he emphasized that he knew nothing about Mr. Galbraith's arrangement.
 A possible indication of Mr. Galbraith's estimate of the deal's worth may be discerned in a London arbitration case in which Porcupine and a Yemeni investor who now apparently holds Mr. Rosjo's former share are seeking more than $525 million from DNO, according to a filing reported on the legal news Web site Law.com. Oil analysts in Norway played down the likelihood of a reward as large as the claim.
 According to DNO, the claim represents up to 10 percent of the value of the regional production contract, which the Norwegian oil firm now shares with a Turkish energy company after Kurdish authorities reviewed the previous deal and barred ''certain third-party interests'' from participating further. At a shareholders meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Eide refused to name Mr. Galbraith as a claimant in the case. He acknowledged, however, that DNO lost a procedural ruling in the case last May, and he said a final decision on damages was expected in early 2010.
 In his response, Mr. Galbraith would say only that ''my contractual relationship was with DNO and is the subject of pending arbitration.''

HEADLINE: More Foreclosures to Come

 BODY:
After a few months of some better than expected housing news, home prices are likely to fall again, driven lower by a renewed surge in foreclosures. By conservative estimates, another 2.4 million homes will be lost in 2010, while prices will fall another 10 percent or so. This should be a wake-up call for the Obama administration. Foreclosures are expected to surge, in part, because lenders have been delaying the process during the long rollout of the administration's antiforeclosure plan. But according to Moody's Economy.com, most troubled borrowers ultimately will not qualify for help, and a backlog of bad loans will soon enter foreclosure. 
 The Obama plan, which provides subsidies to lenders who modify troubled loans, has been flawed from the start. It has no teeth to compel lenders to participate. And it was primarily designed to help borrowers who defaulted because their loans had exploding interest rates or other features that made them suddenly unaffordable. 
 There were a lot more of those borrowers when the housing bust began, and for them, the plan's main remedy -- reducing monthly payments -- could work well. But with unemployment running above 10 percent, many people are now defaulting because they have lost their jobs. They will have trouble qualifying for help, because they can't make even reduced payments. 
 Millions of borrowers who now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth are also unlikely to qualify because borrowers without equity are at high risk of re-default, even on modified loans. 
 To help people with negative equity, the subsidies in the Obama plan should be redeployed so that they are used to modify loans by reducing the principal balance. That would restore equity in addition to lowering payments, and in the process, reduce the risk of re-default. 
 To help unemployed people who cannot qualify for loan modifications, Congress and the administration should expand programs to provide rental assistance, including help for foreclosed homeowners to rent their homes at a market rate. That would at least help prevent the blight that comes with abandoned housing.
 On Tuesday, the administration announced that through October, 650,994 loans had been modified under the Obama plan. But the administration did not specify how many of those were trial modifications -- reduced-payment offers that will become permanent after up to five months of steady payments by the borrowers -- and how many had already become permanent. 
 The administration expects to provide that information within the next two weeks. Until then, it will be impossible to know how many people have actually avoided foreclosure. What is evident, now, is that at the current pace of modifications, and with the housing market coming under renewed pressure, the plan has little chance of making a meaningful dent in the crisis. 
 The housing bust sparked the recession. More foreclosures and renewed price declines will worsen the damage. American homeowners, and the economy, need an antiforeclosure plan that works.

HEADLINE: Bush Emerging for Speech to Kick Off Public Policy Institute

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: DALLAS 

 BODY:
Nearly 10 months after leaving office, former President George W. Bush plans to emerge from self-imposed political hibernation on Thursday as he starts a new public policy institute to promote some of the domestic and international priorities of his presidency.
 In a speech at Southern Methodist University, home of his future library and museum, the former president will kick off the new George W. Bush Institute as a forum for study and advocacy in four main areas: education, global health, human freedom and economic growth. Advisers said he hoped his institute would be more focused on producing results than many research organizations are. 
 Mr. Bush will announce the appointment of the first five of two dozen scholars to be affiliated with the institute, which has already scheduled a half-dozen conferences for next year, according to organizers. The former first lady, Laura Bush, will also speak at Thursday's event to discuss how women's issues will be injected into all the institute's program areas, including sponsorship of a conference on the education of women in Afghanistan.
 ''The president has been working with these ideas for a long time now,'' said James K. Glassman, a former top State Department official now serving as the institute's founding executive director. ''He wanted to do something very different from other former presidents, and that is to create a research institute that's independent, nonpartisan and scholarly and that will have an impact on the real world.''
 Although Mr. Bush has given several speeches since leaving office, most have been out of the country, closed to the news media and reminiscent in tone. This is the first event where he has invited reporters to announce a new venture. Organizers expect as many as 1,500 students, donors and others to attend.
 The former president's approach contrasts with that of his vice president, Dick Cheney, who has become a vigorous public critic of President Obama's national security policies. The institute will be a vehicle for Mr. Bush to re-enter the national conversation and advocate ideas in a less politicized way, advisers said. The goal, Mr. Glassman said, is to ''extend principles and work that were accomplished during the administration.''
 The institute will be housed along with the presidential library and museum in a building on the S.M.U. campus to be completed by 2013. The Bush foundation has secured $212 million in pledges and contributions toward its goal of $300 million by next year's groundbreaking, according to two people who were privy to the results but not authorized to discuss them on the record. 
 Mr. Bush is also completing a book describing some of the most important decisions in his life. He is about five-sixths through with the manuscript, which he is drafting with Chris Michel, a former White House speechwriter, for publication next fall, according to his office.
 Former aides said Mr. Bush remained attentive to news developments, even if publicly quiet. ''I get a lot of e-mails from him now,'' said Michael J. Gerson, his former senior adviser. ''He responds to the news. He's very engaged.''
 But the Bushes keep a deliberately low profile. After a shooting rampage left 13 dead at Fort Hood, about 150 miles south of Dallas, the former president and first lady paid a visit in secret to wounded soldiers and family members.

HEADLINE: New Fame for the Everyday Donor

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
AFTER years in the shadows, the everyday donor is emerging as philanthropy's newest hero, the driver of a more down-to-earth approach to charity. Sure, Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, Bono and other celebrity mega-donors still have their place, but now high-profile charities are homing in on smaller donations, while new charities are being organized around the principle of modest giving.
 ''This is one of those all-hands-on-deck moments where we absolutely need to engage everyone, whether they are able to give 50 cents or $50 million,'' said David Salzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, famous for annual benefits where billionaires routinely hand over $20 million. 
 Americans have always been generous givers, and small donations have always played their part. After a tsunami devastated parts of southeast Asia in 2004, individuals in the United States donated $2.78 billion of the $6.2 billion raised for relief efforts -- and the median gift was $50, the average gift $135. Yet multimillion gifts and lavish campaigns and events often commandeered the spotlight and the press coverage. 
 ''We are deluded by the attention paid to the large contributors in our country,'' said Wendy Smith, author of ''Give A Little: How Your Small Donations Can Transform the World.'' 
 ''Small checks coming through the mail are the bread and butter for most organizations.''
 From leaving a can of soup on the doorstep for collection by a local charity to logging on to the Internet and making a mini- or micro-gift, the small givers are drawing attention for their good works and their willingness to keep giving in a tough economy.
 At Robin Hood, a charity founded and supported by hedge fund tycoons and Hollywood celebrities, Mr. Salzman said the organization was for the first time working to attract young professionals whose pay is closer to $30,000 than to the nine-figure incomes of its founders. 
 Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade association representing nonprofits and foundations, said many charitable organizations were ''making an effort to diversify their funding bases and not depend on a few large funders, whether they be foundations or individuals.'' For those organizations comfortable with technology, she said, ''this is not hard to do; but for others, it will take rethinking the way they fund raise altogether, including the professionals they use to help them raise money.''
 One charitable organization that always recognized the value of the small donor is the March of Dimes, which gets about 22 percent of its revenue from gifts averaging $14. ''We are, indeed, the house the dime built,'' said Dr. Jennifer Howse, its chief executive.
 The bulk of those gifts come from direct-mail efforts, though more and more from the Internet and social media, she said. The March of Dimes also relies on supermarket checkout lines, where at many stores shoppers can add a $1 donation to their purchase. At Kmart stores alone, this raised $6 million. 
 ''Gifts of $10, $15 and $20 can buy supplies for our research labs, books for a baby's nursery, a bundle of 15 brochures on healthy pregnancy to put in Medicaid clinics,'' Dr. Howse said. ''They really are valuable.''
 Among the new charitable endeavors thinking small is One Can a Week. Peter Norback asked his neighbors in Tucson to put a can of food on their doorsteps every Sunday and would collect them and deliver the food to the Tucson Community Food Bank, which like most other soup kitchens has seen a sharp increase in demand. 
 ''I did 10 houses the first week, the next week, those 10 plus 10 more,'' Mr. Norback said. ''I built it by tens. It took me months.'' 
 About 140 households in the neighborhood now participate, and through Sept. 30, they contributed more than 6,500 pounds of food and $1,262 in cash, or enough to feed more than 1,500 people three meals. 
 Similarly, One Day's Wages, a new charity established by Eugene Cho, a Christian minister in Seattle, asks donors to give up a day's income to charity. The idea came to Mr. Cho during a trip to Myanmar a few years ago when he visited a school in the jungle whose teachers were taking better-paying jobs in bordering Thailand.
 He asked a village elder what it would take to retain teachers, and they said about $40 each. Not a week. Not a month. ''I realized he meant per year,'' said Mr. Cho. ''It hit me: $40 can make a huge difference.''
 He started a Facebook group, Fight Global Poverty, and pledged to donate $1 for each member who joined, up to a total of $100,000. The group now has more than 1 million members, and Mr. Cho and his wife will contribute about $68,000 this year -- representing a year's wages -- and the rest next year. One Day's Wages received tax-exempt status in May and started its Web site last month at www.onedayswages.org. ''It's easy to be drawn to the multimillion-dollar donations, but we're doing ourselves a disservice by not elevating the stories of the working mothers and fathers who also contribute what are significant amounts to them,'' Mr. Cho said.
 GlobalGiving, another online fund-raising organization, supports very small projects proposed by nonprofits typically seeking less than $1,000. It has raised $22 million since it started in 2002, with an average gift of $54. 
 ''There are many Americans whose first interaction with giving, if not through a church or synagogue, is through an educational institution, normally as part of some big capital campaign that is trying to raise $100 million,'' said Margaret Coughlin, GlobalGiving's chief marketing officer. ''It makes you feel like an ant.''
 GlobalGiving holds contests for organizations seeking a spot on its Web site. In a recent contest for nonprofits working internationally, ZimKids managed to raise $26,726 to educate and house orphans in Zimbabwe. The average gift was $240, but many were smaller.
 ''They had been looking for that $5,000 donor, the person who would give $10,000, but they participated in the global challenge to see how they'd do,'' Ms. Coughlin said. ''When it was over, the founders told us that the $25 and $50 gifts that had been made were the difference between being able to take care of 160 kids and not.''
 Even big philanthropists can speak the message of smallness. ''Just $2, that's all it takes'' to buy enough vaccine to give a poor child a much better chance of living to the age of 18, Bill Gates once said. While the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is known for its grants in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, it recently introduced the Living Proof Project, intended to demonstrate the impact American investments in global health could have at a granular level -- how for mere cents, critical nutrients can be added to baladi bread in Egypt or to the diets of mothers tutored in the value of breast milk.
 Small grants have produced some of the biggest successes in foundation history, including the $96,691 that the Ford Foundation gave Mohammed Yunus to create the Grameen Bank and lead the way in microfinancing. Mr. Yunus and the bank received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Ford, which gives away hundreds of millions of dollars a year, has been criticized for making too many small grants, but it has steadfastly stuck to that strategy as and more foundations moved to give money away in larger chunks. 
 ''Making relatively small grants is really fundamental to the way we work, because over many, many years of experience, we have found that many ideas start small,'' said Suzanne Siskel, director of social justice philanthropy at Ford. ''What we do, then, is take a risk on a completely new idea that, if successful, we help grow.''
 Even Wall Street is recognizing the power of small. Fidelity Investments, which manages one of the largest pools of the charitable-giving accounts known as donor-advised funds, used to require that any donation from these funds be at least $100. In October 2008, it dropped the minimum to $50. 
 ''We wanted to help donors use their account balances to give to as many causes as they had been accustomed to in the fat years, and if that meant reducing the minimum grant requirement, we were happy to do it,'' said Sarah C. Libbey, president of the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund. ''Small gifts do matter, especially when they are channeled and consolidated.''

HEADLINE: Billionaires Learn Giving Is Only a Start

BYLINE: By MATTHEW BISHOP and MICHAEL GREEN. 
Matthew Bishop and Michael Green are the authors of ''Philanthrocapitalism: How Giving Can Save the World.'' Mr. Bishop also writes for The Economist. Mr. Green is a writer and consultant.

 BODY:
''BILL GATES: The Real Secretary of Education,'' ran a recent headline on the state of education reform in America, prompted by the unhappiness of teachers' unions about the growing influence of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Washington, D.C.. This reflects a new phase in the development of this generation of megadonors, in which the success or failure of their philanthropic agendas may be determined by their ability to master the dark arts of politics.
 For the super-rich who are relatively recent converts to philanthropy, Mr. Gates chief among them, their practice of what we call philanthrocapitalism began with a belief that the sort of thinking that earned them success in business could be applied to the biggest social problems on the planet. As they had made their fortunes through innovation and market forces -- like personal computing or investment -- their initial efforts at philanthropy tended to try to bypass government. 
When Mr. Gates spoke about his philanthropy to the Harvard graduating class of 2007, his speech echoed the language of Microsoft, focusing on finding the ''ideal technology'' with the right ''application'' to tackle problems like malaria. Yet experience has taught Mr. Gates and others that, compared with government budgets, even their vast fortunes are a drop in the bucket. (''We're a tiny, tiny organization,'' says Mr. Gates of his foundation, which gives away $4 billion a year.) If they want to achieve change to match their sweeping ambitions, they have to start exercising disproportionate influence in politics.
 When he began his philanthropic life a decade or so ago, Mr. Gates was driven by his conviction that providing incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for the diseases of the poor world would be enough to avoid millions of deaths. He did not give much thought to the practicalities of getting health care systems in poor countries to deliver the drugs and educate the needy to use them. Likewise, he assumed that if his giving succeeded in developing a better sort of school for deprived urban areas in America, then that model would be widely adopted without his having to think about the political economy of education reform. 
 That was before he went full time at the helm of his foundation last year. Since then, Mr. Gates has devoted a growing amount of his time and his public speaking to calling for political change: one day making the economic case for American taxpayers to keep investing in global health, the next urging Arne Duncan, who actually is the education secretary, to stay true to the path of change despite the opposition of the teachers' unions. 
 Mr. Gates is not alone in this intensifying political focus. Jeff Skoll, who made his fortune as the first chief executive of eBay, has dedicated his giving and his for-profit business to changing public opinion through movies with a message; he was the backer of Al Gore's Oscar-winning climate change documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' Pete Peterson, who made his fortune as a co-founder of the private equity firm Blackstone, has created a foundation dedicated to promoting prudent fiscal policy in America and has hired David Walker, a former comptroller general of the United States, to lead what in current circumstances seems to be a Quixotic crusade.
 Then there is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has said he regards spending hundreds of millions of his own dollars on three elections as an act of philanthropy. By not having to raise money from others, he says, he is spared the need to promise things to backers that leads many politicians astray. Mr. Bloomberg has given away similar amounts through his foundation to fight smoking around the world, yet he says that this more conventional philanthropy has achieved none of the impact he had by getting elected and banning cigarettes from public places -- a case study in why philanthropists are increasingly seeking political influence.
 The one certain consequence is that these philanthrocapitalists will become increasingly controversial -- on specific issues and also in a broader sense by unleashing deep-rooted concerns among the public about plutocracy.
 Conspiracy theorists muttered loudly in May when Mr. Gates, Warren E. Buffett and David Rockefeller held a secret summit meeting in New York attended by George Soros, Ted Turner, Oprah Winfrey and Mr. Bloomberg, among others. In his re-election last week, Mr. Bloomberg's reduced margin of victory seems to have reflected concern about his use of his own money and overturning term limits. 
 This is part of a long cycle. Philanthropy first took off in America in the late 19th century as tycoons like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller responded with good works to populist attacks on them as robber barons. Later, when the new foundations started to pay for research into the fundamental causes of poverty and racism in America, and propose radical policy responses, they were accused in Congress of trying to undermine American capitalism -- a critique reprised in the 1960s, when right-wing populists turned on the Ford Foundation and its liberal sympathies. Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, liberals criticized right-wing organizations like the John Olin Foundation for financing the conservative revolution that produced Reaganism and Thatcherism.
 ON the face of it, the simplest way to address concerns about plutocracy would be to ban the rich and their foundations entirely from political activism. (Current laws merely ban tax-exempt foundations from overtly partisan activities.) Yet, assuming it could be done in practice, that would deprive society of the talents of some of the world's most successful and effective people, and their ability to take the sort of higher risk and longer-term bets needed to find solutions that politicians with elections every few years tend to shrink from. That is why we should hope that philanthropists like Mr. Gates develop a thick skin, rather than back off at the first sign of political opposition. The role model here is George Soros, who calls himself a ''political philanthropist'' and boasts of enemies who include the Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and Vladimir Putin.
 The philanthrocapitalists could go some way to solving this problem by accepting that secret meetings are only going to excite conspiracy theorists. Transparency may be a pain, but it will save them trouble in the long run. Yet, like fixing schools or ending malaria, establishing the legitimacy of philanthropy to take on controversial challenges is a problem that they cannot tackle on their own.
 It has been 40 years since Congress debated the role of philanthropy in society, resulting in the Tax Reform Act of 1969, which defined the role and responsibilities of foundations. On that occasion, the Rockefeller family set up its own commission to contribute to the public debate, led by Mr. Peterson. It is time for Mr. Peterson, along with Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and the other big donors, to use their clout to start a similar debate about the role of philanthropy for the next 40 years. This should be done in tandem with the Obama administration, which has gone further than any of its predecessors in seeking to forge partnerships with philanthropists and ought to welcome the opportunity to define the new social contract between the rich and the rest in the 21st century.

HEADLINE: Outreach in the Age of Pullback

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 IT was standing room only in a Detroit hotel ballroom last week as the leaders of hundreds of nonprofits poured in to hear one of President Obama's top advisers describe a new government fund meant to help innovative, successful nonprofits expand their reach.
''We're not looking to make marginal or incremental progress here,'' said Melody C. Barnes, the president's domestic policy adviser, who was addressing the annual conference of the Independent Sector, a nonprofit trade association. ''We're looking for programs that are nothing short of transformative.''
 Ms. Barnes, who oversees the newly created White House Office of Social Innovation, was talking about the Social Innovation Fund, which hopes to invest at least $360 million over the next five years to help promising community groups scale up their operations and broaden their impact.
 The fund has generated considerable excitement in the nonprofit world -- as well as some passionate debate -- as the grim economic climate has left many groups reeling. The money will go to groups with established track records that hope to replicate their successes, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, economic development, health, education and programming for children and teenagers, administration officials said. 
 The program has received strong backing from Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, who worked as community organizers earlier in their careers and who have emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships. The first lady announced the creation of the social innovation fund in May. A month later, Mr. Obama reiterated his own commitment.
 ''Solutions to America's challenges are being developed every day at the grassroots, and government shouldn't be supplanting those efforts; it should be supporting those efforts,'' Mr. Obama said.
 He added, ''We won't just be looking at the usual suspects in the usual places. We'll be looking in all sorts of communities -- rural, urban and suburban -- in every region of this country, because we know that great ideas and outstanding programs are everywhere, and it's up to us to find them.''
 The fund plans to provide a minimum of $100,000 annually for up to five years to the selected community groups, which would have to provide proof of their progress. With the support and imprimatur of the White House, administration officials said they believed, the groups may also be able to garner additional financing and strategic partnerships from donors and government agencies. 
 The money is expected to start flowing next summer, the officials said. Nonprofit executives like Eric Schwarz, who was forced to scale back his agency's operations this year, say the fund will fill a critical gap. 
 ''Sometimes just as you prove your success, people in the funding world, both government and foundations, will pull back and say, ''We're on to the next idea,' '' said Mr. Schwarz, who runs Citizen Schools, a Boston-based nonprofit that provides creative after-school programs in 20 districts, including Newark, Houston and Charlotte, N.C. ''With this, we could potentially grow to new communities. It's a great idea.'' 
 But Mr. Schwarz said uncertainty remained in nonprofit circles about the fund's financing mechanisms and its criteria. ''There are still a lot of questions,'' he said. ''People are still sorting it out, trying to figure out how it will apply to them.''
 Some nonprofit executives argue that the pot of money allocated for the fund is so small that it will be largely irrelevant to most community groups.
 The legislation that created the fund allowed for a maximum of $50 million to be disbursed during its first year. But the fund -- which will be housed at the Corporation for National and Community Service, a government agency -- may end up with even less: House appropriators have allocated only $35 million to it. (The Senate allocated the full $50 million.)
 Administration officials said they are working with lawmakers to ensure that the maximum amount will be allocated, but leading philanthropists warned that even $50 million would not fill the enormous need for capital.
 ''Everybody, everybody wants this fund to serve their special passion, but there's only $50 million,'' said Steve Gunderson, chief executive of the Council of Foundations. ''There's no way that they can distribute that $50 million in a way that will keep everyone happy.
 ''Is it worth the effort? Absolutely,'' Mr. Gunderson said. ''But we shouldn't minimize the challenges on this.''
 Others worry that the complex funding mechanisms will be too challenging for some groups. The money allocated to the fund will first go to intermediary organizations, like social venture funds or community foundations, which would identify the grantees and distribute money to them. (Those intermediaries will be selected in a competitive process next year.)
 Both the intermediary organizations and the nonprofit recipients must raise money to match the dollars they receive to maximize the tax dollars spent, officials said. The intermediary groups must raise one dollar for every dollar received, while the nonprofit recipients must raise two dollars for every dollar received. 
 This would be a considerable hardship for groups that are already strapped, some warned, allowing only the most established nonprofits to benefit. And if the process is too complicated, true innovators who could really benefit might be missed.
 ''It's going to be tough for foundations to provide matching funds,'' said Rick Cohen of the Nonprofit Quarterly during a panel discussion about the fund last month that was hosted by the Hudson Institute's Bradley Center for Philanthropy and Civic Renewal.
 ''And it's going to be even tougher for groups that rely on charitable giving due to a jobless recovery,'' Mr. Cohen added. ''Many of the tiny hidden jewels will have a tough time getting noticed and a tough time participating in a program that is structured this way.''
 Sonal Shah, the director of the Office of Social Innovation, acknowledged the concerns and challenges. During the Clinton administration, Ms. Shah held several positions in the Treasury Department, where she served as director of the department's Africa office, overseeing the policies and international financial institution programs affecting the sub-Saharan region.
 Ms. Shah, who also worked at the Center for American Progress and Goldman Sachs, was the head of global development at Google.org when the Obama administration tapped her for the job at the Office of Social Innovation. 
 ''I'm sure there's frustration because there's not enough money and the philanthropic community has taken a hit,'' Ms. Shah said. ''But I think there is a momentum of people thinking we're moving in the right direction.
 ''We really want to invest in those innovative solutions that are moving the dial; we really want to develop that next generation of leaders that have service as a mindset. While there's a lot more to do and I don't want to underestimate the challenge, we've started on a path where government is thinking differently.''
 Michele Jolin, the senior adviser for social innovation, has crisscrossed the country in recent months, attending conferences and participating in conference calls, reaching out to hundreds of nonprofits eager to hear about the fund. Ms. Jolin has also consulted with several leading philanthropies, including the Ford Foundation and the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, as she has worked on the fund's design. 
 ''The administration deserves incredible credit for reaching out and listening and listening and listening to everyone,'' Mr. Gunderson said. (A former Republican lawmaker in the House, Mr. Gunderson likes to joke that he's been invited to the White House more this year than during his entire 16-year career in Congress.) 
 Luis A. Urbinas, president of the Ford Foundation, said that public-private partnerships were more critical than ever given the constraints on federal and local government budgets. He said he was not bothered by the fund's relatively small budget.
 ''I think of it as a first step, an opportunity for proof of concept,'' he said. ''Show that it works, and the funding will follow.''
 Cheryl L. Dorsey, president of Echoing Green, a New York-based social venture fund that finances early-stage social innovators here and abroad, said some people still worry that ''this is some new-fangled idea that will go the way of so many others.''
 But she said the extensive outreach conducted by the Obama administration had persuaded the nonprofit sector that ''they have a partner and ally in the White House.''
 ''I really believe there is a reserve of good will for this president, for the first lady,'' Ms. Dorsey said. ''Most people are willing to see what happens. My bet is that they will hold their fire and give the administration a little more running room before they pass judgment.''

HEADLINE: Seeking a Lever in Kabul

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When President Obamadelivered a rare and public call last week for President Hamid Karzai to crack down on corruption in Afghanistan, there was one glaring omission from his remarks -- an ''or else.''
 Mr. Obama's exclusion of the obvious threat -- that he will pull American troops out of Afghanistan if Mr. Karzai does not comply -- reflects a stark conundrum: How much leverage does the United States really have over the Afghan leader?
 ''You know that scene in the movie 'Blazing Saddles,' when Cleavon Little holds the gun to his own head and threatens to shoot himself?'' asked Ronald E. Neumann, a former ambassador to Afghanistan. 
 ''The argument that we could pull out of Afghanistan if Karzai doesn't do what we say is stupid. We couldn't get the Pakistanis to fight if we leave Afghanistan; we couldn't accomplish what we've set out to do. And Karzai knows that.''
 As Mr. Obama nears the end of his review of American strategy in Afghanistan, the issue of how he will prod, cajole or bully Mr. Karzai into taking action on matters he has avoided for the past five years has been catapulted to the center of the discussion. 
 Administration officials and America's European allies say that rampant corruption and the illegal drug trade in Afghanistan have fueled the resurgence of the Taliban, and that unless Mr. Karzai moves forcefully to tackle those issues, no amount of additional American troops will be able to turn the country around. 
 Yet many of Mr. Obama's advisers said they had seen no evidence that Mr. Karzai would follow through on promises to crack down on corruption or the drug trade. Mr. Obama, who met with his advisers again on Wednesday, is said to be particularly skeptical of Mr. Karzai's resolve. 
 Mr. Obama himself laid down the stakes last week when he said he wanted ''a sense on the part of President Karzai that, after some difficult years in which there has been some drift, that in fact he's going to move boldly and forcefully forward and take advantage of the international community's interest in his country to initiate reforms internally. That has to be one of our highest priorities.''
 Or else what? White House officials acknowledged this week that they were not planning on using the ultimate cudgel: pulling all American troops. Such a step would certainly get Mr. Karzai's attention -- it might lead to his overthrow because his political survival is dependent on the presence of American troops.
 But withdrawing all troops would not serve American interests, officials said; aside from the chaos it could cause in Afghanistan, a pullout could tip the balance in even more volatile Pakistan, where the government is battling Taliban militants. 
 ''What if Karzai doesn't do what we ask and calls our bluff?'' asked Richard Fontaine, a former foreign policy adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ''What, do we go home now? If we set up this framework that demands X, Y and Z must be met within whatever time frame, that would only feed the fear and increase the hedging in Pakistan in a way that makes the situation even worse.''
 In an interview on Wednesday, senior White House officials said that they had other tools in mind, and that the new Afghan strategy would include goals that Mr. Karzai would be pushed to meet.
 New measures will focus on areas like roads, electricity and schools, as well as corruption, the officials said. While they declined to go into many specifics, the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the Afghanistan review is not complete yet, said they had a range of diplomatic, financial and economic options if the targets were not met.
 One lever, they said, would be to shift money from Mr. Karzai's central government to provincial leaders who perform better than their national counterparts. And although a complete withdrawal of American troops is not considered an option, Mr. Obama might endorse a partial withdrawal that would lead to a more limited counterinsurgency strategy initially advocated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
 One official noted that the Karzai government controlled little of Afghanistan on its own, and that even a partial American withdrawal would leave Mr. Karzai with no sustainable political future. Officials said Mr. Obama's Afghanistan review took weeks longer than expected in part because officials were unhappy about reports of fraud in the Afghan elections, and they implied that even after the new Afghan strategy is announced, details will not be final. 
 ''I'm not saying that we'll be in a perpetual state of review, but the time the president has taken so far should signal to people that he will not hesitate to take a hard look at things and question assumptions if things are not moving in the right direction,'' a senior White House official said.
 If Mr. Karzai ''falls short of our expectations, there are a lot of things, in terms of our investment, that we could do,'' one official said. ''Let's say he appoints someone to a certain ministry or portfolio, and we just consider that person unacceptable. We're not going to be forced to deal with that person.''
 But Mr. Karzai has already called the administration's bluff on that issue. He appointed a running mate, Marshal Muhammad Qasim Fahim, who has been accused by international groups of corruption and of maintaining an armed militia when he was defense minister. He is now one of Mr. Karzai's two vice presidents. 
 Mr. Karzai also ignored American and European objections and allied himself with Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is accused of involvement in the killings of thousands of Taliban members held as prisoners of war early in the Afghan conflict. Mr. Obama has called for an investigation of General Dostum, to no avail.
 Mr. Karzai may feel compelled to include the men in his government because his alliance with them helped get him elected. Marshal Fahim stood next to Mr. Karzai on Tuesday even as the Afghan president vowed to begin a campaign to clean up the government.
 That seeming contradiction left Afghanistan's international backers seething. On Friday, Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, threatened to pull back support for Mr. Karzai if he did not clean up his act. ''I am not prepared to put the lives of British men and women in harm's way for a government that does not stand up against corruption,'' he said.

HEADLINE: America's Defining Choice

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
President Obama and Congress will soon make defining choices about health care and troops for Afghanistan. 
 These two choices have something in common -- each has a bill of around $100 billion per year. So one question is whether we're better off spending that money blowing up things in Helmand Province or building up things in America.
 The total bill in Afghanistan has been running around $1 million per year per soldier deployed there. That doesn't include the long-term costs that will be incurred in coming decades -- such as disability benefits, or up to $5 million to provide round-the-clock nursing care indefinitely for a single soldier who suffers brain injuries. 
 So if President Obama dispatches another 30,000 or 40,000 troops, on top of the 68,000 already there, that would bring the total annual bill for our military presence there to perhaps $100 billion -- or more. And we haven't even come to the human costs.
 As for health care reforms, the 10-year cost suggests an average of $80 billion to $110 billion per year, depending on what the final bill looks like.
 Granted, the health care costs will continue indefinitely, while the United States cannot sustain 100,000 troops in Afghanistan for many years. On the other hand, the health care legislation pays for itself, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while the deployment in Afghanistan is unfinanced and will raise our budget deficits and undermine our long-term economic security.
 So doesn't it seem odd to hear hawks say that health reform is fiscally irresponsible, while in the next breath they cheer a larger deployment of troops in Afghanistan?
 Meanwhile, lack of health insurance kills about 45,000 Americans a year, according to a Harvard study released in September. So which is the greater danger to our homeland security, the Taliban or our dysfunctional insurance system?
 Who are these Americans who die for lack of insurance? Dr. Linda Harris, an ob-gyn in Oregon tells of Sue, a 31-year-old patient of hers. Sue was a single mom who worked hard -- sometimes two jobs at once -- to ensure that her beloved daughter would enjoy a better life.
 Sue's jobs never provided health insurance, and Sue felt she couldn't afford to splurge on herself to get gynecological checkups. For more than a dozen years, she never had a Pap smear, although one is recommended annually. Even when Sue began bleeding and suffering abdominal pain, she was reluctant to see a doctor because she didn't know how she would pay the bills.
 Finally, Sue sought help from a hospital emergency room, and then from the low-cost public clinic where Dr. Harris works. Dr. Harris found that Sue had advanced cervical cancer. Three months later, she died. Her daughter was 13.
 ''I get teary whenever I think about her,'' Dr. Harris said. ''It was so needless.'' 
 Cervical cancer has a long preinvasive stage that can be detected with Pap smears, and then effectively treated with relatively minor procedures, Dr. Harris said. 
 ''People talk about waiting lines in Canada,'' Dr. Harris added. ''I say, well, at least they have a line to wait in.'' 
 Based on the numbers from the Harvard study, a person like Sue dies as a consequence of lack of health care coverage every 12 minutes in America. As many people die every three weeks from lack of health insurance as were killed in the 9/11 attacks.
 Health coverage is becoming steadily more precarious as companies try to cut costs and insurance companies boost profits by denying claims and canceling coverage of people who get sick. I grew up on a farm in Yamhill, Ore., where we sometimes had greased pig contests. I'm not sure which is harder: getting a good grip on a greased hog or wrestling with an insurance company trying to avoid paying a claim it should.
 Joe Lieberman, a pivotal vote in the Senate, says he recognizes that there are problems and would like reform, but he denounces ''another government health insurance entitlement, the government going into the health insurance business.'' Look out -- it sounds as if Mr. Lieberman is planning to ax Medicare. 
 The health reform legislation in Congress is imperfect, of course. It won't do enough to hold down costs; it may restrict access even to private insurance coverage for abortion services; it won't do enough to address public health or unhealthy lifestyles.
 Likewise, troop deployment plans in Afghanistan are imperfect. Some experts think more troops will help. Others think they will foster a nationalist backlash and feed the insurgency (that's my view).
 So where's the best place to spend $100 billion a year? Is it on patrols in Helmand? Or is it to refurbish our health care system so that people like Sue don't die unnecessarily every 12 minutes?

HEADLINE: Japan Cools To America As It Awaits Obama Visit

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama will arrive in Tokyo on Friday, at a time when America's relations with Japan are at their most contentious since the trade wars of the 1990s -- and back then, the fights were over luxury cars and semiconductors, not over whether the two countries should re-examine their half-century-old strategic relationship.
 When Japan's Democratic Party came to power in September, ending 50 years of largely one-party government, Obama administration officials put on an outwardly positive face, congratulating the newcomers. But quietly, some American officials expressed fears that the blunt criticism that the Japanese had directed at the United States during the political campaign would translate to a more contentious relationship.
 Within weeks, those fears started to play out. The new Japanese government said the country would withdraw from an eight-year-old mission in the Indian Ocean to refuel warships supporting American efforts in Afghanistan. 
 The government also announced that it planned to revisit a 2006 agreement to relocate a Marine airfield on Okinawa to a less populated part of the island, and to move thousands of Marines from Okinawa to Guam.
 And Japanese government officials have suddenly lost their shyness about publicly sparring with American officials, as evident in a dispute in September between Japan's ambassador to the United States, Ichiro Fujisaki, and the Pentagon.
 Meanwhile, Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, has called for a more equal relationship with the United States, and his government wants a review of the status of forces agreement, which protects American troops from Japanese legal prosecution. Japanese citizens, and Okinawans in particular, have demanded such a review for years. 
 When Mr. Hatoyama met Mr. Obama in New York during the United NationsGeneral Assembly in September, the conditions seemed ripe for a kiss-and-make-up session. At their initial meeting, Mr. Obama congratulated Mr. Hatoyama ''for running an extraordinary campaign'' and complimented his party for ''leading dramatic change in Japan.'' 
 Mr. Hatoyama responded with the usual diplomatic niceties, telling reporters after the meeting that ''I told President Obama that the Japan-U.S. alliance will continue to be the central pillar, key pillar of the security of Japan and Japanese foreign policy.''
 But there were also a few awkward moments. Mr. Hatoyama and his wife, Miyuki, were the last to arrive at a leaders' dinner at the Phipps Conservatory on the margins of the Group of 20 economic summit meeting in Pittsburgh later that week in September. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, had been greeting arriving guests for almost two hours. ''I'm sorry we were late,'' Mrs. Hatoyama apologized. 
 A few days later, after the Obamas and the Hatoyamas flew to Copenhagen to lobby the International Olympic Committee for the 2016 Olympics, Tokyo beat out Chicago in the first round of voting, then was bumped as Rio de Janeiro took the prize.
 But all of that paled in comparison with the uproar that erupted in Japan after Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates visited Tokyo in October. Mr. Gates, known for speaking bluntly, pressed Mr. Hatoyama and Japanese military officials to keep their commitment on the military agreements.
 ''It is time to move on,'' Mr. Gates said, calling Japanese proposals to reopen the base issue ''counterproductive.'' Then, adding insult to injury in the eyes of Japanese commentators, Mr. Gates turned down invitations to attend a welcoming ceremony at the Defense Ministry and to dine with officials there. 
 In the weeks since, in advance of Mr. Obama's visit, both countries have taken pains to tone down the rancor. The Japanese government has sent several high-level officials, including members of Parliament, to Washington to take the political temperature. Besides meeting with Obama administration officials, the Japanese representatives have spoken with members of research and policy groups based in Washington, particularly experts on foreign policy issues related to Japan.
 ''The feelers they've been putting out is, 'Please don't push us to make a decision because if you do, you'll hear what you don't want to hear,' '' said Andrew L. Oros, a professor at Washington College and the author of ''Normalizing Japan: Politics, Identity and the Evolution of Security Practice.'' 
 Japan's new government is ''trying to backtrack from some of their campaign rhetoric, but it's too soon,'' Mr. Oros said.
 ''This was a historic election,'' he added. ''They overturned 50 years of conservative rule. They can't do everything at once.''
 Indeed, the new government is under political pressure at home. More than 20,000 Okinawa residents held a protest rally against the base last week, and residents have been vociferous in letting the government know that they expect it to keep its campaign promises. 
 Administration officials said they had no intention of letting the relationship slide. Mr. Obama will be ''looking to build his relationship and his personal ties with the new D.P.J. government there,'' Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Obama's senior director for East Asian affairs, told reporters on Monday, using the initials for the Democratic Party of Japan. ''This government is looking for a more equal partnership with the United States. We are prepared to move in that direction.''
 But the United States, while tamping down the tone of the discussion, is still pressing Japan, particularly on the Okinawa base issue. Mr. Obama, in an interview on Tuesday with NHK television of Japan, said Japan must honor the agreement. 
 While ''it's perfectly appropriate for the new government to want to re-examine how to move forward,'' Mr. Obama told NHK, he added that he was ''confident that once that review is completed that they will conclude that the alliance we have, the basing arrangements that have been discussed, all those things serve the interest of Japan and they will continue.''
 In an effort to defuse tensions and perhaps make up for saying it would not refuel the Indian Ocean warships, Japan said Tuesday that it would sharply increase its nonmilitary aid to Afghanistan, pledging $5 billion for a variety of projects that include building schools and highways, training police officers, clearing land mines, and rehabilitating former Taliban fighters. 
 But even if the military squabble is eventually resolved, Japan's economic relationship with the United States is being altered. China has now surpassed the United States as Japan's major trading partner, a switch that economists expect to continue as China's economy grows.
 ''Japan sees its future more within Asia,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an Asia specialist and professor at Cornell University. ''They feel that they owe a lot less to the U.S. right now. U.S. economic policy is hurting them in a lot of ways, particularly with the decline in the value of the dollar versus the yen.''

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off-key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20091112 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20091112
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20091112
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'WHO SHOT ROCK & ROLL: A PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY, 1955 TO THE PRESENT,' through Jan. 31. This entertaining exhibition presents more than 175 images of rock stars by 105 photographers. It includes album cover art, candid snapshots, publicity portraits and pictures of live performances. The downside is that only a few photographs rise to the level of fine art, and the general focus is on only the most famous and familiar musicians, from Elvis Presley to Kurt Cobain. There are some nice surprises, though, like a small Polaroid of Courtney Love on which she wrote a rude salutation. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'WATTEAU TO DEGAS: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE FRITS LUGT COLLECTION,' through Jan. 10. Ranging from Watteau and Fragonard to Ingres and Degas, 64 works from a celebrated Parisian repository offer a gratifying immersion in 18th- and 19th-century French draftsmanship. For urbanity, vivacity and technical merit, these artists remain in a league of their own. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20091112
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'KANDINSKY,' through Jan. 13. The Guggenheim is not exactly thinking outside the spiral with this sleek retrospective, but then the pioneering abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) is more than just its foundational artist. He is the angel in the architecture. His swirling, unanchored abstractions are implicit in Frank Lloyd Wright's great circling rotunda, and now they fill it, bottom to top -- a sensational sight that is as much Kandinsky-Wright reunion as retrospective. One of the fullest, clearest views of Kandinsky's achievement in decades, it certainly unmoors the conventional wisdom of precipitous decline after 1921, if not 1914. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20091112
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20091112
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'SERIZAWA: MASTER OF JAPANESE TEXTILE DESIGN,' through Jan. 17. Serizawa Keisuke (1895-1984), one of the most prominent Japanese artisans of the 20th century, transformed paper and fabric with intricate, hand-cut stencils. His art updated, and some might say elevated, centuries-old crafts with allusions to Korean folk art, Chinese calligraphy, Aesop's Fables, Indian miniatures and Western midcentury Modernism. This handsomely installed show includes an early artist's-book adaptation of ''Don Quixote,'' as well as curtains, screens and kimonos from Serizawa's mature and productive postwar years. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICAN STORIES: PAINTINGS OF EVERYDAY LIFE, 1765-1915,' through Jan. 24. This exhibition of 103 figurative paintings and portraits that the museum justifiably calls ''iconic'' spans the Colonial period to World War I, touching on issues like the settling of the West and the Civil War and its legacy. Many of the works are masterpieces by artists like John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt and George Bellows that will in all likelihood not be gathered together anytime soon. Others are little-known gems of genre painting; many more are less gemlike genre works full of plots, props and stilted emotions. The result is refreshingly evenhanded. Art historical viewpoints previously too often considered mutually exclusive -- pro-narrative versus pro-form -- are synthesized. The paintings benefit tremendously from the mix, as will your understanding of American art and history. A thrilling, illuminating show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE SAMURAI: JAPANESE ARMS AND ARMOR, 1156-1868,' through Jan. 10. This sumptuous exhibition alternates between extraordinarily gorgeous, intricately wrought suits of armor that count as some of the world's greatest works of multimedia art and an unprecedented gathering of some 60 bare sword blades whose Minimalist subtleties of line, proportion and surface form a show within a show. In between are amazing helmets; ornate sword mountings and fittings; scroll paintings of samurai dressed to kill; and the colorful surcoats they traditionally wore over their armor. Nearly all of the 200-plus works come from Japan's museums; about half have been designated National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties by the Japanese government. Because of their extreme fragility, not all objects will be on view at once: about 60 pieces will be replaced by similar objects of equal caliber during the first week in December. Visit early and often. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LOOKING IN: ROBERT FRANK'S ''THE AMERICANS,''' through Jan. 3. In the mid-1950s the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank made three long car trips from New York City across the United States, through the Deep South to California, and back again by a northern route, taking thousands of pictures as he went. He needed a year to develop, print and edit them down to the 83 that made up his classic book, ''The Americans,'' which was panned for its pessimism in his day, and sanctified for its political prescience since. The Met show, and the huge book that accompany it, are basically monuments to that monument. If ''The Americans'' looks more formulaic in its sentiments than it did 50 years, that is because it has had so many imitators and the country it captured has changed. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID,'' ' through Nov. 29. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WATTEAU, MUSIC, AND THEATER,' through Nov. 29. Informed by new research in music and theater, this show highlights the influence of the performing arts on paintings, drawings and prints by Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his contemporaries. It includes several elaborate fetes galantes and smaller works depicting actors and musicians, and cultivates an atmosphere of civilized hedonism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' ongoing. Attributed to Michelangelo Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a ten-year loan from the French Republic, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM: 'CEZANNE AND AMERICAN MODERNISM,' through Jan. 3. Including early works by Dove, Hartley, Gorky and more than 25 others, this fascinating show explores the art history-changing influence of Cezanne on American artists between 1907 and 1930. Nothing by the American artists looks as good as any of the 18 Cezannes on view, but the exhibition and its hefty, richly informative catalog are revelatory. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J. , (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO AND REVOLUTION: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 3. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. The nearly 80 works selected from the Morgan's own collection include excellent pieces by most of the era's best known artists, from the Rococoists Watteau and Fragonard to Neo-Classicists like Jacques-Louis David and Etienne Louis Boullee. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'WILLIAM BLAKE'S WORLD: ''A NEW HEAVEN IS BEGUN,'' ' through Jan. 3. Artist, poet and irritated ecstatic, William Blake listed as his primary residence the Imagination, a combination of creative command post and psychological refuge where, as he put it, the eternal and the real meet. You'll see a good amount of both in this show, drawn from the Morgan's deep holdings of Blake's hand-printed-and-painted books and from the entire series of 21 watercolor illustrations he made for ''The Book of Job.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)20091112
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived here in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, who served as a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. ( Smith)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091112
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION,' through Feb. 15. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point, for many viewers, will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 NEW MUSEUM: 'URS FISCHER: MARGUERITE DE PONTY,' through Feb. 7. Naming his first American museum show after a fictional character from Mallarme, the young Swiss sculptor Urs Fischer spreads himself thin, but brilliantly. Admirers of his gaping holes in walls may be disappointed by the sparseness, quiet and subtlety, but for the most part -- despite too much Surrealism 101 -- Mr. Fischer's neo-Dada formalism wins out. Nose-thumbing irreverence colludes with Minimalist space, scale and perception. Take this three-floor show from the top and watch worlds collide: abstraction, found objects and trompe l'oeil; the actual-size, the large and the enlarged; images, reflections and volumes. Each floor is a kind of implosion, although it only becomes obvious on the lowest. The perpetual twilight in the middle may be the most memorable moment. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24, 2010. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20091112
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20091112
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: ABSTRACTION,' through Jan. 17. The focus of this surprisingly surprising show is the first two decades of O'Keeffe's long career, beginning in 1915 when she made her first abstract drawings, which were also among the first fully abstract images by any American artist, and continuing into the 1930s, when she was spending increasing amounts of time alone in New Mexico. In between comes a body of bold, graphically punchy and sensuous painting that you tend to experience whole and fast, as you do a strong scent or a touch. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20091112
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'RONI HORN AKA RONI HORN,' through Jan. 24. Two floors is one floor too many for this late-phase Post-Minimalist. She is best represented here by some exquisite cast glass sculptures, photographs of Iceland's extraordinary topography and several large drawings that combine aspects of carving, cartography and quilting. The catalog is even more elaborately stage-managed; the main take-away from the combination is that Ms. Horn's ostensibly androgynous (but actually butch) persona is her most engaging creation and that self-portraiture and language are her truest modes of expression. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20091112
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'MRS. DELANY AND HER CIRCLE,' through Jan. 3. This fascinating show celebrates the contributions of the exemplary 18th-century Englishwoman Mary Delany to botany, the decorative arts and English court society. A widow twice over with no children, Mrs. Delany thrived in middle and old age as a naturalist, amateur artist and close friend to Handel, Jonathan Swift and the Duchess of Portland, among others. The exhibition includes her drawings, silhouettes and floral embroidery, and a selection from the ''Flora Delanica'': a series of some 1,000 botanical collages, begun when she was 72. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Conn. , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Rosenberg)20091112
 Galleries: Other
 BARRY X. BALL: 'MASTERPIECES,' through Dec. 12. A striking departure from the surrealistic heads for which Mr. Ball is known, this show replicates three Italian Late Baroque busts in different kinds of exotic stone using a combination of high-tech machinery and manual labor. Two glowing pieces represent ''Purity'' by Antonio Corradini, an image of a woman whose head and face are covered by a sheer veil. The third, based on ''Envy'' by Orazio Marinali, is a snarling, snake-haired Medusa. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side , (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Johnson)20091112
 'ICONS OF THE DESERT: EARLY ABORIGINAL PAINTINGS FROM PAPUNYA,' through Dec. 5. With their bold, diagrammatic compositions; finely coordinated colors; and dotted textures, paintings by indigenous Australians appeal to Western eyes trained to respond to abstraction and folk and so-called outsider art. The paintings in this excellent show are mostly from the 1970s, the early years of the modern Aboriginal painting movement. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20091112
 MIKE KELLEY AND MICHAEL SMITH: 'A VOYAGE OF GROWTH AND DISCOVERY,' through Nov. 30. This entertaining and thought-provoking exhibition features a six-channel video following Michael Smith, dressed as Baby Ikki in droopy diapers, bonnet and dark glasses, as he wanders around Burning Man, the weeklong celebration of all things psychedelic in the Nevada desert. With jungle-gym-like structures in the gallery and a towering junk-metal sculpture of Baby Ikki looming over all, the whole project represents Burning Man as a festival of infantilism. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MICHAEL WILLIAMS: 'UNCLE BIG,' through Nov. 22. On his second time out, this young painter's colorful, wood-grain-obsessed canvases raise the stakes. His informed if eccentric pictorial tactics hover in the vicinity of James Ensor and Roy DeForest (oh, look him up) and include bright-on-white wood-paneled spaces occupied and not; jigsaw puzzle extravaganzas figured or forested; and the occasional abstraction. The Revenge of the Regional Artists, Mr. DeForest included? Perhaps. Meanwhile, Mr. Williams is both true to himself and willing to mess around. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side , (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork.com. (Smith)20091112
 Last Chance
 SARAH ANNE JOHNSON: 'HOUSE ON FIRE'; closes on Saturday. This Canadian artist is trying to process some remarkable family history with the works in this show. In bronze sculptures, drawings on old photographs and newspaper clippings and a meticulously constructed dollhouse with a nightmarish interior, she alludes to her grandmother's mentally debilitating stay at a McGill University-affiliated psychiatric institution in the 1950s, where she underwent horrendous experimental treatments. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com. (Johnson) 20091112

HEADLINE: A Lack Of Rigor Has a Price

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris

 BODY:
MBIA, the financial insurance company, used to hold itself out as a paragon of hard work and number crunching.
 ''Each transaction guaranteed by MBIA needs to pass a rigorous underwriting process proving no losses will arise under the worst probable case scenario,'' the company said in a typical investor presentation just three years ago. 
 It added that its payouts for claims over 32 years came to less than $10,000 a year for every $100 million of insurance it wrote.
 ''We expect,'' the company added, ''to remain at that level or better.'' 
 That expectation was wrong. MBIA's once pristine AAA-rating has now turned into junk and no one wants to buy insurance from the company.
 MBIA insists it is in much better shape than investors realize, but in making that case it assumes it will be able to collect at least $1.2 billion from Wall Street firms that it says swindled it. If it were to win all its pending suits, it could collect billions more.
 MBIA is suing Merrill Lynch, which paid MBIA to insure securities backed by extraordinarily complex securities, among them collateralized debt obligations secured by collateralized debt obligations secured by collateralized debt obligations that were secured by mortgage-backed securities. Such a thing is known as a C.D.O. cubed, by the way.
 In the suit, filed in state court in New York, MBIA details its underwriting process, which does not sound very rigorous.
 ''The due diligence standard for a monoline insurer, which MBIA followed,'' did not involve looking into the quality of the securities underlying the securities being insured, MBIA said in its suit. Instead, it primarily relied on assurances by Merrill Lynch and on credit ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
 And, MBIA added, Merrill knew that the rating agencies also would not bother to look at the performance of the underlying loans in issuing their ratings.
 When I asked MBIA officials this week if they also understood that the rating agencies were not looking at the underlying loans, I got no answer, only a statement that the company could not discuss pending litigation.
 In any case, MBIA argues, Merrill knew that MBIA could not afford to do much research, and took advantage of it by lying about things that it knew no one would check. ''It would be enormously expensive, even if it were logistically feasible, for a credit insurer to investigate the health of these ground-level loans,'' MBIA argued in a court filing, adding that if it did such research, it would have to charge much higher premiums. MBIA said its premiums were as low as $77,500 for each $100 million of insurance. 
 In other suits, MBIA claims that mortgage issuers like Countrywide and IndyMac lied to it by claiming they were making loans based on strict underwriting criteria, when in fact they were not. It wants Bank of America, which took over Countrywide, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which closed IndyMac, to buy back mortgage loans that have defaulted. 
 Long after it wrote the insurance on those mortgage-backed securities, MBIA says it began to study the files of second-mortgage loans that had defaulted. It was clear from looking at the application files that more than 90 percent of the Countrywide loans had been improperly granted, and even more of the IndyMac loans clearly failed to meet the stated underwriting criteria.
 MBIA claims it had no way to check such things before it wrote the insurance, and properly relied on assurances by the mortgage companies. By early 2007, MBIA was issuing insurance for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mortgage securities within less than two weeks of first being told of the pending transaction. There was no time to do any real due diligence.
 The defendants in the suits have denied doing anything wrong, and the cases are a long way from trial. But MBIA's allegations raise an interesting question: How much of this mess could have been averted if everyone -- from the companies that made mortgage loans to the rating firms to the monoline insurers -- had been less trusting?
 Or if they wanted to keep being so trusting, would it not have been nice if they had admitted they were doing so little work? Perhaps MBIA should have changed the word ''rigorous'' to ''virtually nonexistent'' in describing its underwriting process. 
 This week MBIA reported a third-quarter loss, disappointing some investors, and the stock slipped below $4. The company still says its ''adjusted book value'' is more than $39 a share, but it is clear that investors do not believe it.
 To get to that figure, MBIA makes some interesting assumptions. Most prominent is the belief that current market prices for many assets are far below their intrinsic value. In other words, it assumes the market is very wrong. If that is correct, then MBIA will not have to pay nearly as much as some expect to honor its guarantees, and it will be worth a lot more than its current stock price would indicate.
 Back when MBIA was flying high, its business model was essentially that the municipal bond market was wildly inefficient. For its product to be valuable, issuers had to be able to borrow for a rate low enough to more than offset the insurance premiums they were paying. By telling investors that it expected virtually no claims, MBIA was saying that it was selling insurance that was not really needed.
 For many years, that seemed to work with municipal bonds. Investors in such bonds got comfort, and MBIA got profits. But the company's expansion into structured finance proved to be disastrous.
 Perhaps the problem was a simple one of economics: MBIA could sell the insurance only if it charged premiums so low that they assumed almost no chance of default, and allowed for little if any real due diligence to determine the actual risks.
 It did not work.
 ''Since the fourth quarter of 2007, MBIA Corp. made $4.4 billion of cash payments'' related to the types of securities covered in its suits, the company reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. ''As a result of the current economic stress, MBIA could incur additional payment obligations beyond these mortgage-related exposures, which may be substantial, increasing the stress on MBIA Corp.'s liquidity.''
 For now, at least, MBIA can write no new insurance because its guarantee is not worth very much. It still collects premiums on old insurance, and the $39-a-share book value reflects the expectation that premiums on those policies will keep rolling in for many years.
 The company has reorganized, separating its muni bond business from the rest, in the hope that it can eventually start selling muni insurance again. But the split is a messy one, being challenged in court by banks fearing that it could undermine the company's ability to pay claims on the structured finance products. 
 If MBIA's current models forecasting losses are even close to being right, the company is probably worth more than its current share price would indicate. But given the history, it is easy to see why investors are no longer willing to trust an insurer that did not bother to do any real investigation of the risks it was insuring.

HEADLINE: Housing Agency, Cash Dwindling, Tightens Rules

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Federal Housing Administration, the government agency whose loan-insurance programs have become a crucial source of support for the housing market, said on Thursday that its cash reserves had dwindled significantly in the last year as more borrowers defaulted on their mortgages.
 The agency released an audit that spelled out the rapid deterioration of its finances. It is tightening loan standards in hopes it will not become another drain on the United States Treasury, but is reluctant to clamp down so much that it snuffs out the tentative recovery in housing. 
 How successfully the agency walks this tightrope could well determine whether the recovery gathers force, or whether home prices slide again -- perhaps creating a fresh economic downturn.
 As recently as a few weeks ago, the F.H.A. had said that even under the bleakest economic forecast, its cash cushion would quickly recover. On Thursday, it abandoned that position. 
 ''There is a real risk. Nobody has a crystal ball,'' Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development, said in an interview. ''We recognize there is a possibility that the reserves go below zero and stay there.''
 Still, Mr. Donovan stressed that the agency, which had a role in one out of five home purchases in the last year, would not need a direct taxpayer bailout. 
 ''There is no extraordinary action that Congress or anyone else needs to take,'' he said during a news conference in Washington. 
 Instead, the agency would borrow from the Treasury, under authority previously granted by Congress. In the worst case, involving a protracted recession, the audit said the F.H.A. would run out of capital in 2011 and have to borrow $1.6 billion from the Treasury to pay insurance claims, a relatively small sum.
 That is not a situation the agency considers likely. In line with many analysts, the agency expects the housing market to turn down again over the next nine months and then to recover. Under this projection, foreclosures would be manageable and the reserves would quickly grow.
 The F.H.A.'s annual audit was scheduled for release last week, but was mysteriously delayed at the last minute. On Thursday, as it released the document, the agency explained that it wanted its auditors to include more negative forecasts as a way of understanding the worst-case risk.
 The audit showed reserves to be 0.53 percent of the total portfolio, far below the 2 percent minimum mandated by Congress and far less than the audit last year had forecast. In 2007, just before housing prices began their worst slump in decades, the reserves were above 6 percent.
 Ann Schnare, a consultant who has analyzed the F.H.A. balance sheet, put the situation this way: ''They're running on empty.''
 As the fortunes of the F.H.A. have deteriorated over the last few months, the agency has become a focal point for dissatisfaction over federal efforts to prop up the housing market. 
 It is drawing comparisons to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant agencies created by Congress to keep the mortgage market supplied with cash by buying up pools of home loans. With borrowers defaulting in the downturn, Fannie and Freddie have required enormous bailouts.
 The F.H.A.'s role differs from that of Fannie and Freddie. Through its insurance, it helps marginal buyers get loans if they do not have the 20 percent down payment a traditional bank loan requires. The agency requires a 3.5 percent down payment. Critics say it went overboard and insured too many loans to unqualified borrowers in 2007 and 2008, a position with which the agency itself now agrees.
 Nearly one in five loans it insured in 2007 falls into the category of ''seriously delinquent,'' it said Thursday. These loanholders are at least three months behind in their payments. For 2008 loans, 12 percent of them were seriously delinquent.
 The F.H.A. says it is insuring loans to more financially secure buyers with higher credit scores. The average credit score of new borrowers, it said, is 693, compared with 633 two years ago. 
 In a sense, the agency is bulking up and giving as many loans as it can to qualified buyers as a way to diminish the relative size of the pool of problem loans. It guaranteed more than $360 billion in mortgages in the last year, four times the amount of 2007. 
 Critics say this is only increasing the size of the ultimate peril. 
 ''They keep saying they're going to outrun their problems, but some way, somehow, the taxpayer is going to end up on the hook,'' said Edward Pinto, a former executive with Fannie Mae.
 During the news conference, Secretary Donovan and the agency's commissioner, David H. Stevens, said that the cash reserve, the figure that has fallen to 0.53 percent of loans outstanding, was merely a supplement to a much larger fund that the F.H.A. was holding against expected losses. Between the two accounts, the agency has $31 billion to cover losses over the next 30 years.
 The F.H.A.'s problems stem from its rapid transition from a wallflower to the most popular student in class.
 During the housing boom, buyers flocked to private subprime lenders, who offered deals that required no money down and no documentation. The F.H.A., which required its token down payment and documentation of the borrower's earning power, lost ground.
 But as the market tumbled and the subprime outfits failed, F.H.A. loans became the next best thing. Brian Montgomery, who ran the F.H.A. for the Bush administration, said in a recent interview that the agency felt it had no choice but to open the doors to a broader group of applicants. 
 Citing pressure from Congress and the White House, Mr. Montgomery said: ''We had to let these loans through.''
 Mr. Montgomery, now a consultant, says that anyone dismayed by the possibility of yet another bailout should feel a different emotion toward the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, for that matter, himself: gratitude.
 ''They should be going over to the H.U.D. building and frankly thanking the career staff for saving them from a depression,'' Mr. Montgomery said.

HEADLINE: Small Signs Of Optimism

BYLINE: By TRACEY TAYLOR

 BODY:
If you live in the Bay Area, you hardly need reminding that you pay more for your home than most people. The region has the dubious honor of ranking No. 1 nationally in median home value, median monthly mortgage costs and median gross rent. 
 PRICE The median price paid for a Bay Area home is $365,000, compared with $177,900 nationally. That regional median price peaked at $665,000 in June 2007.
 The Urban Land Institute's new Bay Area Burden report offers more of the figures behind the general sense of being overstretched: almost 20 percent of all Bay Area homeowners spend more than half of their income on housing -- far exceeding the national average of 12 percent.
 On average, these households spend more than $28,000 annually on housing -- about 39 percent of the area median income, the report said. Three-fifths of local residents live in communities unaffordable to households earning less than $80,000 a year.
 SALES New sales figures show an increase in the area's two biggest urban concentrations, at a time of year when one would expect a dip. The number of existing single family homes sold in San Jose in the month ended Oct. 15 was 764, up 12 percent from that period in 2008, according to MDA DataQuick. In San Francisco, there was an 18.5 percent jump with 282 sales.
 Even in Oakland, where one expects less buoyancy, existing home sales slipped just 3.5 percent, to 276 from 286, according to DataQuick's analysis. 
 Low interest rates as well as lower prices help explain the strong numbers. 
 In more hard-hit communities, government assistance has helped increase home sales, particularly among first-time buyers. Lending on about half of all homes bought in Martinez (51.2 percent), Brentwood (50.6 percent) and Antioch (50.3 percent) is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. In Oakley, it is 65 percent.
 FORECLOSURES The foreclosure statistics tell another story, and the most notable trend is a discernible increase in the number of distressed homes at the higher end of the market. In San Francisco, where the median home price is $650,000 (compared with $365,000 for the Bay Area as a whole), there has been a significant rise in the number of default notices: 180 in the month ended Oct. 15, compared with 34 in the same period last year. Mountain View, Palo Alto and Danville have also had sharp rises in defaults. 
 A major cause is the resetting of ''exotic'' mortgages, those with low upfront interest rates. Plunging home values, and reduced availability of the jumbo mortgages, which make refinancing possible, have left many high-end homeowners facing significant monthly payment increases.

HEADLINE: Phillips de Pury Limps to the Finish With a $7 Million Total

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The evening sale of contemporary art at Phillips de Pury brought a vibrant week of auctions to an anemic close on Thursday night. 
 Phillips, the struggling Chelsea auction house, was offering less-than-stellar examples of trendy names like Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons, making the event seem like an average day sale at Sotheby's or Christie's, with prices in the hundreds of thousands rather than millions. The auction totaled $7 million ($5.8 million before Phillips's fees are added in), in the middle of its $5.8 million to $8.3 million estimate. Of the 39 works on the block, 8 failed to sell. 
 ''They did pretty well with what they had,'' said Edward Tyler Nahem, a Manhattan dealer. ''The offerings were pretty skimpy.'' 
 But while the subdued salesroom -- a makeshift space with a concrete floor and views of a carwash, the Hudson River and the West Side Highway -- was not as crowded as in years past, it was nonetheless filled with many of the regular dealers who make it their business to see and be seen, keep an eye on market gyrations and perhaps even pick up a bargain or two. 
 Without the expertise or international reach of Sotheby's and Christie's, Phillips was forced to rely in part on its relationship with Charles Saatchi, the British collector, gallery owner and advertising magnate. He struck a deal with the auction house two years ago when he was opening a gallery in London. Phillips agreed to help subsidize the gallery's free admission, but in exchange, Mr. Saatchi -- known for disposing of works as quickly as he collects them -- agreed to conduct most of his buying and selling through Phillips. Beyond the dozen or so works he was offering, sellers, dealers and auction house experts said the sale consisted of works that Sotheby's and Christie's had rejected or were from dealers in need of quick cash.
 The top seller was by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, who had a much-talked-about exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea this year. Her ''Infinity Nets (T.W.A.)'' from 2000, a monochromatic painting of thickly rendered loops, brought $700,000 ($842,500 with fees), above its high, $400,000 estimate. 
 (Final prices include the commission to Phillips: 25 percent of the first $50,000 of the hammer price, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
 It has been Warhol's week, what with the artist's ''200 One Dollar Bills'' fetching $43.7 million at Sotheby's on Wednesday night. Phillips was selling one of his Brillo boxes, a 1964 construction fashioned from plywood, with silk-screen ink and house paint. It had once belonged to Frederick W. Hughes, the artist's business manager, who died in 2001. Two telephone bidders went for the work, and it sold for $700,000, or $842,500 with commission. (Its low estimate was $700,000.) 
 Richard Prince generally has a following, but on Thursday night his ''Untitled (Four Women With Their Backs to the Camera),'' a 1980 suite of four color photographs from an edition of 10, fell flat. It was expected to sell for at least $400,000, but there wasn't a bidder in sight, and Simon de Pury, the auctioneer, stopped trying at $320,000. 
 There was competition for another popular American artist, Ed Ruscha, perhaps because he is the subject of a retrospective now at the Hayward Gallery in London. Three bidders sought ''Mean as Hell,'' from 2002, a bird's-eye view of the nighttime Los Angeles grid, but nobody was willing to pay more than $490,000 ($590,500 with fees). It had been estimated at $400,000 to $600,000. 
 While bidding seemed thin, with often only one or two people trying for an artwork, Michael McGinnis, Phillips's worldwide director of contemporary art, said he did not witness the same buyer's fatigue he had seen since the recession began, adding, ''A lot of money has come back into the market.''

HEADLINE: New Claims From Jobless Show Decline

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment insurance fell more than expected last week, offering some hopeful signs for the job market.
 Still, many analysts worry the nation could be in for a jobless recovery as the unemployment rate rises despite some overall economic growth. 
 The Labor Department said Thursday that first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 502,000 from an upwardly revised 514,000 the previous week. That is the fewest claims since the week ended Jan. 3, and below economists' estimates. The four-week average, which smoothes fluctuations, dropped to 519,750, the lowest in almost a year. It has fallen by more than 20 percent since its peak in the spring.
 Economists watch initial claims as a gauge of the pace of layoffs. But claims also provide a signal about companies' willingness to hire, because laid-off workers able to find jobs are less likely to request benefits.
 Many analysts estimate that claims must fall to roughly 450,000 to signal that the economy is adding jobs.
 The number of people continuing to claim benefits dropped by 139,000, to 5.6 million, also below analysts' estimates. The figures on continuing claims lag initial claims by a week.
 But millions of unemployed Americans have used up the regular 26 weeks of benefits typically provided by states and are receiving extended benefits for up to 73 more weeks, paid for by the federal government. Congress added 14 to 20 weeks to the extended program last week, the fourth extension since the recession began and the longest total extension on record.
 About 4.1 million people were receiving extended benefits in the week ended Oct. 24, little changed from the previous week.
 The unemployment rate jumped to 10.2 percent in October, the Labor Department said last week, as employers cut a net total of 190,000 jobs. That was the highest jobless rate in 26 years.

HEADLINE: The 'Highly Qualified Teacher' Dodge

 BODY:
Education Secretary Arne Duncan has been widely held in high regard since he was appointed in January, but no honeymoon lasts forever. Mr. Duncan's came to an abrupt end earlier this week when he issued long-awaited rules that the states must follow to apply for his $4.3 billion discretionary fund, known as the Race to the Top Fund, and the second round of federal financing under the $49 billion federal stimulus package known as the state fiscal stabilization fund. 
 The rules for the Race to the Top Fund, which is designed to reward states that embrace reform and bypass those that do not, are generally sound and have been greeted with enthusiasm. But some school reform groups and some in Congress have reacted with dismay to the part of the stabilization fund that was supposed to require the states to end the longstanding and reprehensible practice of shunting unprepared and unqualified teachers into the schools serving the poorest students.
 The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 was clear in requiring states to remedy situations in which high poverty schools were being disproportionately staffed by teachers who were inexperienced, unqualified or teaching in fields that they had not majored in.
 The country would be much further along on the reform trail had the Bush administration followed the law. Instead, it allowed the states to define away the problem by re-labeling the existing, inadequate teacher corps as ''highly qualified.''
 Congress tried to discourage the use of inexperienced and unqualified teachers a second time when it passed the stimulus act. Education advocates inside and outside Congress expected that the stabilization fund application would be explicit and ambitious on the issue of teacher equity. They were understandably disappointed to find the issue couched, once again, in euphemistic language that asks the states to describe in vague terms whether the teacher corps is ''highly qualified.'' 
 The Congressional Black Caucus is unhappy with this approach. The Education Trust, an influential research group that deals with reform issues, accused Mr. Duncan of papering over a serious problem and squandering an opportunity to force ''truth-telling about unfair teacher-assignment practices.'' 
 The language in the application reflects timidity at the White House and in Congress, where some voices wanted to delay the fight over this issue until next year when Congress will likely reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The language also reflects the sometimes excessive influence of boutique alternative certification programs, which want to keep doors open for teachers who might be shut out under traditional criteria. 
 But the facts on the ground remain inescapably clear. Children in poor neighborhoods will continue to be poorly served at school until Congress pushes the states to provide them with better, more effective teachers.

HEADLINE: Eating by the Numbers

BYLINE: By JULIE S. DOWNS, GEORGE LOEWENSTEIN and JESSICA WISDOM. 
Julie S. Downs is an assistant research professor, George Loewenstein is a professor and Jessica Wisdom is a graduate student in Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Social and Decision Sciences.

 BODY:
BURIED in the nearly 2,000 pages of the health reform bill passed by the House on Saturday is a provision requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts on their menus. Given the worsening problem of obesity in the United States, and the superiority of disease prevention over treatment, calorie posting seems like a great idea. However, research by us and others suggests that it is unlikely to have much, if any, impact on eating or obesity. 
 There have now been three studies of New York City's menu-labeling legislation, which took effect last year and serves as a model for the national legislation. One relatively small study conducted by researchers at New York University and Yale and published in the journal Health Affairs found no impact of labels on healthier eating, although the sample wasn't large enough to detect modest changes. 
 We conducted a somewhat different study, supported by the United States Department of Agriculture and published in American Economic Review earlier this year, that examined purchases by 1,479 McDonald's customers in New York City in 2007 and 2008, both before and after menu labeling went into effect. 
 Beyond simply measuring the impact of labeling, we gave some diners information about how many calories one is recommended to consume per day or per meal, anticipating that this information would help diners to make use of the posted calorie information. However, we found that this did not help diners use menu labels, and we saw no impact on calorie consumption. 
 Supporters of menu labeling, however, have been talking up a third study, conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which included more than 20,000 customers at 13 restaurant chains. It studied eating habits in 2007, before the labeling law took effect, and again this year. The full data from 2009 have not been published, but news reports indicate that the researchers found significant reductions in consumption at just four of the chains. (The only specific reduction cited was 23 calories per patron at Starbucks, a pretty modest improvement.) 
 Unfortunately, the press got carried away. The Reuters article on the study carried the headline, ''New York Study Says Menu Labeling Affects Behavior.'' The National Post of Canada added a photograph with the caption reading: ''A study of chain restaurants in New York City, where it is mandatory to list calorie content on the menu, found that consumers were consuming on average 106 calories less per visit.'' But that's not what the study found. 
 Instead, customers in 2009 were asked if they had noticed the calorie information, and 56 percent said yes -- an encouraging sign. However, only about a quarter of that 56 percent said they used the information to decide what to order. This group, which make up only about 15 percent of total customers, bought meals with 106 fewer calories on average than those who said they didn't notice or use the information. 
 As anyone who has taken a course in statistics knows, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Just because those who claimed to have used the information consumed relatively fewer calories doesn't mean that the information was what caused them to do so. 
 Based on the scientific literature, we know that people who seek out and use calorie information are likely to be different from other eaters in many ways, including their motivation to cut calories. Sure, it's possible that some people who looked at the information were persuaded to consume fewer calories, but it is equally plausible that those who were intending to order lower-calorie meals were more likely to seek out the calorie information. 
 By helping consumers make more informed decisions, calorie posting may be desirable even if it fails to reduce calorie intake. But effective policies to deal with obesity will need to involve much more than posting calories. People eat too much because calorie-dense foods are convenient and cheap, with large portion sizes priced to encourage overeating. 
 Members of Congress -- and the New York State Assembly, which is considering similar labeling legislation -- would do well to consider a wide range of methods to tip people toward healthier food choices, including efforts to make healthy foods relatively cheaper or more convenient. To pin our hopes on calorie posting is bad lawmaking based on poor reading of science.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
The giant chip maker Intel, facing antitrust challenges around the world, announced on Thursday that it would pay $1.25 billion to settle its long-running disputes with its smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices.
 The settlement, covering both antitrust and patent claims, ends the computer industry's most bitter legal war. 
 But the truce may not be enough to turn around the fortunes of A.M.D, which has struggled to come up with chips that give it any significant technological or performance edge over Intel, which supplies about 80 percent of the microprocessors that sit at the heart of personal computers.
 At least in the short term, the settlement also does not end Intel's antitrust problems. Governments in Europe, the United States and Asia have accused the company of systematically using large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to persuade computer makers to use its chips instead of those made by A.M.D. 
 The regulators contend that Intel's tactics have not only hurt competitors, but also effectively forced customers to pay higher prices. On Thursday, both the European Union and the New York attorney general's office said they would continue to press their cases against the company.
 Still, legal experts say the agreementresolves some of the antitrust issues surrounding Intel and could dissuade other government agencies from bringing cases against the company.
 The Federal Trade Commission, for example, has been investigating the big chip maker for the past year but has taken no action. ''This private settlement has probably taken a lot of wind out of the sails'' of the F.T.C.'s case, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the University of Iowa. 
 The agreement between the two Silicon Valley companies mainly covers A.M.D.'s claims that Intel rewarded computer makers that used only Intel chips and punished those who bought from A.M.D. Intel contends that it never engaged in tactics to exclude A.M.D. from the marketplace but agreed in the settlement not to do so in the future. 
 The pact provides for quarterly meetings between the companies and programs for mediating disputes over exclusionary practices. The firms will also cross-license each other's patents for five years.
 But it's unclear whether the deal will truly change the competitive dynamics between the companies. A.M.D., founded 40 years ago, rose to prominence as a maker of Intel-compatible chips, but it has had difficulty producing notably better products than Intel and often ended up in devastating price wars. 
 Dirk Meyer, the chief executive of A.M.D., said the settlement opened the door to a ''transformation in the way our industry operates,'' though he admitted change would not be immediate. 
 Thomas M. McCoy, A.M.D.'s executive vice president for legal affairs, said his company's long-time goal had only been fair competition. ''We're not looking for any help, just do not hurt us,'' he said.
 Intel executives said that settling the case was a pragmatic business decision, a careful weighing of risks. 
 The jury trial in A.M.D.'s antitrust case against Intel was scheduled to begin in Delaware next spring. If things had gone against Intel, the chip maker could have been hit with triple damages, executives said. 
 ''We have never wavered in our position that Intel did nothing outside the law,'' said Intel's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini. ''It made sense to step back and find a way to settle this.'' 
 Michael Salinger, an economist at the Boston University School of Management and a former F.T.C. official, said the substantial settlement ''suggests Intel knew they faced a serious risk of losing'' in the A.M.D. trial. 
 However, analysts said that the deal was unlikely to have a significant impact on how Intel did business. 
 ''A.M.D. did very well from this settlement, but Intel's business model is not changing,'' said Stacy Rasgon, a chip analyst at Bernstein Research.
 The Intel settlement with A.M.D. does not cover a range of business practices, including Intel's broad pricing policies and its marketing payments to PC makers under its Intel Inside branding campaign. 
 Those pricing and marketing practices have drawn the scrutiny of regulators worldwide.
 In May, the European Union hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine, which the company is appealing. And last week, New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, filed a wide-ranging antitrust suit against Intel. 
 Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the European Union's competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said on Thursday that the settlement would have no effect on Europe's case. 
 ''Intel has an ongoing obligation to comply with the commission's antitrust decision and with E.U. competition law,'' Mr. Todd said. ''The commission continues to vigorously monitor Intel's compliance with its obligations under the E.U. antitrust decision.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo's office said its suit against Intel also was continuing.
 Intel and A.M.D. said that talks to end their disputes began in April, but negotiations got serious over the summer, after the Europeans ruled against Intel. Mr. Otellini said New York's suit had no effect on the timing of the deal, although the state's investigation began last year.
 The final negotiating point, Mr. Otellini said, was how much Intel would pay A.M.D. He said it pained him to write a big check, but $1.2 billion might be a ''small multiple'' of the company's liability if it lost a jury trial.
 Intel and A.M.D. have wrangled legally for more than two decades, and A.M.D. has been the primary instigator behind various government investigations of its rival over the years. By now, the two sides have exchanged 200 million documents, and witness depositions run to 2,200 hours -- all of which are available to government investigators. 
 Besides cash, the settlement gives A.M.D. greater freedom to produce chips at different contract factories around the world. Under a patent cross-licensing deal with Intel, A.M.D. was restricted in producing large volumes of chips in any factory not owned by A.M.D. or a subsidiary.
 That part of the agreement, analysts say, could eventually allow A.M.D. to reduce its stake in its former chip-making operations, which in March were spun off into a money-losing joint venture called Globalfoundries. In the third quarter, A.M.D. had operating income of $47 million, excluding the losses from Globalfoundries, on revenue of $1.4 billion.
 ''A stronger A.M.D. is good for competition in the industry,'' said Mr. Rasgon. ''The impact will depend on how well A.M.D. does in developing and producing products over time.''

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Why Philippe Diaz has titled his new documentary ''The End of Poverty?'' is unclear, because this guilt trip/history lesson is really about the beginning of poverty: how the economic and social systems evolved that have kept parts of the world wealthy and large swaths of it poor. The film spends so much time detailing its thesis that the roots of modern poverty are 500 years deep -- going back to the explorers and conquistadors who first supplanted indigenous economic systems with Western ideas of property ownership -- that it only briefly mentions what might be done about the problem. And then it cops out by not dealing with the many practical barriers to that solution. 
 For his gallery of talking heads, Mr. Diaz, to his credit, uses academics and public figures from all over the globe -- Kenya, Bolivia, France -- rather than just the usual American and British professors. And they lay the blame for poverty squarely on Western capitalism and the notion that natural resources like water and oil can be owned. (If that sounds like Henry George, the 19th-century political economist, it's because the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, which is devoted to George's ideas, is behind the film.) These experts sound a bit naive, but they do at least make the case that handouts from wealthy countries won't undo the current inequities.
 What will? Serge Latouche, a French economist, suggests what he calls de-growth as the way back to economic Eden, but the film ends without explaining how to bring that about. 
 THE END OF POVERTY?
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan. 
 Written and directed by Philippe Diaz; director of photography, Mr. Diaz; narrated by Martin Sheen; edited by Tom Von Doom; music by Cristian Bettler and Max Soussan; produced by Beth Portello; released by Cinema Libre Studio.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart's Profit Rises, But a Key Indicator Slips

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Even as more consumers flocked to Wal-Mart the last few months for deals on brand-name electronics, the company cut prices drastically to keep up with competitors, undermining its sales.
 Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer and an increasingly important player in electronics retailing, posted strong third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Though the company has gained market share during the recession, sales at stores open at least a year -- an important measure of retail health -- fell slightly. Wal-Mart attributed the decline to price deflation in groceries and, especially, in electronics. 
 ''Prices have declined dramatically,'' said Riddhi Patel, principal analyst with the market research firm iSuppli. She added that, industrywide, prices for LCD televisions fell 23 percent and prices for plasma TVs fell 18 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of this year. Electronics analysts said prices dropped as retailers vied to sell to tight-fisted consumers. 
 ''Wal-Mart and Best Buy are locked in this life-and-death struggle for market share,'' said Paul Gagnon, director of North American TV research for DisplaySearch, a research firm. ''They've both been pretty aggressive in dropping prices.''
 And for good reason. Low prices are crucial to winning in this economy, analysts said. 
 ''When consumers go out in the market, what they have in mind is a price point -- 'O.K., I'm going to spend $800,' '' Ms. Patel said. 
 Wal-Mart's strategy these days is to pick up new consumers, and then hang onto them as the job market improves. The retailer said Thursday that it sold 25 percent more flat-panel televisions this year than last year. The average price for each unit fell by more than 20 percent. 
 Eduardo Castro-Wright, who oversees Wal-Mart's United States operations, said in a recorded call that sales of televisions were also hurt because ''there has been little new technology and fewer movie releases this year compared to the last.'' 
 And Mr. Gagnon said that television prices typically went through cycles where prices dropped significantly until a new technology emerged. Retailers began experiencing that last year, he said. 
 Bill Dreher, a senior research analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities, said Wal-Mart was being strategic about where to sacrifice profit margins. ''They're focusing on gaining market share and gaining categories -- food, toys and consumer electronics,'' he said. ''They're being very aggressive in reminding the customer that they have low prices in these key categories that are important to the customer.'' 
 For the three months ended Oct. 31, Wal-Mart had profits of $3.24 billion, or 84 cents a share, up from $3.14 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $99.4 billion from $98.3 billion. 
 Sales at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year in the United States, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, fell 0.4 percent, not including the impact of fuel sales. 
 Given consumers' mood and the fact that Wal-Mart posted strong sales last Christmas, the retailer said it expected same-store sales in its next three-month reporting period to be about the same as last year. 
 ''The sales environment continued to be difficult this quarter,'' Mike Duke, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday, ''but customer traffic is up throughout the company.'' 
 Wal-Mart's strongest categories were grocery and health and wellness, both of which had year-over-year sales increases. ''Our customer is really taking advantage of Wal-Mart's low price on prescriptions and over-the-counter products,'' Mr. Castro-Wright said during the call. 
 Wal-Mart raised its profit projection for the year, to $3.57 to $3.61 a share, up from $3.50 to $3.60 a share.

Newfangled 
 Bank Capital 
 Contingent capital securities -- known as CoCo bonds -- have made their debut. The early reviews seem promising. 
 The securities, a newfangled form of convertible bonds, were sold by the beleaguered Lloyds Banking Group of Britain. Lloyds increased the size of its sale by a quarter, to $:7 billion ($11.6 billion). 
 The warm reception may encourage other banks to sell CoCos, a development that would probably please regulators, since CoCos could cushion banks in the event of another financial crisis. 
 The main feature of these instruments is that they turn into equity if a bank's capital ratio falls below a predetermined level. Federal Reserve officials, among others, have blessed the idea of contingent capital. 
 But CoCos come at a price for banks. The Lloyds CoCos look like they will yield around 11 percent a year, given the price at which the hybrid securities they will replace are now trading. That's four percentage points more than the bank's most comparable traditional bonds. The only difference between the two is that the CoCos would automatically turn into equity if Lloyds' core Tier 1 ratio of capital to assets were to fall below 5 percent. 
 The extra yield is the compensation investors are demanding for this risk. Royal Bank of Scotland is separately paying the British government 4 percent a year in return for being able to tap it for equity if its capital ratio falls below 5 percent. So that seems to be the going rate. 
 Is 4 percent the right premium? The answer depends on the likelihood the CoCos could be forcibly turned into equity. Suppose there were a 10 percent chance of that outcome. In that event, the equity would be worth very little -- say half its current value. The conclusion would then be that 90 percent of the time, CoCos would be just like the nearest equivalent bond and the rest of the time they would be worth half their par value. On that basis, the 11 percent yield could be generous and the new CoCos could appreciate in value. 
 A Valuation Question
 Attempts to streamline accounting standards for banks are running into problems in Europe and, possibly, the United States. Still, the goal is worth pursuing. The current rules confuse almost everybody. Investors should pressure policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic, otherwise thorny accounting is likely to be just as much a feature of the next crisis as it was of the last. 
 The International Accounting Standards Board, which sets standards for most of the world outside the United States, has led the charge for simpler rules. It wants just two ways of valuing financial assets, down from the current four. One is to value them at cost; the other is to mark them to market prices. In order to qualify for the former, the bank would have to jump two hurdles. First, the asset would have to be a loanlike instrument producing contractual cash flows. Second, the bank would have to be in the business of holding assets rather than trading them. 
 The I.A.S.B.'s approach strikes many people as sensible, but it faces problems on two fronts. One is from Brussels, the I.A.S.B.'s main sponsor. Some European Union members, including France, think the board is relying too much on mark-to-market accounting. The European Commission, which had previously urged the I.A.S.B. to fast-track its proposals, is now saying it is going to wait before deciding whether to adopt them. 
 Meanwhile, the I.A.S.B. has exactly the opposite problem in the United States. The Financial Accounting Standards Board argues all assets should be marked to market. F.A.S.B. hasn't formally started its consultation process, so there is a chance that it will change its mind. But if it doesn't, the result will be a mess. Few financial professionals understand one set of bank accounting standards. Fewer still can understand two. It would be a pity if the world's policy makers let investors down on this issue.

HEADLINE: Pfizer to Leave City That Won Land-Use Suit

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
From the edge of the Thames River in New London, Conn., Michael Cristofaro surveyed the empty acres where his parents' neighborhood had stood, before it became the crux of an epic battle over eminent domain.
 ''Look what they did,'' Mr. Cristofaro said on Thursday. ''They stole our home for economic development. It was all for Pfizer, and now they get up and walk away.''
 That sentiment has been echoing around New London since Monday, when Pfizer, the giant drug company, announced it would leave the city just eight years after its arrival led to a debate about urban redevelopment that rumbled through the United States Supreme Court, and reset the boundaries for governments to seize private land for commercial use. 
 Pfizer said it would pull 1,400 jobs out of New London within two years and move most of them a few miles away to a campus it owns in Groton, Conn., as a cost-cutting measure. It would leave behind the city's biggest office complex and an adjacent swath of barren land that was cleared of dozens of homes to make room for a hotel, stores and condominiums that were never built.
 The announcement stirred up resentment and bitterness among some local residents. They see Pfizer as a corporate carpetbagger that took public money, in the form of big tax breaks, and now wants to run.
 ''I'm not surprised that they're gone,'' said Susette Kelo, who moved to Groton from New London after the city took her home near Pfizer's property. ''They didn't get what they wanted: their development, their big plan.''
 Ms. Kelo lived in a small pink house in the Fort Trumbull section that was square in the sights of city and state officials who wanted to revitalize the area. The city had created the New London Development Corporation to buy up the nine-acre neighborhood and find a developer to replace it with an ''urban village'' that would draw shoppers and tourists to the area.
 Economic development officials in Connecticut used that plan -- and a package of financial incentives -- to lure Pfizer to build a headquarters for its research division on 26 acres nearby. With an agreement that it would pay just one-fifth of its property taxes for the first 10 years, Pfizer spent $294 million on a 750,000-square-foot complex that opened in 2001.
 By then, Ms. Kelo, the Cristofaros and several neighbors had sued the city to stop it from using its power of eminent domain to take their property. The lawsuit, Kelo v. New London, wound up at the Supreme Court in 2005 as one of the most scrutinized property-rights cases in years.
 In a 5-to-4 decision, the high court ruled that it was permissible to take private property and turn it over to developers as part of a plan to bolster the local economy. Conservative justices, including Clarence Thomas, dissented. Justice Thomas called New London's plan ''a costly urban-renewal project whose stated purpose is a vague promise of new jobs and increased tax revenue, but which is also suspiciously agreeable to the Pfizer Corporation.''
 The decision was widely criticized, and spurred lawmakers across the country to adopt statutes to prevent similar uses of eminent domain. Scott G. Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group in Arlington, Va., said that 43 states had moved to protect private-property rights since the Kelo decision. New York and New Jersey are among the seven that have not, he said.
 Mr. Bullock, who represented the landowners in New London, said Pfizer's announcement ''really shows the folly of these plans that use massive corporate welfare and abuse eminent domain for private development.''
 ''They oftentimes fail to live up to expectations,'' he added.
 For its part, Pfizer said it had no stake in the outcome of the Kelo case nor any interest in the development of the land that was acquired by eminent domain, according to a statement provided by a spokeswoman, Liz Power.
 After Pfizer completed its $67 billion acquisition of Wyeth, another drug giant, in October, Ms. Power said, ''We had a lot of real estate that we had to make strategic decisions about.'' She said Pfizer would try to sell or lease its buildings in New London and would ''continue to pay our taxes to the city as scheduled.''
 The complex is currently assessed at $220 million, said Robert M. Pero, a city councilman who is scheduled to become mayor next month. The company pays tax on 20 percent of that value and the state pays an additional 40 percent, Mr. Pero said. That arrangement is scheduled to end in 2011, around the time Pfizer, which is currently the city's biggest taxpayer, expects to complete its withdrawal.
 ''Basically, our economy lost a thousand jobs, but we still have a building,'' Mr. Pero said. Then again, he added, ''I don't know who's going to be looking for a building like that in this economy.''
 Some residents said they expected Pfizer to seek a revaluation of its buildings if they wind up vacant in two years; Ms. Power declined to comment. 
 Mr. Pero said that he was offended that Pfizer did not notify city officials about the decision before Monday or give them a chance to argue against it or even fully understand it. But he said he did not regret the decisions he and other elected officials had made to bring Pfizer to New London for what they had hoped would be a long and fruitful stay.
 ''I'm sure that there are people that are waiting out there to say, 'I told you so,' '' Mr. Pero said. ''I don't know that even today you can say, 'I told you so.' ''
 But Mr. Cristofaro and Ms. Kelo both said just that.
 Ms. Kelo, a nurse who works in New London and Norwich, Conn., said she was still bitter about the loss of her house, which she sold for $1 to Avner Gregory, a preservationist. Mr. Gregory dismantled the house and moved it across town. It now stands as a bright-pink symbol of the divisive dispute that drew so much attention to New London.
 ''In all honesty, I'm not happy about what happened to me,'' Ms. Kelo said. But, she added, ''With 43 states changing their laws, in that sense I feel we did some good for people across the country.''

HEADLINE: Drugs to Deter Some Cancers Are Not Taken

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Many Americans do not think twice about taking medicines to prevent heart disease and stroke. But cancer is different. Much of what Americans do in the name of warding off cancer has not been shown to matter, and some things are actually harmful. Yet the few medicines proved to deter cancer are widely ignored.
 Take prostate cancer, the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, surpassed only by easily treated skin cancers. More than 192,000 cases of it will be diagnosed this year, and more than 27,000 men will die from it. 
 And, it turns out, there is a way to prevent many cases of prostate cancer. A large and rigorous study found that a generic drug, finasteride, costing about $2 a day, could prevent as many as 50,000 cases each year. Another study found that finasteride's close cousin, dutasteride, about $3.50 a day, has the same effect. 
 Nevertheless, researchers say, the drugs that work are largely ignored. And supplements that have been shown to be not just ineffective but possibly harmful are taken by men hoping to protect themselves from prostate cancer. 
 As the nation's war on cancer continues, with little change in the overall cancer mortality rate, many experts on cancer and public health say more attention should be paid to prevention. 
 But prevention has proved more difficult than many imagined. It has been devilishly difficult to show conclusively that something simple like eating more fruits and vegetables or exercising regularly helps. And, as the response to the prostate drugs shows, people are not enthusiastic about taking anticancer pills, or are worried about side effects or not really convinced the drugs work. Others are just unaware of them. 
 And prostate cancer is not unique. Scientists have what they consider definitive evidence that two drugs can cut the risk of breast cancer in half. Women and doctors have pretty much ignored the findings.
 Companies have taken note, saying that it makes little economic sense to spend decades developing drugs to prevent cancer. The better business plan seems to be looking for drugs to treat cancer. That is a sobering lesson, said Dr. Ian M. Thompson Jr., chairman of the urology department at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. 
 ''A scientific discovery that is very clear cut and that is not implemented by the public is a tragedy,'' he said.
 Few Sure Things
 A few ways are known for sure to prevent cancer; the biggest is to avoid cigarette smoking. That alone would drop the cancer death rate by a third. No other measure comes close. 
 Another huge success, for breast cancer, is to avoid taking estrogen and progestin at menopause. Sales of those drugs plummeted in 2002 after a federal study, the Women's Health Initiative, concluded that they did not prevent heart disease and might increase breast cancer. The next year, the breast cancer rate dropped by 15 percent after having steadily increased since 1945. 
 The vaccine for human papilloma virus, protects against most strains of the virus, which causes cervical cancer. 
 But other measures that are often assumed -- and marketed -- as ways to prevent cancer may not make much difference, researchers say. 
 For example, public health experts for years recommended eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day to prevent cancer, but the evidence is conflicting, at best suggestive, and far from definitive. 
 Low-fat diets were long thought to prevent breast cancer. But a large federal study randomizing women to a low-fat or normal diet and looking for an effect in breast cancer found nothing, said its director, Ross L. Prentice of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
 Fiber, found in fruits, vegetables and grains, is often thought to prevent colon cancer, even though two large studies found no effect.
 ''We thought we would show relationships that were strong and true,'' said Dr. Tim Byers, professor of epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health, ''particularly for dietary choices and food and vegetable intake. Now we have settled into thinking they are important but it's not like saying you can cut your risk in half or three-quarters.'' Others wonder whether even such qualified support is misplaced.
 There has to be a reason the research disappointed, said Colin B. Begg, chairman of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Perhaps the crucial time to intervene is early in life. 
 ''That's one possibility,'' Dr. Begg said. ''The other is that it's all sort of nonsense to begin with.''
 Many hold out hope for exercise or weight loss. Studies have associated strenuous exercise with less cancer. But that is the same sort of evidence that misled scientists about aspects of diet.
 ''I think it's wishful thinking,'' said Dr. Susan Love, a breast surgeon and president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. ''We would like things to be more in our control. I think that's part of it. And in the absence of anything else, what do we tell women about how to prevent breast cancer? We tell them to exercise and eat a good diet.'' 
 As for obesity, researchers differ. Studies that observed large numbers of people often found that fatter people have more cancer. But many of the correlations are weak, and different studies have pointed to different cancers, raising questions about whether some of the effects are real. 
 Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said he was convinced. The strongest link, he and others say, is with obesity and breast cancer. But there, Dr. Brawley says, the crucial period may occur early in life -- girls who gain weight when they are young, he said, tend to start menstruating earlier, which increases their breast cancer risk because it adds years of exposure to the body's estrogen. It may be that weight loss in adulthood does not help.
 ''We have very little evidence that losing weight or changing diet reduces risk of cancer,'' he said. ''It is likely that it takes years to effect a change in risk. We do have data that the change in diet decreases cardiovascular disease risk, so it's easier to advocate diet change.'' 
 Others, like Donald A. Berry, head of the division of quantitative sciences at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, are dubious about blaming obesity for cancer rates. If there is a risk, Dr. Berry said, he suspects it is small. The studies are relying on correlations -- they cannot assess cause and effect. And studies that come up with such associations are likely to be published, even though often the associations turn out to be spurious. That means, Dr. Berry said, that ''the false-positive rate skyrockets.''
 Still, Dr. Prentice said, disheartening as the findings have been, it would be a mistake to give up on lifestyle changes. Instead, he said, perhaps it is time to rethink the way studies are done. 
 ''This should be a stimulus to our research community to say, How can we conduct observational studies in a way to reveal more reliable information?'' Dr. Prentice said.
 Diet and exercise, he added, ''are likely quite important, but we just aren't getting the answers.''
 Great Hopes Dashed
 Dr. Peter Greenwald knows the dashed hopes of cancer prevention research firsthand. As far back as 1981, when he arrived at the National Cancer Institute to direct ''cancer prevention and control,'' Dr. Greenwald began thinking about testing whether simple measures, like vitamin supplements, could prevent common cancers.
 He focused on what looked like it could be a sure thing -- beta carotene, found in orange fruits and vegetables as well as in green leafy vegetables. 
 The body converts beta carotene to vitamin A, which can prevent cancer in rats. People eating the most fruits and vegetables had less cancer. And the more beta carotene in a person's blood, the lower the cancer risk. Lung cancer seemed particularly vulnerable to beta carotene's effects, particularly in smokers and former smokers. 
 What was needed was cause-and-effect evidence, studies showing that if people bolstered their beta carotene and vitamin A levels, they would be protected from cancer. The cancer institute decided to take it on with two large studies.
 But not only did the supplements not work, but there was evidence that beta carotene might actually increase cancer risk in smokers.
 Dr. Greenwald and his colleagues still held out hope for vitamins and minerals as cancer preventatives. So his group proposed the largest cancer prevention clinical trial ever tried, involving 35,000 men 50 and older. This time, the idea was that vitamin E and selenium might prevent prostate cancer.
 Once again, there was presumptive evidence. But this time it was harder to persuade scientists to go ahead. After the beta carotene and vitamin A studies, several other studies had also failed to find evidence that food components or special diets could prevent cancer.
 ''By this time, a lot of people were very concerned,'' said Dr. Scott M. Lippman, an oncologist at M. D. Anderson. He argued that the huge study had to be done. The supplements were being promoted for ''prostate health,'' and the evidence that they might actually work was tantalizing.
 The selenium and vitamin E study ended early. Once again, there was no protection from cancer, and there were hints the supplements might be causing cancer. Once again, the great hope turned into a stunning disappointment. 
 Prevention researchers say they are left sadder but wiser. 
 ''Over the years, I've grown more skeptical and more cautious,'' said Dr. Meir J. Stampfer, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''Findings get reported in the literature, and the more extreme findings tend to excite the imagination. Then, as evidence accumulates, those findings are not confirmed.'' 
 Dr. Stampfer remains optimistic, though, pointing to the story of heart disease, where softer evidence eventually led to discoveries that measures like lowering blood pressure and cholesterol could prevent disease. An amazing decline in illness and death resulted. ''Cancer is harder,'' Dr. Stampfer said, but he added that it is too soon to give up. Dr. Greenwald, too, has not given up. He still hopes a diet with fruits and vegetables, along with exercise and weight control, might help prevent cancer. But he knows the evidence is not definitive and scientists have been fooled before. As for Dr. Lippman, he said the field had suffered from an excess of premature enthusiasm, especially before the beta carotene studies.
 ''We were pulled into this,'' he said. ''People said, We've got it! There were incredibly high expectations that were, in retrospect, unrealistic.''
 Claims That Go Too Far
 David G. Schardt, a senior nutritionist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, likes to relax in front of his television set at night. But what he was seeing last winter made his blood boil. 
 ''I would sit there watching network news and the ads would come on,'' Mr. Schardt said. Bayer, advertising its One A Day vitamins, was saying the selenium in the pills might improve ''prostate health.'' And as he drove to his office in Washington, Mr. Schardt heard Bayer advertisements on the radio that actually mentioned prostate cancer.
 ''I couldn't believe it,'' he said. After all, the federal study had already shown that selenium was useless and might be harmful. Finally, on Oct. 1, Mr. Schardt and the Center for Science in the Public Interest filed a lawsuit.
 Tricia McKernan, a Bayer spokeswoman, says the advertisements relied on the Food and Drug Administration's ''permitted qualified health claim that 'selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers,' '' especially prostate cancer. The F.D.A. no longer permits that claim, Ms. McKernan noted. She said Bayer was revising its packaging and promotional materials for its One A Day Men's and One A Day Men's 50+ vitamins, removing references to selenium reducing prostate cancer risk.
 But a subtle promotion of selenium and vitamin E by supplement makers goes on, with claims that the pills improve ''prostate health'' by increasing the body's ''antioxidant defenses.''
 Dr. Thompson said he sees the lure of supplements when he counsels patients. ''I can't tell you how many times I talked to somebody about prostate cancer prevention,'' he said. He gives the high-risk men a prescription for one of the drugs that work. But the men do not fill it.
 Instead, he said, they are taking ''prostate health'' vitamins.
 In 1990, Dr. Victor G. Vogel was at M. D. Anderson and had high hopes of changing the world. It just may be possible, he thought, to prevent many cases of breast cancer in women at high risk, a group that includes every woman over age 60, the time when the risk takes a sharp turn upward.
 Dr. Vogel was to be an investigator in a huge study of 13,000 women that seemed to have everything going for it. It would test a drug, tamoxifen, an estrogen-blocker widely used to treat women with breast cancer. The studies showing the drug's effects in breast cancer patients, though, had an unexpected bonus. It looked as if tamoxifen was also preventing new cancers in the opposite breast. 
 ''By the time we got to 1990, there was just a huge amount of data,'' Dr. Vogel said. The drug's risks were well established and seemed well worth taking if the benefit was cutting cancer in half among women at high risk. Most side effects, like hot flashes, were temporary. But there also was a risk of blood clots similar to that conferred by birth control pills or estrogen used to relieve symptoms of menopause. And there were about two additional cases of uterine cancer per 1,000 women per year.
 By 1998, the results were in.Tamoxifen cut the breast cancer rate in half. Similar studies in Britain and Italy, also involving high-risk women who had not had breast cancer, came to similar conclusions. And women did not have to take the drug for a lifetime -- they needed just five years of therapy.
 Dr. Vogel was ecstatic. 
 ''If I had told you in 1990 that in 10 years I would have a pill that would cut the risk of breast cancer in half, you wouldn't have believed me,'' he said. 
 But, he said, to his shock, ''The world said, So what?'' 
 ''We were met with shoulder shrugs and harrumphs,'' Dr. Vogel said. Sales of tamoxifen, worldwide, ''didn't budge.'' 
 Maybe, Dr. Vogel thought, the problem was that internists and gynecologists were not comfortable prescribing a drug used to treat cancer patients. Then, in 1999, he had a chance to do another breast cancer prevention trial, this time of an osteoporosis drug, raloxifene, or Evista, which did not have the cancer drug taint. It was to be compared with tamoxifen. 
 The $110 million study, involving 19,000 women, ended in 2006. The two drugs were found to be equally effective in preventing breast cancer, but with raloxifene there was no excess uterine cancer and the clotting risk was 30 percent less. 
 ''It was a spectacular clinical trial,'' Dr. Vogel said. But, he added, ''Once again, the world met the result with a shrug and a harrumph.''
 ''Those were your tax dollars and mine,'' he added. ''You can't do too many $110 million studies.''
 He cannot understand why no one cares, but some doctors say they see a number of problems. It is usually not the cost; tamoxifen is about 30 cents a day and raloxifene $3.30 a day. It is doctors' practices and women's concerns.
 Most doctors, said Dr. Therese B. Bevers, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center at M. D. Anderson, do not take the first step -- calculating a woman's lifetime risk of getting breast cancer -- in part because that can lead to the next step, spending an hour or so discussing cancer risk and drug risks and benefits. 
 Dr. Bevers suggests the drugs for women whose lifetime odds exceeds 20 percent. That could include, for example, a 55-year-old woman who began menstruating early (increasing the risk), had her first child late (again increasing the risk), and whose mother and sister got breast cancer. About half the time, though, women with that kind of risk turn down the drugs, Dr. Bevers said. ''The No. 1 reason I hear is, 'Oh, I just don't like to take medications,' '' she added.
 Others, like Cecilia Anderson, who is 57 and lives in Houston, worry about side effects. ''I felt like my quality of life was in question,'' she said. ''I am busy, I am out there. I totally love my life and don't want it to be compromised.'' Her lifetime risk of breast cancer is 20.5 percent, compared with an average risk of 9.8 percent for a woman her age. Ms. Anderson declined the drugs. ''I live a different lifestyle,'' she said. ''I eat organic foods, I exercise. Through all of that comes a spiritual element as well. Mind, body, and spirit are all connected.''
 Studies' Complications
 Then came the studies of finasteride and dutasteride for prostate cancer. The drugs block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a hormone that prostate cancers need to grow. They are on the market to shrink the prostate in older men, whose prostates often enlarge. (Finasteride is also sold to grow hair -- but the dose is one-fifth the dose that shrinks prostates and that dose has not been tested for cancer prevention.) Doctors can prescribe the drugs for cancer prevention but, at this point, that is not on their label.
 The prostate cancer studies were complicated by other another factor; at first, researchers thought, erroneously, that finasteride was actually spurring the growth of aggressive prostate cancers. The drug's side effects can include impotence or decreased ejaculate. But the Food and Drug Administration concluded that these effects, if they occur at all, are gone after a year.
 Now, even though the F.D.A. deemed the drug's adverse reactions to be ''usually mild and transient.'' The American Urological Association and the American Society for Clinical Oncology recommend that men 50 and older consider taking it. But there appears to be little interest even among high-risk men. 
 Dr. Vogel wonders what message the indifference to the breast cancer and prostate cancer drugs is sending. Why would a company want to develop drugs for cancer prevention?
 That is a lesson that hits home, said Dr. Gregory Curt, an oncologist who directs emerging products at AstraZeneca, a drug company.
 He hopes companies will take more interest when researchers find biomarkers -- cancer risk indicators that are the equivalent of blood pressure or cholesterol. That way people taking the drugs can see that they are reducing their risk. And studies can be smaller and quicker because companies can follow these markers rather than waiting for people to develop cancer.
 But risk assessment is not easy, and biomarkers are still more of a dream than a reality. There are other problems, too. If each cancer requires a different drug for prevention, how many drugs can a person take? For now, Dr. Curt said, the very idea of cancer prevention is daunting. And since cancer can take decades to develop, by the time a study concludes, a drug's patent life may be over.
 It is not a pretty picture, Dr. Vogel said. 
 ''You have to think that in boardrooms they are saying, Man, did we learn a lesson,'' he said. ''We will stay as far away as possible from cancer prevention.''

HEADLINE: Food Network Dreams, and Struggles With the Back Rent

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
More than anything, Atavia Wilson wants to be Anthony Bourdain, the roving celebrity chef.
 ''That would be my dream, just to travel and go to different restaurants,'' said Ms. Wilson, 26, of the Bronx. ''Food is the only thing I never get tired of learning about.''
 Her dream will have to be deferred. Having supported herself since she left high school and took a job as a home health care aide -- dropping out, she says, ''is one of my biggest regrets''-- she ekes out a living, earning $8 an hour caring for the homebound and the elderly. Her workweek, once 36 hours, has been reduced to 24 as she completes a free course of study to become a certified nursing assistant. What was once a meager monthly salary of $1,152 is now a barely manageable $752. 
 Rent for her studio apartment in Soundview, pegged to her income, is $589. A miscarriage, followed by a recent bout with anemia, put her in the hospital and kept her away from her patients, and she owes $2,290 in back rent. 
 She has applied for temporary cash assistance from the city's Department of Social Services, which offers a ''one-shot deal'' that would pay the rent, a last resort that applicants can use only once a year. 
 Ms. Wilson, the youngest of five, does not want to ask for help from her mother, who lives in New Jersey and works for the New York City Department of Juvenile Justice, or her father, a Hunts Point resident who subsists on disability, or her siblings. 
 ''Everyone has their own issues,'' she said. ''I don't want to burden people with mine.''
 What does puzzle Ms. Wilson is that she seems to exist in a sort of social services limbo: When she worked 36 hours a week, she did not qualify for Medicaid and she received only $24 a week in food stamps.
 Now that she is working fewer hours, she gets $100 in food stamps and $75 a week in unemployment benefits, but when she returns to a full-time schedule, even though her income will rise just $96 a week (before taxes), she will lose Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment benefits. 
 To get help, ''you need to be real, real poor or real, real rich,'' she said. ''There is no in between. If you're single with no kids, not on drugs, not getting abused by your boyfriend, nobody wants to help you.''
 In January, when she owed $1,777 in rent, an uncle referred her to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Now, however, the one-shot deal is her only hope. Having no money has meant she cannot afford to go out with friends; nor can she spare $40 a month for Internet service. 
 ''I'm willing to work hard, but it's like I can't catch a break,'' she said.
 Then there is the matter of her dream. She has looked into the culinary program at Monroe College, but her student loans would total $70,000, a prospect she rejects. ''I don't want to be paying student loans for the rest of my life,'' she said. ''My mother is still paying hers. She's 55 and paying loans from 25 years ago.'' 
 For now, she is content to indulge her Food Network dreams in her own tiny kitchen. Her favorite dish? ''I make a pretty mean lasagna, not to toot my own horn,'' she said. 
 ''Even though this is not the field I want to be in,'' she added, referring to health care, ''wherever the money's at, this is the direction I want to go. I figure I have time to work on my dream.''

She will no longer be eligible for Medicaid and unemployment benefits once her work hours increase, but she will in fact still qualify for food stamps.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Miami or Los Cabos? Time Shares Move to the City

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
THERE is a new building on West 57th Street in Manhattan, a block from Bulgari and Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, and about the same distance to Central Park and Carnegie Hall. Walking by, it looks like many of the luxury apartment projects that have recently sprouted in the city, with glass windows reaching up 28 stories, a fitness center visible from the street and well-dressed doormen in the lobby. 
 Except the building offers neither condominiums nor rental apartments -- just time shares.
 The project, West 57th Street by Hilton Club, which opened in July, is not the first time-share building to stake out ground in New York City. The Manhattan Club, a few blocks away on West 56th Street, has been welcoming guests since 1996. But the Hilton property is the first building in Manhattan built as a time share, designed to appeal to a new generation of buyers, with amenities like iPod docking stations, Japanese soaking tubs and hardwood floors. 
 It also represents a bet that urban time shares can expand the vacation ownership concept beyond beach destinations like Florida and Hawaii, appealing to regional residents who regularly come to the city to shop, eat out and see a Broadway show. 
 ''There's a market for urban time shares, because people like to go to gateway cities,'' said Kim Kreiger, a senior vice president with Hilton Grand Vacations Company, a division of Hilton Hotels that operates time-share properties around the world.
 Hilton tested the Manhattan market in 2002 by converting two floors of its hotel on the Avenue of the Americas into 78 time-share units, called the Hilton Club. Those units sold out ahead of schedule, Mr. Kreiger said, so the company began looking for a site to build a dedicated time-share property. 
 The West 57th Street project has 161 units, which are sold by the week, ranging from a $33,900 studio to a $125,000 penthouse. Annual maintenance fees, based on the size of the unit, are $900 to $1,200. By comparison, the Manhattan Club has 286 units, priced between $29,500 and $50,000. 
 The Manhattan Club feels a bit more like a traditional hotel -- which it once was -- with a concierge desk in the lobby and a rack of brochures promoting musicals and tours. But the arrival of another time share in the neighborhood may actually help validate the urban concept, said Michael Heller, the Manhattan Club's vice president for sales and marketing.
 ''Everybody said urban time shares don't work,'' Mr. Heller said. ''Well, it certainly did, and that's why you see competition coming on.''
 While it may seem like an inopportune time to be selling real estate in Manhattan, sales at Hilton's West 57th Street property, once the site of a Horn & Hardart Automat, began in 2007, and about half of the available weeks are already sold, Mr. Kreiger said. But he said the recession had resulted in more modest price increases this year than originally planned, as well as fewer foreign buyers than expected and slower sales at the lower prices.
 Harvey and Myrna Lederman are among West 57th Street's initial owners; they bought four weeks at the property after trying out Hilton's first Manhattan time share in 2002.
 ''We love the city, and we like to be here as much as we can,'' said Dr. Lederman, a podiatrist from Bloomfield, Conn. He and his wife spend a week in the city in June, another week in December, and celebrate their anniversary, Valentine's Day and other special occasions in the city, so owning a time share has given them something of a part-time pied-a-terre. 
 ''We live in a beautiful part of Connecticut,'' he said. ''Our roots are there. And yet we can come down here often, so we have the best of both worlds.'' 
 Like the Ledermans most buyers live within 200 miles of the city, and owners can break up their week into stays of as little as just one night. Each week is measured in points, which can be traded for stays at other Hilton Grand Vacations properties in places like Las Vegas; Los Cabos, Mexico; or Miami Beach.
 Those types of sun-and-sea destinations still account for the vast majority of time-share properties. Urban locations represent just 7 percent of the market, according to a 2008 industry study by Ernst & Young. But with more time-share operators adopting a point system with the flexibility to visit different destinations, and travel patterns shifting toward shorter trips, urban time shares are becoming a more viable option for developers.
 ''There are a lot more people traveling to metropolitan areas that are closer to where they live,'' said Adam Schwartz, a senior vice president with Wyndham Vacation Ownership, which has 20 urban properties out of about 150 time-share locations.
 Most recently the company converted two San Francisco hotels into a 115-unit time-share property that opened in June near Union Square; it is Wyndham's second location in San Francisco. Other urban destinations include Alexandria, Va.; Atlantic City; Las Vegas; New Orleans; San Antonio; San Diego; and Seattle, as well as a property at National Harbor near Washington, due to open in February.
 Another landmark urban time share is the Custom House in Boston by Marriott Vacation Club, a historic building where ship captains used to pay their taxes; Marriott turned it into an 84-unit time share in 1997. Current prices for the one-bedroom suites range from $24,000 to $28,000, with maintenance fees around $800 year. 
 Although Marriott has considered developing a time share in New York City, the real estate boom made finding a good location a challenge, said Ed Kinney, a vice president with Marriott Vacation Club International, though an opportunity might present itself down the road.
 ''The real estate environment is changing dramatically,'' Mr. Kinney said, ''and people are looking to repurpose buildings. It may be more cost effective once again, after the economy sorts itself out.''
 Not surprisingly, one of the hurdles for urban time shares has been the high price of property in the metropolitan markets that draw visitors year round. 
 ''It's a concept that works in a limited number of destinations,'' said Scott Berman, a hospitality analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers, and himself a time-share owner in Colorado. Mr. Berman cited New York, Boston, San Francisco and potentially London, Paris and Rome as among the most viable locations for urban time shares.
 But it may turn out that some cities actually prove to be too popular, at least for people trying to exchange points. (Owners at a particular location typically get first dibs for reservations.) Peggy Rusnak, a time-share owner since 1987, said she had not yet been able to use her Wyndham points to book stays in San Francisco and New Orleans, partly because her job made it hard to plan ahead.
 ''I've tried to get into them, but I always wait until the last minute,'' Ms. Rusnak said. Although the time shares she owns are in the Florida cities of Daytona Beach, Panama City and Orlando, she has never been to the one in Panama City, mostly choosing to stay at a Wyndham property on Edisto Island, S.C., in recent years.
 But over all, Ms. Rusnak said, she has been very happy with her time-share experience, citing the friendliness of the staff and the versatility of the point system, although the main benefit has been the incentive to actually take time off.
 ''It made us go on vacation at least twice a year,'' she said. ''We saw places we probably never would have gone.''

REGINA JOSe GALINDO 
 Exit Art 
 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan 
 Through Nov. 21 
 Regina Jose Galindo's show at Exit Art doubles as an overdue New York solo debut for Ms. Galindo, a Guatemalan performer and poet born in 1974, and a 10-year career retrospective. It is also easily one of the most ambitious and moving shows by any young artist in the city at present. 
 Physical violation and psychological duress, applied on her own person, are the basic themes of Ms. Galindo's endurance-test performances, with poetry never far away. Poetry is uppermost in her earliest videotaped piece, from 1999, when she suspended herself, dressed like an annunciate angel, high over a street in Guatemala City reading her verses aloud and dropping handwritten copies to a crowd gathered below. 
 Thereafter the performance took a darker, more carnal direction. In a 2002 work, still in an absurdist vein, Ms. Galindo endured a pummeling from a female wrestler. Two years later, in one of her most unnerving pieces, she submitted to -- and filmed -- reconstructive surgery to her hymen, a procedure undertaken or forced on women in the sex trade, for whom virginity, or the illusion of it, is an economic asset. 
 In recent years, episodes of debasement, self-imposed or otherwise arranged, though with unpredictable results, increased. Ms. Galindo sealed herself in an isolation chamber, had herself immobilized for days in a full-body cast and a straitjacket. In the video ''Social Cleaning,'' she is brought to her knees by water sprayed from a high-pressure hose, of the kind used by riot-control police officers. In 2007, the year of the revelations of abuses at Abu Ghraib, she had herself subjected to a version of waterboarding, then shot with a Taser until she collapsed, unconscious. 
 There are many precedents for this grueling, body-centered art. Marina Abramovic, Valie Export, Ana Mendieta, Gina Pane and Yoko Ono come to mind, as, of course, does Chris Burden. But Ms. Galindo's version has its own fiercely focused recklessness, as well as a distinctive set of political and personal themes that come across most stirringly in some of her physically less extreme pieces. 
 In 2003, in response to the prospective election of a former leader of a military junta, Ms. Galindo walked through the main square of Guatemala City carrying a basin of human blood into which she periodically dipped her bare feet, creating a track of red prints leading to the National Palace. In a more passive performance in 2007, she lay motionless and barely breathing on a table while a funeral parlor cosmetician applied heavy makeup to her face as if beautifying her for burial. 
 As in most of her art, the references were twofold: to the frequent and premature deaths, through crime, poverty and disease, of women in her volatile homeland; and to mortality as a fact of human life. The performances do not succeed equally in joining topicality to existential metaphor; the sight of the artist moping around in chains has, possibly intentionally, a comedic edge. But in many pieces the fusion works, and the cumulative effect of the show -- organized by Exit Art's founders, Jeanette Ingberman and Papo Colo, with an insightful brochure essay by Nick Stillman -- is potent.

Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off-key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20091112 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20091112
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20091112
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'WHO SHOT ROCK & ROLL: A PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY, 1955 TO THE PRESENT,' through Jan. 31. This entertaining exhibition presents more than 175 images of rock stars by 105 photographers. It includes album cover art, candid snapshots, publicity portraits and pictures of live performances. The downside is that only a few photographs rise to the level of fine art, and the general focus is on only the most famous and familiar musicians, from Elvis Presley to Kurt Cobain. There are some nice surprises, though, like a small Polaroid of Courtney Love on which she wrote a rude salutation. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'WATTEAU TO DEGAS: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE FRITS LUGT COLLECTION,' through Jan. 10. Ranging from Watteau and Fragonard to Ingres and Degas, 64 works from a celebrated Parisian repository offer a gratifying immersion in 18th- and 19th-century French draftsmanship. For urbanity, vivacity and technical merit, these artists remain in a league of their own. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20091112
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'KANDINSKY,' through Jan. 13. The Guggenheim is not exactly thinking outside the spiral with this sleek retrospective, but then the pioneering abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) is more than just its foundational artist. He is the angel in the architecture. His swirling, unanchored abstractions are implicit in Frank Lloyd Wright's great circling rotunda, and now they fill it, bottom to top -- a sensational sight that is as much Kandinsky-Wright reunion as retrospective. One of the fullest, clearest views of Kandinsky's achievement in decades, it certainly unmoors the conventional wisdom of precipitous decline after 1921, if not 1914. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20091112
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20091112
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'SERIZAWA: MASTER OF JAPANESE TEXTILE DESIGN,' through Jan. 17. Serizawa Keisuke (1895-1984), one of the most prominent Japanese artisans of the 20th century, transformed paper and fabric with intricate, hand-cut stencils. His art updated, and some might say elevated, centuries-old crafts with allusions to Korean folk art, Chinese calligraphy, Aesop's Fables, Indian miniatures and Western midcentury Modernism. This handsomely installed show includes an early artist's-book adaptation of ''Don Quixote,'' as well as curtains, screens and kimonos from Serizawa's mature and productive postwar years. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICAN STORIES: PAINTINGS OF EVERYDAY LIFE, 1765-1915,' through Jan. 24. This exhibition of 103 figurative paintings and portraits that the museum justifiably calls ''iconic'' spans the Colonial period to World War I, touching on issues like the settling of the West and the Civil War and its legacy. Many of the works are masterpieces by artists like John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt and George Bellows that will in all likelihood not be gathered together anytime soon. Others are little-known gems of genre painting; many more are less gemlike genre works full of plots, props and stilted emotions. The result is refreshingly evenhanded. Art historical viewpoints previously too often considered mutually exclusive -- pro-narrative versus pro-form -- are synthesized. The paintings benefit tremendously from the mix, as will your understanding of American art and history. A thrilling, illuminating show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE SAMURAI: JAPANESE ARMS AND ARMOR, 1156-1868,' through Jan. 10. This sumptuous exhibition alternates between extraordinarily gorgeous, intricately wrought suits of armor that count as some of the world's greatest works of multimedia art and an unprecedented gathering of some 60 bare sword blades whose Minimalist subtleties of line, proportion and surface form a show within a show. In between are amazing helmets; ornate sword mountings and fittings; scroll paintings of samurai dressed to kill; and the colorful surcoats they traditionally wore over their armor. Nearly all of the 200-plus works come from Japan's museums; about half have been designated National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties by the Japanese government. Because of their extreme fragility, not all objects will be on view at once: about 60 pieces will be replaced by similar objects of equal caliber during the first week in December. Visit early and often. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LOOKING IN: ROBERT FRANK'S ''THE AMERICANS,''' through Jan. 3. In the mid-1950s the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank made three long car trips from New York City across the United States, through the Deep South to California, and back again by a northern route, taking thousands of pictures as he went. He needed a year to develop, print and edit them down to the 83 that made up his classic book, ''The Americans,'' which was panned for its pessimism in his day, and sanctified for its political prescience since. The Met show, and the huge book that accompany it, are basically monuments to that monument. If ''The Americans'' looks more formulaic in its sentiments than it did 50 years, that is because it has had so many imitators and the country it captured has changed. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID,'' ' through Nov. 29. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WATTEAU, MUSIC, AND THEATER,' through Nov. 29. Informed by new research in music and theater, this show highlights the influence of the performing arts on paintings, drawings and prints by Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his contemporaries. It includes several elaborate fetes galantes and smaller works depicting actors and musicians, and cultivates an atmosphere of civilized hedonism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' ongoing. Attributed to Michelangelo Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a ten-year loan from the French Republic, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Nov. 29. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM: 'CEZANNE AND AMERICAN MODERNISM,' through Jan. 3. Including early works by Dove, Hartley, Gorky and more than 25 others, this fascinating show explores the art history-changing influence of Cezanne on American artists between 1907 and 1930. Nothing by the American artists looks as good as any of the 18 Cezannes on view, but the exhibition and its hefty, richly informative catalog are revelatory. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J. , (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO AND REVOLUTION: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 3. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. The nearly 80 works selected from the Morgan's own collection include excellent pieces by most of the era's best known artists, from the Rococoists Watteau and Fragonard to Neo-Classicists like Jacques-Louis David and Etienne Louis Boullee. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20091112
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'WILLIAM BLAKE'S WORLD: ''A NEW HEAVEN IS BEGUN,'' ' through Jan. 3. Artist, poet and irritated ecstatic, William Blake listed as his primary residence the Imagination, a combination of creative command post and psychological refuge where, as he put it, the eternal and the real meet. You'll see a good amount of both in this show, drawn from the Morgan's deep holdings of Blake's hand-printed-and-painted books and from the entire series of 21 watercolor illustrations he made for ''The Book of Job.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)20091112
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived here in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, who served as a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. ( Smith)20091112
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091112
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION,' through Feb. 15. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point, for many viewers, will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20091112
 NEW MUSEUM: 'URS FISCHER: MARGUERITE DE PONTY,' through Feb. 7. Naming his first American museum show after a fictional character from Mallarme, the young Swiss sculptor Urs Fischer spreads himself thin, but brilliantly. Admirers of his gaping holes in walls may be disappointed by the sparseness, quiet and subtlety, but for the most part -- despite too much Surrealism 101 -- Mr. Fischer's neo-Dada formalism wins out. Nose-thumbing irreverence colludes with Minimalist space, scale and perception. Take this three-floor show from the top and watch worlds collide: abstraction, found objects and trompe l'oeil; the actual-size, the large and the enlarged; images, reflections and volumes. Each floor is a kind of implosion, although it only becomes obvious on the lowest. The perpetual twilight in the middle may be the most memorable moment. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20091112
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24, 2010. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20091112
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20091112
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: ABSTRACTION,' through Jan. 17. The focus of this surprisingly surprising show is the first two decades of O'Keeffe's long career, beginning in 1915 when she made her first abstract drawings, which were also among the first fully abstract images by any American artist, and continuing into the 1930s, when she was spending increasing amounts of time alone in New Mexico. In between comes a body of bold, graphically punchy and sensuous painting that you tend to experience whole and fast, as you do a strong scent or a touch. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20091112
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'RONI HORN AKA RONI HORN,' through Jan. 24. Two floors is one floor too many for this late-phase Post-Minimalist. She is best represented here by some exquisite cast glass sculptures, photographs of Iceland's extraordinary topography and several large drawings that combine aspects of carving, cartography and quilting. The catalog is even more elaborately stage-managed; the main take-away from the combination is that Ms. Horn's ostensibly androgynous (but actually butch) persona is her most engaging creation and that self-portraiture and language are her truest modes of expression. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20091112
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'MRS. DELANY AND HER CIRCLE,' through Jan. 3. This fascinating show celebrates the contributions of the exemplary 18th-century Englishwoman Mary Delany to botany, the decorative arts and English court society. A widow twice over with no children, Mrs. Delany thrived in middle and old age as a naturalist, amateur artist and close friend to Handel, Jonathan Swift and the Duchess of Portland, among others. The exhibition includes her drawings, silhouettes and floral embroidery, and a selection from the ''Flora Delanica'': a series of some 1,000 botanical collages, begun when she was 72. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Conn. , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Rosenberg)20091112
 Galleries: Other
 BARRY X. BALL: 'MASTERPIECES,' through Dec. 12. A striking departure from the surrealistic heads for which Mr. Ball is known, this show replicates three Italian Late Baroque busts in different kinds of exotic stone using a combination of high-tech machinery and manual labor. Two glowing pieces represent ''Purity'' by Antonio Corradini, an image of a woman whose head and face are covered by a sheer veil. The third, based on ''Envy'' by Orazio Marinali, is a snarling, snake-haired Medusa. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side , (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Johnson)20091112
 'ICONS OF THE DESERT: EARLY ABORIGINAL PAINTINGS FROM PAPUNYA,' through Dec. 5. With their bold, diagrammatic compositions; finely coordinated colors; and dotted textures, paintings by indigenous Australians appeal to Western eyes trained to respond to abstraction and folk and so-called outsider art. The paintings in this excellent show are mostly from the 1970s, the early years of the modern Aboriginal painting movement.

 MIKE KELLEY AND MICHAEL SMITH: 'A VOYAGE OF GROWTH AND DISCOVERY,' through Nov. 30. This entertaining and thought-provoking exhibition features a six-channel video following Michael Smith, dressed as Baby Ikki in droopy diapers, bonnet and dark glasses, as he wanders around Burning Man, the weeklong celebration of all things psychedelic in the Nevada desert. With jungle-gym-like structures in the gallery and a towering junk-metal sculpture of Baby Ikki looming over all, the whole project represents Burning Man as a festival of infantilism.

 MICHAEL WILLIAMS: 'UNCLE BIG,' through Nov. 22. On his second time out, this young painter's colorful, wood-grain-obsessed canvases raise the stakes. His informed if eccentric pictorial tactics hover in the vicinity of James Ensor and Roy DeForest (oh, look him up) and include bright-on-white wood-paneled spaces occupied and not; jigsaw puzzle extravaganzas figured or forested; and the occasional abstraction. The Revenge of the Regional Artists, Mr. DeForest included? Perhaps. Meanwhile, Mr. Williams is both true to himself and willing to mess around.

 Last Chance
 SARAH ANNE JOHNSON: 'HOUSE ON FIRE'; closes on Saturday. This Canadian artist is trying to process some remarkable family history with the works in this show. In bronze sculptures, drawings on old photographs and newspaper clippings and a meticulously constructed dollhouse with a nightmarish interior, she alludes to her grandmother's mentally debilitating stay at a McGill University-affiliated psychiatric institution in the 1950s, where she underwent horrendous experimental treatments.

HEADLINE: Obama Sets Jobs Forum

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
President Obama announced Thursday that he would convene a jobs conference at the White House next month, saying that ''the economic growth that we've seen has not yet led to the job growth that we desperately need.'' 
 ''Millions of Americans, our friends, our neighbors, our family members, are desperately searching for jobs,'' Mr. Obama said. ''This is one of the great challenges that remains in our economy, a challenge that my administration is absolutely determined to meet.''
 Mr. Obama made his remarks in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House shortly before leaving Washington for a weeklong trip to Asia. He spoke after the release of a Labor Department report on Thursday showing that fewer people submitted applications for unemployment benefits last week than in any other week since January.
 The jobs forum in December will include business leaders, small-business owners, labor union leaders and others. It marks a pivot for Democrats as they head into next year's midterm elections. While Mr. Obama is not on the ballot next year, his economic policies will be, as Democratic members of Congress and governors face an angry and worried electorate. 
 Republican Congressional leaders said Thursday that they hoped to be invited to participate, or have their ideas heard, at the jobs conference.
 ''The White House said they were 'shaking every tree' for solutions,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican. ''If the White House is sincere in that goal, I welcome their consideration of Republican ideas and solutions to get people working again.''
