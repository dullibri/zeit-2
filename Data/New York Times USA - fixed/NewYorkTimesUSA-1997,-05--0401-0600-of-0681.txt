HEADLINE: Solar Power In Big Leap In California

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
A California electric utility has signed a big contract to buy solar cells that the utility and the Department of Energy say will push the cells' cost down to a competitive level by 2002.
The utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, will buy 10 megawatts of solar cells by 2002, enough to supply hundreds of houses. The total is small by the standards of conventional power plants, but experts say it is the largest purchase ever by a utility of solar cells, which make electricity from sunlight. The type that the utility district will buy, thin-film silicon, is similar to what pocket calculators run on. 
 Outside experts say that it is difficult to predict future costs but that the contract is likely to help push prices down substantially.
The utility district expects to buy cells in 1998 at a cost equal to 16.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The price will fall to 8.2 cents by the final year of the contract, 2002. The driving force behind the price drop, officials said, will be economies of scale possible with a long-term contract.
The utility will put 300 square feet to 500 square feet of cells on the roofs of about 4,000 customers who volunteer, and these will produce about three kilowatts of power during the day, said Donald E. Osborn, who is in charge of solar power for the utility district. Over the year, he said, the cells will produce about the same amount of power as a house uses.
Solar cells produce energy only during daylight hours, a time frame that matches Sacramento's hours of greatest need, Mr. Osborn said. The system can tolerate 10 percent to 20 percent of its production coming from such intermittent power sources, he said.
About 700 customers already have such installations and pay $4 a month extra as "PV Pioneers." Since June 1989, when voters in the district decided to shut their nuclear plant, Rancho Seco, the utility district has tried to cut demand, paying customers to buy more efficient refrigerators and planting thousands of tress that shade houses and lower air-conditioning costs. It has also installed solar cells, some on the site of the nuclear plant.
The new solar cells will come from Energy Photovoltaics of Princeton, N.J., which will build a factory in Sacramento. The Energy Department has subsidized the research.
At the Energy Department, Joseph Romm, the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, called the contract signing "an exceptional moment for the solar energy program."
Solar experts said the size and duration of the contract made it exceptional. John P. Thornton, an expert in photovoltaic markets at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, an Energy Department laboratory in Golden, Colo., said, "It actually could have a significant influence on driving the price down."
Total worldwide production of solar cells is about 96 megawatts a year, about 45 megawatts of which is in the United States, Mr. Thornton said. Many of the cells are exported to developing countries, he said.
At the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group based in Washington, Scott Sklar, the executive director, said that the contract was unprecedented in size for a utility, but that several other companies were "not far behind."

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Tax-Cut Plan Faces G.O.P. Opposition in Albany

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan for $284 million in tax cuts, one of the pillars of his election-year budget, is drawing opposition from an unexpected quarter: his fellow Republicans in the State Senate, whose approval is required for nearly all of the proposals to become law.
Mr. Giuliani is seeking to do away with New York City's 4 percent sales tax on clothing under $500 and to trim taxes on small-business earnings, personal income, commercial rent and co-ops and condominiums. The Mayor is making the package a focus of his campaign for re-election, portraying himself as a leader who is overhauling what he says is a burdensome tax structure. 
 But the State Senate's Republican majority, which usually champions tax reduction, is instead resisting the Mayor's plan, largely because regional rivalries seem to be carrying more weight than political kinship with Mr. Giuliani.
Republicans from areas around New York City say they do not want the city to lower its sales tax on clothing if such a move would leave the tax higher in neighboring counties, potentially putting merchants there at a disadvantage. Some Republican Senators from outside the city contend that if Mr. Giuliani lowers taxes and loses revenue, he might then be forced in an economic downturn to ask for more state aid.
"While we applaud tax cuts, you have to be very, very careful in how you proceed," Joseph L. Bruno, an upstate Republican who is the Senate majority leader, said last week.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, acknowledged that the tax package, which was part of the budget that the Mayor presented earlier this month, was running into difficulties in the Senate. But Mr. Mastro said there was still time to persuade the Republican majority to approve it.
"No one ever said that this was going to be an easy task," he said.
The state wields vast control over the city's finances and tax system, so nearly all the tax reductions proposed by Mr. Giuliani require the approval of not only the City Council but also Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature.
For now at least, the State Senate has formally rebuffed the Mayor's plan to eliminate the 4 percent sales tax on articles of clothing under $500 in the city. It passed its own legislation that would gradually phase out the state's 4 percent sales tax on clothing under $500 while giving localities the option of doing the same with their companion levies.
In New York City, there is currently an 8.25 percent sales tax on clothing under $ 500: 4 percent goes to the state, 4 percent to the city and 0.25 percent to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
The bill approved by the Senate would reduce the state sales tax by one percentage point a year, eliminating it after four years. Localities could reduce their part of the sales tax at the same pace.
Governor Pataki, who has close ties to suburban Republicans, has said he favors the Senate bill, though it appears that he is not as opposed to the Mayor's proposal as some Republican Senators. The Democratic-controlled Assembly, which is dominated by New York City lawmakers, has backed the Republican Mayor.
Republicans from counties around the city, a powerful bloc in the Senate majority, said their legislation would be more equitable because it would provide all localities with the same opportunity to cut taxes.
"The phase-in that we propose is a better approach," said Senator Dean G. Skelos of Nassau County, the deputy majority leader. "When you do tax cuts and you do a budget, you have to look at how it impacts the entire state, county by county. You can't just deal with one area in a vacuum."
The Mayor's plan for the sales tax, Mr. Bruno said, "is potentially very, very troublesome, when you pit one county against another."
Mr. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor, noted that even though the Senate legislation fell short of what the Mayor wanted, the very fact that the Senate had approved any measure to reduce the clothing sales tax was a tribute to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to spotlight the issue.
"That's substantial progress," Mr. Mastro said.
The Senate majority could still reverse its stance and pass the Mayor's sales tax proposal before the legislative session ends this summer. The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, is a staunch backer of the proposal and is expected to try to pressure Mr. Bruno to accept it in the coming weeks.
But some Giuliani administration officials acknowledged privately that the Mayor would probably not prevail and would have to accept a compromise that would allow the city to reduce the tax gradually.
There is a silver lining to that defeat: the Mayor can still trumpet to voters that he pushed the proposal, and he can also spend the revenue that he had expected to lose from the cut, $157 million in the 1998 fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
The Democratic-led City Council supports much of the Mayor's tax cut package, including the reduction in the clothing tax, though there are some differences. The Mayor and the Council have varying ideas for scaling back the unincorporated business tax, which is a kind of income tax for small businesses.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, is also calling for a tax cut for emerging industries to spur job growth, a measure that the Mayor has not embraced.
The one tax reduction put forth by Mr. Giuliani that does not require approval by Albany is the cut in the commercial rent tax, which the city levies only in Manhattan south of 96th Street.
Underlying some of the opposition from Senate Republicans is the historic antipathy of suburban and rural legislators to New York City, which is scorned as profligate and continually holding out its hand to Albany.
For instance, Mr. Skelos, the deputy majority leader, questioned whether the city could afford the Mayor's tax cuts. He pointed out that though the city has a record budget surplus this year, it is facing future projected deficits.
If the tax cuts are approved and the city loses revenue, "are you then going to come to the state for more money?" Mr. Skelos asked.
Such sentiment helps explain why the final part of the Mayor's tax cut package is also contentious. Mr. Giuliani is calling for the Governor to revamp a proposal that would give property tax relief to localities.
In its current form, the city would get about 12 percent of the property tax relief, which localities would receive as increased state aid. Mr. Giuliani, joined by Mr. Vallone, wants close to 40 percent, about equal to the percentage of the state population that lives in the city.
The Mayor and the Speaker would then use that extra state aid to make up for lost revenue from new cuts in the personal income tax and the tax on co-ops and condominiums, as well as from a tax credit intended to help move people on welfare into jobs.
The problem, of course, is that to increase state aid for the city, the Governor would have to reduce it for other areas, a change that will not please the Senate majority.

HEADLINE: The Blind, Like Others, Fish by the Sense of Feel

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
A 100-foot aluminum party boat called the Sunshine left its dock in Sheepshead Bay under a leaden sky Saturday morning with 40 people on board. Thirteen of them were members of the Helen Keller Fishing Club, an organization that takes blind people deep-sea fishing.
"Really, this club's a godsend," said Marty Ross, who has been blind from birth. "I love fishing." 
 Eric Blair, a member for 20 of the club's 48 years, observed that the air was warming up. Indeed, the sun was beginning to peep through the clouds. "Nature has presented us with a beautiful day," he said. Nunzio Russo, 76, played an Italian folk tune on his harmonica.
Membership in the club -- an offshoot of the Helen Keller Services for the Blind based in Brooklyn -- stands at 23, including 5 women. Members come mostly from Brooklyn and Queens to take part in monthly fishing expeditions. The only requirement is being legally blind. Dues are $10 a month. Each member is also expected to sell 60 $1 tickets for a yearly raffle. Beer, soda and other accessories are often donated by businesses.
Walter S. Bach, a club member who used to work for the Helen Keller agency until cost-cutting eliminated his job, spoke with Joe Lomeo, who cannot see, hear or speak, by tapping out letters on his arm. "F-L-O-U-N-D-E-R," he saidwhen Mr. Lomeo asked the day's prey.
As the Sunshine churned to a choppy stop about half a mile off Coney Island, members of the fishing club began baiting their hooks.
"Oh, it's a nasty one!" said Helen Keenan as the squirming sandworm in her hand bit her.
"Put the hook in his mouth so he can't bite you," one of the 11 volunteers on board suggested.
"But I can't see the mouth," Ms. Keenan replied.
The club members fished with concentration. Many insisted that the sense of touch is what actually matters, even for those who can see.
"It's a matter of feel," said Mr. Ross, who has been a chef for 27 years. "The fish can't see you, and you can't see the fish. It's all in the fingers."
For some members, the club offers a return to a lost pastime. "A lot of things in the past I can't do," said Robert Tobin, who became legally blind six years ago. "Fishing is one I can."
For others, it offers a new skill to master. Jonathan Emerson, who asks friends to call him Mad Dog, was eager to tell of his other exploits: skiing through trees while accompanied by a sighted guide, running a marathon and helping teach paraplegics to sail at a school on City Island.
As waves gently rocked the boat, Mr. Lomeo almost sat in the box of worms. Somebody caught a clam. Alfred Carlton puffed a cigar. When Clifton Harrell shouted that he had landed a big one, others ran over to touch it. Mr. Bach told a story about the biggest fish ever caught by the club, a 90-pound tuna off Gerritsen Beach.
Almost all club members are unemployed or work at menial jobs for the minimum wage, but on board they could relax. It almost did not matter that the fish were not biting. By day's end, only a dismal 18 flounders -- none exactly whoppers -- were caught.
"Sometimes you can't catch anything," said Mr. Russo, who lives in a group home in Queens. "But to tell you the truth, I'll sleep good tonight. The air is good."
Michael Ryan, a Farmingdale, N.Y., volunteer who works as an emergency subway car repairman, took a vacation day to drive the club members to the boat and then help them fish. He recalled how pleased he was at last year's holiday banquet when Mr. Lomeo won the award for catching the most big fish. He said he kept lining up to shake his hand again and again, thinking there was a small chance that he would be recognized by the beaming champion.
People have fallen off the boat a time or two, Mr. Bach said, and not just club members. He fell once himself, he said, because nobody warned him about the gap between the dock and the boat.
"It's an awful feeling," he said.
Lynne Luxton, a rehabilitation counselor at the agency, said that seemingly unlikely recreational activities favored by the blind like fishing and bowling are useful because they provide a chance to socialize. "You belong to this group of fishermen," she said. "You can tell a story as big as the next guy."

HEADLINE: Corporate Web Police Hunt Down E-Pirates

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SHAPLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18

 BODY:
Joshua Bauchner, who spends most workdays stalking suspected copyright pirates on the Internet, is about to make a big haul. Typing in the word "warez," he waits for a search engine to spit out sites that include the term, which means pirated software in Internet parlance.
On the list was a site maintained by an Internet service provider in Finland. And on the site was a trove of programs likely to be illegal copies of American software pilfered for the sheer thrill of it. 
 As Mr. Bauchner scrolls down the list of software available free, it proves spectacular -- a treasure chest of pirated goods that he is eager to show to his colleagues at the Software Publishers Association.
The young men and women who gather to review his findings are a new on-line breed: the Internet police.
Or perhaps one should call them the Internet's Pinkerton detectives. Most often, they are private sleuths, hired by corporations to guard their wares -- from corporate logos to comic strips, from music to software -- from the pilfering that computer technology makes so easy.
The rise of these sleuths reflects the taming of cyberspace's affinity for anarchy.
In recent years, Hollywood, the music industry, software publishers and merchandisers have pushed to enforce copyright and trademark laws on the Internet.
The Business Software Alliance estimates that of the 523 million new business software applications used globally in 1996, 225 million, or nearly one in two are pirated -- a 20 percent increase over 1995.
On other fronts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department have built up teams of cybersleuths as well.
The response from the Internet's precincts is mixed and sometimes defiant. On one hand, many users publish their own work on the Internet in the hopes of lucrative reproduction fees. On the other, many habitues treat their sites like family bulletin boards, and object to being pursued for posting a Dilbert cartoon.
But there is also a booming subculture of pirates who collect the latest software programs -- not necessarily to use, but just for bragging rights.
The pursued have the advantage over their pursuers. The number of Internet users doubled in the last year to 45 million, according to the Gartner Group. "The biggest problem is that the number of illegal copies available to the average user is so numerous," Greg Wren, corporate counsel for Adobe Systems Inc. of San Jose, Calif., said.
The applicability of the laws the new detectives seek to enforce remains unclear. Several lower court rulings have held system operators to be like publishers and liable for illegal material posted on their networks. Last December, a Federal court in the Northern District of California held Maphia, a small Internet provider, liable for illegal copies of Sega Enterprises Ltd. games in its system, because Maphia operators knew of the activity.
But in a case that the Religious Technology Center, part of the Church of Scientology, brought against Netcom On-line Communications Services Inc., a Federal judge refused to enjoin the company from allowing texts owned by the church to remain in its system. In denying the preliminary injunction, Judge Ronald Whyte of United States District Court for Northern California noted that it could be hard for network operators to decide quickly and fairly whether an activity brought to its attention was illegal.
"There is a split at the moment at the lower court level that turns on fine distinctions of fact and law as to Internet service provider liability," Sandra Sellers, a vice president for intellectual property enforcement at the Software Publishers Association, said.
The legal uncertainty does not hamper the new on-line sleuths. "Four years ago there wouldn't have been a demand for our service," Sudeep Bose, president of Infringatek Inc. of Alexandria, Va., said.
Now, however, so many marketers of brand name goods, including Victoria's Secret catalogue, want him to track down counterfeit wares on the Internet that Mr. Bose is moving his business with its eight full-time employees out of his home and into an office.
Paramount Digital Entertainment, a unit of Viacom Inc., handles things differently. The company, which has rights to the Star Trek television series, keeps trying to persuade the on-line world to refrain from reproducing Trekkiana. It looks for illegal copying itself, and also asks fans to E-mail suspected cases to its Web site -- a kind of cyberneighborhood watch.
The detective business is beginning to pay off.
Datalytics Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, an on-line business service firm, has added Markwatch, "to help you detect potential infringement, dilution, tarnishment and genericide" of trademarks.
"We do major searches for over 100 companies," including Reebok, said Herbert Lichtman, a lawyer and software expert who developed the idea. The charge is $895 per profile per year; some companies order many specialized profiles of their products. The demand for the service is strong, Mr. Lichtman said, though he declined to disclose total revenue.
Datalytics culls references to its clients from the Internet, along with their context, and sends clients weekly lists detailing these. The clients can decide what action, if any, to take.
Company actions against Web sites are sometimes problematic. A site critical of Kmart that used a derogatory verb in its headline changed its name to "Xmart" after the operator got a notice from his service provider -- who had been reached by a public relations firm representing the retailer -- asking him to "remove the icon K and any appearance with the K and the likeness used by Kmart."
If the operator of the Web site had stood on a street corner making derogatory remarks about Kmart, "he would be within his First Amendment rights," said Michael D. Sullivan of Levine, Pearson, Sullivan & Koch. "So they use intellectual property law to come after the guy."
Ian Kitching, a resident of Cambridge, England, received a cease-and-desist letter last year from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation after posting an old spoof of a warranty card for the company's fighter jets. (A buyer, asked how he became aware of the McDonnell Douglas product, is offered several responses, including "heard loud noise, looked up," "espionage" and "was attacked by one.")
"This is a misuse of our company name and does not reflect the image of McDonnell Douglas," wrote Gary Hutti, the company's information director. Mr. Kitching is still posting the spoof.
The improvements in the technology made the need for policing inevitable, said James A. Powers, a Bethesda, Md., attorney who represents multimedia developers.
"The original Net was open," he said. "But now that we have the World Wide Web which can transmit not just data and text but graphics and multimedia, ownership and getting economic value from works has become paramount."

HEADLINE: ERA OF DOWNSIZING CREATES JOB BOOM FOR CLASS OF '97

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ind.

 BODY:
At colleges and universities around the country, the class of '97 is graduating this spring into the most auspicious job market in memory, a product of today's soaring economy and, in many ways, the large-scale layoffs that cut a swath through their parents' generation.
From huge state universities like Indiana University here to high-end private schools like Williams College in Massachusetts, from brand-name institutions like Dartmouth College to Red Rock Community College in Colorado, from Northeastern to Northwestern, colleges, universities and professional schools are reporting record numbers of recruiters on campus, often offering more jobs than they can fill. 
 "I did eight interviews and got four offers, but I could have had more -- I ruled out two of them early on," said Vijay Bhagavan, a 21-year-old accounting graduate who got a $35,000 starting position as an auditor with Price Waterhouse in Chicago. "I'd say 90 percent of my friends have jobs, and most had them relatively early. Basically, if you did your part right, you should have got a job by November, which makes Christmas break a lot more fun."
The current job market reflects the upswing in the overall economy with unemployment now below 5 percent and the go-getter predilections of a generation of students who have made junior- or sophomore-year internships as big a growth area as full-time jobs for graduates. And Internet job searches, now the rule on most campuses, have made the process of finding employment much more efficient.
But, in an odd twist on the experiences of their parents' generation, the surge also reflects the years of layoffs for which many companies are now frantically trying to compensate. Many experts believe that companies laid off too many employees in the early 90's and now that business has boomed beyond expectations, they are recruiting college students for sales, managerial, technical and support positions.
"Corporations downsized too much," said Maury Hanigan, the chief executive of the Hanigan Consulting Corporation, which advises Fortune 500 companies on how to recruit college students. "They laid off people with a lot of experience, and they also laid off their bench strength so that they had appropriate staffing for the amount of business they were doing in, say, 1991, but hadn't anticipated how much it would grow. Now they need college graduates to replace all those people who were laid off."
The National Association of Colleges and Employers says the best opportunities are in high-technology industries, especially in hardware and software development and computer consulting, which are hiring new graduates in computer science, computer information systems, computer engineering and electrical engineering. But accounting, business administration, economics, finance and marketing graduates are also in extraordinary demand.
"There shouldn't be a senior in America who wants a job that doesn't get one this year," said Jim Greeley, director of career services at Merrimack College in North Andover, Mass.
The stories from diverse campuses around the country are uniformly upbeat:
*At Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., 366 companies conducted interviews on campus, compared with 292 at the same time last year. The number has doubled since 1992-93.
*At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., more than 500 companies recruited, up almost 40 percent over last year.
*Caldwell College in New Jersey had 20 recruiters on campus. Last year it had one, United Parcel Service, offering mostly part-time positions.
*At the two-year M.B.A. Program at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., not only do virtually all graduates have plum jobs, but virtually all the first-year students have them already as well.
*At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the starting salaries of this year's M.B.A. graduates at investment banking firms jumped to $75,000, from $61,000 last year.
*At Columbia University, companies that usually finish recruiting by January were still posting new jobs in May. Also showing up were some businesses that have not recruited in years: public relations, communications, advertising, city government and not-for-profit organizations.
"I've been here 30 years and without a doubt there's been more interviewing activity on campus, more job offers, and more companies than I can ever remember," said C. Randall Powell, assistant dean and director of placement at the University of Indiana School of Business here. "In terms of getting a job, this is one of the premier years ever to have graduated from college."
Ms. Hanigan said undergraduate hiring at Fortune 500 companies, which has been on the rise since 1992, will be up at least 20 percent this year over last year.
For many liberal arts graduates, of course, the job prospects are not as glittering as for newly minted business graduates or M.B.A.'s.
"The philosophy or anthropology graduate doesn't necessarily have employers beating down at their doors," said Alan Goodman, director of career services at the Catholic University of America in Washington. "They still have to work very hard to find positions that call for their skills and knowledge."
But he said the spillover of the strong market will benefit those graduates as well. And liberal arts schools, like Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., or St. John's College of Annapolis, Md., say students are getting jobs ranging from investment banking to the Peace Corps or the Americorps. Others, as always, opt for wholly unconventional jobs. One student at St. John's reports going to work as a "groundskeeper/ grave digger/sausage maker/dog trainer" at a monastery.
The upbeat mood is hard to miss on this 1,860-acre Indiana campus of rolling hills, known for the volatile basketball coach Bobby Knight and the world's largest student union, where most students affect the well-scrubbed look of aspiring middle managers and where graduation speakers proudly pay homage to "Hoosier values."
Harry Jones, 26, an M.B.A. graduate, who will become an assistant product manager for the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, like most M.B.A. graduates went back to school after a few years in the work world. He knows boom times do not last forever, but he looks out to the future and sees mostly bright prospects.
"I think this is still the land of opportunity," said Mr. Jones, the father of two small children. "I know economic cycles have an impact, but the biggest factor is the attitude and skills you have. The job market is so good now it can skew your perceptions, but even in tougher times I think you can make things happen."
But for many students, the upbeat mood is tempered by the ups and downs of the economy and the wave of layoffs in the early 1990's.
John Warneke, 23, who is going to work in sales for Ikon Office Solutions in Indianapolis, at a starting salary of $30,000, was able to choose among four offers. But he remembers that when he was a junior in high school, his father was laid off from his job as a plant manager, and he keeps in mind that the work world will not always look so sunny.
"Fear drives you," Mr. Warneke said. "I'm motivated by the idea that nothing is secure, that you'd better produce or you could be gone. In fact, when I was talking with companies, I was always keeping in mind where they might be 5 or 10 years down the line. I think you've got to keep that fear, because it's when you get in a comfort zone, that you lose your competitive advantage."
As a result, the overwhelming majority of graduates see their job at graduation not as the beginning of a straight line of advancement within a company, but of what is likely to be a zig-zag path from company to company, job to job and skill to skill.
"Because these students were at least teen-agers when all the downsizing happened, and saw, if not parents, friends, uncles, someone laid off, they begin with the understanding that there's no such thing as lifetime employment, and they're responsible for their own career," Ms. Hanigan said. "You ask them how many know someone who was laid off and every hand in the room goes up. They believe it's part of life, like getting a cold, so they know job tenure is a short-term thing not a long-term commitment. It's an economic transaction that lasts only so long as it works for both sides, not a marriage."

Crime and Politics

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
Donna Ratliff was 8 years old when her uncle was convicted of sexually molesting her. Two other members of her family abused her. Her mother regularly beat and threatened to kill her.
When she was 14, two years ago, Donna poured kerosene around their house in Huntington, Ind., and set it on fire. Her mother and an older sister died in the fire. Donna pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. She was put in Indiana's maximum-security prison for women, in a unit where some of the other prisoners threatened her physically and sexually. 
 Last week the Indiana Court of Appeals ruled that imprisoning Donna with adults violated the state's Constitution. It has a specific provision requiring separate "institutions for the correction and reformation of juvenile offenders," so they will not be hardened by adult criminals.
But if President Clinton and the House have their way, Donna Ratliff and others like her may have to be locked up with hardened adult prisoners. That is one provision of a bill that was passed by the House a week before the Indiana court decision.
The bill would offer $1.5 billion to the states if they met new standards of harshness in the way they treat young offenders. Among other things the states would have to insure that any juvenile charged with a violent crime was tried as an adult unless the state attorney general found that the public safety would be "best served" by trial in a juvenile court. And those convicted would in some instances have to be confined in adult prisons.
House Republicans turned down elements of a juvenile crime bill put forward by President Clinton, including prevention measures and a proposal for safety locks on handguns. But the two bills shared the same premise: that even though national crime figures are falling, young people are committing worse crimes and need to be dealt with more harshly.
There are shocking cases of violent crime by juveniles. They arouse public demands that the accused be tried as adults, and most states have recently passed laws to that end.
Whether trying young people as adults actually reduces crime is an open question. An article in The Economist of London last month described two recent studies -- in Florida and New York-New Jersey -- comparing the subsequent records of defendants tried in juvenile and adult courts. The latter were more likely to be arrested again, and sooner. The Justice Department questioned those findings and is sponsoring further research.
But one thing is clear: All juvenile offenders are not alike. Some really are career criminals by the time they are 15. Others are like Donna Ratliff. We know about her because her story was brought to public attention by Larry Hayes of The Fort Wayne (Ind.) Journal Gazette and Fox Butterfield of The New York Times.
Donna grew up in desperate poverty, sometimes going for days without food. The mother who beat her had herself been sexually assaulted by her father. In the maximum-security prison Donna has been with women convicted of abusing their children. She was forbidden to talk about her experiences because, prison authorities said, that would upset the others.
Those who have dealt with Donna say she is intelligent, she needs to talk and she needs counseling. She could be someone when she gets out of prison. Or she could pass on to another generation the wounds of a dysfunctional family.
Supporters of the new Federal legislation say the differences between one young person charged with crime and another can be taken care of by prosecutorial discretion. But prosecutors have too much unreviewable power already. And they tend to use it zealously because it is good politics to "get tough on crime."
Congress and President Clinton are driven by the same thing: politics. They are intruding the Federal Government into an area that has been and should be left to local decision. Washington cannot know best how to handle a juvenile in Huntington, Ind.
Where are all the politicians who talk so much about "turning authority back to the states"? For the sake of looking tough, they are putting an iron national grip on a diverse problem that needs diverse local solutions. They are showing our children a model of hypocrisy.

HEADLINE: That Fine Spring Day in 1947

 BODY:
Looking back 50 years to the dawn of the cold war, a certain modesty is in order. We now know who won, and can itemize the mileposts of victory. The nuclear peace held, the industrial democracies hung together, and over time the Soviet empire collapsed, just as George Kennan foresaw in his pivotal "long telegram" from Moscow in February 1946. There he urged collective resistance to Stalin's expansionary drive, yet presciently added that the success of the Soviet system "is not yet finally proven" and its permanence "need not yet be regarded as assured."
But the fate of the Soviet Union was unknown when Secretary of State George Marshall rose on June 5, 1947, to deliver the commencement address at Harvard. What he did know was not encouraging. In Washington, his boss, Harry Truman, had plunged in approval ratings, abetted by the first Republican Congress since the 1920's. Europe, still bleeding from the war and having just endured the century's worst winter, faced in Marshall's words "hunger, desperation, poverty and chaos." 
 Nor was it a good time to ask Americans to offer erstwhile adversaries and prostrate allies, including a no longer friendly Soviet Union, billions in loans and grants. Americans had already voted nearly $20 billion for postwar emergency programs and were in no mood to spend more. In March 1947, when Truman asked a reluctant Congress to appropriate $450 million in security aid for Greece and Turkey, the loudest applause the President elicited was when he promised the money would be promptly repaid.
Nonetheless, in Cambridge that fine June day, in six fateful sentences, Marshall said America would open its purse wide if Europe, including the Russians, came up with a promising recovery plan. These were the seeds of what Winston Churchill called "the most unsordid act in history." From 1948 until 1951, with Republican support, some $13 billion, the equivalent of roughly $80 billion today, was disbursed in Marshall Plan grants and loans. This opened the way to NATO, the Common Market, Franco-German friendship, and thus the Western world we know today.
Granted, Marshall aid was not charity, it generated a thriving market for American exports and its deeper motive was political, to shore up the European center-left and to contain the Soviet Union. But Marshall and his chief deputy, Dean Acheson, rightly gambled that Stalin would boycott the July meeting in Paris prompted by the Harvard speech. Stalin went further. He later barred Czechoslovakia from participating, presaging the 1948 Communist coup in Prague and the hardening of the Iron Curtain that Churchill had perceived two years earlier in another commencement speech, in Fulton, Mo.
With hindsight, the end of the cold war was foreshadowed in its advent. Under Stalin, the Kremlin assumed that a capitalist economic crisis would engulf and cripple the West. Certain it would triumph no matter what, Moscow proceeded to drain $14 billion from Eastern Europe between 1948 and Stalin's death in 1953, the same period in which Washington provided $13 billion to Western Europe. The Soviet bloc, for all its outward might, was rooted in subservience and rapacity.
The real surprise in newly opened cold war archives is how few surprises have thus far emerged. So writes John Lewis Gaddis in "We Now Know," a brave early attempt to distill these documents into a narrative. Stalinist Russia was as dangerous and devious as Mr. Kennan concluded in his remarkable telegram. The onus for dividing Europe rested with Moscow, and so long as Stalin was in charge, conflict was inescapable. Where Americans (though not Mr. Kennan) erred was in underestimating the political and economic weakness of the Soviet system, a misjudgment that contributed to the tragic intervention in Vietnam.
But this was not so evident 50 years ago. Facing a Soviet adversary with global appetites and a nuclear capacity, Washington rose impressively to the occasion, summoned life from the ashes of Europe and rallied support for a bold and demanding response. Today's threats are more subtle and require more nuanced responses. The planned eastward expansion of NATO mimics the grand strategies of the earlier era but seems misplaced at a time when the consolidation of democracy in Russia is paramount. Still, America has every reason to look back with awe and admiration at how it met the great challenges that followed World War II.

HEADLINE: Japan Reports Trade Surplus Soared in April

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, May 19

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose sharply in April as auto makers and others cranked up exports to compensate for slower growth in domestic demand after the Government raised the national consumption tax, economists said today.
The surplus increased 163.7 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier to 831.48 billion yen, or $7.23 billion, the Finance Ministry said. The rise, which was the second in the last three months, followed nearly three years of declines. Automobile and machine makers that lifted production to meet strong domestic orders before April are now focused on competing for market share overseas. 
 Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose for the seventh consecutive month, increasing 174.1 percent, to 468.97 billion yen, or $4.16 billion.
That could irritate the Big Three American automobile companies, which have seen Japanese auto makers increase their share of the United States market this year.
The rise in the trade surplus came as the dollar rose sharply against the yen, before slipping this month. A stronger dollar, and thus a weaker yen, makes Japanese goods less expensive overseas. In Tokyo trading, the dollar briefly slipped to less than 115 yen on word of the trade-surplus rise, down from 115.45 just before the release of the numbers, but later recovered.
If the dollar continues to fall from the highs it reached against the yen earlier this year, it could limit the rise in the Japanese trade surplus by making the country's exports more expensive again.
Japanese exports in April rose 21.5 percent, to 4.43 trillion yen, the Government said.
Exports of every major industrial category rose. Auto exports to the United States rose 25.4 percent in April from the corresponding month the previous year, to 230 billion yen.
Imports to Japan rose 8.1 percent in April, to 3.59 trillion yen. The Government raised the consumption tax by 2 percentage points, to 5 percent, on April 1.
 The stock market had a muted reaction to the report. At midday, the Nikkei index or 225 issues was up 97.91, to 20,422.44, or a half-percent. On Friday, the Nikkei rose 268.42 points.

HEADLINE: Rethinking the News;
Papers Seek More Personal Connection With Readers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
Most daily newspapers save the front page for their most important news. But The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is experimenting with a Sunday front page that has no news on it at all -- only highlights of features in the rest of the paper. And people seem to like it.
Most dailies publish letters and opinion articles from readers. But The San Jose Mercury News in California turns most of a weekly features section, Celebrations, over to heart-warming articles written by readers. It is one of the paper's most popular sections. 
 And most dailies print long, multipart series on important news or social events. But The St. Petersburg Times in Florida took the concept to new lengths by running a 29-part serial, complete with end-of-chapter cliffhangers, about a woman whose secretly gay husband contracted AIDS and died. Sure enough, sales got a lift while the serial was running.
From coast to coast, and in big cities and small ones, newspapers are embracing color and drama and intimacy in hopes of better connecting with their increasingly distracted and time-pressed readers. These efforts are squarely aimed at reversing grim trends faced by nearly all newspaper editors and publishers: declining circulation, an aging readership and weaker ties between the public and their papers.
Some of the largest dailies, like The New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, aim for a cosmopolitan and affluent readership, reaching a national audience by publishing at distribution centers across the country and extending their geographic boundaries even further through the Internet. Such papers have retained their focus on national and international news, business news, analysis and the arts.
But editors and publishers at more locally oriented papers say they must appeal to the widest range of potential readers and particularly to their weakest audience segments -- women and young people. In the process, they have begun to question some of the basic assumptions of print journalism -- that hard news trumps soft features in the allocation of space and staff, for example. Or that, in American journalism, it is up to editors and reporters to do the talking while the customers shut up and pay attention.
In this new world of adaptive journalism, readers and newspaper marketers are getting a bigger say in what goes into the paper. Like it or not, editors and reporters are being forced to do the listening .
"We are trying to get out of the business of being the mediator between our readers and the news and into the business of listening over the back fence while people talk," said Jerry Ceppos, the executive editor of The Mercury News. Describing the reader-written Celebrations section, Mr. Ceppos said, "We are trying to solve the problem of a metropolitan newspaper seeking to maintain its connection with its readers."
Many of these changes in American journalism have their roots in the influential market research of Yankelovich Skelly & White in the late 1970's, which found that newspaper readers wanted more "self-oriented" features and local news.
The studies, paid for by a newspaper industry already concerned about declining readership, also reported that readers wanted no loss in hard news. Some critics say that in the intervening years, the hard news part of the equation has been lost.
"In one sense, it's comforting to see newspapers trying to please their readers this way," said John Polich, a media consultant and professor of media management at the Fordham University business school. "But on the other hand, it's frightening," he added, "because a lot of these things undermine what newspapers spent the first couple of hundred years in this country learning to do -- which was to be the gatekeeper, to be a filter of all the true and false and gray-area information that is out there every day and to deliver what journalists thought was important and useful."
Edward Wasserman, the former business editor at The Miami Herald who now publishes Miami Business Reviews, three business weeklies covering South Florida, was even blunter. "Newspapers have been tarting themselves up like a cheap diner's commemorative place mats for better than a decade," he wrote in the current edition of The American Journalism Review, "and they're still shutting down, and readership numbers are still declining."
Indeed, the percentage of adults in the United States who read a weekday paper declined to 64.2 percent in 1995, from 77.6 percent in 1970, according to the Newspaper Association of America. Sunday newspapers have recovered some readership in part because of the advertising supplements and discount coupons.
No one paper exemplifies all of the experimentation under way in the industry. But all of the tinkering seems aimed at the common objective of a more emotional and intimate relationship with readers.
Tom Koenninger, editor of The Columbian in Vancouver, Wash., is working down a list of 32 community groups, from real estate agents to Conservative Christians to the Clark County Saddle Club. Representatives of each group are being invited in for coffee and conversation.
"We had the medical society in, and we found out they were mad at us for an article we did on managed care in 1984," Mr. Koenninger said. "They were still mad, and we didn't find out until we asked them to come for a visit."
John G. Craig Jr., the editor of The Post-Gazette, echoes many editors elsewhere in conceding that his newsroom staff members worry that the innovations are being made at the expense of the tasks that newspapers still perform better than any other medium, which is to report and explain the news in depth.
"The internal debate was extraordinarily ferocious," Mr. Craig said of the decision to try the no-news Sunday front page. "A lot of the people in editorial were talking about integrity issues and suggesting that we were selling out to the devil."
But along with other editors nationwide, Mr. Craig insists that newspapers can become more appealing to readers without giving up their best qualities.
So last fall, Mr. Craig went to work on his Sunday bulldog, the edition that goes on sale Saturday afternoon and does not normally have much fresh news to report. It is the only edition of the week that is sold exclusively on the streets and in stores.
As a test, Mr. Craig split his bulldog circulation, printing a conventional front page of hard news and photographs for distribution in the northern and eastern parts of the Pittsburgh market. For the southern and western parts, the front page consists of color photos, drawings and brief upbeat captions highlighting the features inside the paper -- an experimental design that has been given names like "the teaser" by the circulation staff and "revolting" by the news staff.
On Sunday, April 13, for example, the conventional bulldog front page offered stories about Iowa's success in privatizing state liquor sales (Pennsylvania is moving in the same direction), an explanatory feature about high-definition television and a report on problems at the city's convention center.
The same day, the experimental front page offered cartoons and photo ads for a spring golf preview in Section DD, the promise that "Parade Magazine counts the ways America is still Number One," the lure of a travel feature on the Chesapeake Bay on page F1, and so on.
"The idea really goes to the heart of a lot of newspaper maxims, like 'A good news headline sells papers,' " Mr. Craig said. "Well, we have done one front page with a good news head and one that was mostly about what was in the TV magazine. And the grotesque and outrageous front page sells better than the traditional one."
The difference is small, 3 percent to 5 percent, said David Stolar, the director of single-copy sales at The Post-Gazette. But these days, the circulation wars are being fought over tiny increments. "There are people out there every day who are on the fence -- are they going to buy a paper or not?" Mr. Stolar said. "If we can just get a 3 percent swing in sales, that's a couple thousand more papers that we've sold."
In two weeks, The Post-Gazette will switch distribution sectors for the Sunday bulldog through December, after which the paper's executives will evaluate the experiment.
Getting that extra few thousand sales, and perhaps luring a different kind of reader, was also part of the inspiration last fall for "Three Little Words -- A Tale of Trust, Betrayal and Redemption," the 29-part series in The St. Petersburg Times about a woman's discovery of her husband's secret life as a homosexual and her subsequent ordeal as he died of AIDS.
Each installment of the serial was written to be read quickly -- the time it would take a reader to drink a cup of coffee -- said Neil Brown, managing editor of The Times.
"There is still a lot of discussion at the paper about whether it worked as journalism, but I think we can all agree that it was worth trying," Mr. Brown said. "We were intrigued about trying this as a way of reaching another kind of reader, and maybe a younger reader, who would drop a quarter in a box to read a different kind of story."
Apparently it worked, because the paper saw its sales bump slightly upward during the serial, although overall circulation remains flat.
The quest to reach young readers, especially minority youths, and develop future newsroom talent prompted The Kansas City Star in Missouri to create Teen Star, a weekly half-page pull-out section of news reporting and personal experiences by local teen-agers.
Attracting younger readers is high on the list for many newspaper executives.
The Sacramento Bee in California, for instance, closed its Mexico City bureau during the recent West Coast recession, cut its San Francisco bureau to one reporter from four and has delayed plans for a Pacific Rim bureau until business conditions improve. Right now, said Rick Rodriguez, managing editor of The Bee, the paper has a higher priority: hiring a second pop music critic.
"I think all newspapers have to be interested in getting young people as readers, and in Sacramento, we do a good job of it, but we have to do better," Mr. Rodriguez said. "And getting younger readers might mean making some changes in staffing emphasis."
In San Jose, The Mercury News's efforts to tap into readers' emotions seems to be succeeding, judging by the response to the reader-written Celebrations features. The articles occupy most of the cover of the paper's Silicon Valley Life section on Thursdays. Regular Celebrations departments include "Quotable Kids," "How I Met My True Love" and "The Seven-Second Philosopher."
One of the fans is Peter Jonnard, a math teacher at Capuchino High School in San Bruno, Calif. "I know you can't put every kid who graduates from high school on the front page," Mr. Jonnard said, "but to thousands of people like me, something like that is more important than something that happens a thousand miles away."

HEADLINE: College Minority Enrollment Slowed in 1995

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Several years of rapid gains in the college enrollment of minority students gave way to more subdued growth in 1995, according to a report to be released today by the American Council on Education in Washington.
Education officials worry that the slowdown will turn into an actual decline after recent cuts in affirmative action programs in Texas and California. 
 "Our primary concern is that the trends continue in the right direction, and that the current turbulence over affirmative action in Texas and California does not create a stall or send the trends in the wrong direction," said Stanley O. Ikenberry, the president of the council.
Gary Orfield, a desegregation expert at the School of Education and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, saw a special significance in the report's findings.
"To see the enrollment rates slowing even before those policy changes occur suggests how incredibly high the stakes are in the reversal of affirmative action," Mr. Orfield said.
The council's study, "The 15th Annual Status Report on Minorities in Higher Education," showed a 2.9 percent increase in overall minority enrollment in 1995, the most recent year for which data were available. In 1994, the gain was 4.6 percent, and in 1993, 7.1 percent.
African-American enrollments were up 1.7 percent in 1995 over 1994, to 1.5 million. Hispanic enrollments grew 4.6 percent to 1.1 million. Asian-American enrollment rose 3 percent, to 797,000 students. And American Indian enrollment was up 3.1 percent to 131,000. Total enrollment at colleges was 14.3 million.
The study did not address why minority enrollments had slowed, but educators said a stronger economy and greater ease in finding jobs might have diverted some prospective students from college. They also cited higher tuitions and cuts in financial aid as possible obstacles. Donald Stewart, the president of the College Board, which administers many college and graduate school entrance tests, said some college officials expected a drop this fall in minority enrollment, particularly by black and Hispanic students in the West. Fewer minority students applied to public universities in Texas and California this spring, although those states have not fully imposed the cuts in affirmative action.
"It's not because of changes in admissions policies, but because of fears of changes in policies," Mr. Stewart said.
The study made clear that while college enrollment by white high school graduates had climbed significantly in 20 years -- to 43 percent in 1995, up from 32 percent in 1975 -- there was little or no improvement among minority groups.
Slightly more than 35 percent of black high school graduates from 18 to 24 years old were enrolled in college in 1995, three percentage points above the level in 1975. The rate for Hispanic graduates was 35 percent in both years, though it has fluctuated in the 20-year period.
The number of black college students is at an all-time high, but William H. Gray 3d, the president of the United Negro College Fund, said this was not good enough. The percentage of blacks in college, Mr. Gray said, should match the level for all students. The report said that 42 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were in college in 1995.
Officials at the American Council on Education, an umbrella organization for the nation's colleges, universities and other education associations, said their research had highlighted a variety of problems.
One was the low high school graduation rates of Hispanic students.
In 1995, the latest year for which the council had data, fewer than 60 percent of Hispanic 18- to 24-year-olds had completed high school or earned an equivalent degree, significantly less than the 77 percent rate for African-American students and the 82 percent rate for whites.
"You can't make progress in opening education opportunities in higher education if they are not graduating from high school," said Mr. Ikenberry, the council's president.
Deborah Carter, associate director of the council's Office of Minorities in Higher Education and a co-author, with Reginald Wilson, of the study, pointed out that Hispanic students who complete high school enroll in college in similar proportions to black students -- about 35 percent.
"Much more attention has to be paid to this issue," Ms. Carter said. "By 2015, the Hispanic population will be the largest ethnic minority in the United States. Not to attend to this issue would be a major travesty in terms of providing equal educational opportunity."
The council's report also highlighted problems among some Asian-American groups. Over all, 55 percent of Asian-Americans from 18 to 24 years old were enrolled in college. But among subgroups, the figures ranged from a high of 66 percent of Chinese-Americans to a low of 26 percent of Laotian-Americans.
"The Laotians, Cambodians and some Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants have some major hurdles in terms of language skills," Ms. Carter said, "and demonstrate some of the same at-risk characteristics that other low-income students face."

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Teachers Resist Teaching in English

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., May 18

 BODY:
On an island where English is routinely spoken in government and business, heard and read in the news media and widely accepted as a ticket to economic opportunity, a plan to begin using it as a second language of instruction in public schools has prompted demonstrations by teachers and predictions of cultural suicide.
Teacher organizations say they oppose the Puerto Rico Department of Education's "Project for Developing a Bilingual Citizen," calling it a political rather than pedagogic move by a pro-statehood government that wants to make the island more palatable to Congress. Bills are pending in Washington to give Puerto Ricans the chance to vote on the island's political status -- whether statehood, independence or some form of association with the United States -- by next year. Puerto Rico's Spanish-speaking population is a major roadblock for proponents of making the island the 51st state. A nonbinding plebiscite in 1993 showed the island sharply divided between statehood and the current commonwealth status. 
 Teachers are also concerned that the school system is ill prepared to add English instruction for subjects like math and science, mostly because most teachers are not bilingual themselves. Plans call for phasing in English instruction, beginning when the new school year starts in August. Officials with the Teachers Federation of Puerto Rico said that many teachers planned to sabotage the effort and that some were already hoarding Spanish textbooks to avoid using the new ones in English.
"I will refuse" to teach in English, said Digna Irizarry, 45, a math teacher who was among several hundred teachers protesting Friday in front of the Education Department with signs reading, "I'm Puerto Rican. I Speak Spanish" and "Math is difficult enough in Spanish, imagine in English."
The controversy echoes the national debate over English-only laws in the United States, a debate prompted by a growing population of Spanish-speaking immigrants. But unlike in the states, the invading language here is highly valued. Because of Puerto Rico's nearly century-old political association with the United States, which has kept the island as a territory since it was ceded by Spain after the Spanish-American War in 1898, there are Federal courts and agencies here that do business in English. Jobs routinely require bilingual skills, and English textbooks and tests are the norm in many university programs.
Anglicisms, long part of the vocabulary of even the educated, keep going strong thanks to cable television and the Internet.
But Spanish is held as a pillar of Puerto Rico's culture, and even the pro-statehood New Progressive Party maintains that it is nonnegotiable: even under statehood, Spanish and English would co-exist, the party promises.
The mother tongue, however, has hardly been immune to the forces of Puerto Rican politics. Just in 1991, pro-commonwealth Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon elevated it to sole official language, only to have the current Governor, Pedro J. Rossello, who is pro-statehood, obtain legislation two years later making English officially equal.
Statehood advocates put the need for bilingualism in practical terms. "We're Puerto Ricans and U.S. citizens; we're both," said Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's representative in Congress. "Our language of birth is Spanish, but we also understand that to widen our opportunities we must speak both languages."
But others see the latest effort as a not-so-veiled attempt to assimilate Puerto Rico, or at least to portray it as assimilated.
"Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking country, and to introduce in a massive way instruction in English is to try to Americanize us, to return to the past," said Carmelo Delgado Cintron, the former director of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, who now heads a group called Spanish First. "I don't have anything against the United States, but we have a culture that should be valued and defended."
Although English was the main language of public school instruction here in the first half of the century under governors sent from the mainland, Spanish replaced it for all courses except English class beginning in 1949. Census figures show that only about a quarter of the population of 3.7 million is bilingual.
Starting in August, the island's public schools will intensify the learning of English by using textbooks in English for the first time for courses other than English, by extending English classes to 90 minutes from 50, and by giving priority to reading and writing in English in first, second and third grades. The Department of Education also plans to retrain and certify Puerto Rican teachers as specialists in English and bring teachers from the United States to offer technical assistance under exchange programs.
Education Secretary Victor Fajardo said that he was giving teachers the option of lecturing in either language and that "we agree that English will always be the second language of education." But his goal, he said, is to introduce English in every course "so that we create a climate where English is a presence."
Mr. Fajardo said his plan was a response to test scores last year indicating that 90 percent of the island's 650,000 public school students lack basic English skills by the time they graduate from high school. He said he wanted public school students to have the same advantages as those in private schools.
But the emphasis on English comes as test scores are showing deficiencies in all other subjects, including Spanish. Teachers blame crowded classroom and shortages of books and other materials. And College Board test scores from 1980 to 1995 showed that while averages for English improved, those for Spanish were on the decline.
Although there is debate here about what the best age is to immerse children in a second language, a larger concern among many teachers is that English may be emphasized at the expense of Spanish and other subjects. They say the department would do better if it simply strengthened the existing English program.
"In three years we won't know neither English or Spanish or math or science because we're adding an element of complexity to students in their learning and an impediment for teachers to teach," said Jose Eligio Velez, president of another teachers' group, the Teachers Association.
At the Julio Selles Sola Elementary School here in San Juan, parents were generally supportive of more English instruction, although they said they knew little about the plan beyond published reports. Raul Rivera, 37, who has a 12-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter in the school, recalled how when he went to college he was forced to use a dictionary and ask for tutorial help to understand the English textbooks.
"I wouldn't want my children to go through that experience," said Mr. Rivera, who now teaches microbiology at the University of Puerto Rico. "But I'd like both English and Spanish teaching to be improved."
The issue recently led to a rare outburst of English on the Senate floor by Senator Kenneth McClintock, a statehooder and the son of a Puerto Rican mother and a Texan father who grew up here.
"I wanted to make the point that there's nothing bad about English," Mr. McClintock said. The Senate minority leader, Antonio J. Fas Alzamora of the pro-status quo Popular Democratic Party, said the new policy was just one more example of the promotion of statehood with public money by the Rossello administration.
"They don't want to accept reality," he said of statehood proponents. "They want to disguise the fact that Puerto Rico is a distinct nation."

HEADLINE: Tenure Denial to a Woman Puts Harvard in an Uproar;
Rejection From Leader Who Vows Diversity

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 18

 BODY:
The denial of tenure to a brilliant young scholar at Harvard University is hardly a rare event. Indeed, decisions over tenure -- the academic prize that confers a job for life -- are often contentious, with all the political intrigue of, say, a White House Cabinet appointment.
But the decision last month by Harvard's president, Neil L. Rudenstine, to deny tenure to a rising star in the faculty of arts and sciences -- Bonnie Honig, 37, an associate professor of political theory -- has led to a firestorm of speculation and protest the likes of which has not been seen here in recent history. 
 Mr. Rudenstine's decision has raised sensitive questions over his attitude toward affirmative action at a time when he has proclaimed the hiring of more tenured female faculty members to be one of his top priorities. The uproar, which has been front-page news in The Harvard Crimson and the talk of faculty meetings and dinners, provides a rare window into the byzantine tenure process at one of the world's most prestigious universities.
Professor Honig, who has published two books, with the manuscript for a third recently accepted by Princeton University Press, had cleared all the tenure hurdles save one: winning Mr. Rudenstine's approval. His decision, amid his administration's drumbeat for affirmative action, has mystified faculty members and students.
"I am personally very pleased with Neil's statements about diversity, and the leadership he is taking on diversity," Mary C. Waters, a professor of sociology, said in an interview. "That's why it's such a complex issue. Here you've got this real liberal guy who says all the right things. And this case comes up that's just so perplexing."
The centerpiece of the protest, itself the subject of as much talk on campus as the president's decision, is a letter that 15 of the most senior and distinguished women on the faculty sent to Mr. Rudenstine asking him to reconsider and questioning his commitment to affirmative action.
At Harvard, where the senior faculty women are not known for their militance, where even tenured faculty members, men and women, are reluctant to criticize the administration, the letter amounted to a near-revolutionary act.
Describing Professor Honig as "a brilliant, highly productive and widely respected political theorist," the letter, which The Harvard Crimson obtained through undisclosed sources and published on its front page on Monday, read: "Your decision to refuse Honig tenure has been greeted with shock and disbelief across the university and beyond. It is especially incomprehensible given your publicly stated commitment to equality for women."
The 15 women who signed the letter include Martha Minow, professor of law; Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology; Carol Gilligan, professor of education; Seyla Benhabib, professor of government; Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor of history, and Professor Waters.
"The Honig affair is puzzling to us," Professor Benhabib said, "because according to all institutional criteria and criteria of scholarship, she has fulfilled Harvard's requirement for promotion and tenure."
The letter supplied such insider's details as the strong departmental vote in favor of Professor Honig, as well as the support she had from four out of the five members of the ad hoc committee that reviewed her case.
Another letter that was leaked to The Crimson and that startled people here was one written to the 15 women by Harvard's associate dean for affirmative action, Marjorie Garber. "I hope your argument will prevail with President Rudenstine," she wrote, "since I too think the university -- and the students -- will be much the poorer without Bonnie Honig's presence on our faculty."
The official silence from Mr. Rudenstine on his reason for denying Professor Honig tenure has only fueled the speculation.
In a letter of response to the 15 women, which was provided to The New York Times by a faculty member sympathetic to Professor Honig, Mr. Rudenstine shed no further light on his decision but wrote, "I assure you that my commitment to the advancement of women at Harvard remains unequivocal."
Affirmative action is a particularly sensitive issue here as Harvard is in the midst of a $2.1 billion fund-raising campaign. The university has been smarting from the attention given to a group of alumnae of Radcliffe College, which merged with Harvard in the 1970's, and their organized challenge to what they view as Harvard's unimpressive record of hiring tenured women.
The group has persuaded alumni to divert nearly $500,000 in gifts into a protest escrow account to try to force Harvard to act.
Of 418 tenured members of the faculty of arts and sciences, 48, or 11.5 percent, are women, and it is widely acknowledged that progress has been made during Mr. Rudenstine's five and a half years as president. From 1991 to 1996, the number of tenured women in the faculty of arts and sciences increased by 26 percent, to 48 from 38, while its tenured faculty as a whole grew by 6 percent.
At the same time that Professor Honig was denied tenure, so, too, was Peter Berkowitz, also an associate professor of government. The outcry over Professor Berkowitz's denial has been muted in comparison with that over Professor Honig's.
There are five women among the 28 tenured members of the government department.
Professor Honig said she had been gratified by the support on her behalf.
She arrived at Harvard in 1989, with graduate degrees from the London School of Economics and Johns Hopkins University. Her work, which draws on post-structuralist and feminist theory and is a critique of liberal political theory, is regarded as cutting edge.
She grew up in Montreal, where she attended an Orthodox Hebrew elementary and high school. "Talmud was reserved for the boys," Professor Honig said. "I always wanted to study Talmud. Political theory, in the end, met that need."
She said she and her husband, Michael Whinston, a tenured professor of economics at Harvard, were weighing their options. Professor Honig has received an offer of full tenure as a professor of political theory at Northwestern University. Professor Whinston has also received an offer of tenure at Northwestern.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about protests over the refusal of tenure to a woman at Harvard University omitted a response from Neil L. Rudenstine, the university president. He declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the tenure process.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK OFFERS POLLUTION PERMITS TO LURE COMPANIES

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 18

 BODY:
New York State has long offered companies tax breaks, low-interest loans, grants and other incentives to lure them into doing business in the state. But now the Pataki administration is dangling a new kind of enticement: permission to pollute.
Over the last year, state agencies have accumulated millions of dollars in so-called pollution credits. The credits, a free-market innovation created by the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, are generated by agencies and companies that keep their polluting emissions below Government limits. 
 The credits are bought and sold on the open market. Any company or state agency with a good emissions record can sell its credits -- essentially, the permission to pollute -- to a company unable or unwilling to meet emissions standards. Or it can retire the credits permanently and reduce the potential of further pollution.
But the Pataki administration has recently chosen a novel approach that has prompted an intense debate: offering the credits free to companies willing to set up shop in New York. Without the credits, the companies might find it hard to do business here, and either have to buy credits on the open market, or find ways to reduce pollution.
The administration says its policy will still result in reduced emissions, because a new company that receives the credits will not be allowed to produce the full amount of pollution the credits allow.
"We try to make it easier for manufacturers to move into New York," said Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state economic development agency, which has already given credits to a glass company building a plant in upstate Geneva. "It was a unique and innovative idea."
But environmentalists are voicing deep concerns over the policy, saying it raises several important questions: Why should the state subsidize polluters? Isn't the environment better served by permanently retiring these credits? And is it proper to promote economic development at the expense of the public's health?
The debate in New York underscores the policy conundrum that other state and local governments face as they decide how to use or regulate such credits in the fledgling free market in pollution.
In Maine, widespread protests forced state officials to back away from a plan to offer pollution credits to a paper company. In New Jersey, state regulators require companies to retire 10 percent of any credits sold, a policy that angered some in the business community. And in Connecticut, the state no longer grants waivers to companies whose emissions exceed allowable limits, forcing them instead to buy pollution credits.
"There are a lot of ideas on how to handle this market," said Jason Grumet, the executive director for the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a group of air pollution regulators from eight Northeast states, including New York and New Jersey. "States are having to make important choices on how to use these powerful market approaches to achieve the dual goal of environmental protection and economic development."
New York's approach, one of the first of its kind in the nation, has prompted a particularly troublesome dispute for Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who has cast himself as a staunch defender of the environment but whose policies have often been attacked by environmentalists.
The policy of handing out the pollution credits underscores what many regard as a fundamental dilemma for Mr. Pataki: how to protect the environment without alienating the business community, an important political ally of the Governor's.
To many environmentalists, it seems oddly inconsistent for Mr. Pataki to enact such a policy, given that just last month he wrote out a personal check during a news conference to buy $50 in pollution credits in order to retire them permanently and thus remove them from the market.
The environmentalists wonder why the state would undermine its efforts to reduce pollution by giving away the credits it earned. "It's disturbing that the state would turn around and give away pollution credits that it has accumulated by reducing its own pollution emissions," said Peter Ironowitz, an air-quality expert for Environmental Advocates. "The state should be retiring them for the public health, not giving them to business."
The policy is relatively new, enacted by the Governor through an executive order he signed in July 1996 with little public notice. The executive order required state agencies to do two things: conduct an inventory of their pollution emissions and then hand over their credits to the Empire State Development Corporation. That agency, in turn, was instructed to offer the credits to businesses as an incentive to move to New York or expand in the state.
To date, the state has qualified for credits equivalent to the emission of 150 tons of nitrogen oxide a year, a big component of smog. The credits are sold on the open market for between $150,000 and $450,000 in upstate New York, but 10 times as much in New York City, the administration said.
The Pataki administration has given all those credits to Guardian Glass, a glass manufacturer that needed the credits to get a pollution permit to build a 696,600-square-foot plant in the upstate community of Geneva.
The administration contends that the deal is good for both the environment and the economy. It says that the company had to obtain 1.15 tons in credits for every ton of pollutants it expects to emit.
"We're reducing emissions from the state's own facilities at the same time that we're allowing economic growth and job creation to occur," Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, said. "We're achieving a balance."
But environmentalists and Democratic legislators say they are concerned not only by the policy itself but also by what they view as the relative secrecy under which it was enacted.
Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee in the State Assembly, said he was disturbed that the decision to transfer the credits to Guardian Glass was reached without an extensive public review. He has begun an inquiry into the legality of the transaction.
"The process by which these decisions are made must be open and accountable," he said in a recent letter to John P. Cahill, the state's Acting Environmental Conservation Commissioner. "To the best of my knowledge, they have been behind closed doors, and the public has received no public notice or justification."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 20, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about New York's offer of pollution credits to companies that relocate in the state misspelled the surname of an environmentalist who expressed concerns about the plan. He is Peter Iwanowicz, not Ironowitz.

HEADLINE: Demystifying the Method;
Once-Exclusive Actors Studio Reaches Out to the Public

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Looking back on his career, Paul Newman said recently, "The Actors Studio can take the credit or the blame for what I've become as an actor."
Which is it, credit or blame? In answer, Mr. Newman chose the noncommittal road: "The Studio has to accept the responsibility." 
 Although there would seem to be a note of irony in the actor's voice, almost all his colleagues at the Studio, from Julie Harris to Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin, could echo that statement. With its use of the naturalistic style of acting known as the Method, the organization has had an indelible effect on American acting in films as well as onstage. It has also left its signature on the actors themselves, a gallery of the most talented performers from several generations.
This year the Actors Studio is celebrating its 50th anniversary. In the theater, an art with a short shelf life, that should make it a venerable institution. After all, the Group Theater, its prestigious predecessor, lasted only 10 years. There is something about the exploratory nature of the work that keeps it youthful. Although it has had its struggles, it remains a vibrant organization, one that seems to be changing to keep up with theatrical times. This once-secret sanctuary has opened its doors -- slightly.
The Studio was born on Oct. 5, 1947. Two months later, "A Streetcar Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams opened on Broadway. As directed by Elia Kazan, a co-founder of the Studio, the play established several careers, including that of Marlon Brando, who galvanized audiences in the role of Stanley Kowalski. The actor and his performance came to signify the essence of the Method.
The Method, Lee Strasberg's version of the acting system first developed by Konstantin Stanislavsky for the Moscow Art Theater, uses physical and emotional exercises as a way of encouraging actors to explore their own psyche while preparing for a role. Before the Method, acting training in the United States emphasized language and text rather than psychology. That was fine for dealing with the classics and popular Broadway fare, but limited with the new, emotionally revealing drama of playwrights like Mr. Williams.
Throughout its history, the Method has had its critics as well as its partisans, with detractors mocking what they thought of as self-indulgence. But it was soon clear that the best of the Method actors like Mr. Brando probed deeply into their characters, and uncovered a greater psychological truth.
Ellen Burstyn, a past president of the Studio, defines the Method as "character expressed through behavior." She said: "The Studio is truly a workshop. Lee always said that acting is an art in which the artists use themselves as the artistic tool. Actors work with the emotional life of human beings, and that's very reclusive. It is like an artist's atelier, a place for actors to find their voice."
In its lifetime, the organization has had periods of controversy, and after Mr. Strasberg's death in 1982 it seemed to be in eclipse, but it continues to have a strong influence.
Arthur Penn, the stage and film director who is the group's current president, said that the image of the Studio as a "kind of closed, almost mystical society is slowly undergoing a change." This was a feeling that was perpetuated during the 30-year reign of Mr. Strasberg, who became an all-powerful teacher. Now, the Method is taught at many other schools and conservatories, and, said Mr. Penn, "the Studio is no longer the temple it once was." Although the work sessions, the core of the training, remain private, the public is now invited to see more of the results.
In a quest to widen the perception of the organization and also to encourage the writing of new plays with large casts, Mr. Penn has been presenting a series of free workshop performances of plays by Jay Presson Allen and others at the Raw Space theater on West 42d Street.
Three years ago, the Studio moved into the educational arena, starting a Master of Fine Arts program at the New School. Today, the first class will graduate. As part of their curriculum, students have classes in dance, voice, play writing and theater history as well as acting. The students range in age from the early 20's to the early 60's. To earn their degrees, they act in their own productions of plays at Circle in the Square Downtown. After graduating, they are urged to audition for a place in the parent organization.
"We are the cadet company of the Actors Studio," said James Lipton, dean of the School of Dramatic Arts at the New School.
 
A Deep Experience That Changes a Life
One of the 77 graduates, Peggy Lee Brennan, an actress from Staten Island, had been on Broadway in "Grease" and worked in movies and on television. She regards the three-year program as a life-changing experience: "I needed to be stretched. I wanted to be something more." Robert Lavelle, an actor from Memphis, said: "I feel like I'm standing on a foundation of work now. It's a psychologically astute and informative course of study, but it also teaches you the nuts and bolts -- a means of survival in this business."
As part of the master's program, Mr. Lipton conducts public seminars with famous actors and directors, a series that is broadcast on the Bravo cable channel. The series is called "Inside the Actors Studio," although the guests include nonmembers (Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts) as well as members (Mr. Newman, Christopher Walken).
Members meet regularly at the Studio itself, a former church and now a landmark building (on West 44th Street). They bring in individual projects, and more experienced actors like Ms. Burstyn take turns as group leader. In a recent work session, an actress was so overcome that she broke down during a scene. "Work through your tears," advised Ms. Burstyn. Later she explained the reason behind her suggestion: "Very often actors become emotional and they try to control their emotion. The point is to allow it to flow and to keep on working. Then the whole scene can come alive."
Because these sessions are closed, except to certain professional observers (and students from the master's program), a certain mystery still persists. One of the questions is how the organization began.
The idea of creating a new workshop for actors was first discussed by Robert Lewis and Mr. Kazan during what Mr. Lewis describes as their "famous walk in Central Park." Cheryl Crawford was subsequently brought in, making it a founding triumvirate. Mr. Strasberg did not arrive until a year later, after Mr. Lewis had resigned, but his name quickly became synonymous with the Studio. Running his own classes, Mr. Lewis continued to have an influence on actors.
From the first, the Studio was conceived as a place, in Mr. Newman's words, where experienced actors "could reinvestigate and re-examine their craft." When he joined, he was fresh out of the Yale Graduate School of Drama, and had appeared in summer stock: "It gave me a chance to see how the most gifted American actors worked and to see the nature of their exploration,"
As the organization developed, attitudes toward it were as diverse as the stories about its creation. Norman Mailer, an active member since 1958, said that at first it was more a church than a club, and "either you were an acolyte or you resisted it." What he liked was that even as an outsider (and a nonactor) he was allowed to speak up. Mr. Mailer said that over the years the group had become more eclectic and less secretive. With dry amusement, he compares it with the C.I.A. "They have parallel histories," he said, adding, "We may not have as many scandals as they do."
It still is an exclusive club with stringent entrance requirements. Actors have to go through a rigorous audition, and if they fail they often apply again and again. It took seven auditions before Geraldine Page was accepted. Lee Grant, one of the members who opened the West Coast branch, says, "It's the only place where talent, not success, gets you in." Once people are accepted, they are members for life; there are no requirements or fees. There are currently about 800 members. Almost everyone works without pay.
During Mr. Strasberg's time, there were occasional crises, including the failure of the Actors Studio Theater on Broadway in 1963. After Mr. Strasberg died, a sequence of presidents eventually led to Mr. Penn, who has been a member since 1953. Recalling his early days there, he said: "It was much more of a fraternity or sorority. As the cult of personality grew, the exclusionary policy grew. Finally it became Strasberg's place." Although he is hesitant about criticizing Mr. Strasberg's domination, he makes it clear that his intention has been to make it more an actors' place.
 
Staying Afloat Without Any Grants
In pursuit of that goal, he plans to ease the entrance requirements so that "extraordinarily accomplished actors" can be invited to join. "I hope the 50th anniversary will be something of distinction in the diminishing American consciousness about art," Mr. Penn said. "There is something to be celebrated, that people have stayed together and have done it on a voluntary basis. We have no government support and years ago the grants ceased. But somehow the Studio has endured."
It is now supported by private contributions. During periods of economic stress, board members like Mr. Newman have stepped in with emergency money. The program at the New School and the Bravo series have finally given the group a certain financial stability.
On the outside, Mr. Lewis, now 88 and still teaching, can look back with bemusement. He remembers his differences with Mr. Strasberg, which were substantive and esthetic. When told that the organization he helped create retains its cachet after half a century and that actors still compete to become members, he said: "Well, I'm going to apply. Do you think they'll take me?"

Screams At the Window

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
American politics is dead. Government is scarcely breathing. Washington media people worth hundreds of millions of dollars are withering away for lack of news from the Potomac shore. Desperate columnists sob and say, "There is no news."
No news? Nonsense. Of course there is news. This is a country with 250 million people who don't want any news from Washington and, even if they did, wouldn't expect any news from Washington because they don't think Washington could pour stale beer out of a boot if the instructions were printed on the heel. 
 These people are mad, as in, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore." As in "Network," the movie that gave us that line, these people, expecting nothing of consequence from any government, can only go to the window and scream. Or write to a convenient newspaper columnist.
Here is John M. of Queens, N.Y., and he is mad about car alarms. Inspired by the President's recent dog-and-pony show about volunteerism, he wants "to donate crowbars and wire cutters to open the hood of cars whose alarms blare outside my window at all hours."
Traffic studies, too, have him steaming. "In 1993," he writes, "Queens Borough President Claire Shulman earmarked $900,000 to study the huge number of traffic fatalities on Queens Boulevard. Another $200,000 was added to this fund. The study finally began this year -- sort of. I believe they are studying how to begin the study. Yes, that's it."
He wants to volunteer to drive "a bit more slowly and carefully, on constant alert for the elderly, children and disabled hastening to make their rent of $800 a month for an overcrowded basement in Flushing."
Here is a New York woman, Phyllis H., mad about "a bus ride from hell" -- presumably New York -- to Philadelphia:
"On the 9 A.M. bus, a mandatory movie! VCR screens, the sound track loud and clear through the P.A. speaker at each ear, Sergeant Bilko barking all the way! Ditto on the return trip."
This is just one example of the entire society's determination to entertain you whether you like it or not. She lists other examples:
"Was regaled with light hillbilly music while strapped into an M.R.I. machine at N.Y.U. Medical Center -- my preference not solicited."
"Telephone 'holds' connected to loud rock music. . . . Doctors' and clinic waiting rooms with canned music keyed to the lowest common denominator."
"A neighborhood supermarket's paging system hooked up to a local radio station, commercials and all, obliterating all memory of items I came in for."
Yes, Phyllis H., your dudgeon is perfectly justifiable. But why do you omit the irritating airport wait for an irritatingly behind-schedule flight, during which there is no escape from the hundreds of TV screens assaulting eye and ear in every recess of this aviation hellhole?
If politics were not dead, if government were about anything anymore, something would be done to stop this wanton and brutal entertainment with which inhuman agencies infest the world, presumably to distract us from the temptation to think.
For dudgeon at its highest, however, our award goes to Steve V. of Pomona, Taxifornia, as he styles, I assume, the Golden State.
This irate Taxifornian has been reading news stories about how Franklin D. Roosevelt statues should pose the late President in his new monument. He has some suggested poses of his own:
"F.D.R. with his hand stuck firmly in the taxpayer's pocket.
"F.D.R. wheeling back and forth over the corpse of American liberty.
"F.D.R. torching the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.
"F.D.R. prolonging the Depression by eight long agonizing years, thanks to his idiot economic notions.
"F.D.R. creating the bankrupting pyramid scheme laughingly called Social Security."
Out of consideration for readers who have not served in the military or have been avoiding the movies lately, I omit Steve V.'s suggestion about how to pose F.D.R. with Josef Stalin at Yalta.
"These poses would be quite appropriate since F.D.R. is one of two Presidents who ruined the Republic," he concludes. "(In case you are interested, the other traitor is Abe Lincoln.)"
Mr. V. identifies himself as "President of the League to Tear Down Any D--- Monument to D--- Politicians."

Government Issues Flat In a Light Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Government securities were relatively flat in light trading yesterday, as investors waited for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy arm to meet today to decide whether another interest rate increase to slow the economy was warranted.
The 30-year bond slipped 6/32, to a price of 96 11/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.92 percent, from 6.90 percent on Friday. 
 Maureen Mooney, an analyst with GovPx, a bond pricing service, said it was the slowest day this year, including half-day sessions that preceded holidays. The value of securities traded was only about $42.6 billion by late yesterday, below the previous low for the year, $44.8 billion on Feb. 10.
The dollar rebounded yesterday in currency trading, which gave the market some early support. A strong dollar makes investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors because of the potential profits from currency translations.
But rates at the weekly auction of Treasury bills yesterday were up from the previous week, as investor interest was low before the Fed meeting. Bills and other securities with short maturities would be most immediately affected by any Fed action.
The average rate for a three-month bill was 5.17 percent, up from 5.08 percent last week. And the bid-to- cover ratio, or the number of bids compared with the total amount of securities offered, was 4.32 to 1, well below the average of 6.14 to 1 over the last 12 auctions and the lowest since 3.88 on Dec. 23, 1996. For the six-month bill, the average rate was 5.35 percent, up from 5.30 percent a week earlier, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 4.21 to 1, below the 12-week average of 5.48 percent and the lowest since 3.82 to 1 on Oct. 15, 1996.
Market participants remained sharply divided in their expectations of the outcome of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the panel that determines monetary policy. Some analysts have pointed to signs of slowing in the economy since the Fed raised a key short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point in March, saying no further moves were needed to reduce inflationary pressure.
But Lou Brien, an analyst with Finacor Vendome Inc., a Chicago brokerage firm, said, "It is unlikely that a quarter-point move was enough to satisfy the Fed's pre-emptive urges." The low unemployment rate and strong economic growth of the first quarter remain strong arguments in favor of another rate increase, he added.
Likewise, Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he favored a further tightening, saying recent reports that showed subdued inflation were less important for their future implications than the employment figures, which have shown an increasingly tight labor market. Those numbers, as well as signs of strong consumer confidence, he said, "suggest that the Fed should be more opportunistic in doing another pre-emptive strike rather than take a pragmatic approach and wait through the July period for more data."
But Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said that the Fed was likely to hold rates steady.
"We now expect the Federal Reserve system to leave the Federal funds rate unchanged for two major reasons," he said. "First, we believe that the expected economic slowdown has become sufficiently evident in most of the latest business data. Second, the latest inflation data were mostly benign."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.693	97.295	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.35%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.58%	High Price	98.701	97.300	Discounted Rate	5.14%	5.34%	Coupon Yield	5.28%	5.57%	Low Price	98.693	97.290	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.36%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.59%	Accepted at low price	81%	10%	Total applied for	$32,507,830	$31,634,886	Accepted	$7,519,383	$7,509,676	Noncompetitive	$1,354,488	$1,146,151	

Both issues are dated May 22, 1997. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 21, 1997, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 20, 1997.

Scripps to Buy Harte-Hanks Media Assets

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The E. W. Scripps Company said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the newspaper and broadcasting properties of Harte-Hanks Communications Inc. for between $605 million and $775 million.
Harte-Hanks, which is based in San Antonio, said in March that it would sell its newspaper and broadcasting properties in order to focus on faster-growing direct marketing and free publication businesses. 
 "Newspapers have been the heritage of the company," Larry D. Franklin, the president and chief executive of Harte-Hanks, said in a telephone interview. "But strategically this will allow us to focus all our resources on these other businesses, which together account for about 75 percent of our revenues."
The deal involves six daily newspapers -- five of them in Texas -- along with the television station KENS-TV and the radio station KENS-AM, both in San Antonio.
"This is the kind of deal we've been looking for," William R. Burleigh, the chief executive of Scripps, said. "For an attractive price, we are going to greatly increase the geographic diversity of our newspaper division through the addition of five mid-sized markets in the vibrant Texas economy, plus one growth market in South Carolina."
The price Scripps will pay for the properties depends on the outcome of Federal legislation, introduced last month, to restrict the tax-free sale of assets under a so-called Morris Trust structure. A vote on that bill is expected later this year.
If a tax-free exchange of shares is allowed, Scripps will pay about $425 million in its stock and assume $200 million of Harte-Hanks debt. If Scripps assumes no debt, the amount of stock it will issue will increase to a maximum of $605 million.
If the Morris Trust structure is disallowed, Scripps will pay $775 million in cash for the properties.
Scripps said that regardless of how the assets are paid for, the deal is expected to dilute its 1998 earnings by about 5 percent.
The deal is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission. Scripps said it did not expect the deal to close until 1998.
Wall Street analysts said the deal made sense from both sides, even without the Morris Trust provision.
"Strategically, Harte-Hanks had a reason to sell and strategically, Scripps had a reason to buy," Lauren Fine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. "If Scripps were to get these assets at, say, $625 million, I would say it is a home run. At $775 million, it is not a bad deal, but not overwhelmingly positive."
On the New York Stock Exchange, Scripps's shares fell 12.5 cents, to $38.125. Harte-Hanks's stock price rose $1.125, to $30.125. News of the deal appeared in The Wall Street Journal yesterday.
The properties Scripps is acquiring "fit in their core competencies of television and newspapers," Michael Kupinski, an analyst at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, said.
"The San Antonio television station is in a great market, and the newspapers are in small but good growth markets with attractive operating margins," he said.
The five Texas papers Scripps is acquiring are The Corpus Christi Caller-Times, The Abilene Reporter-News, The Wichita Falls Times Record News, The San Angelo Standard-Times and The Plano Star Courier. Also included in the deal is The Anderson Independent-Mail in South Carolina. The San Antonio television station, KENS-TV, is a CBS affiliate.
Excluding its newspaper and broadcasting properties, last year Harte-Hanks had revenue of about $600 million, Mr. Franklin said.
The Cincinnati-based Scripps has television stations in nine markets and newspapers in 16 markets. The company also has an entertainment division that includes two television production companies, a licensing and syndication branch and a cable television network. Last year, it had revenue of $1.1 billion.

HEADLINE: The Road Warriors: Battling Over Rte. 92;
The Long and Winding History Of a 'Gateway to the Jersey Shore'

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The proposed Route 92 has been on the drawing boards in New Jersey for 60 years, its path changing so much through time that the original planners would barely recognize it. After all this time, it is a road plan that is still dodging those who would make it road kill.
Once grandly styled as the "gateway to the Jersey Shore," the road was proposed in 1938 as a 25-mile-plus freeway, running from just west of Princeton through Hightstown and east to Route 33 and the Atlantic Ocean. Now it is the state's last major uncompleted road project, a $300 million, 6.5-mile, high-speed, limited-access toll road that would connect Route 1 to the New Jersey Turnpike at Jamesburg. 
 The road has been supported by a dozen governors, although not always ardently; a succession of Princeton University presidents; more mayors over time than those who have opposed it; labor unions, and blue-chip corporations.
Like the inconstant moon, it has waxed and waned, never quite disappearing from planning documents and state legislation, steadily changing as it collided with great and small events, from World War II to demographic shifts to budget problems.
Now the road, which transportation officials say has the longest history of any road project in New Jersey, has run into another problem.
The Federal Environmental Protection Administration has raised questions about the need for the road and about its environmental impact. The agency will hold public hearings on June 10. Those follow other hearings last year by state environmental officials, several two years before that by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which is to build the road, and myriad hearings by the State Department of Transportation during previous years.
The new Federal questions have sent turnpike authority engineers scurrying to make changes that will cost $21 million. They have unearthed decades-old traffic plans and studies, and begun new studies to show why no other alternative will do to ease the traffic on Route 1.
In a time when most highway budgets focus on maintenance, proposed Route 92 is a road out of time, said Jeff Zupan, a transportation consultant with the Regional Plan Association. In the 50's, the three states of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey were building 62 miles of limited-access highways a year, 48 miles annually in the 60's and 25 miles a year in the 70's. By the 80's, there were only 7 miles of such roads built each year in the three-state region, and that figure is even lower now.
Citing sprawl, environmental effects and high costs, he said, "Projects like Route 92 now face the triple threat."
The Federal agency's intervention was a setback for the turnpike authority and the business, labor and government groups who formed an association called 92 Now, who view the Route 1 corridor as the economic engine of the region. But it elated opponents of the road, who see it as an unnecessary blot on some of the last farmland in the central part of the state.
Robert Wolfe, manager of the Princeton Forrestal Center, a research and office park campus on Route 1 that is home to 110 companies with 11,000 employees, said the Federal intervention threatened efforts to promote growth in the area and proved, "Big Brother is still staring over our shoulders. " If the road is built, the office park will have its own exit ramp.
"You would think that after it has been on area master plans for more than 50 years they would have said something before now," he said.
Cathy Dowgin, a member of a group called No-92, applauded the Federal agency's action. Now, says Mrs. Dowgin, whose house in South Brunswick looks out over farmland, she will see soybeans this summer and not the beginnings of a 300-foot-wide asphalt ribbon.
"This road is unnecessary and is a private driveway for employers like Princeton-Forrestal," she said. "There are so many alternatives that they could use that wouldn't affect the wetlands. People don't want this road. Big business does."
At $50 million a mile, many experts suggest that Route 92 will be a costly exercise that will increase, not ease, congestion. David Bernstein, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton University, said it would induce demand, bringing in more traffic. Dianne Brake, a planner with the Middlesex, Somerset and Mercer Regional Planning Council, which supports the road, noted that in many ways it was conceived to channel development. When it went unbuilt because of scarce financing and pockets of political opposition, development mushroomed anyway.
Richard W. Aughenbaugh, a former Mayor of Hightstown, said recent events are eerily similar to what happened to the roadway three decades ago, when it was mired in Federal Highway Administration demands for studies of countless alternatives.
"It was paralysis through analysis, and opposition groups sprung up like weeds," he said.
Long before there was a New Jersey Turnpike, there was a proposed Route 92. It first appeared on state maps as Route 31A in 1938. But in the war years, road work related to military efforts took precedence.
In the early 1950's, the focus was on construction of the New Jersey Turnpike. It was not until 1966 that the road seemed possible as Federal highway funds became available.
Shortly thereafter, it was redesignated Route 92, and opposition began to be heard from areas that had been pastures and fruit orchards a decade before. The road remained on state maps through the 1970's and 80's. By 1987, the Hightstown bypass was separated from the rest of proposed Route 92 in state plans. At the same time, on the western end near Princeton, the part of Route 92 that connected Routes 27 and 206 was dropped because of local opposition and environmental concerns.
The concept of Route 92 as the east-west road to the shore had been eclipsed by development along the Route 1 corridor. Spurred by the proximity of Princeton University, as well as Philadelphia and New York, the corridor was becoming a destination of its own. Office parks and subdivisions sprang up, turning rush hour on Route 1 into a nightmare.
By the early 90's, responsibility for building the road was transferred to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
Edward Gross, the executive director of the authority, said the agency decided that Route 92 should be a high-speed toll road that, unlike most state roads, would not "have a curb cut" at every development and business along the way. The authority immediately redrew the road to have it run from Exit 8A on the turnpike to the heart of Route 1 corridor around South Brunswick and Plainsboro.
Last year, the authority lopped off the western end of the road, from Route 1 to 27, and three months ago, it extended an elevated section of the roadway over Devil's Brook to reduce the impact on wetlands from 33 acres to 18.4 acres.
The turnpike authority's many changes in the road's route effectively made it a different road from the one that state officials had been considering. This was partly why the State Department of Environmental Protection sought the greater involvement of the Federal environmental agency. New Jersey is one of two states -- the other is Michigan -- that administers the regulations of the Federal wetlands protection program, and this was the first time the state had stepped aside in favor of Federal regulators.
Despite the turnpike authority's experience in building roads and its relative insulation from local politics, Mr. Gross conceded in a recent interview that building such a road in the 90's was not for "the faint of heart."
Mrs. Dowgin and other opponents are convinced that the Federal involvement is their last hope in stopping the road. They have picked up support from the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a regional transportation and mass transit advocacy group that questions the need for the road, and from South Brunswick officials like Mayor Deborah Johnson.
Mayor Johnson ridiculed the proposed toll road as one that will do little to ease traffic on local roads. With its 75-cent tolls for cars and $3.50 tolls for 18-wheelers, it was unlikely to alleviate traffic, she said.
By 2000, Turnpike Authority planners expect that 50,000 vehicles will travel at peak hours along a 20-mile stretch of Route 1 from New Brunswick to Princeton to the offices along Route 1. Another 20,500 cars and more than 2,100 trucks will thread their way daily along narrow, two-lane local roads to get from Route 1 to the turnpike.
Mr. Gross said Route 92 would take much of this traffic off local roads and remove 9,000 additional cars daily that now use Route 1 to get on the turnpike farther north in New Brunswick.
"This is the last reasonable opportunity probably ever to make such an east-west connection in the central New Jersey region," he said. "If we don't make it now we won't be able to in the future because it is an area of such high development potential."

1936
When first approved by the New Jersey State Legislature, it was designated State Road 31A and was to be an east-west connector for the central part of the state running from Route 206 to Hightstown and around to Route 33, which runs to the Jersey Shore.
 
MID-1980's
The road had become a federally financed freeway, designated Route 92. Part of the project was split off near Hightstown, and an extension running north to connect with the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 8A was added.
 
EARLY 1990's
Construction of the road was now the responsibility of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. To placate some residents and environmentalists who opposed the project, the western segment of the road, running between Route 27 and Route 206, was scrapped.
 
1996
To minimize opposition, the current plan eliminates another Western segment running between Route 1 and Route 27 and elevates the roadway as it goes over Devil's Brook to spare large wetlands areas.

HEADLINE: CHANGEOVER IN AFRICA: IN WASHINGTON;
U.S. Accepts Kabila, but Cautions on Democracy

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration moved quickly today to extend ties and recognition to the rebel alliance now ruling Zaire, pledging its help in building a democratic government and adopting the name the rebels have given the country, the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But the Administration also called on the country's new leader, Laurent Kabila, to begin taking steps toward a democratic government by holding elections soon and by including opposition figures in the provisional government he is expected to announce when he arrives in Kinshasa on Tuesday. 
 Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that international support -- and, implicitly, aid -- for the government depended on Mr. Kabila's willingness to establish democracy after more than three decades of autocratic rule under Mobutu Sese Seko.
"We are making it very clear that it is important for the new government to be inclusive, to be concerned and do a lot about democratic practices and human rights," Ms. Albright said at a news conference in Wilmington, Del.
The Administration's reactions today reflected both the hope and ambivalence that have greeted the fall of Mr. Mobutu and the rise of Mr. Kabila.
While officials here in Washington have expressed relief that the rebels captured Kinshasa, the capital, with relatively little bloodshed, they remain wary of Mr. Kabila's intentions, noting that the rebel leader has suggested that a transition to elections could last from one to five years. And despite repeated contacts as his rebellion swept over the country, Mr. Kabila has shown little interest in acceding to the United States' demands, even though he has told American officials he shares their views on democracy and a market economy. The officials said Mr. Kabila's announcement of a new government would be an early test of those promises.
Moving to shore up diplomatic contacts with the new leadership, the American Ambassador in Zaire, Daniel H. Simpson, met in Kinshasa today with two of Mr. Kabila's senior aides, Deo Bugera and Paul Kabungo. Mr. Simpson reiterated the United States' eagerness to see the rebels embrace political figures who long opposed Mr. Mobutu, including his longtime rival, Etienne Tshisekedi.
In what officials in Washington interpreted as a hopeful sign, Mr. Bugera, the secretary general of the rebel alliance, asked the Ambassador how to contact Mr. Tshisekedi. Mr. Simpson dialed his cellular phone and handed it to him, an Administration official said.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
A Recurring Theme Plays On: Auto Insurance

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:

The gubernatorial campaign of United States Representative Robert E. Andrews released its first television advertisement yesterday. The Democratic primary is on June 3.
 
 PRODUCER -- Axelrod and Associates. 

 ON THE SCREEN -- Scenes of highways, automobiles and Mr. Andrews in Congress.
 
 THE SCRIPT -- "In Christie Whitman's New Jersey, auto insurance rates are out of control. Seventeen hikes in four years. Highest in the nation. Who's fighting back? Rob Andrews. In Congress, Andrews took on the big polluters, pension raiders and the N.R.A. for working families. As governor, he'll go after the insurance companies. He'll end automatic rate hikes and force companies who want to sell health or home insurance to cut auto rates first. Let's fight back. Rob Andrews for governor."
 
 ACCURACY -- Although the advertisement states that the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has raised auto insurance rates 17 times, that is not correct. All of New Jersey's auto insurance companies have received automatic inflation rate increases of 3 to 5 percent in each of the last three years.
 
 In addition, Mrs. Whitman's insurance regulators approved 11 other rate increases for various companies that said the automatic increases were not enough. The Andrews campaign also counts three rate increases approved by Jim Florio when he was Governor, which took effect while Mrs. Whitman was in office, saying she could have reversed those.
 
 SCORECARD -- The advertisement focuses on drivers' anger over the high price of automobile insurance in the state, an issue that brought hundreds of protesters to Trenton last month. Mr. Andrews says he will end the automatic annual rate increases, which are a leading complaint of voters. Mrs. Whitman also says she will push through legislation to end those automatic rate increases.
 
 Mr. Andrews and his Democratic rivals have so far limited most of their attacks to Governor Whitman; this advertisement is typical of that.
 
 But Mr. Andrews also focuses on his work in Congress in an attempt to show that he has more experience in higher political office than his two other Democratic opponents, State Senator James E. McGreevey, who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, and Michael Murphy, a former Morris County prosecutor.

HEADLINE: Straining Toward an Agreement on Global Bribery Curb

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
With less than a week in which to negotiate a compromise, the United States and its major trading partners remain sharply divided over how to enact and enforce a long-sought global ban on commercial bribery.
The 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development hopes to announce an agreement at its annual meeting of finance ministers that opens in Paris on Monday that would subject companies in all member countries to the same restraints that United States business has faced since Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act two decades ago. 
 But while most O.E.C.D. members acknowledge the need for a ban on kickbacks, which in some countries are not only tolerated but actually remain tax deductible as business expenses, a rift has developed between the Clinton Administration and some of its key allies on the form the ban should take.
O.E.C.D. officials say that France and Germany, with varying degrees of support from Japan, Luxembourg and Spain, remain opposed to United States calls for all member countries to make a public commitment to pass national legislation within one year to criminalize such bribery. Instead, these five countries want the organization to negotiate a treaty banning bribery.
France and Germany are struggling with record unemployment and must take further austerity measures to prepare for the common European currency They want to make sure that all O.E.C.D. members place identical restrictions on their corporations at the same time, and say that the best way to do this is through a treaty that takes effect only when everyone has ratified it.
The United States and most other O.E.C.D. countries oppose that course, saying that a treaty would take years to negotiate and that finding language acceptable to 29 governments would tend to weaken the ban.
Participants do not expect the talks to collapse. But they say that continuing differences could delay or water down a final accord.
"It's hard to say whether we can bridge the gap in time," said Alan Larson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs and the chief United States negotiator at the O.E.C.D. talks. "But we are going to make another stab at it with a series of further meetings in Paris this week."
No action, of course, will completely stamp out bribery, which is rampant throughout much of the developing world and is also common in robust economies like South Korea and China. But backers of the United States' position say that national laws would have more teeth than an international accord.
"National legislation based on the agreed common principles is the fastest way to get action against corrupt business practices," said Nancy Zucker Boswell, the Washington representative of Transparency International, a private organization based in Berlin, Germany, that fights corruption in international business.
Under a compromise proposal suggested last week by Mark Pieth, the Swiss law professor who heads the O.E.C.D.'s bribery working group, members would commit to outlawing bribery through national legislation while also setting a tight deadline for agreement on a treaty. But Germany and France refused to promise to introduce national legislation to ban bribes if work on the treaty floundered.
While the United States is now the only O.E.C.D. country with a specific statue criminalizing bribery of foreign officials, the Netherlands and Norway have similar laws in the works. And Britain, Canada, Greece, Hungary, Sweden, Turkey and New Zealand all have statutes that could be used to restrict kickbacks in certain circumstances. Despite the paper commitment from all these countries to root out bribery, however, many European countries appear reluctant to move swiftly on the issue.
For example, eight European countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, continue to let their corporations deduct foreign bribes from their taxes, even though the O.E.C.D. countries agreed last year to end the practice.
To some extent, the gap between the American and European positions is rooted in cultural differences. When the United States Congress enacted its 1977 ban on bribing foreign officials, European countries generally derided the action as an example of American puritanism that was bound to put United States industry at a competitive disadvantage on world markets.
Since then, however, international sentiment has shifted toward the American position, as public disgust over bribery scandals has grown and as the spread of democracy across the globe has led to greater demands for public accountability.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Japan's View Of Rising Yen: Not to Worry

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, May 20

 BODY:
What is surprising, as the yen shoots up once more against the dollar, is that no one in Japan is screaming.
The yen has strengthened against the dollar by almost 10 percent in the last two weeks, moving from 126.70 yen to 115.60 yen to the dollar. 
 After stalling slightly in foreign-exchange trading in New York on Monday, the yen resumed its ascent today. The dollar fell as low as 113.95 yen in trading this morning. The surge in the yen is the strongest movement to roil the markets since the spring of 1995, when the yen hit a record high of 79.75 yen to the dollar.
At that time, the mightier yen -- which makes imports less expensive in terms of the Japanese currency and exports more expensive in terms of other currencies -- delighted a few Japanese consumers who relish American imported products. But it provoked fear throughout much of corporate Japan, which was worried about the competitiveness of the nation's exports.
There is none of that fear this time around, and in fact, the strengthening of the yen seems welcome all around. Exporters, for instance, may not mind the currency moves, in part because they have had previous experience adjusting to a much stronger yen and because they are still sated from a rush of profits amassed in the days of the cheapened yen.
"The Sonys and Toyotas of the world are so profitable from the windfall gains of the weak yen that any further depreciation to them is redundant," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Securities (Japan) Ltd.
Americans may have an image of all Japanese as exporters lobbying for a weak yen, but Japan's economy has in many ways become more international so that at certain levels, a weak yen hurts more than a stronger one.
Certainly, as the yen weakened, the increasing number of Japanese who have become fond of L. L. Bean clothes and Jeeps grew miffed with the yen at 125. And domestic companies that import products watched woefully as the weakening yen brought down their stock prices at the same time that stock prices of exporters soared.
The yen was bolstered this time almost solely by verbal intervention from ministry officials, notably Eisuke Sakakibara, the director of the Finance Ministry's International Bureau. Mr. Sakakibara, who has been called "Mr. Yen" because of both his penchant and his ability to move currency markets, told the Japanese Parliament on May 8 that for the last decade, the yen had appreciated on average by 23 yen a year, and that it could hit 103 yen to the dollar by next year.
The market then debated whether 103 was a target or just a projection.
Part of the reason for buying back the dollar, economists said, is that a level of about 100 yen to the dollar would not seem to be supported by economic conditions, such as differences in interest rates and the relative strengths of the economies.
Some economists say a rate of about 120 yen to the dollar would properly reflect the gap in long-term interest rates -- which widened to 4.6 percentage points this spring -- and other economic factors.
Now for some, the quest is to pin down the optimal or most equitable range for the economy as a whole, the point where the most people in this relatively egalitarian society are relatively happy. The Finance Ministry said that it did not use such an optimal range in policy making and that its economists refrained from researching such sensitive topics.
Kenji Yumoto, an economist with the Japan Research Institute, said the optimum range of the yen for Japan's manufacturing was 110 to 123 yen to the dollar. Using a complex econometric model, he discovered that when the yen depreciated beyond 123 to the dollar, the rising prices of imported materials used in domestic and export manufacturing took a toll on industry.
At 137 yen to the dollar, he added, industry is worse off than when the yen is at 110. Thus, the current level would still be advantageous for export manufacturing.
In fact, exporters surveyed earlier this year by the Economic Planning Agency said that they had cut costs and refined their operations to the point that profits were possible in some service industries even when the yen strengthened to 114 yen, extending to the 50-yen level for the fishery industry.
Thus, when the yen was weakening most recently the biggest injury was to importers, consumers who like foreign brands and domestic companies like supermarkets that deal in imported goods. Such companies usually hedge their exposure to currency risk, but protracted weakness has an effect sooner or later.
"Supermarkets usually buy futures contracts six months forward, and if the 125-yen range persisted, the unit price of imports would have gone up significantly," said Masaei Kasahara, an official at the Japan Chain Store Association. "As it was, it was going to begin showing up in sales prices six months from now."
"If the rate stayed at a weak level, it would have been a big blow to us," he added. "But the problem is that when the yen appreciated rapidly, the Government pressured us to do 'high yen' sales to bring in benefits to consumers. On the other hand, they don't tell us to raise our prices when the yen swings toward weakness."
In trading in New York on Monday, the dollar settled at 115.68 yen, up from 115.55 yen on Friday and the dollar's first gain since May 2. The dollar rose to 1.7083 marks from 1.6925 marks, while the pound rose to $1.6393 from $1.6367.

HEADLINE: CHANGEOVER IN AFRICA: IN CONGO;
In Congo, a New Era With Old Burdens

SERIES: FRAGILE GIANT: The Wasted Years

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: KISANGANI, Congo

 BODY:
Mauwa Funidi's face softens and glows for a few moments as she recalls happier days as a brilliant student, as a new college graduate, as a member of a prospering family in a nation seemingly about to enjoy an endless economic boom.
Then Mauwa snaps out of her reverie, and she is back in the squalid university library where she works, unpaid except in promises, trying to protect faded magazines from the wind and rain that blow through the broken windows. 
 She is back in a sordid reality where she survives by selling charcoal on the street, where her family lives in humiliation on the earnings of a cousin who sells her body at the Take-a-Peek bar.
A solid, self-confident woman of 45, one of the most successful women of her generation here in the faded city of Kisangani on the Congo River, Mauwa abruptly fought back tears.
"If my grandfather were alive today, he would be very sad," she said, choking, her eyes wet and luminous. "He would regret that his family turned out this way."
Now her country has a chance to remake itself with the rebellion of Laurent Kabila. But as Congo, known as Zaire during the three-decade dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, looks forward to a new phase, many families are also looking back at squandered decades and wasted lives.
Congo is a nation whose 47 million people in many ways live in grimmer conditions than when this was still a colony of Belgium four decades ago. In that respect, Congo is emblematic of a group of countries in Africa that have been disasters for their inhabitants.
In most of the world, change over the last two decades has been measured by the pace of progress -- here rapid, there slow, but at least progress. In sub-Saharan Africa, in contrast, per capita income actually fell most of the time since the late 1970's, including a 10 percent drop between the mid-1980's and the mid-1990's.
The tragedy is that this was so unnecessary. Congolese are among the poorest people in the world, with an average income of just $150 a year, but paradoxically Congo is about as rich in resources as any nation in the world, blessed with diamonds, gold, copper and other minerals scattered across vast tracts of untouched jungle. For all the hopelessness that Westerners often feel about Africa today, this was in the 1950's a bustling nation that brimmed with optimism.
To visit Congo and bounce along its horrific jungle roads today is to experience a twilight world where hints of past greatness and squandered potential peek through the trees: abandoned factories, gas stations, plantations and once-stately homes, their doors creaking on old hinges.
One glimpse of the past comes on the road to Stanley Falls, the rapids at Kisangani that were once a famous tourist attraction in central Africa. The road is on the outskirts of town but has been partly overtaken by the jungle and is now so overgrown that one has to leave one's car behind and finish the trip on foot.
Yet overhead are ancient street lamps, some with bulbs intact, stripped of wire but still a reminder to the hiker that this remote and overgrown path was once a well-tended avenue and a part of the modern world.
In the little village of Mambeau in eastern Congo, peasants live in mud houses on the fringe of the jungle and survive much as their forebears did 100 generations ago, without doctors, schools, stores, electricity or any equipment more sophisticated than a hoe. But beside the village is a startling reminder that it was not always so: rows of sturdy brick houses, empty, overgrown and seemingly haunted, where local villagers once lived much more modern lives as they worked on a vast rubber plantation.
Decades ago the plantation was abandoned, becoming an eerie ghost town overgrown with brush, and now the villagers farm only tiny plots to feed themselves, using a small fraction of the land that their parents worked. The vast majority of the plantation has been claimed once more by the jungle, a habitat for elephants and leopards.
The United Nations Development Program calculates that 11 African countries, including Congo, were richer per capita in 1960 than they are today. And the decline in Congo is not just economic, for the family unit is also tearing at the seams, and the majority of children cannot even graduate from elementary school. Many illiterate young people are members of a lost generation that will impose a burden on the country for half a century to come.
Everybody says that Funidi, grandfather of Mauwa and patriarch and namesake of the Funidi family, must be tossing in his grave.
 
Colonialism
Power Preserved For Europeans
Mr. Funidi was born about 1904 in what was then the Congo Free State, the personal property of King Leopold of Belgium. Almost all of the continent had just been seized by European countries in the "Scramble for Africa" of the 1880's, but what became the Belgian Congo was a special prize: a huge country, one-third the size of the United States, with diamonds, gold, copper, ivory and rubber that made King Leopold one of the world's richest men.
To be sure, Leopold's wealth was not extracted easily. Between five million and eight million Africans are said to have died in the rush to exploit the Congo's resources, and early in this century labor bosses were notorious for cutting off the right hands of boys who did not meet their mining quotas. To demonstrate their strictness, bosses showed off baskets of hands.
Belgium also imposed a web of harsh discrimination, excluding virtually all Congolese from any hope of higher education and banning Africans from traveling without a permit, from drinking anything stronger than beer, from becoming engineers or architects or lawyers.
Yet while focusing its efforts on plundering minerals and preserving power for Europeans, the Belgians also built a country that in many respects was impressive. Kisangani, then called Stanleyville, was typically majestic, with stately buildings, broad avenues, concerts by visiting European musicians and spectacular views of the Congo River. In a description that seems incredible today, the writer John Gunther wrote in 1955 that Kisangani was a place with the "liveliness and efficiency of a miniature Antwerp."
The country in those days had one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa, a flourishing arts community, widely published poets and a dynamic economy with a bulging trade surplus and $3 billion in exports each year -- compared with about $400 million now.
"The essence of the Belgian system is to buy off African discontent by giving economic opportunity, widespread social services and a comparatively high standard of living," Mr. Gunther wrote in 1955, and one of the beneficiaries was Mr. Funidi. A tall, lean man who moved to Kisangani about 1943 from the small village where he had been chief, Mr. Funidi got a Government job as a street cleaner. Before he died in 1959, he sent all his children to school and he was one of a large number of Congolese on the verge of joining an emerging middle class.
Mr. Funidi's children and grandchildren celebrated, of course, when Congo became independent in 1960. Throughout Africa, there was elation at the prospect that diamonds and minerals plundered by Europeans would finally enrich local people. The Funidi family already was moderately well off, with educated children and such conveniences as a bicycle, a hand-crank phonograph, a battery-powered radio and a sewing machine.
"Everybody was very happy with independence, because God seemed to have decreed it and everybody expected life to get better," recalled Emmanuel, one of Mr. Funidi's sons. "But it didn't take long to realize that things were getting worse."
At first the Funidi family was relieved when Col. Joseph Desire Mobutu seized power during a political crisis in 1965, for he seemed to represent order and stability. But then everything began to go wrong. The economy stagnated as foreigners were evicted, as rubber, coffee and banana plantations reverted to jungle, as corruption began to asphyxiate business.
Colonel Mobutu became one of the "big men" of Africa, rewarding himself with a fortune usually estimated at several billion dollars.
As the economy stalled, soaring inflation eroded the salaries of Government officials like the Funidis. The pauperization meant that everyone in Congo, not just the elite, had to make do and get by with what they had. Making do has been a way of life in Congo, and it has meant that Government officials take bribes, doctors ignore patients who do not offer gifts, factory workers steal parts from assembly lines, and soldiers wave guns to get "donations."
That is why Mauwa, who as a college graduate once reflected all the hopes and promise of her country, is now a charcoal peddler.
Smart and disciplined, always the brightest student in her class, in 1976 she became the first person in her family to graduate from college. She was given a job as a university librarian, a particularly exalted post in Congo because of the prestige of universities, which were set up only on the eve of independence with the mission of cultivating an educated elite to run the country.
"It will be dangerous to educate the Africans," the country's Belgian leader ruminated at the time. "It will be more dangerous not to educate them."
Yet for all the hopes and resources invested in these university graduates, Mauwa now says bitterly that it was a mistake to go to college. Her job as librarian is almost meaningless, she said, because all classes at the university have been suspended for lack of funds. The library has not had any money to buy books or subscribe to magazines since 1982.
Inflation has diminished her salary as a librarian from the equivalent of $300 a month when she was hired to $11 a month now, and in any case the wages are theoretical. The last pay was in November, after a gap of many months, and for the last half year Mauwa has survived only by buying charcoal in big bags and reselling it in little bags on the curb.
"It's humiliating, it really is," Mauwa said moodily, as she sat at an ancient table in the dilapidated library. "But it isn't quite so debasing when all of the other university graduates are out there beside me, peddling on the street, selling cakes, palm oil, salt, sugar, soap, lemonade."
 
Independence
Hopes Dissolved Into Poverty
The Funidis live in a two-room mud house with a tin roof, dirt floor and a hole in the wall that serves as a window to let in light, in a neighborhood that resembles a remote village more than a part of a major city. A flimsy outhouse made of palm fronds is in the back, and the "kitchen" is the muddy area in front where the children cook dinner each evening over a fire.
The Funidis have no electricity and no running water. Congo is said to have more undeveloped hydro-electric capacity than any country in the world, but most families in the villages never get closer to electricity than when lightning strikes.
The bulwark of the Funidi family today is not Mauwa, who is too poor to generate much respect in the rest of the family and who cannot contribute to family finances. Instead, the main provider is her cousin, Alphonsine, 25, with her earnings from prostitution at the Take-a-Peek Bar.
Alphonsine is a complex figure, an unmarried mother and earnest Catholic who goes to Mass each Sunday and takes Communion and believes God will help feed and clothe her loved ones. And while she waits for His help, she cares for her 7-year-old son, Patrick, and younger brother and sister by peddling herself.
Pauperization has produced countless people like Alphonsine, deeply troubled men and women who fear that what they are doing is wrong but feel that they have no alternative if they are to feed their loved ones. Alphonsine has been a prostitute for only two years; if she had started earlier she might have had the money to save her other child, a baby who died of malnutrition at about the time she began to work at the bar.
"Everybody in the family criticizes me, but I'm the only one putting food on the table," said Alphonsine, a sturdy, strong-boned woman with a steely face. "Mauwa always says she's afraid I'll get AIDS, but then how come she doesn't help? She just scolds, and complaining doesn't help!"
To be sure, Alphonsine knows that the Rev. Louis-Marie Butari at the neighborhood Catholic church would disapprove. And, indeed, Father Butari argues that Congo's long slide has produced a moral quagmire that is at least as wretched as its economy.
"When someone finds himself in economic difficulties, his conscience asks, 'What should I do?' " he said. "For example, if he hasn't been paid, he says, 'I see there are pens, papers, all these other things here, and I can take them and sell them to survive.'
"So the moral framework disintegrates, and people start to steal, and their children follow and do anything to survive, and girls find nothing to eat and so they sell their bodies. For me as a priest, if there is a problem in our society, if there is a crisis, it is because our moral bulwark has collapsed."
Mauwa has university housing, but Alphonsine lives in the family home with her sister Moza, 15 -- who the family is afraid will follow Alphonsine into prostitution -- and her brother Mariabwana, 17, as well as with little Patrick. The father of Patrick is never around, for he is "a bad man," Alphonsine said. "A crook."
Several years ago he ran away and abandoned his family -- a pattern increasingly common in cities across Africa. The vast migrations to the cities by people looking for work have dramatically reshaped the sociology of much of Africa, creating huge new urban slums and undermining the village values that used to dominate society. In Congo, for example, city-dwellers have soared from one-quarter of the population at independence to nearly one-half now.
Kinshasa, the capital, had 40,000 inhabitants in 1940 and is now a vast and unplanned agglomeration of slums housing five million people.
Alphonsine's 27-year-old brother, Londeke, is also a migrant, but he moved from the city to the jungle. A broad-shouldered man with a solemn, handsome face, he searched for a job in Kisangani so that he could be with his family, but the only job he found was mining for diamonds in the jungle a day's journey north of Kisangani.
"I came here because I had nothing at all," Londeke said softly, as dusk fell on his tiny mud house in the mining camp, a three-and-a-half hour hike through the jungle from the nearest dirt road. Londeke sat on a stool, slapping away mosquitoes and flies, his face illuminated by a small fire.
Digging for diamonds is back-breaking toil in a malaria zone, and some of the miners die from cave-ins or disease. Yet countless young men dig for gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt, uranium and other minerals in Congo.
Many miners, like Londeke, work for themselves, although they must give part of what they find to the mine owner. If they are unlucky and do not find diamonds, they will simply fall deeper into debt. Moreover, most of the mines are like this one, in remote parts of the jungle, and so the men spend their time at the bottom of muddy pits, far from their loved ones, heaving a shovel and hoping for a sparkle that will transform their finances.
"I've spent the last two months digging a hole, and I just got to the point where we reached the sand that may contain diamonds," Londeke said, trying to control the excitement in his voice. "Now I'll wash the sand in the creek and see if there are any diamonds."
If he finds diamonds, he said, he will buy merchandise and go into business as a trader, perhaps bringing goods from Kisangani to sell at the mining camp. That way he would be able to spend at least some time with his wife, Marie, in Kisangani, to ease the burden of separation and the strains that have driven them apart.
"We've got tensions in our relationship, of course," Londeke acknowledged, wincing slightly. "Since I've been away this time, Marie has sent three letters asking me to come back. But I wrote back saying, 'how can I come back when I haven't found anything yet?' "
Back in Kisangani, Marie, a vivacious woman with a quick laugh that rings like a bell, grips her son and suddenly becomes edgy as she confides her worries about her husband.
"All the miners there have girlfriends," Marie said with a touch of sadness. "I can't accept it, and there's probably lots of AIDS there. But there's nothing I can do."
 
The Future
Illiteracy Imperils Next Generation
Perhaps in no area has Congo mortgaged its future so dangerously as in education. Once it was among the best-educated of African countries -- in terms of primary education, not universities -- but now Alphonsine's son, Patrick, is typical. He attended only three months of school last year, in first grade, and he is on the verge of dropping out this year.
The problem is school fees, which mostly run $1 to $7 a month per pupil. The Government stopped sending money to schools years ago, so teachers decided that instead of closing the schools down they would charge fees.
"When the students don't pay fees, we don't get paid," Bernard Mwania, the principal of the local school, explained as he sat in his tiny, dark office. The school, built in the colonial period by the Belgians, must have been pretty once, but now its lawns are ripped apart by open sewers and the windows have all been broken and boarded over with plywood so that classrooms are dim and Dickensian.
There seems to have been a precipitous drop in school attendance in the last few years as more families lost the wherewithal to pay the tuition, and now fewer than one-third of elementary school age children attend school, according to a variety of teachers and principals interviewed in various towns and villages. That is about the same proportion that attended school in the early 1950's under Belgian rule.
Now that Kisangani has been taken over by the rebels, the Funidis are cautiously optimistic that corruption will diminish, that school fees will be eliminated, that life will get better.
Another reason for optimism is that other African countries that have endured wrenching national traumas -- like Uganda and Eritrea -- have emerged, however scarred, with a greater sense of nationhood and purpose, and a much greater ability to forge a modern economy, government and society. Indeed, it is the scarred countries that provide some of the continent's greatest success stories, and certainly the rebel-held areas of Congo seem far less corrupt and much better managed than they were under Mr. Mobutu.
But the optimism is tempered by an awareness that the last time there was such hope for change -- independence -- the exhilaration quickly collapsed into a downward spiral of war, chaos and poverty. The Congolese poet Mukala Kadima-Nzuji wrote bitterly of his homeland in those years:
Gorged with blood, with blood, with blood
From the thousands of innocent souls
Lying silently, motionless, without breath
On clods of scorched earth
Even with peace at hand, it is clear that the Funidi family is much less prepared to prosper now than it was in the 1950's.
Then all the children went through elementary school at least; now all the children get little or no education and are illiterate. Then a college education, however rare, seemed a ticket to run the country; now it is seen as just a detour on the way to becoming a charcoal hawker.
"Dad would be very unhappy with the way things have turned out," Londeke said wistfully as he gazed at the embers of his fire at the mining camp. "When he was alive, conditions were better. We had food, we had clothing, and we could afford breakfast. Now we have nothing."
 
Fragile Giant
 
 Later articles will examine other aspects of Congo's troubled legacy and prospects for its future.

HEADLINE: Funds for the Workfare Transition

 BODY:
New York City and other local governments will be required, under the new Federal welfare law, to find work for tens of thousands of welfare recipients over the next several years, a task no state has ever attempted let alone achieved. Yet New York's Governor, George Pataki, wants to deny local officials the money they need to get the task accomplished. An easy answer to a difficult problem is at hand. Mr. Pataki just needs to grab it.
Our colleague Elizabeth Kolbert cut to the heart of the issue yesterday, pointing out that Governor Pataki wants to take $354 million of a $730 million windfall available for welfare and instead dole it out for other budget purposes. That would waste a historic opportunity to reform, not just reduce, the welfare program. Yet instead of grappling with this momentous social change, the parties in Albany have been frittering away their energies on other issues as the July 1 deadline for instituting the new law approaches. 
 Federal law requires states to put 25 percent of their welfare recipients into work activities immediately, rising to 50 percent by 2002. Governor Pataki proposes to turn the task over to the counties, asking them to find job slots or create "workfare," whereby recipients clean parks or do other unskilled labor in exchange for assistance. The Governor's plan also involves eliminating cash assistance for parents after five years and immediately for able-bodied childless adults, instead giving both groups vouchers for food, clothing and shelter.
The Governor's programs will be hugely expensive to create and administer. Welfare recipients will require intensive training, counseling and monitoring to fulfill their work assignments. Voucher programs require costly individual assessments of clothing and other needs. Parents of young children will need day care, a costly component of welfare-to-work programs.
Social service commissioners from New York City and surrounding counties -- all from Republican administrations -- have told the Governor his budget would provide too little money for day care, vouchers and emergency benefits and thereby threatened to create homelessness. The commissioners are no doubt correct, and the consequences could be severe. If the Governor skimps on payments to the counties, they will have too little money to create workfare slots for everyone who qualifies. Their only realistic escape will be to change eligibility standards so that fewer families qualify for help. An increase in homeless families will be the most visible reflection of the vicious financial bind.
Fortunately, there is a way out. State coffers are flush with extra tax money from a robust economy. Even better, a quirk in the Federal welfare law will pump an extra $730 million into New York State this year. Mr. Pataki wants to take $222 million of this windfall for general state programs -- which those programs do not need given the state's healthy revenue forecasts. He also unwisely proposes to provide $132 million of budget relief to counties, a transfer of funds that is unrelated to the size of their welfare burdens.
Instead he should turn the whole of that $730 million over to counties to create their voucher, workfare, day-care and other poverty programs. Only if the counties achieve their workfare targets for less should the Governor use the Federal largess for other priorities.

HEADLINE: CLINTON LAUNCHES EFFORT TO RENEW CHINA TRADE TIES

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
President Clinton began a campaign today to win Congressional renewal of normal trading status for China, in an annual exercise that threatens to be more contentious than ever this year.
In an announcement before a group of business executives, Mr. Clinton said that trade ties are "the best way to bring China into the family of nations and to secure our interests and our ideals." 
 Mr. Clinton is facing growing anti-China sentiment on both the right and the left in Congress, with an unlikely combination of opponents lining up against renewing China's trade privileges. The coalition ranges from labor, which is concerned about economics and human rights issues, to the Christian right, which is opposing China on human rights grounds as well.
Once Mr. Clinton formally sends his decision to grant China what is known as "most-favored-nation status," the House and Senate have 90 days in which they can try to overturn his recommendation.
Originally the White House had hoped that this year relations with China could be put on a firmer footing. Mr. Clinton is expected to hold a summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin of China later this year, and the Administration is negotiating with China over entry into the World Trade Organization.
Admitting that it would not have the votes, the White House quietly shelved any hope that it might be able to win permanent, instead of annual, approval of normal trade ties for China this year.
The only debate inside the Administration, officials said, was over how much the President should personally put himself on the line to support China in the face of the campaign finance controversy.
The President won an important ally of sorts today in Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House. Although Mr. Gingrich assailed Mr. Clinton as being "virtually absent without leadership on issues of religious tolerance, human rights, and democratic freedoms," he said he would support normal trade relations with China.
Other irritants in this year's debate are China's transfer of missiles to Iran and its huge trade surplus with the United States. Congress is also swayed this year by increasing concerns over Hong Kong. The assumption in Washington is that the handover of the British colony to China will go smoothly. If it doesn't, as one senior Administration official conceded this afternoon, "this whole effort sinks in the Pacific."
The White House today sought to address concerns about Hong Kong's transition by noting that Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patton, and Hong Kong's most prominent advocates of democracy , like Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, support extension of China's trade status.
"Even those people in Hong Kong that have been most passionately identified with the cause of freedom and human rights and have been most in conflict with the Chinese have argued that we have to maintain an open trading relationship with them so we can continue to work with them," Mr. Clinton said.
Other Administration officials argued that Hong Kong is the gateway of trade between the United States and China and that to cut off China's trade status at this moment would deal a blow to Hong Kong precisely at this crucial moment of transition.
While last year's announcement about China's trade status was made in a major speech on Asia policy, this year the President made the announcement at the business leaders' event, which was held in the Old Executive Office Building.
Mr. Clinton said that stopping normal trade relations would "cut off our contact with the Chinese people and undermine our influence with the Chinese Government."
Mr. Clinton originally came into office accusing President Bush of "coddling dictators," but in the spring of 1994, under pressure from American business groups, Mr. Clinton backed down from his early attempt to link China's most-favored-nation status to significant progress in human rights. Since then Mr. Clinton has called for renewal of China's trade status annually.
Mr. Clinton has argued that economic engagement is the best way to get China to improve its treatment of dissidents. But his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, had to concede at a White House briefing today that "we cannot say that human rights conditions in China are better today than they were a year ago."
But Mr. Berger argued that commercial cooperation and openness to the world would eventually change the Beijing Government's behavior.
Yet the Administration's admissions that little has changed in human rights encouraged those who argue that Mr. Clinton's attempt to use commerce in the service of human rights has failed.
"They have to change the subject from human rights because they have nothing to point to," said Gary L. Bauer, the president of the Family Research Council, which is pressing its traditional Republican allies to abandon the party's longstanding support for renewing China's ordinary trading rights.
"It's a corrosive debate," Mr. Berger said in an interview in his office this afternoon. "Everyone in Congress knows that cutting off trade relations is far too blunt an instrument. Instead of debating how to influence China, how to shape the direction, we wind up debating a piece of the relationship. It doesn't work."
Mr. Clinton said today that "the United States has a huge stake in the continued emergence of China in a way that is open economically and stable politically. Of course we hope that it will come to respect human rights more and the rule of law more."
But Human Rights Watch/Asia immediately issued a statement asking how the Administration planned to exert influence on China on human rights, noting that the Administration's efforts to condemn China's human-rights practices in Geneva last month had failed. "What other measures is the Administration willing to use?" asked Mike Jendrzejcyk, the group's Washington director. "Or has it abandoned human rights altogether?"
Despite the growing anti-China sentiment in Congress, Administration officials and opponents of most-favored-nation trade status say that Mr. Clinton would ultimately have the votes to prevail on the issue.
The United States has economic incentives to continue the trade relationship. United States officials say that 170,000 American jobs are dependent on exports to China and that ending normal trade status would cost consumers $600 million annually in higher prices on certain consumer goods.
In fact, at this point the United States and China are so economically intertwined that even many members of the growing anti-China lobby in Congress concede that denying trade privileges to China would be tantamount to breaking off political relations with the world's most populous nation.
As the debate plays out over the next months, the only question, officials say, is whether the President will be forced into a bruising veto fight to preserve most-favored-nation status. That would occur if the House and Senate pass a joint resolution turning down normal trade status. Both chambers would then have to muster two-thirds votes to override the President's veto.
The last time there was such a confrontation over China was in 1992, a Presidential camapign year, when Congress tried to stop most-favored nation status but failed to override Mr. Bush's veto.

HEADLINE: Not All Landlords Were Hurt by Rent Control

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The error in your logic ("A Way to Compromise on Rents," editorial, May 13) is the assertion that New York City landlords have been "deprived . . . of a fair return" on their investment by the 50-year-old program of rent regulation. 
 The largest element of an apartment owner's costs is the price paid, including debt service and the assumed return on investment. Only those who owned apartment buildings when rent regulation was first imposed can claim to have been injured by it. Those who bought with knowledge of it should have paid a price informed by the reality of rent regulation.
Yet building owners have continued to pay prices justified only by speculation upon the end of a regulatory program of which they have had 50 years' notice.
It is not the duty of government to bail them out of their folly by ending a program that has seemed wise to generations of legislators and on which so many depend. To do so would grant a windfall to speculators and punish those who have relied upon continuity and stability.
If expectations of deregulation were lowered and apartment buildings sold for lower prices, owners could enjoy a fair return on their investment within the context of the long-established legal and economic reality of rent regulation.

HEADLINE: Guide to Going Shopping Without the Dropping

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
When it comes to shopping, the two women are as different as Barneys and Bolton's. One sees it as the ultimate bonding experience, while the other shops only when she really needs something. One has been known to call a $900 shearling coat a bargain, while the other's idea of a good buy is a $12 pair of flats.
But Susan B. Dollinger and Jane R. Lockshin, good friends, fellow businesswomen and now co-authors of "The New York Edge: 1997 Savvy Shoppers' Guide," both get their shopping tips from the same source. 
 "When you want to buy something that you aren't used to buying, you call your friends," Ms. Lockshin said.
"I'm giving a dinner party. Who will cater it? I'm moving into a new apartment, and I want custom shelves made. Where do I go? It's the kind of thing we do all the time. We just institutionalized it."
Their book, a kind of Zagat guide to the potentially overwhelming retail landscape of New York City, was the editorial equivalent of a barn-raising. The authors published it themselves after soliciting the insights, passions, gripes and admonitions of about 300 women (and a few men) -- mostly friends, colleagues and friends of friends.
Now in its second printing, the guide covers nearly 2,000 stores and service providers, offering advice on where to find everything from orchids to rare coins and everyone from pearl restringers to dog walkers.
It also offers a window onto a group of working women who may say they weren't born to shop but who seem to bring the same intensity to the pursuit of quality and value that they do to their careers.
Ms. Dollinger, 51, is a vice president for Citicorp and a resident of South Salem, N.Y. Ms. Lockshin, 52, lives in Germantown, Md., where she owns a company that develops data bases, Custom Databanks. The two met in New York City in the early 1970's when they were working as economists. In 1994, Ms. Lockshin, who travels to New York frequently, had the idea to create a data base that would be a guide to New York stores, and she enlisted Ms. Dollinger, a serious shopper.
Brainstorming with about 25 friends, the two compiled a list of about 1,000 stores and businesses representing a broad range of categories: books, linens, art, bridal wear and light fixtures, to name a few. In the meantime, Ms. Dollinger, with the help of paid researchers recruited from local colleges, pored over back copies of fashion magazines and newspapers to come up with 1,000 more retailers.
The partners printed up surveys with the establishments' names next to spaces for comments and ratings on quality, style, service and value. A rating of 1 meant "so-so," while a 5 indicated "excellent." And they asked the volunteers, mostly members of the Financial Women's Association of New York, to evaluate stores visited in the last year.
"I am a size 6 because I work at it, and just as I want every calorie to be worth it, I want my shopping to be worth it," said one respondent, Clarin Schwartz, a vice president at ASA, a benefits consulting firm and AT&T subsidiary in Somerset, N.J. "We're all financial women and we don't have a whole lot of time to shop. But when we do shop, we want to get good value."
For the most part, the stores in the book have at least one positive rating because the authors saw no point in publicizing retailers that were disliked across the board. Some stores were not critiqued at all, but if the merchandise was considered special or unusual, the authors included them, giving straight descriptions.
Occasionally, the book skewers a store with a pointed comment. For instance, VSF, an upscale florist in the West Village, was praised for its "English country garden look" but slapped for being "very snooty." An owner, Jack Follmer, who was unaware of the guide, expressed shock at the criticism. "We are definitely high-end and pretty up on our flowers, but I never thought we were snooty," he said.
The result of all the surveying was a computer disk, with jazzy cross-referencing capabilities. But what the authors really wanted, they decided, was a book. After fruitless inquiries at publishing houses, the women decided to be their own publishers.
Ms. Dollinger bought "The Self-Publishing Manual: How to Write, Print and Sell Your Own Book" (Para Publishing, 1995), and she walked up to managers at Barnes & Noble stores with a simple question: Who sells you your books? One name kept coming up -- Koen Book Distributors, and she picked up the phone.
"It sounded like a good idea," said Sheila Kowalsky, a buyer for Koen, a regional wholesaler in Moorestown, N.J. "I told her that as long as it was viable -- had a spine, a bar code and was produced well -- I'd be willing to consider it."
As in most do-it-yourself ventures, the authors relied on relatives. Ms. Dollinger's 86-year-old mother, Mary Dollinger, surveyed 100 stores, including all the estate jewelers. ("It's kept me out of mischief," she said.) Her husband, Allan Ermann, a high school English teacher, edited copy, while her daughter, Lynn, a freelance writer, helped with publicity. Ms. Lockshin's husband, Michael, a rheumatologist, scanned the galleys for imperfections.
With 38,000 stores in New York City, the book (soft cover, $14.95) is by no means comprehensive. But while it is skewed to the more expensive end of the retail spectrum, the guide does offer useful signposts in a city where there are districts for buttons, cameras and plants.
"There have to be holes," Ms. Lockshin said. "The book is biased by the age and income of the people who did the surveys. It's more Bottega Veneta than Kmart, but that doesn't exclude discounters, because no one likes to pay retail."
Some contributors took pleasure in sharing their sources for bargains, both high and low. Ann B. Diamond, author of "Fear of Finance: The Women's Money Workbook for Achieving Financial Self-Confidence" (Harper Business, 1994), singled out Century 21 for its deals on women's and children's clothes but also put in a word for J. S. Suarez, a Park Avenue handbag shop whose goods, though discounted, start at $150.
Among the surveyors were a few nonshoppers, busy professionals like Mary C. Farrell, a managing director at PaineWebber. "I work full-time and have two teen-agers, and I want to make shopping as effortless as possible," Ms. Farrell said. "I don't want to personally go around to five stores to find what I want. With the book, I feel like someone else has invested that time for me."
So far, about 3,500 copies of the book have sold at Barnes & Noble and Borders Books & Music, as well as at smaller book stores. "It is selling very steadily," said Eugenia Pakalik, the Northeast regional buyer for Barnes & Noble. "It keeps chugging along."
"It's a competitive field," Ms. Pakalik said of the other retail shopping guides on New York City. "But their book has an actual rating system. It's not just telling you where you can buy a leather saddle in New York. It's telling you that there are a couple of places, and this is the one with the best customer service, which is a unique element."
Zagat, the publisher of the popular restaurant surveys, does have a shopping guide called "New York City Marketplace Survey," but it focuses exclusively on food and entertaining.
The two authors are now at work on a second edition, which they plan to publish in the fall.
They intend to expand the survey to include 400 to 500 additional stores and services, while tripling the number of respondents. And it is a concept they believe will travel to other cities.
"We're looking at Washington and L.A.," Ms. Lockshin said.
But, in perhaps the first hint of corporate infighting, Ms. Dollinger said dismissively, "We're doing Europe."

HEADLINE: How Much Is Nature Worth? For You, $33 Trillion

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
HOW much is nature worth?
Some say the question is unanswerable, that it is impossible to calculate a dollar value for the natural world. Others say the question should not even be asked; that nature, like human life, is priceless and should not be devalued as if it were a mere commodity. 
 But economists and ecologists are searching for the answer anyway. Nature performs valuable, practical, measurable functions, they say; without them the human economy could not exist, and in many cases people could not duplicate them as cheaply -- or at all. And they say it is time that the value of these functions is considered when economic decisions are made.
One notable example of nature's economic value that they cite is the purification of New York City's water supply by microorganisms as the water percolates through the soil of the Catskills. The city plans to spend $660 million to preserve that watershed in good health; the alternative, a water treatment plant, would have cost $4 billion to build.
Nature performs a long list of other economic services as well. Flood control, soil formation, pollination, food and timber production, provision of the raw material for new medicines, recreational opportunities and the maintenance of a favorable climate are among them.
But like a well that is taken for granted until it runs dry, these ecosystem services, as ecologists call them, have long been overlooked until they either no longer work or are gone -- as, for instance, when the widespread destruction of Midwestern wetlands meant they could no longer perform their natural function of sponging up water from disastrous floods like those of recent years.
And to the extent ecosystem services are noticed at all, people have tended to regard them as free.
Now, as human activity gradually uses up or destroys this natural capital and eats away at the natural systems that provide many of the services, many experts are insisting that the worth of ecosystem services must be calculated and heeded.
The results of the latest and in some ways the most ambitious effort to place a dollar value on natural capital and services were announced last week.
Thirteen ecologists, economists and geographers, in a report in the journal Nature, estimated the present global value of 17 ecosystem services at $16 trillion to $54 trillion a year, with a likely figure of at least $33 trillion. Most of this, they said, lies outside formal markets and is therefore not reflected in market prices, the customary gauge of economic value. Their estimate, they said, compares with $18 trillion for the gross national product of the world, which is all the goods and services produced by people each year.
The researchers, who based their conclusion on other published studies and their own calculations, freely point out that their estimate is a rough approximation, a first step that is mainly intended to determine whether ecosystem services amount to "big potatoes or small potatoes," in the words of Dr. Robert Costanza, an ecological economist at the University of Maryland who headed the study. "We come away from this thinking this is a minimum estimate," Dr. Costanza said.
Virtually everyone agrees that without the natural world, the human economy and indeed human life could not exist. In this sense, the value of nature is infinite, immeasurable. To some conservationists, this is all that needs to be said. "Common sense and what little we have left of the wisdom of our ancestors tells us that if we ruin the earth, we will suffer grievously," said Dr. David Ehrenfeld, a conservation biologist at Rutgers University. He said he accepted the results of the Costanza study, which he regards as conservative, but added: "I am afraid that I don't see much hope for a civilization so stupid that it demands a quantitative estimate of the value of its own umbilical cord."
Dr. Ehrenfeld and some other conservationists believe that moral arguments for saving nature are more persuasive than economic ones. But in the view of Dr. Costanza and others, moral and economic arguments should be pursued in parallel.
People make economic choices involving nature all the time, according to this view, but they do so without taking all the costs into account. For example, the dollar value of a wetland's flood-protection and water cleansing abilities has not traditionally been considered when it is lost to a shopping center. The result is a creeping depletion of natural wealth.
If such costs were reflected in day-to-day transactions, these theorists say, society would pay more attention to what is lost when land is "developed."
"We can't wait until we've disrupted the planet's life-support system beyond repair," said Dr. Gretchen C. Daily, a conservation biologist at Stanford University. She is the editor of a recent collection of papers on the subject, "Nature's Services; Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems," published as a book by Island Press. Once gone, she noted, many of these ecological assets would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace; it can take thousands of years to recharge depleted aquifers or replenish topsoil.
Until now, fledgling efforts at what is called "green accounting" have been pursued largely at the national level. In a widely applauded attempt of this kind, Dr. Robert Repetto, senior economist at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research organization, has analyzed the economies of Indonesia and Costa Rica. In Indonesia, he and colleagues calculated that losses from soil erosion reduced the net value of crops by about 40 percent and that the loss of value from deforestation was four times as high as the value of the timber extracted. They also concluded that depletion of Costa Rica's soils, forests and fisheries resulted in a 25 percent to 30 percent reduction in potential economic growth.
A nascent effort to introduce a measure of natural-resource accounting into the United States' official calculation of economic worth was made in 1993, but it is on hold pending a Congressionally ordered study of the soundness of the approach by the National Academy of Sciences. A report is due this year.
The new Costanza study is not really an exercise in green accounting, and some experts question its practical usefulness while others express skepticism about its basic finding.
"There's no way of knowing how good this number is," Dr. Repetto said of the study's estimate of $33 trillion for the global value of ecosystem services. "They've made some heroic assumptions. I suppose it's useful for rhetorical purposes." But the number, he said, is less important than the fundamental point made by the study "that ecosystem services are important; I don't think reasonable people would deny that."
Other experts see more utility in the analysis. The study has succeeded in providing "a conservative estimate of what the environment does for us," said Dr. Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee who wrote a commentary on the Costanza study in Nature. "So often," he said, "people concerned with protecting the environment go up against these very highly detailed economic analyses and feel they don't have anything in kind with which to respond." In the tables of specific ecosystem services that accompany the study, he said, "what Costanza et al. has done is provide a checklist" that national and local policy makers can use in attempting to make a rough gauge of the economic worth of their natural assets.
One table, for instance, lists specific ecosystem services, and their supposed value, for 11 biomes, or types of natural areas. These include the open ocean, estuaries, seagrass and algae beds, coral reefs, continental shelves, tropical forests, temperate forests, grasslands and rangelands, tidal marshes and mangroves, wetlands and flood plains and lakes and rivers.
The next step, Dr. Costanza says, is to delineate more clearly the explicit linkages between particular local ecosystems and local economies. For example, how much of the value of the Louisiana shrimp catch is attributable to the wetlands in which the shrimp reproduce and grow? But since wetlands perform other services as well, the wetlands' value as a shrimp nursery would be only a minimum indication of their overall value.
The same applies, for example, to the Catskill watershed, which serves other economic functions besides providing and cleaning New York City's water -- attracting tourists, for instance. "Nobody thinks the Catskills are worth only $4 billion," Dr. Daily said, referring to the cost of replacing the Catskills' water-cleansing function.
Assuming the value of ecosystem services could eventually be established, how might economic policies be changed? For openers, Dr. Daily and others say, government subsidies that distort the value of natural resources -- in fisheries and logging, for example -- should be abolished. Also, tax incentives might be given to landowners to protect the long-term assets represented by natural capital rather than using them for short-term gain.
Some experts advocate applying traditional economic arrangements to ecosystem services. For instance, Dr. Graciela Chichilnisky and Dr. Geoffrey Heal, economists at Columbia University, have proposed selling investment shares in a given ecosystem. Using the Catskill watershed as an illustration, they say that the capital thus raised would pay for preserving the watershed. Returns to investors would come either from a share of the costs saved by not having to build a treatment plant or, if the investment were private, by actually selling ecosystem services. In the case of a watershed, clean water would be sold.
But, says Dr. Daily, "the first thing is getting the prices right."

HEADLINE: How Much Is Nature Worth? For You, $33 Trillion

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
HOW much is nature worth?
Some say the question is unanswerable, that it is impossible to calculate a dollar value for the natural world. Others say the question should not even be asked; that nature, like human life, is priceless and should not be devalued as if it were a mere commodity. 
 But economists and ecologists are searching for the answer anyway. Nature performs valuable, practical, measurable functions, they say; without them the human economy could not exist, and in many cases people could not duplicate them as cheaply -- or at all. And they say it is time that the value of these functions is considered when economic decisions are made.
One notable example of nature's economic value that they cite is the purification of New York City's water supply by microorganisms as the water percolates through the soil of the Catskills. The city plans to spend $660 million to preserve that watershed in good health; the alternative, a water treatment plant, would have cost $4 billion to build.
Nature performs a long list of other economic services as well. Flood control, soil formation, pollination, food and timber production, provision of the raw material for new medicines, recreational opportunities and the maintenance of a favorable climate are among them.
But like a well that is taken for granted until it runs dry, these ecosystem services, as ecologists call them, have long been overlooked until they either no longer work or are gone -- as, for instance, when the widespread destruction of Midwestern wetlands meant they could no longer perform their natural function of sponging up water from disastrous floods like those of recent years.
And to the extent ecosystem services are noticed at all, people have tended to regard them as free.
Now, as human activity gradually uses up or destroys this natural capital and eats away at the natural systems that provide many of the services, many experts are insisting that the worth of ecosystem services must be calculated and heeded.
The results of the latest and in some ways the most ambitious effort to place a dollar value on natural capital and services were announced last week.
Thirteen ecologists, economists and geographers, in a report in the journal Nature, estimated the present global value of 17 ecosystem services at $16 trillion to $54 trillion a year, with a likely figure of at least $33 trillion. Most of this, they said, lies outside formal markets and is therefore not reflected in market prices, the customary gauge of economic value. Their estimate, they said, compares with $18 trillion for the gross national product of the world, which is all the goods and services produced by people each year.
The researchers, who based their conclusion on other published studies and their own calculations, freely point out that their estimate is a rough approximation, a first step that is mainly intended to determine whether ecosystem services amount to "big potatoes or small potatoes," in the words of Dr. Robert Costanza, an ecological economist at the University of Maryland who headed the study. "We come away from this thinking this is a minimum estimate," Dr. Costanza said.
Virtually everyone agrees that without the natural world, the human economy and indeed human life could not exist. In this sense, the value of nature is infinite, immeasurable. To some conservationists, this is all that needs to be said. "Common sense and what little we have left of the wisdom of our ancestors tells us that if we ruin the earth, we will suffer grievously," said Dr. David Ehrenfeld, a conservation biologist at Rutgers University. He said he accepted the results of the Costanza study, which he regards as conservative, but added: "I am afraid that I don't see much hope for a civilization so stupid that it demands a quantitative estimate of the value of its own umbilical cord."
Dr. Ehrenfeld and some other conservationists believe that moral arguments for saving nature are more persuasive than economic ones. But in the view of Dr. Costanza and others, moral and economic arguments should be pursued in parallel.
People make economic choices involving nature all the time, according to this view, but they do so without taking all the costs into account. For example, the dollar value of a wetland's flood-protection and water cleansing abilities has not traditionally been considered when it is lost to a shopping center. The result is a creeping depletion of natural wealth.
If such costs were reflected in day-to-day transactions, these theorists say, society would pay more attention to what is lost when land is "developed."
"We can't wait until we've disrupted the planet's life-support system beyond repair," said Dr. Gretchen C. Daily, a conservation biologist at Stanford University. She is the editor of a recent collection of papers on the subject, "Nature's Services; Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems," published as a book by Island Press. Once gone, she noted, many of these ecological assets would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace; it can take thousands of years to recharge depleted aquifers or replenish topsoil.
Until now, fledgling efforts at what is called "green accounting" have been pursued largely at the national level. In a widely applauded attempt of this kind, Dr. Robert Repetto, senior economist at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based research organization, has analyzed the economies of Indonesia and Costa Rica. In Indonesia, he and colleagues calculated that losses from soil erosion reduced the net value of crops by about 40 percent and that the loss of value from deforestation was four times as high as the value of the timber extracted. They also concluded that depletion of Costa Rica's soils, forests and fisheries resulted in a 25 percent to 30 percent reduction in potential economic growth.
A nascent effort to introduce a measure of natural-resource accounting into the United States' official calculation of economic worth was made in 1993, but it is on hold pending a Congressionally ordered study of the soundness of the approach by the National Academy of Sciences. A report is due this year.
The new Costanza study is not really an exercise in green accounting, and some experts question its practical usefulness while others express skepticism about its basic finding.
"There's no way of knowing how good this number is," Dr. Repetto said of the study's estimate of $33 trillion for the global value of ecosystem services. "They've made some heroic assumptions. I suppose it's useful for rhetorical purposes." But the number, he said, is less important than the fundamental point made by the study "that ecosystem services are important; I don't think reasonable people would deny that."
Other experts see more utility in the analysis. The study has succeeded in providing "a conservative estimate of what the environment does for us," said Dr. Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the University of Tennessee who wrote a commentary on the Costanza study in Nature. "So often," he said, "people concerned with protecting the environment go up against these very highly detailed economic analyses and feel they don't have anything in kind with which to respond." In the tables of specific ecosystem services that accompany the study, he said, "what Costanza et al. has done is provide a checklist" that national and local policy makers can use in attempting to make a rough gauge of the economic worth of their natural assets.
One table, for instance, lists specific ecosystem services, and their supposed value, for 11 biomes, or types of natural areas. These include the open ocean, estuaries, seagrass and algae beds, coral reefs, continental shelves, tropical forests, temperate forests, grasslands and rangelands, tidal marshes and mangroves, wetlands and flood plains and lakes and rivers.
The next step, Dr. Costanza says, is to delineate more clearly the explicit linkages between particular local ecosystems and local economies. For example, how much of the value of the Louisiana shrimp catch is attributable to the wetlands in which the shrimp reproduce and grow? But since wetlands perform other services as well, the wetlands' value as a shrimp nursery would be only a minimum indication of their overall value.
The same applies, for example, to the Catskill watershed, which serves other economic functions besides providing and cleaning New York City's water -- attracting tourists, for instance.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Nonprofits Get Interstate Trade Protection

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19

 BODY:
In a case watched closely by nonprofit organizations around the country, the Supreme Court ruled today that states offering favorable tax treatment to charities cannot draw distinctions based on whether a charity serves primarily in-state or out-of-state clients.
The Court declared unconstitutional a 40-year-old Maine property tax law that made tax-exempt status generally available to "benevolent and charitable institutions" but withheld it from those "operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine." 
 By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court said the law amounted to economic protectionism that placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The law was challenged by a summer camp operated by the Christian Science church that serves mostly children from outside the state and, as a result, had to pay more than $20,000 a year in local property taxes from which it would have been exempt had most of its campers been from Maine.
Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said that a state law making a similar distinction among profit-making businesses would unquestionably violate the Constitution's commerce clause. "We see no reason why the nonprofit character of an enterprise should exclude it" from a similar analysis, Justice Stevens said.
He added that "any categorical distinction" between profit-making and nonprofit organizations was "wholly illusory" given that "entities in both categories are major participants in interstate markets." He noted that the nonprofit sector accounts for approximately 7 percent of the gross national product and, as of 1990, employed 9.3 million people.
Maine's law was evidently the only one of its kind in the country, and the state did not defend it in the Supreme Court. After a state trial court judge declared the law unconstitutional in 1994, the state did not appeal, and the case was carried on by the town of Harrison, about 40 miles northwest of Portland, where the camp that challenged the law, Newfound/Owatonna, is located. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court overturned the earlier decision and upheld the law in a 1995 ruling.
But although, as Justice Stevens observed drily, "the facts of this particular case, viewed in isolation, do not appear to pose any threat to the health of the national economy," the case galvanized an impressive array of nonprofit organizations to make the Justices aware of their concerns.
Groups representing universities, churches, the United Way, the Y.M.C.A. and others warned of the consequences if the Court permitted states to withhold tax exemptions from nonprofits that serve a nationwide audience. The Maine court's decision "poses a substantial threat to the financial welfare of nonprofit institutions generally," a brief from the American Council on Education and other groups told the Court.
Their concern reflected the novelty, and therefore the inherent unpredictability, of the issue. Despite a formidable list of decisions examining, and for the most part disallowing, economic protectionism by the states, the Court had not previously applied these cases in the nonprofit context.
Given the closeness of the vote, the nonprofit groups' concerns proved well founded. The case, argued last October just after the current term began, was the oldest undecided case on the Court's calendar, making it apparent that the Court was engaged in a major battle over the outcome.
The majority opinion, Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Harrison, No. 94-1988, was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the principal dissenting opinion, which was signed by the three other dissenters: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Scalia said Maine was not trying to regulate interstate commerce. He said the challenged law "has nothing to do with economic protectionism" but was "designed merely to compensate or subsidize those organizations" that contribute "benefits the state might otherwise provide." As such, the law "survives even our most demanding commerce-clause scrutiny," Justice Scalia said.
Justice Scalia's opinion suggested, without quite saying so directly, that Court precedents protecting interstate commerce should not apply to nonprofit groups.
A separate dissenting opinion by Justice Thomas, which Justice Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist joined but that Justice Ginsburg did not, went much further, calling into question the Court's approach to the commerce clause going back to the 19th century.
The clause itself, authorizing Congress to "regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states," does not place any explicit limitations on state activity. The Court has interpreted the Constitution as containing an implicit "dormant" or "negative" commerce clause, as the precedents have labeled it, under which states are greatly limited in the way they can act, without Congress's approval, to regulate the national economy.
This entire enterprise has been illegitimate, Justice Thomas said. "The negative commerce clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense and has proved virtually unworkable in application," he said, adding that "we have used the clause to make policy-laden judgments that we are ill-equipped and arguably unauthorized to make."
Justice Thomas said another provision of the Constitution, which prohibits states from taxing imports or exports, should be invoked to prohibit "certain of the more egregious state taxes on interstate commerce." The Court interpreted that provision, in a decision in 1869, as applying only to foreign trade. Justice Thomas, joined in this portion of his opinion only by Justice Scalia, said the 1869 decision should be overruled.
There were also these other developments at the Court today:
 
Lie Detectors
Accepting an appeal from the Federal Government, the Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of blanket prohibitions on defendants' use of polygraph evidence in criminal trials.
The case comes from the military court system, where polygraph evidence is inadmissible, by either side, under the rules of evidence. But the constitutional principle would apply to the numerous state and Federal courts that refuse to admit any such evidence as well.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, a civilian court that is the top appeals court for military cases, ruled in a 3-to-2 decision last September that to bar a defendant from presenting "relevant, material and favorable evidence" of a polygraph examination violates the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. The decision did not mean that all such evidence is to be admitted, but that defendants have a right to persuade a judge of its admissibility.
In its appeal, United States v. Scheffer, No. 96-1133, the Government is arguing that the ban is a reasonable means of avoiding burdensome case-by-case litigation and that polygraph evidence should not be allowed to take the place of jury determinations of witnesses' credibility.
 
Alimony Deduction
The Court agreed to hear a challenge to a New York law under which out-of-state taxpayers who must pay income tax on their New York income may not deduct alimony payments from their taxable income. Resident taxpayers may make that deduction.
In a ruling last December, the New York State Court of Appeals upheld the law, which was challenged by a partner in a Manhattan law firm who lives in Connecticut. He reported income of $788,210, 48 percent of which derived from his business in New York, and alimony payments of $108,000. After New York tax officials rebuffed his effort to claim 48 percent of the alimony as a deduction, he challenged the law as a violation of the constitutional provision that guarantees all citizens the "privileges and immunities" of citizens in other states. The case is Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal, No. 96-1462.
 

CORRECTION-DATE: June 8, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 20 about a Supreme Court ruling on tax treatment of charities misstated the sponsorship of a camp in Maine. The camp, Newfound and Owatonna, is owned by a nonprofit organization and operated for the benefit of Christian Science children. It is not operated by the Christian Science Church.

HEADLINE: Time to Get Big Sugar Off the Public Dole

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alfonso Fanjul and J. Pepe Fanjul, owners of a Florida sugar company, claim that "there is no subsidy" for American sugar growers (letter, May 14). This may come as a surprise to American consumers, who are forced by our Government to pay the Fanjuls almost twice the world price for their sugar. 
 The program provides sugar processors with special loans, and limits fair competition with strict import quotas. The General Accounting Office says that as a result, the sugar program costs consumers $1.4 billion a year in higher food prices. Contrary to the Fanjuls' letter, the Department of Agriculture has endorsed the G.A.O. study, saying that it is "a reasonable report with no major data problems."
The Fanjuls' massive subsidies encourage and intensify production in South Florida, further degrading the Everglades and increasing the cost of restoration by $65 million to $120 million, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Congress has ended welfare as we know it for poor Americans. It's time to do the same for the Fanjuls and for other corporations on the public dole.

HEADLINE: Judging Beef By Its Grade, Cut and Eating Habits

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
STEAK on the grill turns a meal into a feast, the way Memorial Day turns a May weekend into summer.
The growing legion of steak lovers who want that steakhouse experience at home have more choices than ever when it comes to finding a good steak to put on the grill. First there is the matter of choosing the cut. Then, deciding on the grade. And increasingly, another option has become the brand name. Some brands of beef are "natural," that is, raised without hormones or antibiotics. 
 For steak, the best cuts are what the beef industry calls the middle cuts: the ribs, the loins and the flank, from the center of the steer. The less-tender end cuts like the chuck and the round come from around the animal's legs, where the muscles are heavier.
Shoppers who buy steak apparently know which are the best cuts. More than two-thirds select sirloin, shell, rib, T-bone, porterhouse, flank and tenderloin steaks, according to studies conducted by NPD, a market research company in Park Ridge, Ill. These cuts generally cost two to three times as much as the end cuts, about $10 or more a pound.
All the middle cuts are fine for grilling. Which one to buy is a matter of taste, serving size and budget. The loin is most often cut into strip or shell steaks. Sometimes called New York strips, these are the most popular in steakhouses and in stores. Porterhouse steaks are also from the loin and yield two or more servings. A T-bone steak is a smaller version of the porterhouse.
The tenderloin, or fillet, is a soft piece of boneless loin with relatively little fat that is usually sliced into individual filets mignons for grilling. A rib steak, which the French call entrecote, has the richest flavor, and also the most fat. The flank steak, a large flat slab of boneless meat, is economical, at about half the price of the other steaks. But it must be sliced thin on the bias, or it will be tough.
The sirloin can also be cut into large slabs that provide several servings. In his new book, "Steak Lover's Cookbook" (Workman, $13.95), William Rice explains that a big sirloin steak with a small, circular bone or pin bone will be more tender than a sirloin steak with a large, flat bone.
After deciding on the cut, the next option is the grade. The United States Agriculture Department grades beef based largely on the amount of fat marbling, the fat running through the meat, which enhances tenderness. It is a critical feature for a piece of meat that is seared over high heat rather than cooked slowly to break down the tissues. Though the department has eight categories for grading, shoppers can choose from only the top three: prime, choice and select.
More than half opt for choice, the most widely sold grade. About a third prefer select, which is leaner, cheaper and not as tender.
Prime is the beef with the most marbling, which makes it more flavorful and tender. It is also the costliest. Only about 2 percent of all the beef produced in this country these days is graded prime. Most is sold to the top steakhouses, so there is not much available for the home cook.
"The New York market is an exception," said Susan Parenty, a director of communications for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group. "The New York area probably consumes three times as much prime as anywhere else in the country and you can probably find it more easily."
New York still has about 10 butcher shops that sell prime beef. Elsewhere, mail-order companies are another good source.
Sales of brand-name beef, which first came on the market in 1979, have steadily increased, especially in the last few years, as producers take their cue from the chicken industry, their main competition. Last year, nearly half the supermarkets in the country carried some kind of brand-name beef, but it still accounts for less than 5 percent of the beef produced in this country. Almost all chicken is now sold by brand.
About half the brand-name beef is Certified Angus Beef, which is from the Angus breed of cattle and raised according to the standards set by the Certified Black Angus Beef Program in Wooster, Ohio. Certified Angus Beef is graded by the Agriculture Department to be at the high end of the choice range, closer to being prime than select, said a spokeswoman, Crystal Meyer.
Beef that is free of growth hormones and antibiotics is called "natural" and is sold in about 16 percent of supermarkets.
Coleman's, a brand of natural beef raised by a producer in Denver, is now being sold at Food Emporium, A&P, Waldbaum's, King Kullen, Shop Rite, Grand Union and Fresh Fields markets in the New York area. Coleman's, which sells prime, choice and select beef, has experienced double-digit increases in sales since 1993.
Since beef consumption hit its low of 61.6 pounds a person in 1993, it has been slowly increasing, mainly because of increased steakhouse traffic. Last year, it was 64.7 pounds, or 10 pounds a person less than it was a decade ago.
Niman Schell, a company based in Bolinas, Calif., near San Francisco that has been producing natural beef since 1979, recently began selling some of its beef at retail, outside the San Francisco area. It can be ordered from the Williams-Sonoma catalogue for $15 a pound. In Manhattan, it is sold at the Vinegar Factory for around $14 a pound, depending on the cut.
Niman Schell beef is dry-aged for three to six months before being shipped, to enhance its flavor, making it richer and earthier. Some steak-lovers like the taste. In March, Food Emporium supermarkets in Manhattan started selling choice beef that has been dry-aged for three weeks, which costs about $2 a pound more than the chain's regular choice steaks.
Steaks that are about one and a half inches thick produce the best results on the grill or under a broiler. Thinner steaks are better seared on top of the stove in a ridged cast-iron grill pan. A steak that is two inches thick or more may become too charred on the outside before it is cooked to the desired degree of doneness inside.
 
When Is It Done?
THE Agriculture Department recommends cooking beef to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees, the temperature at which most potentially dangerous microorganisms are destroyed. It calls meat at this degree of doneness "medium rare," meat at 160 degrees "medium" and meat at 170 degrees "well done."
But do the Government's criteria for safety match up with most steak-lovers' tastes or with common restaurant practices?
As a test, Victor H. Chavez, the executive chef at Smith & Wollensky, the Manhattan steakhouse, broiled four prime boneless 16-ounce New York strips the way he usually does. The degree of doneness was based mostly on timing. As soon as the steaks came out of the broiler, they were tested with an instant thermometer. The rare steak registered 120 to 125 degrees; the medium rare, 130 to 135, and the medium steak, 145, still light pink in the center but going to gray-brown at the edges. The medium-well steak was 150 to 155 degrees. There was a difference of 15 degrees between the Government and the steakhouse.
Harold McGee in "On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984) said, "We usually define the doneness of red meats not by their temperature, but by their inner color." The Government, more interested in safety than palatability, uses temperature, not color, as the guide. Mr. McGee writes that heating meat to temperatures of more than 140 degrees gradually makes it more solid, dense and dry, and the pigment increasingly drab. "That is why rare meat is pink and juicy, well-done meat brown-gray and dry," he said.
The way the steaks were cooked by Mr. Chavez is typical of most steakhouses. It is also the way people who want their beef medium rare are likely to cook it at home. "When people order a steak, they know how they like it and we have to cook it that way," Mr. Chavez said. "Lately, we have been getting more requests for meat a little more cooked, more medium rare to medium, instead of rare. Maybe people think it's safer."
The home cook also has to decide whether to play it safe and follow Government guidelines, or to indulge in rare or medium rare, knowing there may be a risk.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Grain and Soybean Prices Fall On Reports of Early Planting

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply yesterday after the Government reported that planting was proceeding at a near-record pace, bolstering farmers' chances of producing bumper fall harvests.
In other commodity markets, copper and palladium futures rose to new highs after Federal Reserve policy makers left United States interest rates unchanged. Coffee futures fell sharply for a third session on increasing supplies. 
 Farmers, as of Sunday, had put 88 percent of the corn crop into the ground, compared with the five-year average of 67 percent at this time of year, the United States Department of Agriculture reported late Monday.
Farmers also had sowed 46 percent of the soybean crops -- 20 percentage points above average, the department reported.
The earlier farmers get crops into the ground, the greater the chance of bumper crops. In 1994, for example, there was a record corn harvest after planting was 84 percent complete in mid-May.
Wheat futures retreated sharply despite declining winter wheat conditions. Western Kansas is expected to get rain, which could provide a late boost to the crop shortly before harvesting begins, analysts said.
Soybeans for July delivery fell 22 cents, to $8.44 a bushel; July corn fell 8.25 cents, to $2.7625 a bushel, and July wheat fell 14.75 cents, to $3.80 a bushel.
Copper and palladium futures prices rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Fed left interest rates unchanged, fueling speculation that demand for the metals would increase as economic growth continues.
Palladium and copper, used in electronics, construction, automobiles and computers, would benefit heavily from cheaper interest rates.
June palladium rose $3.75, to $181.75 an ounce, the highest since April 1995. July copper was up 2 cents, to $1.178 a pound, the highest since May 16, 1996.
Coffee futures continued their retreat from 20-year highs on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York as supplies of arabica beans increased.
The exchange reported late Monday that inventories at its warehouses rose to 47,192 bags from 41,682 on Friday. Warehouse supplies have grown by nearly 25,000 bags since May 6.
A meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which accounts for 80 percent of the world's production, also weighed heavily on the market. Analysts speculated that the group would announce today that it had loosened its self-imposed export quotas, allowing producers to sell more coffee if prices rise above a certain level.

Brokerage on Move (But Not Out of City)

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Fahnestock & Company, a securities brokerage based in Manhattan, is moving from one downtown office tower to another, with more than $1.3 million in assistance from city and state agencies.
Fahnestock's 398 employees will move from 110 Wall Street to 125 Broad Street, where the company has leased 69,000 square feet for 15 years at about $25 per square foot, people involved in the transaction said. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a package of incentives yesterday intended to keep the company from leaving the city. The incentives include at least $500,000 in sales tax exemptions and $400,000 in energy discounts, an extra $250,000 in sales tax exemptions if the company hires 125 more workers, and $440,000 in cash grants from the state's Empire State Development Corporation.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which negotiated the incentives, said Fahnestock had been "aggressively" courted by the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development, on behalf of the owners of One Harmon Meadow Boulevard, a five-story office building in Secaucus. New Jersey had offered about "four times" the New York package, Mr. Millard said.
A spokeswoman for the New Jersey agency declined to comment.
Fahnestock & Company drew notice recently for selling $55 million in bonds backed by anticipated future royalties from the recordings of David Bowie. It is a unit of Fahnestock Viner Holdings, a Canadian public corporation.
125 Broad Street, a 40-story tower that was the headquarters of American Express, then part of the Olympia & York real estate empire, was converted to a condominium in 1995 after Olympia & York turned it over to the building's lender, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and the insurance company Johnson & Higgins, both tenants, own about 80 percent of the building. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union bought two of the remaining floors. The Fahnestock & Company lease leaves just two floors vacant, according to William D. Brodsky of Insignia/Edward S. Gordon, who represented New York Broad Holding Inc., which owns six floors in the building.

HEADLINE: New York Is Still No. 1 -- in Taxes

BYLINE: By Raymond J. Keating; Raymond J. Keating is chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee and author of "New York by the Numbers."

DATELINE: CENTER MORICHES, N.Y.

 BODY:
Last year there were 2.8 million private-sector jobs in New York City, down from 3.2 million in 1969. This means that New York City, once the most dynamic city economy in the world, has not created a net new job in more than a quarter century.
The cause of this decline is no mystery: City taxes and regulations are onerous, and have combined with uncontrolled municipal spending and debt to cool the private sector's entrepreneurial fires. The greatest culprits have been the city's taxes on personal income, corporate income and unincorporated businesses, all adopted under Mayor John Lindsay in 1966. Unfortunately, no current city official seems to grasp how damaging these tax policies are. 
 At first glance, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to understand the problem. He eliminated the commercial rent tax throughout the city except for Manhattan south of 96th Street, where the top effective tax rate has been cut from 6 percent to 4.5 percent. And his new budget proposes cutting that top tax rate again, to 3.9 percent.
The Mayor has also pushed through a few minor tax reductions, including a cut in the city hotel tax, from 6 percent to 5 percent (on top of the 8.25 percent city sales tax and $2 per night flat fee), and a property tax cut for co-op and condo owners. He has proposed eliminating the city's 4 percent tax on clothing purchases under $500 and slightly raising the limit on annual income that is exempt from the unincorporated business tax.
These are steps in the right direction. Indeed, last year the city's private sector created jobs at a greater rate than the national average. But before anyone rushes to induct Mayor Giuliani into the pro-growth hall of fame, consider the flip side of the tax coin.
New York City still has the highest combined state and city personal income taxes in the nation. It imposes the highest capital gains tax rate (11.3 percent), the highest corporate income tax rate (19.4 percent), and the highest income and capital gains taxes on unincorporated entrepreneurs (15.3 percent). Not only has Mr. Giuliani done next to nothing to reduce these levies, he has helped to keep them high.
Remember that during the 1994 Governor's race, Mr. Giuliani opposed George Pataki's proposed cut in state personal income taxes, predicting dire consequences for the city. This year the Mayor has been silent about Governor Pataki's proposed four-year extension of the 17 percent tax surcharge that city businesses pay to keep the Metropolitan Transit Authority running -- in effect, a four-year tax increase of $2 billion.
Twice during his tenure Mr. Giuliani has extended the city's "temporary" surcharges on the personal income tax, refusing to allow the overall top tax rate to drop from 4.5 percent to 3.4 percent. Extending these surcharges will bring in about $2.2 billion from 1996 to 1998.
Even if Mr. Giuliani actually gets the tax cuts called for in his budget, during 1997 and 1998 he will be responsible for a two-year net tax increase on individuals and businesses of approximately $575 million. If you want to add in the Mayor's quiet collaboration on the extension of transit authority surcharge, then the net tax increase for 1997 and 1998 will likely be more than $1.5 billion.
Mr. Giuliani's supporters claim that he is making progress, that he cannot do what needs to be done and still be re-elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. If true, then we should expect to see a voracious tax cutter emerge if the Mayor wins a second term this November; the city's new term limits law will not allow him a third term.
In fact, it would also be smart politics to pursue such a strategy, if his ambitions extend beyond the liberal bastion of New York City.

Fed Meeting Gives Bonds A Modest Lift

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose modestly yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged.
While investors were relieved by the decision, they quickly started to mull the possibility of future moves by the central bank. 
 "The Fed chose to leave rates unchanged, but that doesn't mean that they are out of the picture for the rest of the year," Doug Burtnick, senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said. "The market will continue to struggle with each upcoming data release, as traders attempt to divine the course of future rate moves. There is still the risk of higher rates this summer."
Because it was the short end of the market that would have been hit hard had the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates yesterday, it was the short end that experienced the sharpest rally. The price of the three-month bill rose, driving its yield down 16 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- to 5.06 percent. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
But the dollar, which fell sharply in foreign-exchange trading after the Fed's decision, limited the day's gains in bonds. Market participants favor a strong dollar because it makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32, to 96 18/32. The bond's yield -- an important benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- slipped to 6.90 percent from 6.92 percent on Monday.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, noted that had the Fed tightened, a negative reaction from the bond market might have lasted 24 hours. But since the Fed left rates steady, traders and investors will now have to begin examining again each new piece of economic data including the May employment report on June 6, considered the next market mover. "We see a trading band on the yield of the long bonds as between 6.85 percent and 6.95 percent," he said.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said he was disappointed that the Fed did not raise rates. He said there were political considerations behind yesterday's decision.
"What this does to the market is to put it on edge again as investors will again have to scrutinize economic data leading to the next F.O.M.C. meeting," Mr. Pugliese said. "My own opinion is that there shouldn't have been a tightening in the first place. We are in extraordinary times. I think the technological revolution that this country is going through has increased productivity to the point where inflation is benign for the foreseeable future. Besides, the consumer has become more sophisticated, and you just can't pass prices along."
While he expects that wages will go up, Mr. Pugliese predicted they would not reach a meaningful level. "Plus again we have lower import prices, which keep competition keen," Mr. Pugliese said. "Long-term rates will be significantly lower than they are now regardless what the Fed does over the near term. The road to higher prices will not be smooth until the Fed acknowledges that it is done raising rates."

Singapore Ranked the No. 1 Economy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Singapore again ranks first among the 53 economies rated in the Global Competitiveness Report, a closely watched study of countries' economic potential that is being released today by the World Economic Forum, a business-financed research organization in Geneva.
The United States also continued to do well in the report, moving to third from fourth. That made it far and away the leader among large, developed economies in what Jeffrey Sachs, the co-chairman of the forum's advisory board and the architect of the rating system, calls "the ability to achieve sustained high rates of economic growth." 
 There are other familiar players at the top of the list, including Hong Kong (No. 2), New Zealand (No. 5), Switzerland (No. 6) and Taiwan (No. 8), but there are some surprises, too. Canada moved to fourth from eighth, reflecting progress in reducing its budget deficit -- a problem plaguing virtually all the mature social democracies. Even more dramatic, Britain jumped to 7th place from 15th by slashing top tax rates and reducing labor market regulation that inhibits employment growth.
 The study, which was reformulated last year to emphasize the conclusions of professional economists over those of business executives, has attracted a following because many business and government leaders see it as a report card on their success in making their economies leaner, meaner and more prepared for growth.
Last year's change in the rankings process, which de-emphasized opinion polling in favor of more objective criteria, ranging from tariff rates to currency stability to the number of telephones per capita, has apparently produced a better predictor of growth prospects. Indeed, there was no statistical correlation between the old style of executive poll rankings and rates of growth, while the new method did identify some actual winners and losers last year. "We beat the gut response of business leaders," Mr. Sachs said.
 The survey of executives is still conducted, but is given less weight. It has tended to favor historically successful countries like Japan, Germany and France, whose entrenched flaws are more easily discernible under the new system. From Mr. Sachs's perspective, the principal advantage to the refurbished Global Competitiveness Report is its transformation from a high-profile popularity contest to a bully pulpit for spreading the gospel according to modern development economics.
The most successful grouping in the recent report -- what it calls the "entrepot economies," including Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg (11th), so-called because they are very small countries that thrive on providing global trade and financial services -- got that way by virtue of the countries' commitment to openness, minimal regulation and rule of law.
 The "Anglo-Saxon" economies (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Britain and the United States) are doing well, too, beating back the economic arteriosclerosis that can come with the accumulation of interest group influence in rich democracies. The United States led this pack by ranking first among all economies on management skills, second on access to technology and third on both infrastructure development and the efficiency of financial markets. It would have nosed out Hong Kong for second place in the overall rankings but for mediocre scores on taxation, bureaucracy and civil justice.
 The most disappointing group, the countries of the European Union, all provide high living standards. But their high-spending, high-tax regimes generally undermine the efficiency of markets and offer little hope of rapid growth in income or employment. "Continental Europe sits there in a mess," Mr. Sachs said. "The basic problems aren't being solved." But the Netherlands (moving from 17th to 12th) and Ireland (jumping from 26th to 16th), both bucked the general trend in Europe by making their welfare states more user-friendly for business.
 The transition economies of Eastern Europe are, at best, treading water. Russia (53d) and Ukraine (52d) have been overwhelmed by corruption and incompetent government, the report says. Poland (50th), Hungary (46th) and the Czech Republic (32d) are all striving to encourage private enterprise and attract foreign investment. But in all three, social security has priority over efficient markets and government spending still represents roughly half of national output. "Their pretensions to being Sweden are premature," Mr. Sachs said.
 Protectionism and heavy-handed regulation are holding back some of these economies, along with some others that have consistently ranked low, like Venezuela (47th), India (45th) and South Africa (44th).
Human rights appear to have no direct input on competitiveness rankings. Some economies with capital-friendly authoritarian regimes -- Singapore, Indonesia (15th) and China (29th) -- did well compared with rights-minded democracies, including Portugal (30th), Belgium (31st), the Czech Republic, Iceland (38th), Italy (39th) and Poland.
But Mr. Sachs, citing countries like Britain and the United States, suggested that the conflict between competitiveness and social justice was more apparent than real. "You don't need to spend half of national income on middle-class entitlements in order to maintain the safety net," he argued.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Lay of the Land"
Table lists countries with the best and worst business climates, out of 53 analyzed and ranked by the World Economic Forum (49 were ranked last year). Ranks are broken down into four categories: most competitive, least competitive, biggest growth potential, and smallest growth potential. Competitiveness refers to countries' labor markets, fiscal policies, tax and regulatory regimes and openness to trade and investment, regardless of the size of the economy. Growth potential refers to expected absolute increase in total output. (Source: World Economic Forum)

HEADLINE: A Slowdown In the Works Whatever The Fed Does

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Whatever the Federal Reserve does over the next few months, the American economy appears to be heading, on its own, into a period of slower economic growth.
"Weaker is not bad," said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "We are still talking about positive economic growth." 
 Virtually no economist is predicting a recession, only a slowdown to perhaps half the booming annual growth rate of more than 4 percent that prevailed from October through March. Many analysts consider such rapid growth to be inflationary, if it lasts long enough. Eventually, with very strong growth, shortages of labor and merchandise develop, which push up wages and prices.
But the spurts of growth during the current recovery, like the one this last winter, have not lasted long. Counting the slower periods, the gross domestic product, valuing all the goods and services that the nation produces in a given year, has risen at an average annual rate of only 2.7 percent since the last recession ended, in the spring of 1991. That growth rate has not been strong enough to create the shortages that push up inflation. And the growth rate is even less, a very mild 2.1 percent a year, if the 1990-91 recession is averaged in.
The economic expansion of the 1990's, now in its seventh year, has been marked by alternating periods of strong and weak growth. A booming 1994, for example, was followed by a weak 1995, mostly because the Fed had raised interest rates sufficiently to slow the economy. The slowdown under way now -- after a winter in which the economy boomed -- appears to reflect more natural causes.
"With the economy slowing, it is quite plausible that we can have a 2.5 percent growth rate, and the Fed does not have to lift a finger," said Lee Price, chief economist at the Commerce Department. The Fed's top officials, at their policy meeting yesterday, decided not to follow a rate increase in March with another one now.
Since early April, retail sales have fallen and stockpiles of unsold goods have piled up. This inventory accumulation accounted for a big chunk of the strong economic growth in the first quarter. Working off those stockpiles now, in the face of weaker retail sales, means cutbacks in industrial production, at least temporarily. These cutbacks have already begun to show up in Government statistics as weaker growth in the second quarter.
"What is going on now is a mini-inventory correction," said Lyle Gramley, a consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Fed governor. "That is normally a short phenomenon."
The big question is how long the slowdown will last. There is no way to answer that question yet.
But if the inventory correction follows a typical pattern, the economy might be growing more strongly again by fall or winter, once retailers and wholesalers decide to step up orders to restock their shelves.
However, some ingredients of last winter's strong growth are lacking now. Warmer-than-usual weather encouraged above normal shopping and construction activity, strengthening the economy temporarily, particularly in the first quarter. So did tax refunds, which flowed to Americans in unexpectedly large amounts in the weeks before April 15.
Other factors suggest that a longer period of mild growth might lie ahead. Consumer debt is at a record high, eating into household income, and borrowing to finance purchases has tapered off. New-vehicle sales, having held above 15 million at an annual rate through the winter, dropped below that level in April, and the auto industry has responded with rebates and sales incentives.
"When the economy slows, we slow even more," said Wynn Van Bussman, chief economist at the Chrysler Corporation, "and we are confirming that slowdown because it is becoming more and more difficult to sell new vehicles."
Similarly, home construction was quite strong this winter, contributing noticeably to economic growth, particularly when all the accessories -- carpeting, appliances, furniture, remodeling -- are added in. Construction is still high, but no longer rising. "Some of the early-year exuberance has worn off," said David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
Slower economic growth -- 2.5 percent or less annually -- is touted by most economists and policy makers as necessary to avoid the shortages that drive up the inflation rate. Corporate executives and union officials increasingly argue that the American economy is capable of greater growth without rising inflation.
Slower growth also makes an economy more susceptible to the sort of "accident" that can tip a weakened economy into recession: the Persian Gulf crisis played a role in provoking the 1990-91 recession, along with the Fed's decision to keep interest rates up. Similarly, a sharp decline in stock prices could undermine the economy now by damaging the confidence of American households, nearly half of whom own stocks, either directly or through mutual funds and retirement accounts.
Or the Federal Reserve, trying to slow the economy to avoid a rise in the inflation rate, could push up interest rates too much, in its effort to discourage borrowing and spending. "Every recession since 1957 has been caused by a spike in interest rates or an oil price shock," Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, said.
The Fed in its decision yesterday seemed to recognize the danger of pushing up rates too much.

HEADLINE: Minister of Objection Nettles Washington;
Boeing, Threatened, Sees Trade War

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 16

 BODY:
Who is Karel van Miert, and why is he declaring war on the Boeing Company?
As the Seattle-based aerospace giant pushes to complete its $14 billion takeover of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the biggest roadblock is suddenly being posed by a feisty European official who has bluntly branded the deal "totally unacceptable." 
 The official is Karel van Miert, a 55-year-old former Belgian Socialist who is the European Commission's Minister for Competition and, de facto, the Continent's top antitrust authority. Few Americans have heard of him, but that is changing fast, especially in corporate board rooms.
On Wednesday, Mr. van Miert is expected to hand Boeing a list of "objections" to the McDonnell Douglas deal. Never mind that the takeover involves two American companies, or that his biggest objection stems from two long-term sales contracts that Boeing recently reached with two American airlines.
"If any deal has an effect on the European marketplace, then the jurisdiction is within our territory," said Willy Helin, Mr. van Miert's spokesman. "We don't give a damn about extraterritoriality."
[On Tuesday, Mr. van Miert met with British officials and reiterated his hard line against the proposed marketing alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation. Mr. van Miert has complained that it would eliminate competition on many routes between the United States and Britain.]
It is in the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas case that Mr. van Miert is flexing his muscles for a showdown with both the United States aerospace industry and, very likely, the United States Government.
In numerous public comments, he has warned that the creation of an aerospace goliath would endanger competition in Europe, especially for Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium based in Paris that competes with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. If Boeing fails to address his concerns, Mr. van Miert has threatened to block the deal or impose fines of up to 10 percent of Boeing's revenues, or about $4 billion.
For American companies, the case highlights the lengthening reach of the European Union as Europe acts increasingly as a single political entity. But experts say Mr. van Miert's higher profile is a result of the inevitable clashes that come with the rise in international trade.
Whether the United States tries to block European companies from doing business with Cuba or Iran, or Europe tries to enforce an internal ban on hormone-treated beef from American cattle farmers, international disputes over conflicting national policies are piling up. And there are few precedents for guidance.
"The whole issue of extraterritoriality is a vexing area, and it is one that is going to get worse," said Michael Hodges, senior lecturer in international relations at the London School of Economics. "Having dealt with many of the issues between borders, we are now looking at issues behind the borders."
The looming fight over Boeing could easily engulf the Clinton Administration. Although the Federal Trade Commission is not expected to decide the antitrust issues until next month, the United States Government has already approved several big mergers within the nation's shrinking military and aerospace industry. And Mr. van Miert has already attracted warning growls from Boeing's home-state senators and from Vice President Al Gore.
While Mr. van Miert has been quick to object, his bark is often worse than his bite. Indeed, most disputes that he initiates are eventually settled through negotiation and compromise rather than by taking companies to court. Of roughly 500 mergers that his office has reviewed, only 7 have been blocked outright.
Just this week, his office approved with only minor changes British Telecommunications' takeover of MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance telephone carrier in the United States after AT&T. But two years ago, he pressed the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Scott Paper to sell off some of their European businesses as a condition for approving their merger.
He has also provoked sputtering indignation from London to Bonn. He infuriated the British Government last fall when he first threatened to block the proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. He also outraged German Government officials by challenging subsidies to Volkswagen in eastern Germany as well as state aid to areas in western Germany. And he has chastised the French Government for its billion-dollar bailouts of state-owned companies like Credit Lyonnais, the troubled bank.
In the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas case, European officials have made it clear that they do not expect to veto the proposed merger outright. Rather, they suggest, the goal is to get Boeing to address their worries about particular business practices.
The European Commission must make a final decision on the merger by late July. If it vetoed the deal, and the Federal Trade Commission approved it, the fight would probably shift to the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
Mr. van Miert seems to relish conflict. A tough-minded politician who once headed the Belgian Socialist Party, he has become one of the most powerful figures within the sprawling bureaucracy of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. His attacks on a wide range of anti-competitive practices and on Europe's mountain of subsidies for industry have generally won praise as tough and honest. That is no small feat, since every country in the European Union has sacred cows that it wants to protect.
With a staff of more than 100 people, Mr. van Miert oversees a staggering volume of activity. His ministry reviews all major mergers that involve European companies as well as a few that do not. It also investigates allegations of price-fixing and a wide range of attempts to stifle competition, much like the United States Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. (The Justice Department and the F.T.C. together employ an antitrust staff of more than 1,100 people.)
In theory, Mr. van Miert can make life miserable for those who refuse to obey his rulings. But as a practical matter, he follows the opposite of the dictim made famous by Theodore Roosevelt by talking loudly and carrying a small stick.
In Germany, for example, the Governor of the eastern state of Saxony was outraged that Mr. van Miert blocked a package of subsidies for Volkswagen to build a new automobile factory. Mr. van Miert said he had already approved big subsidies for Volkswagen and was drawing the line at more. The state of Saxony went ahead anyway and Mr. van Miert prepared to take the state to court. Over the next several months, however, the two sides worked out a compromise that reduced but did not eliminate the subsidies.
In the British Airways deal with American Airlines, Mr. van Miert argued that the two airlines would control a majority of the coveted landing slots for flights between the United States and Heathrow Airport in London. The British Government has been content to let the airlines sell off many of these slots in order to lessen their dominance, but Mr. van Miert contended that they should give the slots away and said he would take the British Government to court.
The fight has been hanging in limbo for several months and remains unresolved.
The Boeing case is likely to be much tougher. Boeing now sells more than 60 percent of the world's commercial airplanes, while Airbus has captured about a 30 percent share. McDonnell Douglas, which had about 20 percent of the market 10 years ago, is now a negligible player with only about 4 percent. Most of McDonnell Douglas's business is in military aircraft, an area where Boeing is relatively weak.
Mr. van Miert's focus has been on the commercial aircraft market. In particular, he has complained repeatedly about Boeing's two recent contracts to become the exclusive supplier of planes to American Airlines and Delta Air Lines for 20 years.
He said such contracts would be a grave threat to competition in general and Airbus in particular. "These agreements are totally unacceptable because they eliminate Airbus as a rival for at least the next 20 years," he said last week in Stockholm.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas executives argue that Mr. van Miert is merely protecting Airbus. The competition in commercial aircraft had already been reduced to Boeing and Airbus, and company executives argue that Boeing's acquisition of McDonnell's military business would not change the balance. They also defend their airline contracts, asserting that the contracts were awarded through open competition and that Airbus had itself signed an exclusive long-term contract with U S Airways in 1996.
"It's obvious he wants a war," Harry C. Stonecipher, the president and chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, said in Washington last week.
In Brussels, headquarters of the European Commission, Boeing officials have lined up numerous European attorneys and argue that Mr. van Miert has wandered out of bounds. "At least from the U.S. side, this looks like an extraterritorial attempt to impose European law," said Ray Waldman, Boeing's vice president for international business.
Mr. van Miert dismissed Boeing's warnings of a possible trade war as "totally nonsensical."
But the issue is reverberating in the United States. Members of Congress from Washington State sent Mr. van Miert a letter last week complaining that he had prejudged the issue and was trying to protect Airbus -- charges that Mr. van Miert vehemently denied.
Meanwhile, Vice President Gore fired a warning shot of his own. "We haven't been bashful about our advocacy of the rights of American businesses oveseas," Mr. Gore said earlier this month. "We will be watching the outcome of their deliberations extremely carefully, and we will take whatever action is appropriate to assure justice and fairness."

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Squeeze Schools in Cleveland

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
The once-forsaken downtown boasts a glistening array of new office towers, hotels and sports stadiums. In the Flats, the industrial area where the brown bends of the Cuyahoga River once caught fire, the riverbanks are lined with bars and restaurants. Over all, the city's economic revival has transformed Cleveland from the Mistake on the Lake to the Comeback City.
But the city's school system is broke. 
 The Cleveland Teachers' Union sees a direct link between the downtown boom and the educational bust: the very same tax abatement policies that attracted new development to the city, they say, cost the schools $21 million a year.
Even through that represents only a small fraction of the district's budget, the teachers say the schools need every cent they can get. So, in what is apparently the first such campaign in the nation, the union has gathered enough signatures to force a special vote in August on a proposal to require that businesses winning abatements, or the city, reimburse the schools for any lost taxes.
Richard DeColibus, the union's president, said it was simply a matter of making sure that Cleveland schoolchildren did not bear the brunt of the city's development policy.
Chris Warren, the director of Cleveland's Department of Economic Development, agrees that abatements were given too freely in the past. And, he said, he would welcome a statewide ban. But a ban in Cleveland only, Mr. Warren said, would put the city at a terrible competitive disadvantage with its affluent surrounding towns, which he said would be only too happy to offer tax incentives to lure dozens of businesses out of Cleveland.
The union contends that the passage of the proposal would not hurt Cleveland, because it could still abate the portion of the property taxes that does not go to the schools.
With more local governments using tax incentives as a weapon in the escalating bidding wars for new investments, property tax abatements that siphon money from the schools have become controversial.
"The whole issue came to a head in the early 1990's, when the economy was bad, a lot of states were suffering and there was increasing competition for big-ticket projects," said Scott Mackey, of the National Conference of State Legislatures. "And in the last few years, we've begun hearing a lot about how school districts are the biggest recipients of property tax, but they don't usually have much say over abatements."
Only a handful of states allow school districts to veto abatements, Mr. Mackey said.
The debate over the long-term economic effects of tax abatements -- and who controls the decision to offer them -- has taken on new urgency as school systems hard-pressed for money look longingly at a revenue stream they see trickling away.
"Tax abatements are a two-edged sword," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents the nation's largest urban school districts. "They can help to create and attract the jobs that cities desperately need to remain vital. But at the same time, they can strip schools of the revenues they need to educate young people to fill those jobs."
There are no reliable national statistics on how much money schools lose from tax abatements. But the Corporation for Enterprise Development, in Washington, estimates that state and local governments give up $5 billion to $8 billion in tax incentives a year -- most, but not all, of them property tax abatements. And nationally, schools receive almost half of all property tax revenues.
As abatements have proliferated and awareness of the revenue loss for schools has grown, there has been increasing concern that local governments may be giving away more than they should.
"This conversation about the impact of abatements on schools is brand new, even though it's a fairly old practice," Mr. Casserly said. "It has something to do with the evolving conversations between mayors and schools about each one's role in the other's vitality. But because there has not been adequate research on how the benefits and liabilities balance out, it can be a pretty uninformed conversation, with people just shouting at each other."
Those who think tax abatements are being abused -- that school revenue is being lost without helping the city very much -- say that most abatements go to large corporations, whose workers disproportionately live outside the city limits, rather than to the smaller businesses that employ more city residents.
"One thing that is clear, frankly, is that corporations need to understand how their rhetoric about wanting a well-educated citizenry and their demands for tax abatements are really at odds with one another," Mr. Casserly said. "If you're going to have an educated citizenry, you're going to have to pay for it."
Some large corporations and tax-exempt institutions do contribute to the schools, providing cash, internships or other forms of support. In Cleveland, for example, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum agreed to give the schools a share of its admission fees in lieu of property taxes. This year, the school's cut will be about $450,000, which is still less than it would have received if the Hall of Fame were taxed.
Some educators and legislators think abatements of property taxes that support the schools should be banned altogether. In Texas, for example, the Legislature is considering State Senator David Sibley's proposal to end school property tax abatements. The Senate's Economic Development Committee found that from 1985 to 1995, the state's school districts lost almost $480 million in local property tax revenue because of abatements.
Texas law already allows schools not to participate in abatements the local government proposes. But Senator Sibley and others say the pressure on school boards can be so great as to make it impossible for them to resist development projects that will cut into their budgets.
"School districts never really reap the benefits from new jobs or an expanded tax base created by companies that receive school property tax breaks," Senator Sibley said. "Unlike cities and counties which ultimately benefit financially, most school districts lose money which they never get back. Our children's future should not be traded for new jobs now."
Tax abatements, of course, are only the latest skirmish in the continuing battle over how to pay for schools -- and indeed, in some states, including New York, financing for schools is not directly affected by property tax abatements.
In recent years, courts in several states, including Ohio in March and New Jersey just last week, have struck down financing systems that depend heavily on local property tax, finding that the disparities between rich and poor districts' spending violate state constitutional guarantees of a proper education.
The Cleveland schools have been in disarray, and in serious financial straits, for years. In 1995, a Federal judge put the 70,000-student system under state control after it ran out of money halfway through the year. The system has an annual budget of $670 million, and is $155 million in debt -- far more than most districts its size and far more than any change in abatement policy could make up. Meanwhile, student achievement levels are dismal and school buildings are deteriorating.
"It's completely dysfunctional," said Michael Charney, a middle-school teacher in Cleveland who has been a leader in the campaign against tax abatements. "Last year, in my seventh-grade social studies class I had 32 kids and only 24 desks. And we only had one set of textbooks for the classroom, so kids couldn't take them home."
Against that backdrop, Mr. DeColibus said, the teachers' union decided it had no choice but to start a petition drive for a city charter amendment that would make sure that tax revenues earmarked for the schools would not go to businesses instead.
"Business has taken a 'let someone else pay for it' attitude toward any kind of support for public institutions," Mr. DeColibus said, "and schools are hurt the most by this total lack of fiscal morality since we rely more heavily on property taxes than other government institutions. I've come to understand that 'good business climate' is a euphemism for 'businesses don't have to pay the taxes the rest of us do.' "
Ohio has taken some steps to stem the loss of school revenue from abatements. In 1994, the state passed legislation giving school boards the right to veto abatements of more than 75 percent of the taxes that would otherwise be paid, or those that last more than 10 years. In addition, if the annual payroll of added employees of an exempted project exceeds $1 million, the city must share with the schools a portion of the income tax it receives. But, Mr. DeColibus said, those provisions have had little effect.
Mr. Warren, the Cleveland development official, said the new law has not been invoked often, because the city no longer offers abatements of more than 75 percent; 60 to 65 percent is now the average, he said. But, he said, there have been a few instances of income-tax sharing.
"We use abatements very sparingly now, only as a last resort option to assist neighborhood-based businesses, with a strict 'but-for' test showing that the proposed development would not go forward but for the abatement," Mr. Warren said. "It's also important to keep in mind that since we don't abate 100 percent, or even 75 percent any more, we're collecting extra taxes from the development that does go forward, even with the abatements."
Mr. Warren sees the abatement vote largely as a political maneuver, an expression of the teachers' frustration. But he also said he thought the teachers were wrong to make the abatement issue a local one.
"We've told the teachers they should be working on a state level," Mr. Warren said. "If there's a ban on tax abatement just in Cleveland, there will be dozens of companies that will pick up and move over to Solon, where they'll be made very welcome. We'll have abandoned properties and that won't do anyone any good. Abatements are a legitimate concern, but this isn't the answer."

HEADLINE: Another Ranking Executive At Apple Decides to Resign

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 20

 BODY:
In the latest senior management departure from struggling Apple Computer Inc., George Scalise, the company's executive vice president for operations, resigned today to become president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He will leave Apple at the end of the month.
Mr. Scalise, 63, had followed Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman and chief executive, to the company from the National Semiconductor Corporation and had earlier in his career held executive positions at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor and Motorola. Mr. Scalise had also previously worked for the Semiconductor Industry Association, the chip industry's trade organization, as chairman of its public policy committee. 
 The powers and responsibilities of Mr. Amelio's chosen executives have weakened since Apple's $400 million acquisition of Next Software Inc. returned Steven P. Jobs to the company he helped found, analysts noted. Ellen Hancock, who last year joined Apple as chief technology officer, also from National Semiconductor, had her oversight of both hardware and software development management turned over to former Next executives.
"The influence of Steve Jobs has been much greater than anyone anticipated," said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. "But any brain drain right now, especially someone so close to Gil, has to be considered a loss."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Scalise said his departure had nothing to do with Mr. Jobs's influence but instead reflected the completion of much of what he was brought on board to accomplish. "I think a lot of what I was focused on, and what was in my area of responsibility, has been done now," he said. "The idea was to focus on getting Apple on track operationally. Now, we're satisfying demand, and we're able to bring out leading edge products on schedule."
Mr. Scalise said that Apple did not plan to replace him but that Mr. Amelio would redistribute some of his responsibilities. "We now have the team in place that can execute on the game plan," he said. "With that done, a lot of the challenge that was mine is taken care of."
For its second quarter, ended March 28, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported a loss of $708 million, compared with a loss of $740 million in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Fed Inaction Sends Dollar Down but Spurs Stock Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday not to raise short-term interest rates knocked the dollar sharply lower and provided only a little relief for the bond market. But the Fed's inaction spurred the stock market, which continues to show an exuberance that may again worry Fed officials.
The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen and the mark after the central bank announced at 2:15 P.M. that it would leave its target for the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent. 
 The dollar's decline restrained the rally in the bond market, analysts said, as traders and investors feared a round of selling by foreign investors because a weaker dollar was eating into their profits or enlarging their losses. The price of the 30-year bond jumped 13/32, to 96 24/32, just after the Fed announcement before retreating to finish the day up 7/32 at 96 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.90 percent from 6.92 percent on Monday.
In the stock market, technology, bank and financial stocks benefited the most, leading the Dow Jones industrial average up 74.58 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,303.46. The Dow was down as much as 76 points earlier in the day but jumped nearly 100 points to within 30 points of its record close after the report of the Fed's decision.
The Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 8.39 points, or 1 percent, to 841.66, less than a half a point below its record close. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared even better, rising 22.64 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,363.88.
While the slumping dollar held back the bond market yesterday, it appeared to help stocks by improving the prospects of many exporters, whose products become more competitive abroad. For example, earnings of I.B.M. -- which led the Dow higher yesterday, surging 5, to 173 3/4 -- could get a lift after its first-quarter profits were held back by the surge of the dollar earlier in the year.
"Bullish spirits remain high," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco. "The fear of missing a rise is much greater than the concern about participating in a painful tumble.
"And when you get a sense of relief, technology tends to be a lead group," he added. "That's where a lot of the excitement has been."
Analysts were split pretty evenly over whether the Fed would act yesterday, and their forecasting of the performance of the economy in the months ahead and how the Fed will react will be just as difficult. But it seems fairly clear that the inaction of the Fed has set financial markets up for six weeks of uncertainty -- and volatile trading -- until the next Fed policy meeting July 2 and 3.
Unless economic data for May confirm the slowdown implied in April's data, the chances of a Fed rate increase this summer will be even greater than they were yesterday.
"The market will be in the same spot on July 2 as it is now -- waiting for the Fed to act," said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities. And the odds of a rate increase, he said, "will change with each new economic report and that will make for choppier trading."
Some stock analysts warned that while the market could climb in the near term, the threat of higher interest rates is still there and means something, given the almost 10 percent plunge in the Dow after the Fed raised interest rates in March.
"There is so little evidence that inflation was looming that they felt that their credibility would have been damaged" by raising rates now, explained Byron Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. But, he added, "the Fed not tightening is not conclusive proof that things are going to remain good."
Yesterday's decline in the dollar accelerated a slump that began on May 2 and that has left the American currency 10.8 percent lower against the yen and 2.7 percent lower against the mark. The dollar's decline this month was started by comments from Japanese finance officials who said the dollar had risen too far and implied that the Government might intervene in markets to bolster the Japanese currency.
That step has not been necessary because traders have been spooked by the comments and hints that the Japanese central bank might raise interest rates soon. It was a new round of such hints that sent the dollar lower in overseas trading early Tuesday. The decision by the Fed not to raise interest rates, which could have supported the dollar by making it a more attractive investment, adds to the near-term woeful outlook for the American currency.
"For right now the dollar is going to be under some pressure," said David Puth, the head of foreign exchange and derivatives in North America at Chase Manhattan Bank. He said that while there was still reason to expect the Fed to raise interest rates in July, the fact that such a move is not certain will be a dollar "negative."
In late trading in New York, the dollar fared the worst against the mark and other European currencies, falling even lower after the Fed's decision than it did in Asian and in early European trading. Against the mark the dollar was at 1.6823, down 1.5 percent from Monday.
Against the yen, the dollar finished at 113.04, down 2.3 percent on the day, but above the intra-day low of nearly 112 hit in overnight trading.
Other advancing stocks yesterday included J.P. Morgan, up 2 3/4, to 105 1/4; American Express, increasing 2 1/8, to 70 3/4; Intel, up 6 1/4, to 161; General Electric, rising 1 1/2, to 62 1/2, and Microsoft, up 4, to 119 1/8.

HEADLINE: Nafta Environmental Lags May Delay Free Trade Expansion

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
During his recent Latin American trip, President Clinton enthusiastically promised to extend free trade throughout the hemisphere. But a delay in an environmental study on the effect of the increased trade that has already taken place is weakening support he will need to get wider trade agreements approved in Congress.
Environmentalists in the United States, Canada and Mexico fear that the delays signal a lack of commitment by the Governments of those countries to monitor the environmental effects of free trade. Such monitoring was a tenet of the side agreements that helped get the North American Free Trade Agreement approved when it was stalled in the United States Congress in 1993. 
 "What this shows is that the side agreements really haven't delivered on commitments made by the Clinton Administration in 1993," said Dan Seligman, an official responsible for trade issues with the Sierra Club in Washington.
The organization originally opposed the passage of Nafta, but the support of other environmental groups was crucial to winning the accord's approval and the Sierra Club ultimately dropped its opposition. Mr. Seligman said the Government's weak support for the environmental agreements makes it unlikely that environmental groups could support expansion of the agreement.
President Clinton has said he will seek Congressional authority to negotiate agreements with Chile and other Latin American nations, but he has not made a commitment to include environmental accords.
"If the commission can't get the countries to study the environmental impacts of increased trade that's already taken place, how can they ever get them to do anything real about improving environmental standards, which is what they promised in 1993," Mr. Seligman said.
The environmental study is a comparatively small part of a comprehensive review of the trade pact and its effects on the United States economy, which by law must be completed this year. President Clinton must report to Congress by July.
Three areas were selected for examination: energy use, cattle raising and, in Mexico, raising corn -- the country's primary agricultural crop.
The study was considered an important milestone because the work was to be done independently of the three Governments. An advisory panel made up mostly of experts and representatives of citizens' groups was supposed to oversee the project.
The $150,000 to finance the study this year is included in the $9 million annual budget of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the organization set up in Montreal to oversee the environmental aspects of Nafta. But while the money has been in the budget since last fall, the three Governments have not given approval for the work to proceed. Trade officials from the United States have raised concerns about the study, but the Mexican Government has most forcefully objected, several people familiar with the negotiations say.
"The trade people in Mexico were nervous about letting any part of the Nafta process out from under their direct and total control," said Daniel C. Esty, now director of the Yale University Center for Environmental Law and Policy, who was the chief negotiator for the Environmental Protection Agency on Nafta.
Mexican officials agreed that the study teams should be independent, but they wanted so much input and oversight that it would have amounted to the ability to censor the reports, an American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said there appeared to be a split between Mexico's Environmental Ministry and the Trade Ministry.
Mario Aguilar, an Environmental Ministry official at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, denied that there was any split in his Government's position. He confirmed that Mexico has objected to the way the study was designed, he rejected any suggestion that there had been an attempt to censor the findings.
"We have doubts about the way the three sectors were chosen," Mr. Aguilar said. "We want the work to have a scientific base, not to deal with politics and opinion."
A member of the group advising the environmental analysis said the three areas were selected after a thorough review of the free trade agreement's first years of operation. "Case studies were needed," said Richard Kamp, director of the Border Ecology Project in Bisbee, Ariz., "to show how investments have taken place and how they have affected society."
The study on corn is considered the most potentially damaging to Mexico, since it deals with the most important staple of nearly every Mexican's diet.
Before Nafta was passed, it was widely predicted that eliminating tariffs over a 15-year period would flood Mexico with imported corn, causing great disruptions as poor farmers gave up their fields and moved to Mexico's cities or across the border.
But the early drafts of the corn study show that while corn imports indeed have already surpassed the 15-year projections, there has been no widespread dislocation.
Alejandro Nadal, a professor of economics at the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City who is conducting the corn study, said he knows why the Mexican Government is worried about the results.
"They want Nafta to work out fine," he said. "But if they start fiddling around with the commission's work, we are going to have problems."

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Allowing Rates To Hold Steady

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy was slowing sufficiently to avert a resurgence of inflation.
The central bank's policy-making body had increased the key short-term rate it controls by a quarter point, to 5.50 percent, at its last meeting two months ago, saying that strong growth and low unemployment were creating the conditions that could push wages and prices higher and endanger the economy's expansion. 
 In passing up the chance today to raise rates again, it heeded, at least for now, warnings from some economists that a further increase would have little economic justification or political support because there is almost no sign that inflation is taking root.
The decision heartened investors, who sent stock prices surging. After falling early in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied after the Federal Reserve's announcement in the early afternoon, closing at 7,303.46, up 74.58 points. Bond prices rose moderately, and the dollar -- which would have become a more attractive investment if interest rates were higher in this country -- fell. [Page D1.]
Analysts said that the Federal Reserve might still feel compelled to raise rates again this year, perhaps at its next policy meeting in July. They said the decision today was driven by clear evidence that economic growth had moderated substantially from the 5.6 percent rate of the first quarter, as well as by reports showing that inflation was almost nonexistent at the producer level and subdued at the consumer level.
Some economists also saw today's decision as evidence of an increased willingness on the part of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to be open to the possibility that the economy could grow without igniting inflation. The alternative to such a decision is to fall back reflexively on the convention that growth rates that are more than about 2.25 percent when unemployment is less than 5 percent will inevitably lead to sharp increases in wages and prices.
"There's an experiment going on here, and the Fed is letting growth roll," said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm.
Mr. Sinai and others said economists were being forced to re-examine their old rules of thumb about growth and inflation because of an array of changes that are reshaping the economy. Huge investments by businesses in new technology appear to have bolstered productivity in ways that official statistics do not capture. Instead of passing cost increases along to consumers, companies increasingly try to wring them out of their own production processes. Workers are more willing to accept modest pay raises, or to tie their compensation to performance or efficiency. The globalization of commerce has intensified competition in many industries.
"So much has changed in our economy that it would be a mistake to assume the old rules apply," Mr. Sinai said. "What Greenspan has shown us again and again in his tenure is the ability to understand how the world does change and still keep his eye on the ball of price-level stability."
Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, came against a backdrop of vociferous opposition to further rate increases from across the political spectrum and from both the business community and organized labor. Opponents argued that in raising rates in March to slow demand by making borrowing more expensive, Mr. Greenspan had gone too far with his policy of eradicating inflationary pressures before they took root. The rate increase caused a sharp selloff in the stock market, which has recovered since then.
While Mr. Greenspan's willingness to hold off on further rate increases no doubt has its limits, today's decision was applauded by many of the groups that had criticized the rate increase in March.
"From living rooms to board rooms, anyone concerned with economic growth and continued high employment can breathe easier," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "The Fed recognized that there is no need to fix an unbroken economy."
In holding rates steady today, the Federal Reserve was clearly betting on a repeat of the events in the economy last year: a period of unusually strong growth followed by a slowdown that bled off any mounting inflationary pressure, averting the need for action.
Still, the risks in the strategy are substantial. The economy grew 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 1996, and then by 5.6 percent in the first three months of this year. With unemployment at 4.9 percent in April, traditional economic forecasts predicted that employers would begin bidding up wages to attract the workers needed to keep increasing their output, and that wage increases would feed through to consumers in the form of higher prices.
At its meeting in March, the Fed decided that the risks of accelerating inflation were sufficient to justify a small step to cool down the economy. It therefore raised the target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
As Mr. Greenspan put it in a speech this month defending the move, "The risk to the economy from inaction came to outweigh the risk from action."
But since then nearly all the economic evidence has suggested that inflation remains well contained, that the consumer spending binge that drove growth earlier in the year has cooled off and that companies have built big inventories that they must sell before placing new orders -- all factors suggesting that the economy is not overheating.
At a minimum, the Federal Reserve decided today that it could afford to wait at least until its July meeting to get a clearer indication of whether the economy was slowing sufficiently on its own to eliminate the inflation threat, analysts said.
"The real question is what the incoming information will look like over the next six weeks," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities.
Analysts said the decision today may also have been influenced by the agreement between the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress on a plan to eliminate the Federal budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan has pushed hard for deficit reduction, saying a credible plan to balance the budget would help bring down interest rates. To raise rates immediately after a bipartisan budget agreement could have undermined the considerable respect Mr. Greenspan enjoys on Capitol Hill, they said.
"Mr. Greenspan has proven himself very adept over the years in sensing which way the political wind is blowing, and apparently he decided that the Fed needed more ammunition before tightening again," economists at First Union Capital Markets said in a report today.

HEADLINE: House Democratic Leader Opposes Clinton's Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, broke with the White House today and said he would oppose the budget deal between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans.
"I do this as a matter of principle," Mr. Gephardt said this afternoon as the House opened debate on its budget resolution. "This is a budget of many deficits: a deficit of principle, a deficit of fairness, a deficit of tax justice, and, worst of all, a deficit of dollars." 
 While significant, Mr. Gephardt's opposition is unlikely to block passage of the budget deal that Mr. Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, signed off on last week.
His decision may influence some of his rank-and-file members, but a majority of Republicans and Democrats in both chambers support the five-year plan, which would balance the Federal budget, offer some of the largest tax breaks in decades and provide billions of dollars for education, social and health programs.
Mr. Gephardt, of St. Louis, is widely expected to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, and his announcement drew a sharp distinction between the two.
In the coming weeks, Mr. Gephardt may wind up on the opposite side of the Clinton-Gore team on several major issues, including extending most-favored-nation trade status to China for another year, which the Administration supports.
Mr. Gephardt has also expressed reservations about giving the White House the "fast track" negotiating authority it wants for a trade agreement with Chile. But the Democratic leader tried to quash the notion that his political positions were influenced by the Presidential race.
"This is not politics, this is not about some election, this is about the future of this country and what is best for it," he said.
Likewise, neither Mr. Gore nor the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, would be drawn into talk about Presidential politics.
"Let's not run the 2000 campaign in 1997," Mr. McCurry told reporters.
And Mr. Gore limited his comments to defense of the budget, saying, "It is a well-reasoned approach, and I think that it is a good approach."
Both the House of Representatives and the Senate began debate today on their budget resolutions, the first legislative step in the budget process and the outline for specific changes to come later.
Mr. Gephardt was the only one of the top four leaders on Capitol Hill to criticize the deal when it was announced last week. From the outset, he has been one of the harshest critics of the tax cuts in the plan, which he says favor the well-to-do.
Before declaring his opposition on the House floor this afternoon, Mr. Gephardt informed the President of his position in a meeting at the White House and met privately with House Democrats for about 90 minutes to argue his case.
His decision placed him on the opposing, and likely losing, side of the most prominent piece of legislation that will be debated this year. But the arguments he made resonate with a majority of Democratic primary voters and with organized labor groups that are the base of his national following.
"I think he has positioned himself excellently to command the liberal base of the Democratic Party in the primaries," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who added that he was "not the least bit worried" that Mr. Gephardt had the clout or support to torpedo the deal.
The package includes $115 billion in savings to the Medicare program and $85 billion worth of tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, broad-based, permanent cuts in the capital gains tax, reductions in the inheritance tax and an expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts.
The proposal also provides $35 billion over five years for post-secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit, all items that the Administration had demanded.
Republican House leaders had expected a vote on the budget resolution tonight, but that timetable fell apart after the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, introduced an amendment that the leaders said would wreck the entire budget deal.
The amendment -- co-sponsored by Representative James L. Oberstar, the senior Democrat on the transportation committee -- would increase spending for Federal highway and mass transit programs by $11.6 billion.
The sponsors proposed offsetting the spending through across-the-board reductions of 0.4 percent in tax cuts and spending. Programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, with mandatory spending, would be exempted from the proposed cuts.
As the idea gained support throughout the day, Republican leaders hastily convened a late night meeting of their rank-and-file to try to quash the amendment and White House negotiators rushed to Capitol Hill to lobby Democrats.
The loudest clamor against the budget has come from hard-line conservatives in the Republican Party and the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma, laid out most of the conservatives' complaints in a letter today to Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Istook criticized the agreement as "a high-risk plan, feasible only if future economic conditions are ideal."
He also complained that the plan would spend too much money, expands entitlement programs, open-ended commitments that finance all who qualify, and fails to provide all of the tax relief being promoted. He urged Speaker Gingrich to reopen negotiations.
"I believe this plan focuses on solving the problems of today's politicians, when it should focus on solving the problems that threaten America's future, to preserve our children's heritage and opportunity," Mr. Istook wrote.
Mr. Gephardt that the assertion that the plan would balance the Federal budget by 2000 was based on "dubious assumptions."
And while stopping well short of criticizing the Administration directly, he said the budget fell short of many of the other goals that its backers assert it will achieve.
While Mr. Clinton has touted a provision that makes $16 billion available to children who lack health insurance, for instance, Mr. Gephardt said the "positive effect" of that program was offset by cuts in Medicaid funding to children's hospitals.
"This compromise gives to children with one hand and takes away with the other," he said.

HEADLINE: The Greenspan Dividend

 BODY:
Wall Street is supposed to react with horror when the Federal Reserve Board cowers from raising interest rates in the face of a raging economy. But yesterday, when the Fed announced it would keep interest rates steady, stocks soared and interest rates fell, a tribute to the market's faith in Chairman Alan Greenspan. Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has presided over nearly uninterrupted growth with steadily falling inflation. His record now gives him the leeway to sit back and let the economy grow without having to prove his anti-inflationary credentials by prematurely jacking up rates and slowing the economy down.
A year or so ago, economists debated whether the economy could operate at unemployment rates below 6 percent without driving up wages, then prices. Today unemployment hovers below 5 percent, while inflation stays below 3 percent. This good news puts the Fed in a policy predicament. It knows that its interest rate hikes take a year or more to cool off an economy. If it waits until inflation visibly rises, it risks having to throw the economy into a tailspin to wring out the inflationary momentum. But by stamping out inflation before it appears, the Fed would forgo learning whether the modern economy can operate at permanently lower unemployment rates than in the past. 
 The Fed has decided to see how good the economy can be, allowing unemployment to drop to the lowest rate in 23 years, 4.9 percent. But it could not have done so had Mr. Greenspan not firmly established his credibility as an inflation fighter by pre-emptively raising interest rates in 1994 to ward off an inflationary burst that he feared but that had not yet appeared.
Had bond traders feared inflation, they would have greeted yesterday's non-action by driving up long-term interest rates, which the Fed does not control. They did not. The economy now reaps the benefit of the Fed's record. At an unemployment rate of 5 rather than 6 percent, the economy is already operating with an extra one million jobs. The Fed has now said, in effect, that it is prepared to test how low the rate can go.

HEADLINE: PLAN TO PAY OFF U.N. DUES STALLS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's proposal to pay $1 billion in dues owed to the United Nations has run aground in Congress. Republicans are insisting on paying only some of the debt, over a longer stretch of time and only after the United Nations agrees to a series of demands.
Proposals circulating in the House and the Senate would require everything from permanently reducing Washington's annual dues, while raising China's, to slashing the expense accounts of ranking officials. 
 Under the proposals, which have the backing of the Republican leadership in both houses, the United Nations would also have to reimburse the cost of American military equipment and support for peacekeeping operations, to impose still more budget restraints and even to allow the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to check the organization's books.
While the billion-dollar battle raged in Washington, in New York, the American delegate to the United Nations discussed the diplomatic immunity as applied to traffic tickets, an issue that has rankled New Yorkers. [Page A8.]
If Republicans have their way, Washington will pay the back dues -- the total is being debated -- over as many as five years instead of the two years that the Administration proposed. And the President would have to certify that the United Nations had met the conditions. "It's not going to be a payment up front with good intentions in the back," said Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota, a Republican who has been involved in drafting the proposals. "We have to say it loud and clear: the arrears will be paid only when the reforms are made."
The Administration, in quiet negotiations with Republican leaders, has opposed many of the conditions. And while it has agreed in principle to others -- including a reduction in the United States' yearly dues for general expenses and peacekeeping operations -- it has opposed writing them into law.
To do so, officials argue, would leave the State Department little flexibility in negotiations with the United Nations over changes in the organization's budget or bureaucracy. "It is a level of micromanagement by statute that is unprecedented," a senior Administration official said today.
At the United Nations, the proposals are encountering heated criticism from diplomats who have grown increasingly resentful that the United States will not come up with dues that it is bound by treaty to pay, even as it issues new dictates.
"We feel quite frankly that it is preposterous to put any conditions to the repayment of arrears, which the United States should pay under international law," said Nicolaas H. Biegman, the representative of the Netherlands at the United Nations. "It's as simple as that."
The wrangling between the Administration and the Republicans over how to pay the dues comes only months after the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, swept through Washington, promising to impose reforms and receiving pledges that the United States would finally pay up.
At the time, the election of Mr. Annan, a direct result of the United States campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, appeared to brighten the prospects for payment of the dues, most of which date back to 1994.
But the United Nations remains a target of many Republicans on Capitol Hill despite the Administration's newly vigorous campaign, led by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to persuade Congress to pay the dues.
There is even a bill before the House that would bar any payment, based on the argument that the United States should have been credited for all of its contributions of military materiel to peacekeeping efforts. That legislation, introduced by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett of Maryland and sponsored by more than 60 others, has little chance of passing, but it underscores the difficulty of winning support for paying the dues.
The Republican proposals are included in a series of bills with similar, though not identical, conditions on paying the dues, including one introduced by Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, and another by Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine.
The staff of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also drafting a series of demands. Senator Helms's demands carry added significance, since he has insisted, an aide said, on attaching them to the legislation authorizing the State Department's entire budget, as well as to President Clinton's proposal to reorganize the department and the other foreign affairs agencies.
Mr. Helms's proposals -- a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by Senate aides -- would pay the dues in installments over five years and set specific conditions or "benchmarks" for the United Nations to meet each year.
In the first year, for example, the organization would have to agree to erase all outstanding debt owed by the United States. That is sure to be controversial, since the organization argues that the United States owes far more than the $1 billion that the Clinton Administration recognizes.
By the second year, the United Nations would have to cap United States dues at 20 percent of the general operating budget, compared with 25 percent now, and at 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget, compared with more than 30 percent now.
By the end of the five years, the United Nations would have to accept increased auditing, start setting expiration dates on programs, consolidate the myriad environmental and development organizations and eliminate those dealing with regional economic and social affairs.
The proposal would also require the affiliated international organizations, like the World Health Organization, to reduce their budgets.
If the United Nations failed to enact any of the changes, the United States would simply not pay that year's installment.
The Administration has held a series of negotiations with Republicans in the House and Senate to try to work out an agreement on the language of the demands.
Princeton N. Lyman, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, said the Administration hoped to reach an accord with Congress that included "a set of benchmarks that are achievable," though some of those proposed by the Republicans were clearly not.
Another senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Administration could not accept repaying the dues over five years or cementing reforms of an international body into American law, which would have the effect of making them appear to be ultimatums.
"To lock it in will only cause other countries to refuse to negotiate," the official said.
But Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees United Nations issues, said Congress had an obligation to set rigorous conditions, since the United States paid the largest share of the organization's budget.
"Since we're carrying the load," he said, "we have some right to demand that the tax dollars be spent in an appropriate way."

Need for Jewish Housing Is Questioned by U.S.
American diplomats have found high vacancy rates in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, casting doubt on the Israeli Government's claim that it is expanding the settlements to accommodate natural growth. Such expansions have angered the Palestinians and hindered peace efforts. A1 

G.O.P. Fights U.N. Dues
Republicans in Congress have skewered the Clinton Administration's proposal to pay $1 billion in dues the United States owes the United Nations. They demand that the United States' annual dues be permanently reduced while increasing those of China. A1
 
United Nations diplomats in New York City said they faced growing hostility since the uproar over their parking tickets. A8
 
Kabila Arrives in Kinshasa
Unannounced and discreetly, Laurent Kabila, Congo's new President, arrived in Kinshasa to take over the capital. But he did not announce the composition of his Government, which had been expected. A3
 
Support for Organ Donors
The top religious authority in Egypt reversed the prevailing interpretation of Islamic rules by saying that he was willing to donate his organs when he died. But conservative Muslims scoffed that the cleric, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, had been appointed as Grand Sheik of Al Azhar, the center of learning in Sunni Islam, by the secular Government to do its bidding. A6
 
Scandal Surfaces in Brazil
The Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been accused of paying five Congressmen nearly a million dollars to vote for a constitutional amendment that would allow a President to run for re-election. A daily newspaper published what it said were transcripts of secret tape recordings in which two Congressmen discussed receiving payoffs. A9
 
Qaddafi Gets Mild Rebuke
The United Nations Security Council mildly rebuked Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi for violating an international flight ban against his country. In a statement, the council said it "takes note with concern" reports that the Libyan leader had flown to Niger and Nigeria earlier this month. (Reuters)
 
Taliban Makes Advance
Local residents said three provinces in Afghanistan had fallen to the Taliban, an Islamic militant group that has imposed strict rules on the two-thirds of the country it already controls. The loss of the three northwestern provinces of Badghis, Faryab and Sar-e-Paul seriously threatened the anti-Taliban alliance led by Gen. Rashid Dostum, and aid workers said heavy fighting was only four miles from his stronghold in Mazar-e-Sharif. (AP)

Senate Votes to Prohibit Method for Late Abortions
The Senate voted to ban a late-term abortion procedure, but the bill's supporters fell three votes short of the number needed to override the veto expected from President Clinton. While the vote may mark only incremental progress for abortion opponents, they gained some ground in the larger abortion debate. A1
 
Birdlike Dinosaur Is Found
A team of Argentine paleontologists reported finding what appears to be the most birdlike dinosaur ever found. Its anatomy appears to be intermediate between dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx, the earliest known bird. The new fossil animal has been named Unenlagia comahuensis, which means "half bird from northwest Patagonia" in the language of the Mapuche Indians of the region. A18
 
Gephardt Opposes Budget Deal
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, said he would oppose the budget deal between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans. Mr. Gephardt's opposition is unlikely to block passage of the proposal. But Mr. Gephardt is widely considered as a likely challenger to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, and his announcement draws a sharp distinction between him and his potential rival. B7
 
Health Care Bill Criticized
Republican senators attacked a children's health insurance bill proposed by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. They said the higher Federal tax it would put on tobacco would cut cigarette sales, costing the states more than $1 billion in annual revenues. The bill's sponsors intend to offer it on Wednesday as an amendment to the budget resolution. A20
 
E.P.A. Targets Mills' Pollution
The Environmental Protection Agency wants to force paper mills to make big reductions in their emissions of dioxins and other toxic chemicals into the water and air, at an estimated cost of $1.4 billion.

Appeals Court Tells Judges To Make Juries Follow Law
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in Manhattan that judges had a duty to insure that jurors did not ignore the law and impose their own values to acquit or convict a defendant. The decision comes at a time when the legal community is embroiled in a continuing debate over race and the justice system, and whether it is ever appropriate for jurors to acquit a defendant as a protest against a perceived lack of fairness in the justice system, which is called "jury nullification."

4 Charged in School Rape
Four teen-agers were arrested and charged with gang-raping a 14-year-old girl after luring her from a public high school cafeteria to an unused classroom, the authorities said. The girl had reported the attack to school authorities a month ago, but a member of the school's staff, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there had been doubts about her account. A1
 
Thousands Rally for Rent Rules
Thousands of tenants converged on the state Capitol to show support for extending New York's rent regulations. They protesters also demonstrated their opposition to Governor Pataki's proposal for a system that would remove rent protections from apartments when the tenants moved out or died. The crowd was the largest seen in Albany since State University students protested tuition increases two years ago. B1
 
Same Proposal, Different Vote
Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee approved legislation that would allow Broome County to eliminate its sales tax on clothing, even though they are resisting a similar proposal from Mayor Giuliani for New York City.

Jobless Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City's high unemployment rate did not budge in April, remaining stuck at 9.7 percent, even as a booming national economy pushed down unemployment rates to low levels elsewhere around the country. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.3 percent was also unchanged.
Nationally, only 4.9 percent of Americans were unemployed in April, the lowest level in 23 years. The gap between New York City's jobless rate and that of the rest of the nation -- 4.8 percentage points in April -- is now the largest it has been in at least 19 years, according the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The previous record gap, of 4.5 percentage points, was set in March 1997. 
 The New York State Labor Department said that on a snapshot month-to-month basis, not adjusted for seasonal variations, the picture looked better for both the city and the state. Statewide the number of service jobs, construction, and retail and wholesale trade jobs all rose, while banks and insurance companies reduced their job totals.
New Jersey reported last week that its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April dropped to 5.2 percent from 5.5 percent in March. Connecticut has not reported its April rate yet, but its unemployment rate in March stood at 4.9 percent. KIRK JOHNSON

Aid Lags, Indian Colleges Say

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Leaders of the United States' Indian-run colleges say Federal support has failed to keep up with rising enrollments that are likely to swell further as an overhaul in welfare programs drives more American Indians to seek job training.
The leaders hoped that a new report on tribal colleges being released today would again call attention to their role in moving Indians out of poverty and into higher education. 
 The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said the tribal colleges, mostly two-year institutions, excelled at job training, business creation and community building even though money and buildings were scarce.
"Despite overwhelming obstacles, America's tribal colleges are educating thousands of our people, providing them with perhaps their only chance of economic self-sufficiency," said Janine Pease-Pretty On Top, president of Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency, Mont.
Total enrollment in tribal colleges nationally has shot up to more than 24,000 in 1996 from about 10,000 in 1989. Yearly Federal support for the institutions has remained at about $27 million since 1995, although President Clinton wants to raise that amount by $3 million in 1998.
The amount of support, about $2,890 per full-time student, is less than the $5,820 authorized in the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978.
Robert Lorence, president of Northwest Indian College on the Lummi Reservation outside Bellingham, Wash., said the Indian institutions often served as bridges to four-year colleges.
Mr. Lorence said that his 650-student college struggled largely with teaching basic reading, math, and writing, and that the demand on basic training would rise.
"I'm assuming welfare reform will include some additional funds for training," Mr. Lorence said, "but I haven't seen where that is or how it will come from the colleges."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
SENATOR JOSEPH R. McCARTHY was not known as a connoisseur. But from time to time he would, said one of his chroniclers, employ a phrase worthy of inclusion in any anthology of culinary bons mots. Asked how he liked his steak, Tailgunner Joe would reply, "Charred -- like the soul of an unbeliever."
Much has changed since the Junior Senator from Wisconsin left us in 1954, but most folks still prefer their grilled meat carbonized, at least on the outside. To the wine lover, this preference poses a dilemma: forgo the grape entirely or come up with something short of cleaning fluid that marries well -- as the food esthetes say -- with charred meat. 
 A third alternative, steaks and chops rare all the way through, which might stand a better chance with wine, can be dismissed out of hand. It's un-American.
Not too long ago, real men, the major consumers of grilled meats, did not drink wine. For me, at least, this perception changed in 1985, when the late Paul Castellano was gunned down on East 46th Street in Manhattan on his way into Sparks Steak House. Mr. Castellano was, as they say, a major underworld figure, a calling in which manliness is highly valued and readily demonstrated by mayhem, which is not always convenient, and by eating steaks.
Since Sparks happens to have a great wine list, Mr. Castellano's demise, whatever else it accomplished, established once and for all a relationship between red meat and wine. Had he made it inside, he almost certainly would have ordered wine, probably Chianti, a variety much favored in his set, as anyone who listens to court-ordered tapes will attest.
Probably a Chianti, but then, Sparks' owner, Pat Cetta, is skilled at steering even the most hide-bound meat-eaters in new directions. The best Chiantis, like the best Bordeaux, are not always the best choices to go with grilled steaks and chops. They can be too subtle, too nuanced.
Granted, skilled chefs and cooks, working with the best meat and professional broilers, can prepare a steak that won't overshadow an elegant wine. But for the most part, grilled meats, and particularly those prepared by backyard amateurs, need big, assertive wines that can hold their own in any company: syrahs from all over the world, barolos and other wines from the Piedmont, petite sirahs from California, any reds from the Rhone Valley, South African pinotages and, most important, muscular zinfandels, also from California.
Zinfandel is a red grape with European roots, but it achieved its own identity in this country long before any other important variety and has been adopted, one could say, as America's own. And since, along with Argentina, we are one of the few nations seriously hooked on grilled meat, it seems only fitting that zinfandel should be our designated grilled-meat wine.
Mind you, not white zinfandel -- a sweet, slightly fizzy, pale pink concoction, more akin to soft drinks than to wine, that at times isn't even made from zinfandel grapes. Real zinfandel is a gutsy red wine, full of spice and fruit flavors and often fairly high in alcohol. Most wines these days average between 11.5 and 13.5 percent alcohol. Zinfandels regularly reach 15 percent alcohol, and some recent monsters from De Loach Vineyards in Sonoma County have gone as high as 17.5 percent.
Delicious wines, but not for the faint of heart or for anyone driving home from the picnic.
Zinfandel can display all the finesse of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, but even the most elegant of the breed will also be full-flavored, ready to hold up to any steak, lamb chop or loin of pork -- overdone, underdone or just right.
Stockbrokers, especially successful ones, can be enthusiastic steak eaters, which, in good times like these, can lead to excess. A few months ago, around bonus time, two Young Turks were spotted at Wollensky's Grill on 49th Street, just off Third Avenue, lunching on hamburgers and Chateau Pichon-Lalande 1970. One evening around the same time, a group of eight young men, at the Post House on East 63d Street, chose to pair their steaks with a jeroboam -- eight bottles in one -- of Robert Mondavi Reserve cabernet sauvignon.
Stock market hubris has its own rules. Under less dramatic conditions, say, around the trusty Weber grill in the backyard, more modest wines should be the order of the day. And not just for economic reasons. An unsubtle grilled steak really calls for an unsubtle wine: one of those De Loach zinfandels, for example, or one from Ravenswood, Fetzer, Rodney Strong, Kendall-Jackson or Ridge. From northern Italy, a Gattinara from Travaglini or a spanna from Dessilani would work well. So would a southern Italian red like Taurino's Notarpanaro. From France, a hearty Cote du Rhone or a Gigondas from Guigal would honor any cookout, as would a solid shiraz from Rosemount, in Australia.
These are all easy-going wines at, generally, easy-going prices, many of them at or around $10. Which means that stocking enough for a crowd is not going to be a problem. It's important to be well stocked: people get impatient waiting for the fire to get hot. And if the steak doesn't turn out as planned, well, these are all wines that will go well with the pizza when it arrives 30 minutes later as a backup.

TASTINGS
Paul Thomas Cabernet-Merlot 1995 (Washington State). About $10.
 
Like many Pacific Northwest winemakers, Paul Thomas started out with fruit wine -- in his case, Crimson Rhubarb. He moved into grapes in the late 1970's and began a few years ago to turn out some interesting wines. Washington winemakers have always emphasized that their growing conditions are more Bordeaux-like than those in California. Their leaner, less aggressive wines tend to prove the point. They may not have the full-bodied richness of the California wines, but, at their best, they display complexity and nuance that their cousins to the south sometimes lack. This blend skillfully combines cabernet structure and merlot roundness in an extremely pleasant package. The blend is 57 percent cabernet and 43 percent merlot. And the price is not unattractive, either.

HEADLINE: Time to Get Big Sugar Off the Public Dole

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alfonso Fanjul and J. Pepe Fanjul, owners of a Florida sugar company, claim that "there is no subsidy" for American sugar growers (letter, May 14). This may come as a surprise to American consumers, who are forced by our Government to pay the Fanjuls almost twice the world price for their sugar. 
 The program provides sugar processors with special loans, and limits fair competition with strict import quotas. The General Accounting Office says that as a result, the sugar program costs consumers $1.4 billion a year in higher food prices. Contrary to the Fanjuls' letter, the Department of Agriculture has endorsed the G.A.O. study, saying that it is "a reasonable report with no major data problems."
The Fanjuls' massive subsidies encourage and intensify production in South Florida, further degrading the Everglades and increasing the cost of restoration by $65 million to $120 million, according to the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Congress has ended welfare as we know it for poor Americans. It's time to do the same for the Fanjuls and for other corporations on the public dole.

HEADLINE: Judging Beef By Its Grade, Cut and Eating Habits

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
STEAK on the grill turns a meal into a feast, the way Memorial Day turns a May weekend into summer.
The growing legion of steak lovers who want that steakhouse experience at home have more choices than ever when it comes to finding a good steak to put on the grill. First there is the matter of choosing the cut. Then, deciding on the grade. And increasingly, another option has become the brand name. Some brands of beef are "natural," that is, raised without hormones or antibiotics. 
 For steak, the best cuts are what the beef industry calls the middle cuts: the ribs, the loins and the flank, from the center of the steer. The less-tender end cuts like the chuck and the round come from around the animal's legs, where the muscles are heavier.
Shoppers who buy steak apparently know which are the best cuts. More than two-thirds select sirloin, shell, rib, T-bone, porterhouse, flank and tenderloin steaks, according to studies conducted by NPD, a market research company in Park Ridge, Ill. These cuts generally cost two to three times as much as the end cuts, about $10 or more a pound.
All the middle cuts are fine for grilling. Which one to buy is a matter of taste, serving size and budget. The loin is most often cut into strip or shell steaks. Sometimes called New York strips, these are the most popular in steakhouses and in stores. Porterhouse steaks are also from the loin and yield two or more servings. A T-bone steak is a smaller version of the porterhouse.
The tenderloin, or fillet, is a soft piece of boneless loin with relatively little fat that is usually sliced into individual filets mignons for grilling. A rib steak, which the French call entrecote, has the richest flavor, and also the most fat. The flank steak, a large flat slab of boneless meat, is economical, at about half the price of the other steaks. But it must be sliced thin on the bias, or it will be tough.
The sirloin can also be cut into large slabs that provide several servings. In his new book, "Steak Lover's Cookbook" (Workman, $13.95), William Rice explains that a big sirloin steak with a small, circular bone or pin bone will be more tender than a sirloin steak with a large, flat bone.
After deciding on the cut, the next option is the grade. The United States Agriculture Department grades beef based largely on the amount of fat marbling, the fat running through the meat, which enhances tenderness. It is a critical feature for a piece of meat that is seared over high heat rather than cooked slowly to break down the tissues. Though the department has eight categories for grading, shoppers can choose from only the top three: prime, choice and select.
More than half opt for choice, the most widely sold grade. About a third prefer select, which is leaner, cheaper and not as tender.
Prime is the beef with the most marbling, which makes it more flavorful and tender. It is also the costliest. Only about 2 percent of all the beef produced in this country these days is graded prime. Most is sold to the top steakhouses, so there is not much available for the home cook.
"The New York market is an exception," said Susan Parenty, a director of communications for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group. "The New York area probably consumes three times as much prime as anywhere else in the country and you can probably find it more easily."
New York still has about 10 butcher shops that sell prime beef. Elsewhere, mail-order companies are another good source.
Sales of brand-name beef, which first came on the market in 1979, have steadily increased, especially in the last few years, as producers take their cue from the chicken industry, their main competition. Last year, nearly half the supermarkets in the country carried some kind of brand-name beef, but it still accounts for less than 5 percent of the beef produced in this country. Almost all chicken is now sold by brand.
About half the brand-name beef is Certified Angus Beef, which is from the Angus breed of cattle and raised according to the standards set by the Certified Black Angus Beef Program in Wooster, Ohio. Certified Angus Beef is graded by the Agriculture Department to be at the high end of the choice range, closer to being prime than select, said a spokeswoman, Crystal Meyer.
Beef that is free of growth hormones and antibiotics is called "natural" and is sold in about 16 percent of supermarkets.
Coleman's, a brand of natural beef raised by a producer in Denver, is now being sold at Food Emporium, A&P, Waldbaum's, King Kullen, Shop Rite, Grand Union and Fresh Fields markets in the New York area. Coleman's, which sells prime, choice and select beef, has experienced double-digit increases in sales since 1993.
Since beef consumption hit its low of 61.6 pounds a person in 1993, it has been slowly increasing, mainly because of increased steakhouse traffic. Last year, it was 64.7 pounds, or 10 pounds a person less than it was a decade ago.
Niman Schell, a company based in Bolinas, Calif., near San Francisco that has been producing natural beef since 1979, recently began selling some of its beef at retail, outside the San Francisco area. It can be ordered from the Williams-Sonoma catalogue for $15 a pound. In Manhattan, it is sold at the Vinegar Factory for around $14 a pound, depending on the cut.
Niman Schell beef is dry-aged for three to six months before being shipped, to enhance its flavor, making it richer and earthier. Some steak-lovers like the taste. In March, Food Emporium supermarkets in Manhattan started selling choice beef that has been dry-aged for three weeks, which costs about $2 a pound more than the chain's regular choice steaks.
Steaks that are about one and a half inches thick produce the best results on the grill or under a broiler. Thinner steaks are better seared on top of the stove in a ridged cast-iron grill pan. A steak that is two inches thick or more may become too charred on the outside before it is cooked to the desired degree of doneness inside.
 
When Is It Done?
THE Agriculture Department recommends cooking beef to an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees, the temperature at which most potentially dangerous microorganisms are destroyed. It calls meat at this degree of doneness "medium rare," meat at 160 degrees "medium" and meat at 170 degrees "well done."
But do the Government's criteria for safety match up with most steak-lovers' tastes or with common restaurant practices?
As a test, Victor H. Chavez, the executive chef at Smith & Wollensky, the Manhattan steakhouse, broiled four prime boneless 16-ounce New York strips the way he usually does. The degree of doneness was based mostly on timing. As soon as the steaks came out of the broiler, they were tested with an instant thermometer. The rare steak registered 120 to 125 degrees; the medium rare, 130 to 135, and the medium steak, 145, still light pink in the center but going to gray-brown at the edges. The medium-well steak was 150 to 155 degrees. There was a difference of 15 degrees between the Government and the steakhouse.
Harold McGee in "On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen" (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984) said, "We usually define the doneness of red meats not by their temperature, but by their inner color." The Government, more interested in safety than palatability, uses temperature, not color, as the guide. Mr. McGee writes that heating meat to temperatures of more than 140 degrees gradually makes it more solid, dense and dry, and the pigment increasingly drab. "That is why rare meat is pink and juicy, well-done meat brown-gray and dry," he said.
The way the steaks were cooked by Mr. Chavez is typical of most steakhouses. It is also the way people who want their beef medium rare are likely to cook it at home. "When people order a steak, they know how they like it and we have to cook it that way," Mr. Chavez said. "Lately, we have been getting more requests for meat a little more cooked, more medium rare to medium, instead of rare. Maybe people think it's safer."
The home cook also has to decide whether to play it safe and follow Government guidelines, or to indulge in rare or medium rare, knowing there may be a risk.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Grain and Soybean Prices Fall On Reports of Early Planting

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply yesterday after the Government reported that planting was proceeding at a near-record pace, bolstering farmers' chances of producing bumper fall harvests.
In other commodity markets, copper and palladium futures rose to new highs after Federal Reserve policy makers left United States interest rates unchanged. Coffee futures fell sharply for a third session on increasing supplies. 
 Farmers, as of Sunday, had put 88 percent of the corn crop into the ground, compared with the five-year average of 67 percent at this time of year, the United States Department of Agriculture reported late Monday.
Farmers also had sowed 46 percent of the soybean crops -- 20 percentage points above average, the department reported.
The earlier farmers get crops into the ground, the greater the chance of bumper crops. In 1994, for example, there was a record corn harvest after planting was 84 percent complete in mid-May.
Wheat futures retreated sharply despite declining winter wheat conditions. Western Kansas is expected to get rain, which could provide a late boost to the crop shortly before harvesting begins, analysts said.
Soybeans for July delivery fell 22 cents, to $8.44 a bushel; July corn fell 8.25 cents, to $2.7625 a bushel, and July wheat fell 14.75 cents, to $3.80 a bushel.
Copper and palladium futures prices rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Fed left interest rates unchanged, fueling speculation that demand for the metals would increase as economic growth continues.
Palladium and copper, used in electronics, construction, automobiles and computers, would benefit heavily from cheaper interest rates.
June palladium rose $3.75, to $181.75 an ounce, the highest since April 1995. July copper was up 2 cents, to $1.178 a pound, the highest since May 16, 1996.
Coffee futures continued their retreat from 20-year highs on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York as supplies of arabica beans increased.
The exchange reported late Monday that inventories at its warehouses rose to 47,192 bags from 41,682 on Friday. Warehouse supplies have grown by nearly 25,000 bags since May 6.
A meeting of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which accounts for 80 percent of the world's production, also weighed heavily on the market. Analysts speculated that the group would announce today that it had loosened its self-imposed export quotas, allowing producers to sell more coffee if prices rise above a certain level.

Brokerage on Move (But Not Out of City)

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Fahnestock & Company, a securities brokerage based in Manhattan, is moving from one downtown office tower to another, with more than $1.3 million in assistance from city and state agencies.
Fahnestock's 398 employees will move from 110 Wall Street to 125 Broad Street, where the company has leased 69,000 square feet for 15 years at about $25 per square foot, people involved in the transaction said. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a package of incentives yesterday intended to keep the company from leaving the city. The incentives include at least $500,000 in sales tax exemptions and $400,000 in energy discounts, an extra $250,000 in sales tax exemptions if the company hires 125 more workers, and $440,000 in cash grants from the state's Empire State Development Corporation.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which negotiated the incentives, said Fahnestock had been "aggressively" courted by the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development, on behalf of the owners of One Harmon Meadow Boulevard, a five-story office building in Secaucus. New Jersey had offered about "four times" the New York package, Mr. Millard said.
A spokeswoman for the New Jersey agency declined to comment.
Fahnestock & Company drew notice recently for selling $55 million in bonds backed by anticipated future royalties from the recordings of David Bowie. It is a unit of Fahnestock Viner Holdings, a Canadian public corporation.
125 Broad Street, a 40-story tower that was the headquarters of American Express, then part of the Olympia & York real estate empire, was converted to a condominium in 1995 after Olympia & York turned it over to the building's lender, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell and the insurance company Johnson & Higgins, both tenants, own about 80 percent of the building. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union bought two of the remaining floors. The Fahnestock & Company lease leaves just two floors vacant, according to William D. Brodsky of Insignia/Edward S. Gordon, who represented New York Broad Holding Inc., which owns six floors in the building.

HEADLINE: New York Is Still No. 1 -- in Taxes

BYLINE: By Raymond J. Keating; Raymond J. Keating is chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee and author of "New York by the Numbers."

DATELINE: CENTER MORICHES, N.Y.

 BODY:
Last year there were 2.8 million private-sector jobs in New York City, down from 3.2 million in 1969. This means that New York City, once the most dynamic city economy in the world, has not created a net new job in more than a quarter century.
The cause of this decline is no mystery: City taxes and regulations are onerous, and have combined with uncontrolled municipal spending and debt to cool the private sector's entrepreneurial fires. The greatest culprits have been the city's taxes on personal income, corporate income and unincorporated businesses, all adopted under Mayor John Lindsay in 1966. Unfortunately, no current city official seems to grasp how damaging these tax policies are. 
 At first glance, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears to understand the problem. He eliminated the commercial rent tax throughout the city except for Manhattan south of 96th Street, where the top effective tax rate has been cut from 6 percent to 4.5 percent. And his new budget proposes cutting that top tax rate again, to 3.9 percent.
The Mayor has also pushed through a few minor tax reductions, including a cut in the city hotel tax, from 6 percent to 5 percent (on top of the 8.25 percent city sales tax and $2 per night flat fee), and a property tax cut for co-op and condo owners. He has proposed eliminating the city's 4 percent tax on clothing purchases under $500 and slightly raising the limit on annual income that is exempt from the unincorporated business tax.
These are steps in the right direction. Indeed, last year the city's private sector created jobs at a greater rate than the national average. But before anyone rushes to induct Mayor Giuliani into the pro-growth hall of fame, consider the flip side of the tax coin.
New York City still has the highest combined state and city personal income taxes in the nation. It imposes the highest capital gains tax rate (11.3 percent), the highest corporate income tax rate (19.4 percent), and the highest income and capital gains taxes on unincorporated entrepreneurs (15.3 percent). Not only has Mr. Giuliani done next to nothing to reduce these levies, he has helped to keep them high.
Remember that during the 1994 Governor's race, Mr. Giuliani opposed George Pataki's proposed cut in state personal income taxes, predicting dire consequences for the city. This year the Mayor has been silent about Governor Pataki's proposed four-year extension of the 17 percent tax surcharge that city businesses pay to keep the Metropolitan Transit Authority running -- in effect, a four-year tax increase of $2 billion.
Twice during his tenure Mr. Giuliani has extended the city's "temporary" surcharges on the personal income tax, refusing to allow the overall top tax rate to drop from 4.5 percent to 3.4 percent. Extending these surcharges will bring in about $2.2 billion from 1996 to 1998.
Even if Mr. Giuliani actually gets the tax cuts called for in his budget, during 1997 and 1998 he will be responsible for a two-year net tax increase on individuals and businesses of approximately $575 million. If you want to add in the Mayor's quiet collaboration on the extension of transit authority surcharge, then the net tax increase for 1997 and 1998 will likely be more than $1.5 billion.
Mr. Giuliani's supporters claim that he is making progress, that he cannot do what needs to be done and still be re-elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. If true, then we should expect to see a voracious tax cutter emerge if the Mayor wins a second term this November; the city's new term limits law will not allow him a third term.
In fact, it would also be smart politics to pursue such a strategy, if his ambitions extend beyond the liberal bastion of New York City.

HEADLINE: Bridging a Gap In the Resume;
When H.I.V. Loosens Grip, It's Back to the Job Market

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
A year and a half ago, a 49-year-old man named Robert was planning his funeral instead of his future. His skin had become infected with festering pimples that refused to heal. His weight had dropped precipitously. He found it physically draining to visit old friends who were also dying of AIDS, fading like wilted flowers. He thought of death constantly.
But earlier this month, there he was, robust and tan in a blue T-shirt and khakis, pondering three job offers and attending a new evening seminar on H.I.V. in the workplace, sponsored by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest AIDS service agency. 
 In a stark white conference room typically used by social workers to help H.I.V.-infected people arrange a safety net of benefits for their death, he was feeling the wonderment of contemplating a return to work after two years on disability.
Powerful new AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors have reduced the lethal virus in his blood to undetectable levels. Now Robert, who used to earn $70,000 a year in real estate and architectural design, hopes to have a new job by the end of May.
"It's like being resurrected," said Robert, who spoke on the condition that he not be fully identified because he feared prospective employers had misperceptions about AIDS. "I feel like a child."
Medical breakthroughs have left G.M.H.C. and other AIDS service agencies across the country suddenly grappling with fragile hope.
Even as they continue to assist ailing clients who do not have access to the life-prolonging treatments or have failed to benefit by them, the agencies are quietly reinventing themselves in concrete and practical ways to keep pace with thousands of people like Robert. For the first time since the beginning of the epidemic 16 years ago, the agencies are creating new classes, like how to deal with renewed health, and shifting the focus of others from finding a funeral home to finding a paycheck.
At G.M.H.C. in Chelsea, workplace issues have dominated the discussion in seminars and workshops in recent months. New classes deal with subjects like the rights of employees with H.I.V. and how to return to the workplace.
"That's all that everybody is talking about," said Lillie Mikesell, a G.M.H.C. spokeswoman. "It's all just exploded."
In San Francisco, AIDS Benefits Counselors, which used to be in the business of preparing clients for disability and death, now manages an employment service and has seen demand for job skills and placement workshops nearly triple since January.
In Atlanta, AID Atlanta, a nonprofit service agency, has conducted a series of free public forums since November to help clients with AIDS navigate the challenges of renewed health. The forums have broached everything from artfully accounting for enormous gaps in resumes (list accomplishments, putting the sizzle up front, rather than jobs in chronological order) to understanding changes in corporate culture and lingo (team leaders, not managers). For the first in the series of six public forums, a few dozen people were expected, but 200 showed up.
"We're in an incredibly pivotal time in the epidemic where we are looking at how to help people live rather than how to help them die," said Sandy Thurman, President Clinton's new director of the National Office on AIDS Policy. "It's a huge shift logistically as well as psychologically."
Even as AIDS comes to feel for some people more like a chronic disease than a death sentence, the shifting role of AIDS agencies has become a touchy subject to service providers. There are still many unknowns about the new drugs, like how long they will remain effective. But as the needs of clients change, some AIDS organizations are likely to be put out of business.
As lower-income minorities rather than white middle-class gay men have become the prime target of AIDS, racially charged tension has increased over the role that leading AIDS service agencies should play and where resources should be invested, according to patient advocates and researchers.
"There is an absolute need to help those who are now finding themselves healthier," said Mario Cooper, the founder of Leading for Life, an initiative to increase political involvement in AIDS issues among blacks, and a board member of the Harvard AIDS Institute and G.M.H.C. "But at the same time," she said, "the majority of those with H.I.V., increasing amounts of people of color, have absolutely no access to anything, period."
Viewing the availability of protease inhibitors as a new lease on life is premature for some, according to Linda Campbell, executive director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS, the oldest minority AIDS service organization in New York.
"Many of our clients have been unemployed for long periods of time and because of despair and issues of inequity have turned to drugs as a way of dealing with the horrors of everyday life," Ms. Campbell said. "For our clients, we still have to think a lot about what supports that people out of the mainstream have. What does their future look like? What is the promise of the future for our clients, given the realities of how the local, state and Federal governments are now rolling back their commitment to social support."
Officials at agencies like G.M.H.C. said they still have an important role to play for dying people, which include many low-income, minority and heterosexual clients. But they say they cannot ignore the changed reality. G.M.H.C. estimates that roughly 70 percent of its clients have taken protease inhibitors.
On a recent Tuesday evening, nearly 20 men and women filled a conference room at Gay Men's Health Crisis. Marla Hassner, a managing attorney there, was guiding them through their rights as H.I.V.-positive employees. Several in the group scribbled notes as the talk turned from insurance benefits to pre-employment interviews and disclosure of H.I.V. status to employers.
Ms. Hassner advised them against disclosing their H.I.V.-positive status to employers, saying the only reasons to do so were if they applied for disability or sought a disability-related adjustment to their job.
"Often disclosing status causes more trouble than it is worth," she said. "Your employer is not your friend. The law doesn't require companies to treat us with compassion."
One man in an elegant gray suit wanted suggestions on how to ask prospective employers about disability benefits without disclosing his H.I.V.-positive status. The lawyer recommended scooping up the summary plan descriptions of all the employer's insurance policies, rather than raising a red flag by asking for one on long-term disability.
As the men and women listened attentively, Ms. Hassner informed them that prospective employers cannot ask about their H.I.V. status, nor can employers legally ask if they are taking medication, only if they are taking medication that might affect their ability to do their job. They may be taking 30 pills a day, but if they are not experiencing any side effects, the answer would be no, she said.
Robert, the man who is weighing three job offers, was eager to know the ins and outs of individual and group insurance policies, but he was also anxious to know what to do if he became sick again. "If you do start feeling sluggish and slow and your job performance is not up to par," he said, "could you ask for a reasonable accommodation?"
The lawyer told him that it depended on whether modifications could be made to the job that would allow him to perform essential duties, but accommodate his symptoms.
Ms. Hassner reminded the group that the law says people cannot be fired because of their H.I.V.-positive status, but they can be fired for other reasons.
"If there's downsizing and a whole department is going under, you can't save your job by disclosing you're H.I.V.-positive," Ms. Hassner said.
She added that it is illegal for employers not to hire somebody or to deny them health insurance purely because they are H.I.V.-positive.
The tenor of the employment seminar echoed that of a debt-management class, where some clients -- who thought they would be dead soon -- have spent the limit on their credit cards. Within the last six months, the focus of the debt-management workshop has shifted from informing dying clients about entitlements and discussing their debts to exploring the possibility of personal bankruptcy and questions of protecting salaries from garnishment.
"A lot of the time, it's putting the client's mind at ease," said Robert Newman, a G.M.H.C. staff attorney who moderates the workshop. "You have a fear of the unknown. Are they going to put me in jail? Is there a debtor's prison?"
In a new class for women on returning to the workplace, the conversation the other day was about how the term "living with AIDS" is no longer merely a feel-good mantra but a realistic expectation.
Iris Maldonado, 41, said that for so long she "was like in a deathbed waiting for my time to come." She has a 15-year-old daughter whom she did not expect to see graduate from junior high school. Now that Ms. Maldonado is taking protease inhibitors, , which have been on the market for 17 months,she looks forward to the day when she might become a grandmother.
Ms. Maldonado, who counsels other H.I.V.-infected women, is learning to deal not only with crisis management, like finding housing, substance-abuse counseling and other help for clients, but also the emotional and practical aspects of perhaps going back to work fulltime. Ms. Maldonado, for one, is a bit worried about having less time to spend with her family.
"But it's a great challenge to go out today and help someone know there is hope for them," said the slender woman, tears welling in her eyes. "It's not the end. It's just the beginning."
She has finally gotten around to writing her will. She said she placed it on a shelf at home where she hopes it will sit for a long time, collecting dust.

Fed Meeting Gives Bonds A Modest Lift

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose modestly yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged.
While investors were relieved by the decision, they quickly started to mull the possibility of future moves by the central bank. 
 "The Fed chose to leave rates unchanged, but that doesn't mean that they are out of the picture for the rest of the year," Doug Burtnick, senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said. "The market will continue to struggle with each upcoming data release, as traders attempt to divine the course of future rate moves. There is still the risk of higher rates this summer."
Because it was the short end of the market that would have been hit hard had the Federal Open Market Committee raised rates yesterday, it was the short end that experienced the sharpest rally. The price of the three-month bill rose, driving its yield down 16 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- to 5.06 percent. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
But the dollar, which fell sharply in foreign-exchange trading after the Fed's decision, limited the day's gains in bonds. Market participants favor a strong dollar because it makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 7/32, to 96 18/32. The bond's yield -- an important benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- slipped to 6.90 percent from 6.92 percent on Monday.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, noted that had the Fed tightened, a negative reaction from the bond market might have lasted 24 hours. But since the Fed left rates steady, traders and investors will now have to begin examining again each new piece of economic data including the May employment report on June 6, considered the next market mover. "We see a trading band on the yield of the long bonds as between 6.85 percent and 6.95 percent," he said.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said he was disappointed that the Fed did not raise rates. He said there were political considerations behind yesterday's decision.
"What this does to the market is to put it on edge again as investors will again have to scrutinize economic data leading to the next F.O.M.C. meeting," Mr. Pugliese said. "My own opinion is that there shouldn't have been a tightening in the first place. We are in extraordinary times. I think the technological revolution that this country is going through has increased productivity to the point where inflation is benign for the foreseeable future. Besides, the consumer has become more sophisticated, and you just can't pass prices along."
While he expects that wages will go up, Mr. Pugliese predicted they would not reach a meaningful level. "Plus again we have lower import prices, which keep competition keen," Mr. Pugliese said. "Long-term rates will be significantly lower than they are now regardless what the Fed does over the near term. The road to higher prices will not be smooth until the Fed acknowledges that it is done raising rates."

Singapore Ranked the No. 1 Economy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Singapore again ranks first among the 53 economies rated in the Global Competitiveness Report, a closely watched study of countries' economic potential that is being released today by the World Economic Forum, a business-financed research organization in Geneva.
The United States also continued to do well in the report, moving to third from fourth. That made it far and away the leader among large, developed economies in what Jeffrey Sachs, the co-chairman of the forum's advisory board and the architect of the rating system, calls "the ability to achieve sustained high rates of economic growth." 
 There are other familiar players at the top of the list, including Hong Kong (No. 2), New Zealand (No. 5), Switzerland (No. 6) and Taiwan (No. 8), but there are some surprises, too. Canada moved to fourth from eighth, reflecting progress in reducing its budget deficit -- a problem plaguing virtually all the mature social democracies. Even more dramatic, Britain jumped to 7th place from 15th by slashing top tax rates and reducing labor market regulation that inhibits employment growth.
 The study, which was reformulated last year to emphasize the conclusions of professional economists over those of business executives, has attracted a following because many business and government leaders see it as a report card on their success in making their economies leaner, meaner and more prepared for growth.
Last year's change in the rankings process, which de-emphasized opinion polling in favor of more objective criteria, ranging from tariff rates to currency stability to the number of telephones per capita, has apparently produced a better predictor of growth prospects. Indeed, there was no statistical correlation between the old style of executive poll rankings and rates of growth, while the new method did identify some actual winners and losers last year. "We beat the gut response of business leaders," Mr. Sachs said.
 The survey of executives is still conducted, but is given less weight. It has tended to favor historically successful countries like Japan, Germany and France, whose entrenched flaws are more easily discernible under the new system. From Mr. Sachs's perspective, the principal advantage to the refurbished Global Competitiveness Report is its transformation from a high-profile popularity contest to a bully pulpit for spreading the gospel according to modern development economics.
The most successful grouping in the recent report -- what it calls the "entrepot economies," including Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Luxembourg (11th), so-called because they are very small countries that thrive on providing global trade and financial services -- got that way by virtue of the countries' commitment to openness, minimal regulation and rule of law.
 The "Anglo-Saxon" economies (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Britain and the United States) are doing well, too, beating back the economic arteriosclerosis that can come with the accumulation of interest group influence in rich democracies. The United States led this pack by ranking first among all economies on management skills, second on access to technology and third on both infrastructure development and the efficiency of financial markets. It would have nosed out Hong Kong for second place in the overall rankings but for mediocre scores on taxation, bureaucracy and civil justice.
 The most disappointing group, the countries of the European Union, all provide high living standards. But their high-spending, high-tax regimes generally undermine the efficiency of markets and offer little hope of rapid growth in income or employment. "Continental Europe sits there in a mess," Mr. Sachs said. "The basic problems aren't being solved." But the Netherlands (moving from 17th to 12th) and Ireland (jumping from 26th to 16th), both bucked the general trend in Europe by making their welfare states more user-friendly for business.
 The transition economies of Eastern Europe are, at best, treading water. Russia (53d) and Ukraine (52d) have been overwhelmed by corruption and incompetent government, the report says. Poland (50th), Hungary (46th) and the Czech Republic (32d) are all striving to encourage private enterprise and attract foreign investment. But in all three, social security has priority over efficient markets and government spending still represents roughly half of national output. "Their pretensions to being Sweden are premature," Mr. Sachs said.
 Protectionism and heavy-handed regulation are holding back some of these economies, along with some others that have consistently ranked low, like Venezuela (47th), India (45th) and South Africa (44th).
Human rights appear to have no direct input on competitiveness rankings. Some economies with capital-friendly authoritarian regimes -- Singapore, Indonesia (15th) and China (29th) -- did well compared with rights-minded democracies, including Portugal (30th), Belgium (31st), the Czech Republic, Iceland (38th), Italy (39th) and Poland.
But Mr. Sachs, citing countries like Britain and the United States, suggested that the conflict between competitiveness and social justice was more apparent than real. "You don't need to spend half of national income on middle-class entitlements in order to maintain the safety net," he argued.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Lay of the Land"
Table lists countries with the best and worst business climates, out of 53 analyzed and ranked by the World Economic Forum (49 were ranked last year). Ranks are broken down into four categories: most competitive, least competitive, biggest growth potential, and smallest growth potential. Competitiveness refers to countries' labor markets, fiscal policies, tax and regulatory regimes and openness to trade and investment, regardless of the size of the economy. Growth potential refers to expected absolute increase in total output. (Source: World Economic Forum)

HEADLINE: A Slowdown In the Works Whatever The Fed Does

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Whatever the Federal Reserve does over the next few months, the American economy appears to be heading, on its own, into a period of slower economic growth.
"Weaker is not bad," said Robert D. Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "We are still talking about positive economic growth." 
 Virtually no economist is predicting a recession, only a slowdown to perhaps half the booming annual growth rate of more than 4 percent that prevailed from October through March. Many analysts consider such rapid growth to be inflationary, if it lasts long enough. Eventually, with very strong growth, shortages of labor and merchandise develop, which push up wages and prices.
But the spurts of growth during the current recovery, like the one this last winter, have not lasted long. Counting the slower periods, the gross domestic product, valuing all the goods and services that the nation produces in a given year, has risen at an average annual rate of only 2.7 percent since the last recession ended, in the spring of 1991. That growth rate has not been strong enough to create the shortages that push up inflation. And the growth rate is even less, a very mild 2.1 percent a year, if the 1990-91 recession is averaged in.
The economic expansion of the 1990's, now in its seventh year, has been marked by alternating periods of strong and weak growth. A booming 1994, for example, was followed by a weak 1995, mostly because the Fed had raised interest rates sufficiently to slow the economy. The slowdown under way now -- after a winter in which the economy boomed -- appears to reflect more natural causes.
"With the economy slowing, it is quite plausible that we can have a 2.5 percent growth rate, and the Fed does not have to lift a finger," said Lee Price, chief economist at the Commerce Department. The Fed's top officials, at their policy meeting yesterday, decided not to follow a rate increase in March with another one now.
Since early April, retail sales have fallen and stockpiles of unsold goods have piled up. This inventory accumulation accounted for a big chunk of the strong economic growth in the first quarter. Working off those stockpiles now, in the face of weaker retail sales, means cutbacks in industrial production, at least temporarily. These cutbacks have already begun to show up in Government statistics as weaker growth in the second quarter.
"What is going on now is a mini-inventory correction," said Lyle Gramley, a consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Fed governor. "That is normally a short phenomenon."
The big question is how long the slowdown will last. There is no way to answer that question yet.
But if the inventory correction follows a typical pattern, the economy might be growing more strongly again by fall or winter, once retailers and wholesalers decide to step up orders to restock their shelves.
However, some ingredients of last winter's strong growth are lacking now. Warmer-than-usual weather encouraged above normal shopping and construction activity, strengthening the economy temporarily, particularly in the first quarter. So did tax refunds, which flowed to Americans in unexpectedly large amounts in the weeks before April 15.
Other factors suggest that a longer period of mild growth might lie ahead. Consumer debt is at a record high, eating into household income, and borrowing to finance purchases has tapered off. New-vehicle sales, having held above 15 million at an annual rate through the winter, dropped below that level in April, and the auto industry has responded with rebates and sales incentives.
"When the economy slows, we slow even more," said Wynn Van Bussman, chief economist at the Chrysler Corporation, "and we are confirming that slowdown because it is becoming more and more difficult to sell new vehicles."
Similarly, home construction was quite strong this winter, contributing noticeably to economic growth, particularly when all the accessories -- carpeting, appliances, furniture, remodeling -- are added in. Construction is still high, but no longer rising. "Some of the early-year exuberance has worn off," said David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
Slower economic growth -- 2.5 percent or less annually -- is touted by most economists and policy makers as necessary to avoid the shortages that drive up the inflation rate. Corporate executives and union officials increasingly argue that the American economy is capable of greater growth without rising inflation.
Slower growth also makes an economy more susceptible to the sort of "accident" that can tip a weakened economy into recession: the Persian Gulf crisis played a role in provoking the 1990-91 recession, along with the Fed's decision to keep interest rates up. Similarly, a sharp decline in stock prices could undermine the economy now by damaging the confidence of American households, nearly half of whom own stocks, either directly or through mutual funds and retirement accounts.
Or the Federal Reserve, trying to slow the economy to avoid a rise in the inflation rate, could push up interest rates too much, in its effort to discourage borrowing and spending. "Every recession since 1957 has been caused by a spike in interest rates or an oil price shock," Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, said.
The Fed in its decision yesterday seemed to recognize the danger of pushing up rates too much.

HEADLINE: Minister of Objection Nettles Washington;
Boeing, Threatened, Sees Trade War

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 16

 BODY:
Who is Karel van Miert, and why is he declaring war on the Boeing Company?
As the Seattle-based aerospace giant pushes to complete its $14 billion takeover of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the biggest roadblock is suddenly being posed by a feisty European official who has bluntly branded the deal "totally unacceptable." 
 The official is Karel van Miert, a 55-year-old former Belgian Socialist who is the European Commission's Minister for Competition and, de facto, the Continent's top antitrust authority. Few Americans have heard of him, but that is changing fast, especially in corporate board rooms.
On Wednesday, Mr. van Miert is expected to hand Boeing a list of "objections" to the McDonnell Douglas deal. Never mind that the takeover involves two American companies, or that his biggest objection stems from two long-term sales contracts that Boeing recently reached with two American airlines.
"If any deal has an effect on the European marketplace, then the jurisdiction is within our territory," said Willy Helin, Mr. van Miert's spokesman. "We don't give a damn about extraterritoriality."
[On Tuesday, Mr. van Miert met with British officials and reiterated his hard line against the proposed marketing alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation. Mr. van Miert has complained that it would eliminate competition on many routes between the United States and Britain.]
It is in the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas case that Mr. van Miert is flexing his muscles for a showdown with both the United States aerospace industry and, very likely, the United States Government.
In numerous public comments, he has warned that the creation of an aerospace goliath would endanger competition in Europe, especially for Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium based in Paris that competes with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. If Boeing fails to address his concerns, Mr. van Miert has threatened to block the deal or impose fines of up to 10 percent of Boeing's revenues, or about $4 billion.
For American companies, the case highlights the lengthening reach of the European Union as Europe acts increasingly as a single political entity. But experts say Mr. van Miert's higher profile is a result of the inevitable clashes that come with the rise in international trade.
Whether the United States tries to block European companies from doing business with Cuba or Iran, or Europe tries to enforce an internal ban on hormone-treated beef from American cattle farmers, international disputes over conflicting national policies are piling up. And there are few precedents for guidance.
"The whole issue of extraterritoriality is a vexing area, and it is one that is going to get worse," said Michael Hodges, senior lecturer in international relations at the London School of Economics. "Having dealt with many of the issues between borders, we are now looking at issues behind the borders."
The looming fight over Boeing could easily engulf the Clinton Administration. Although the Federal Trade Commission is not expected to decide the antitrust issues until next month, the United States Government has already approved several big mergers within the nation's shrinking military and aerospace industry. And Mr. van Miert has already attracted warning growls from Boeing's home-state senators and from Vice President Al Gore.
While Mr. van Miert has been quick to object, his bark is often worse than his bite. Indeed, most disputes that he initiates are eventually settled through negotiation and compromise rather than by taking companies to court. Of roughly 500 mergers that his office has reviewed, only 7 have been blocked outright.
Just this week, his office approved with only minor changes British Telecommunications' takeover of MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance telephone carrier in the United States after AT&T. But two years ago, he pressed the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Scott Paper to sell off some of their European businesses as a condition for approving their merger.
He has also provoked sputtering indignation from London to Bonn. He infuriated the British Government last fall when he first threatened to block the proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. He also outraged German Government officials by challenging subsidies to Volkswagen in eastern Germany as well as state aid to areas in western Germany. And he has chastised the French Government for its billion-dollar bailouts of state-owned companies like Credit Lyonnais, the troubled bank.
In the Boeing and McDonnell Douglas case, European officials have made it clear that they do not expect to veto the proposed merger outright. Rather, they suggest, the goal is to get Boeing to address their worries about particular business practices.
The European Commission must make a final decision on the merger by late July. If it vetoed the deal, and the Federal Trade Commission approved it, the fight would probably shift to the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
Mr. van Miert seems to relish conflict. A tough-minded politician who once headed the Belgian Socialist Party, he has become one of the most powerful figures within the sprawling bureaucracy of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. His attacks on a wide range of anti-competitive practices and on Europe's mountain of subsidies for industry have generally won praise as tough and honest. That is no small feat, since every country in the European Union has sacred cows that it wants to protect.
With a staff of more than 100 people, Mr. van Miert oversees a staggering volume of activity. His ministry reviews all major mergers that involve European companies as well as a few that do not. It also investigates allegations of price-fixing and a wide range of attempts to stifle competition, much like the United States Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. (The Justice Department and the F.T.C. together employ an antitrust staff of more than 1,100 people.)
In theory, Mr. van Miert can make life miserable for those who refuse to obey his rulings. But as a practical matter, he follows the opposite of the dictim made famous by Theodore Roosevelt by talking loudly and carrying a small stick.
In Germany, for example, the Governor of the eastern state of Saxony was outraged that Mr. van Miert blocked a package of subsidies for Volkswagen to build a new automobile factory. Mr. van Miert said he had already approved big subsidies for Volkswagen and was drawing the line at more. The state of Saxony went ahead anyway and Mr. van Miert prepared to take the state to court. Over the next several months, however, the two sides worked out a compromise that reduced but did not eliminate the subsidies.
In the British Airways deal with American Airlines, Mr. van Miert argued that the two airlines would control a majority of the coveted landing slots for flights between the United States and Heathrow Airport in London. The British Government has been content to let the airlines sell off many of these slots in order to lessen their dominance, but Mr. van Miert contended that they should give the slots away and said he would take the British Government to court.
The fight has been hanging in limbo for several months and remains unresolved.
The Boeing case is likely to be much tougher. Boeing now sells more than 60 percent of the world's commercial airplanes, while Airbus has captured about a 30 percent share. McDonnell Douglas, which had about 20 percent of the market 10 years ago, is now a negligible player with only about 4 percent. Most of McDonnell Douglas's business is in military aircraft, an area where Boeing is relatively weak.
Mr. van Miert's focus has been on the commercial aircraft market. In particular, he has complained repeatedly about Boeing's two recent contracts to become the exclusive supplier of planes to American Airlines and Delta Air Lines for 20 years.
He said such contracts would be a grave threat to competition in general and Airbus in particular. "These agreements are totally unacceptable because they eliminate Airbus as a rival for at least the next 20 years," he said last week in Stockholm.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas executives argue that Mr. van Miert is merely protecting Airbus. The competition in commercial aircraft had already been reduced to Boeing and Airbus, and company executives argue that Boeing's acquisition of McDonnell's military business would not change the balance. They also defend their airline contracts, asserting that the contracts were awarded through open competition and that Airbus had itself signed an exclusive long-term contract with U S Airways in 1996.
"It's obvious he wants a war," Harry C. Stonecipher, the president and chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, said in Washington last week.
In Brussels, headquarters of the European Commission, Boeing officials have lined up numerous European attorneys and argue that Mr. van Miert has wandered out of bounds. "At least from the U.S. side, this looks like an extraterritorial attempt to impose European law," said Ray Waldman, Boeing's vice president for international business.
Mr. van Miert dismissed Boeing's warnings of a possible trade war as "totally nonsensical."
But the issue is reverberating in the United States. Members of Congress from Washington State sent Mr. van Miert a letter last week complaining that he had prejudged the issue and was trying to protect Airbus -- charges that Mr. van Miert vehemently denied.
Meanwhile, Vice President Gore fired a warning shot of his own. "We haven't been bashful about our advocacy of the rights of American businesses oveseas," Mr. Gore said earlier this month. "We will be watching the outcome of their deliberations extremely carefully, and we will take whatever action is appropriate to assure justice and fairness."

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Squeeze Schools in Cleveland

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
The once-forsaken downtown boasts a glistening array of new office towers, hotels and sports stadiums. In the Flats, the industrial area where the brown bends of the Cuyahoga River once caught fire, the riverbanks are lined with bars and restaurants. Over all, the city's economic revival has transformed Cleveland from the Mistake on the Lake to the Comeback City.
But the city's school system is broke. 
 The Cleveland Teachers' Union sees a direct link between the downtown boom and the educational bust: the very same tax abatement policies that attracted new development to the city, they say, cost the schools $21 million a year.
Even through that represents only a small fraction of the district's budget, the teachers say the schools need every cent they can get. So, in what is apparently the first such campaign in the nation, the union has gathered enough signatures to force a special vote in August on a proposal to require that businesses winning abatements, or the city, reimburse the schools for any lost taxes.
Richard DeColibus, the union's president, said it was simply a matter of making sure that Cleveland schoolchildren did not bear the brunt of the city's development policy.
Chris Warren, the director of Cleveland's Department of Economic Development, agrees that abatements were given too freely in the past. And, he said, he would welcome a statewide ban. But a ban in Cleveland only, Mr. Warren said, would put the city at a terrible competitive disadvantage with its affluent surrounding towns, which he said would be only too happy to offer tax incentives to lure dozens of businesses out of Cleveland.
The union contends that the passage of the proposal would not hurt Cleveland, because it could still abate the portion of the property taxes that does not go to the schools.
With more local governments using tax incentives as a weapon in the escalating bidding wars for new investments, property tax abatements that siphon money from the schools have become controversial.
"The whole issue came to a head in the early 1990's, when the economy was bad, a lot of states were suffering and there was increasing competition for big-ticket projects," said Scott Mackey, of the National Conference of State Legislatures. "And in the last few years, we've begun hearing a lot about how school districts are the biggest recipients of property tax, but they don't usually have much say over abatements."
Only a handful of states allow school districts to veto abatements, Mr. Mackey said.
The debate over the long-term economic effects of tax abatements -- and who controls the decision to offer them -- has taken on new urgency as school systems hard-pressed for money look longingly at a revenue stream they see trickling away.
"Tax abatements are a two-edged sword," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, which represents the nation's largest urban school districts. "They can help to create and attract the jobs that cities desperately need to remain vital. But at the same time, they can strip schools of the revenues they need to educate young people to fill those jobs."
There are no reliable national statistics on how much money schools lose from tax abatements. But the Corporation for Enterprise Development, in Washington, estimates that state and local governments give up $5 billion to $8 billion in tax incentives a year -- most, but not all, of them property tax abatements. And nationally, schools receive almost half of all property tax revenues.
As abatements have proliferated and awareness of the revenue loss for schools has grown, there has been increasing concern that local governments may be giving away more than they should.
"This conversation about the impact of abatements on schools is brand new, even though it's a fairly old practice," Mr. Casserly said. "It has something to do with the evolving conversations between mayors and schools about each one's role in the other's vitality. But because there has not been adequate research on how the benefits and liabilities balance out, it can be a pretty uninformed conversation, with people just shouting at each other."
Those who think tax abatements are being abused -- that school revenue is being lost without helping the city very much -- say that most abatements go to large corporations, whose workers disproportionately live outside the city limits, rather than to the smaller businesses that employ more city residents.
"One thing that is clear, frankly, is that corporations need to understand how their rhetoric about wanting a well-educated citizenry and their demands for tax abatements are really at odds with one another," Mr. Casserly said. "If you're going to have an educated citizenry, you're going to have to pay for it."
Some large corporations and tax-exempt institutions do contribute to the schools, providing cash, internships or other forms of support. In Cleveland, for example, the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame and Museum agreed to give the schools a share of its admission fees in lieu of property taxes. This year, the school's cut will be about $450,000, which is still less than it would have received if the Hall of Fame were taxed.
Some educators and legislators think abatements of property taxes that support the schools should be banned altogether. In Texas, for example, the Legislature is considering State Senator David Sibley's proposal to end school property tax abatements. The Senate's Economic Development Committee found that from 1985 to 1995, the state's school districts lost almost $480 million in local property tax revenue because of abatements.
Texas law already allows schools not to participate in abatements the local government proposes. But Senator Sibley and others say the pressure on school boards can be so great as to make it impossible for them to resist development projects that will cut into their budgets.
"School districts never really reap the benefits from new jobs or an expanded tax base created by companies that receive school property tax breaks," Senator Sibley said. "Unlike cities and counties which ultimately benefit financially, most school districts lose money which they never get back. Our children's future should not be traded for new jobs now."
Tax abatements, of course, are only the latest skirmish in the continuing battle over how to pay for schools -- and indeed, in some states, including New York, financing for schools is not directly affected by property tax abatements.
In recent years, courts in several states, including Ohio in March and New Jersey just last week, have struck down financing systems that depend heavily on local property tax, finding that the disparities between rich and poor districts' spending violate state constitutional guarantees of a proper education.
The Cleveland schools have been in disarray, and in serious financial straits, for years. In 1995, a Federal judge put the 70,000-student system under state control after it ran out of money halfway through the year. The system has an annual budget of $670 million, and is $155 million in debt -- far more than most districts its size and far more than any change in abatement policy could make up. Meanwhile, student achievement levels are dismal and school buildings are deteriorating.
"It's completely dysfunctional," said Michael Charney, a middle-school teacher in Cleveland who has been a leader in the campaign against tax abatements. "Last year, in my seventh-grade social studies class I had 32 kids and only 24 desks. And we only had one set of textbooks for the classroom, so kids couldn't take them home."
Against that backdrop, Mr. DeColibus said, the teachers' union decided it had no choice but to start a petition drive for a city charter amendment that would make sure that tax revenues earmarked for the schools would not go to businesses instead.
"Business has taken a 'let someone else pay for it' attitude toward any kind of support for public institutions," Mr. DeColibus said, "and schools are hurt the most by this total lack of fiscal morality since we rely more heavily on property taxes than other government institutions. I've come to understand that 'good business climate' is a euphemism for 'businesses don't have to pay the taxes the rest of us do.' "
Ohio has taken some steps to stem the loss of school revenue from abatements. In 1994, the state passed legislation giving school boards the right to veto abatements of more than 75 percent of the taxes that would otherwise be paid, or those that last more than 10 years. In addition, if the annual payroll of added employees of an exempted project exceeds $1 million, the city must share with the schools a portion of the income tax it receives. But, Mr. DeColibus said, those provisions have had little effect.
Mr. Warren, the Cleveland development official, said the new law has not been invoked often, because the city no longer offers abatements of more than 75 percent; 60 to 65 percent is now the average, he said. But, he said, there have been a few instances of income-tax sharing.
"We use abatements very sparingly now, only as a last resort option to assist neighborhood-based businesses, with a strict 'but-for' test showing that the proposed development would not go forward but for the abatement," Mr. Warren said. "It's also important to keep in mind that since we don't abate 100 percent, or even 75 percent any more, we're collecting extra taxes from the development that does go forward, even with the abatements."
Mr. Warren sees the abatement vote largely as a political maneuver, an expression of the teachers' frustration. But he also said he thought the teachers were wrong to make the abatement issue a local one.
"We've told the teachers they should be working on a state level," Mr. Warren said. "If there's a ban on tax abatement just in Cleveland, there will be dozens of companies that will pick up and move over to Solon, where they'll be made very welcome. We'll have abandoned properties and that won't do anyone any good. Abatements are a legitimate concern, but this isn't the answer."

HEADLINE: Another Ranking Executive At Apple Decides to Resign

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 20

 BODY:
In the latest senior management departure from struggling Apple Computer Inc., George Scalise, the company's executive vice president for operations, resigned today to become president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He will leave Apple at the end of the month.
Mr. Scalise, 63, had followed Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple's chairman and chief executive, to the company from the National Semiconductor Corporation and had earlier in his career held executive positions at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Fairchild Semiconductor and Motorola. Mr. Scalise had also previously worked for the Semiconductor Industry Association, the chip industry's trade organization, as chairman of its public policy committee. 
 The powers and responsibilities of Mr. Amelio's chosen executives have weakened since Apple's $400 million acquisition of Next Software Inc. returned Steven P. Jobs to the company he helped found, analysts noted. Ellen Hancock, who last year joined Apple as chief technology officer, also from National Semiconductor, had her oversight of both hardware and software development management turned over to former Next executives.
"The influence of Steve Jobs has been much greater than anyone anticipated," said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. "But any brain drain right now, especially someone so close to Gil, has to be considered a loss."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Scalise said his departure had nothing to do with Mr. Jobs's influence but instead reflected the completion of much of what he was brought on board to accomplish. "I think a lot of what I was focused on, and what was in my area of responsibility, has been done now," he said. "The idea was to focus on getting Apple on track operationally. Now, we're satisfying demand, and we're able to bring out leading edge products on schedule."
Mr. Scalise said that Apple did not plan to replace him but that Mr. Amelio would redistribute some of his responsibilities. "We now have the team in place that can execute on the game plan," he said. "With that done, a lot of the challenge that was mine is taken care of."
For its second quarter, ended March 28, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported a loss of $708 million, compared with a loss of $740 million in the quarter a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Fed Inaction Sends Dollar Down but Spurs Stock Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve's decision yesterday not to raise short-term interest rates knocked the dollar sharply lower and provided only a little relief for the bond market. But the Fed's inaction spurred the stock market, which continues to show an exuberance that may again worry Fed officials.
The dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen and the mark after the central bank announced at 2:15 P.M. that it would leave its target for the Federal funds rate at 5.50 percent. 
 The dollar's decline restrained the rally in the bond market, analysts said, as traders and investors feared a round of selling by foreign investors because a weaker dollar was eating into their profits or enlarging their losses. The price of the 30-year bond jumped 13/32, to 96 24/32, just after the Fed announcement before retreating to finish the day up 7/32 at 96 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.90 percent from 6.92 percent on Monday.
In the stock market, technology, bank and financial stocks benefited the most, leading the Dow Jones industrial average up 74.58 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,303.46. The Dow was down as much as 76 points earlier in the day but jumped nearly 100 points to within 30 points of its record close after the report of the Fed's decision.
The Standard and Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 8.39 points, or 1 percent, to 841.66, less than a half a point below its record close. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared even better, rising 22.64 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,363.88.
While the slumping dollar held back the bond market yesterday, it appeared to help stocks by improving the prospects of many exporters, whose products become more competitive abroad. For example, earnings of I.B.M. -- which led the Dow higher yesterday, surging 5, to 173 3/4 -- could get a lift after its first-quarter profits were held back by the surge of the dollar earlier in the year.
"Bullish spirits remain high," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in San Francisco. "The fear of missing a rise is much greater than the concern about participating in a painful tumble.
"And when you get a sense of relief, technology tends to be a lead group," he added. "That's where a lot of the excitement has been."
Analysts were split pretty evenly over whether the Fed would act yesterday, and their forecasting of the performance of the economy in the months ahead and how the Fed will react will be just as difficult. But it seems fairly clear that the inaction of the Fed has set financial markets up for six weeks of uncertainty -- and volatile trading -- until the next Fed policy meeting July 2 and 3.
Unless economic data for May confirm the slowdown implied in April's data, the chances of a Fed rate increase this summer will be even greater than they were yesterday.
"The market will be in the same spot on July 2 as it is now -- waiting for the Fed to act," said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities. And the odds of a rate increase, he said, "will change with each new economic report and that will make for choppier trading."
Some stock analysts warned that while the market could climb in the near term, the threat of higher interest rates is still there and means something, given the almost 10 percent plunge in the Dow after the Fed raised interest rates in March.
"There is so little evidence that inflation was looming that they felt that their credibility would have been damaged" by raising rates now, explained Byron Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. But, he added, "the Fed not tightening is not conclusive proof that things are going to remain good."
Yesterday's decline in the dollar accelerated a slump that began on May 2 and that has left the American currency 10.8 percent lower against the yen and 2.7 percent lower against the mark. The dollar's decline this month was started by comments from Japanese finance officials who said the dollar had risen too far and implied that the Government might intervene in markets to bolster the Japanese currency.
That step has not been necessary because traders have been spooked by the comments and hints that the Japanese central bank might raise interest rates soon. It was a new round of such hints that sent the dollar lower in overseas trading early Tuesday. The decision by the Fed not to raise interest rates, which could have supported the dollar by making it a more attractive investment, adds to the near-term woeful outlook for the American currency.
"For right now the dollar is going to be under some pressure," said David Puth, the head of foreign exchange and derivatives in North America at Chase Manhattan Bank. He said that while there was still reason to expect the Fed to raise interest rates in July, the fact that such a move is not certain will be a dollar "negative."
In late trading in New York, the dollar fared the worst against the mark and other European currencies, falling even lower after the Fed's decision than it did in Asian and in early European trading. Against the mark the dollar was at 1.6823, down 1.5 percent from Monday.
Against the yen, the dollar finished at 113.04, down 2.3 percent on the day, but above the intra-day low of nearly 112 hit in overnight trading.
Other advancing stocks yesterday included J.P. Morgan, up 2 3/4, to 105 1/4; American Express, increasing 2 1/8, to 70 3/4; Intel, up 6 1/4, to 161; General Electric, rising 1 1/2, to 62 1/2, and Microsoft, up 4, to 119 1/8.

HEADLINE: Nafta Environmental Lags May Delay Free Trade Expansion

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
During his recent Latin American trip, President Clinton enthusiastically promised to extend free trade throughout the hemisphere. But a delay in an environmental study on the effect of the increased trade that has already taken place is weakening support he will need to get wider trade agreements approved in Congress.
Environmentalists in the United States, Canada and Mexico fear that the delays signal a lack of commitment by the Governments of those countries to monitor the environmental effects of free trade. Such monitoring was a tenet of the side agreements that helped get the North American Free Trade Agreement approved when it was stalled in the United States Congress in 1993. 
 "What this shows is that the side agreements really haven't delivered on commitments made by the Clinton Administration in 1993," said Dan Seligman, an official responsible for trade issues with the Sierra Club in Washington.
The organization originally opposed the passage of Nafta, but the support of other environmental groups was crucial to winning the accord's approval and the Sierra Club ultimately dropped its opposition. Mr. Seligman said the Government's weak support for the environmental agreements makes it unlikely that environmental groups could support expansion of the agreement.
President Clinton has said he will seek Congressional authority to negotiate agreements with Chile and other Latin American nations, but he has not made a commitment to include environmental accords.
"If the commission can't get the countries to study the environmental impacts of increased trade that's already taken place, how can they ever get them to do anything real about improving environmental standards, which is what they promised in 1993," Mr. Seligman said.
The environmental study is a comparatively small part of a comprehensive review of the trade pact and its effects on the United States economy, which by law must be completed this year. President Clinton must report to Congress by July.
Three areas were selected for examination: energy use, cattle raising and, in Mexico, raising corn -- the country's primary agricultural crop.
The study was considered an important milestone because the work was to be done independently of the three Governments. An advisory panel made up mostly of experts and representatives of citizens' groups was supposed to oversee the project.
The $150,000 to finance the study this year is included in the $9 million annual budget of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the organization set up in Montreal to oversee the environmental aspects of Nafta. But while the money has been in the budget since last fall, the three Governments have not given approval for the work to proceed. Trade officials from the United States have raised concerns about the study, but the Mexican Government has most forcefully objected, several people familiar with the negotiations say.
"The trade people in Mexico were nervous about letting any part of the Nafta process out from under their direct and total control," said Daniel C. Esty, now director of the Yale University Center for Environmental Law and Policy, who was the chief negotiator for the Environmental Protection Agency on Nafta.
Mexican officials agreed that the study teams should be independent, but they wanted so much input and oversight that it would have amounted to the ability to censor the reports, an American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said there appeared to be a split between Mexico's Environmental Ministry and the Trade Ministry.
Mario Aguilar, an Environmental Ministry official at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, denied that there was any split in his Government's position. He confirmed that Mexico has objected to the way the study was designed, he rejected any suggestion that there had been an attempt to censor the findings.
"We have doubts about the way the three sectors were chosen," Mr. Aguilar said. "We want the work to have a scientific base, not to deal with politics and opinion."
A member of the group advising the environmental analysis said the three areas were selected after a thorough review of the free trade agreement's first years of operation. "Case studies were needed," said Richard Kamp, director of the Border Ecology Project in Bisbee, Ariz., "to show how investments have taken place and how they have affected society."
The study on corn is considered the most potentially damaging to Mexico, since it deals with the most important staple of nearly every Mexican's diet.
Before Nafta was passed, it was widely predicted that eliminating tariffs over a 15-year period would flood Mexico with imported corn, causing great disruptions as poor farmers gave up their fields and moved to Mexico's cities or across the border.
But the early drafts of the corn study show that while corn imports indeed have already surpassed the 15-year projections, there has been no widespread dislocation.
Alejandro Nadal, a professor of economics at the Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City who is conducting the corn study, said he knows why the Mexican Government is worried about the results.
"They want Nafta to work out fine," he said. "But if they start fiddling around with the commission's work, we are going to have problems."

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Allowing Rates To Hold Steady

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, betting that the economy was slowing sufficiently to avert a resurgence of inflation.
The central bank's policy-making body had increased the key short-term rate it controls by a quarter point, to 5.50 percent, at its last meeting two months ago, saying that strong growth and low unemployment were creating the conditions that could push wages and prices higher and endanger the economy's expansion. 
 In passing up the chance today to raise rates again, it heeded, at least for now, warnings from some economists that a further increase would have little economic justification or political support because there is almost no sign that inflation is taking root.
The decision heartened investors, who sent stock prices surging. After falling early in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average rallied after the Federal Reserve's announcement in the early afternoon, closing at 7,303.46, up 74.58 points. Bond prices rose moderately, and the dollar -- which would have become a more attractive investment if interest rates were higher in this country -- fell. [Page D1.]
Analysts said that the Federal Reserve might still feel compelled to raise rates again this year, perhaps at its next policy meeting in July. They said the decision today was driven by clear evidence that economic growth had moderated substantially from the 5.6 percent rate of the first quarter, as well as by reports showing that inflation was almost nonexistent at the producer level and subdued at the consumer level.
Some economists also saw today's decision as evidence of an increased willingness on the part of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to be open to the possibility that the economy could grow without igniting inflation. The alternative to such a decision is to fall back reflexively on the convention that growth rates that are more than about 2.25 percent when unemployment is less than 5 percent will inevitably lead to sharp increases in wages and prices.
"There's an experiment going on here, and the Fed is letting growth roll," said Allen Sinai, an economist at Primark Decision Economics, a consulting firm.
Mr. Sinai and others said economists were being forced to re-examine their old rules of thumb about growth and inflation because of an array of changes that are reshaping the economy. Huge investments by businesses in new technology appear to have bolstered productivity in ways that official statistics do not capture. Instead of passing cost increases along to consumers, companies increasingly try to wring them out of their own production processes. Workers are more willing to accept modest pay raises, or to tie their compensation to performance or efficiency. The globalization of commerce has intensified competition in many industries.
"So much has changed in our economy that it would be a mistake to assume the old rules apply," Mr. Sinai said. "What Greenspan has shown us again and again in his tenure is the ability to understand how the world does change and still keep his eye on the ball of price-level stability."
Today's meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, came against a backdrop of vociferous opposition to further rate increases from across the political spectrum and from both the business community and organized labor. Opponents argued that in raising rates in March to slow demand by making borrowing more expensive, Mr. Greenspan had gone too far with his policy of eradicating inflationary pressures before they took root. The rate increase caused a sharp selloff in the stock market, which has recovered since then.
While Mr. Greenspan's willingness to hold off on further rate increases no doubt has its limits, today's decision was applauded by many of the groups that had criticized the rate increase in March.
"From living rooms to board rooms, anyone concerned with economic growth and continued high employment can breathe easier," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "The Fed recognized that there is no need to fix an unbroken economy."
In holding rates steady today, the Federal Reserve was clearly betting on a repeat of the events in the economy last year: a period of unusually strong growth followed by a slowdown that bled off any mounting inflationary pressure, averting the need for action.
Still, the risks in the strategy are substantial. The economy grew 3.8 percent in the last quarter of 1996, and then by 5.6 percent in the first three months of this year. With unemployment at 4.9 percent in April, traditional economic forecasts predicted that employers would begin bidding up wages to attract the workers needed to keep increasing their output, and that wage increases would feed through to consumers in the form of higher prices.
At its meeting in March, the Fed decided that the risks of accelerating inflation were sufficient to justify a small step to cool down the economy. It therefore raised the target for the Federal funds rate -- the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent.
As Mr. Greenspan put it in a speech this month defending the move, "The risk to the economy from inaction came to outweigh the risk from action."
But since then nearly all the economic evidence has suggested that inflation remains well contained, that the consumer spending binge that drove growth earlier in the year has cooled off and that companies have built big inventories that they must sell before placing new orders -- all factors suggesting that the economy is not overheating.
At a minimum, the Federal Reserve decided today that it could afford to wait at least until its July meeting to get a clearer indication of whether the economy was slowing sufficiently on its own to eliminate the inflation threat, analysts said.
"The real question is what the incoming information will look like over the next six weeks," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities.
Analysts said the decision today may also have been influenced by the agreement between the Clinton Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress on a plan to eliminate the Federal budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan has pushed hard for deficit reduction, saying a credible plan to balance the budget would help bring down interest rates. To raise rates immediately after a bipartisan budget agreement could have undermined the considerable respect Mr. Greenspan enjoys on Capitol Hill, they said.
"Mr. Greenspan has proven himself very adept over the years in sensing which way the political wind is blowing, and apparently he decided that the Fed needed more ammunition before tightening again," economists at First Union Capital Markets said in a report today.

HEADLINE: House Democratic Leader Opposes Clinton's Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, broke with the White House today and said he would oppose the budget deal between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans.
"I do this as a matter of principle," Mr. Gephardt said this afternoon as the House opened debate on its budget resolution. "This is a budget of many deficits: a deficit of principle, a deficit of fairness, a deficit of tax justice, and, worst of all, a deficit of dollars." 
 While significant, Mr. Gephardt's opposition is unlikely to block passage of the budget deal that Mr. Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, signed off on last week.
His decision may influence some of his rank-and-file members, but a majority of Republicans and Democrats in both chambers support the five-year plan, which would balance the Federal budget, offer some of the largest tax breaks in decades and provide billions of dollars for education, social and health programs.
Mr. Gephardt, of St. Louis, is widely expected to challenge Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, and his announcement drew a sharp distinction between the two.
In the coming weeks, Mr. Gephardt may wind up on the opposite side of the Clinton-Gore team on several major issues, including extending most-favored-nation trade status to China for another year, which the Administration supports.
Mr. Gephardt has also expressed reservations about giving the White House the "fast track" negotiating authority it wants for a trade agreement with Chile. But the Democratic leader tried to quash the notion that his political positions were influenced by the Presidential race.
"This is not politics, this is not about some election, this is about the future of this country and what is best for it," he said.
Likewise, neither Mr. Gore nor the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, would be drawn into talk about Presidential politics.
"Let's not run the 2000 campaign in 1997," Mr. McCurry told reporters.
And Mr. Gore limited his comments to defense of the budget, saying, "It is a well-reasoned approach, and I think that it is a good approach."
Both the House of Representatives and the Senate began debate today on their budget resolutions, the first legislative step in the budget process and the outline for specific changes to come later.
Mr. Gephardt was the only one of the top four leaders on Capitol Hill to criticize the deal when it was announced last week. From the outset, he has been one of the harshest critics of the tax cuts in the plan, which he says favor the well-to-do.
Before declaring his opposition on the House floor this afternoon, Mr. Gephardt informed the President of his position in a meeting at the White House and met privately with House Democrats for about 90 minutes to argue his case.
His decision placed him on the opposing, and likely losing, side of the most prominent piece of legislation that will be debated this year. But the arguments he made resonate with a majority of Democratic primary voters and with organized labor groups that are the base of his national following.
"I think he has positioned himself excellently to command the liberal base of the Democratic Party in the primaries," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who added that he was "not the least bit worried" that Mr. Gephardt had the clout or support to torpedo the deal.
The package includes $115 billion in savings to the Medicare program and $85 billion worth of tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, broad-based, permanent cuts in the capital gains tax, reductions in the inheritance tax and an expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts.
The proposal also provides $35 billion over five years for post-secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit, all items that the Administration had demanded.
Republican House leaders had expected a vote on the budget resolution tonight, but that timetable fell apart after the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, introduced an amendment that the leaders said would wreck the entire budget deal.
The amendment -- co-sponsored by Representative James L. Oberstar, the senior Democrat on the transportation committee -- would increase spending for Federal highway and mass transit programs by $11.6 billion.
The sponsors proposed offsetting the spending through across-the-board reductions of 0.4 percent in tax cuts and spending. Programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, with mandatory spending, would be exempted from the proposed cuts.
As the idea gained support throughout the day, Republican leaders hastily convened a late night meeting of their rank-and-file to try to quash the amendment and White House negotiators rushed to Capitol Hill to lobby Democrats.
The loudest clamor against the budget has come from hard-line conservatives in the Republican Party and the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma, laid out most of the conservatives' complaints in a letter today to Mr. Gingrich. Mr. Istook criticized the agreement as "a high-risk plan, feasible only if future economic conditions are ideal."
He also complained that the plan would spend too much money, expands entitlement programs, open-ended commitments that finance all who qualify, and fails to provide all of the tax relief being promoted. He urged Speaker Gingrich to reopen negotiations.
"I believe this plan focuses on solving the problems of today's politicians, when it should focus on solving the problems that threaten America's future, to preserve our children's heritage and opportunity," Mr. Istook wrote.
Mr. Gephardt that the assertion that the plan would balance the Federal budget by 2000 was based on "dubious assumptions."
And while stopping well short of criticizing the Administration directly, he said the budget fell short of many of the other goals that its backers assert it will achieve.
While Mr. Clinton has touted a provision that makes $16 billion available to children who lack health insurance, for instance, Mr. Gephardt said the "positive effect" of that program was offset by cuts in Medicaid funding to children's hospitals.
"This compromise gives to children with one hand and takes away with the other," he said.

HEADLINE: PLAN TO PAY OFF U.N. DUES STALLS

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's proposal to pay $1 billion in dues owed to the United Nations has run aground in Congress. Republicans are insisting on paying only some of the debt, over a longer stretch of time and only after the United Nations agrees to a series of demands.
Proposals circulating in the House and the Senate would require everything from permanently reducing Washington's annual dues, while raising China's, to slashing the expense accounts of ranking officials. 
 Under the proposals, which have the backing of the Republican leadership in both houses, the United Nations would also have to reimburse the cost of American military equipment and support for peacekeeping operations, to impose still more budget restraints and even to allow the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to check the organization's books.
While the billion-dollar battle raged in Washington, in New York, the American delegate to the United Nations discussed the diplomatic immunity as applied to traffic tickets, an issue that has rankled New Yorkers. [Page A8.]
If Republicans have their way, Washington will pay the back dues -- the total is being debated -- over as many as five years instead of the two years that the Administration proposed. And the President would have to certify that the United Nations had met the conditions. "It's not going to be a payment up front with good intentions in the back," said Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota, a Republican who has been involved in drafting the proposals. "We have to say it loud and clear: the arrears will be paid only when the reforms are made."
The Administration, in quiet negotiations with Republican leaders, has opposed many of the conditions. And while it has agreed in principle to others -- including a reduction in the United States' yearly dues for general expenses and peacekeeping operations -- it has opposed writing them into law.
To do so, officials argue, would leave the State Department little flexibility in negotiations with the United Nations over changes in the organization's budget or bureaucracy. "It is a level of micromanagement by statute that is unprecedented," a senior Administration official said today.
At the United Nations, the proposals are encountering heated criticism from diplomats who have grown increasingly resentful that the United States will not come up with dues that it is bound by treaty to pay, even as it issues new dictates.
"We feel quite frankly that it is preposterous to put any conditions to the repayment of arrears, which the United States should pay under international law," said Nicolaas H. Biegman, the representative of the Netherlands at the United Nations. "It's as simple as that."
The wrangling between the Administration and the Republicans over how to pay the dues comes only months after the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, swept through Washington, promising to impose reforms and receiving pledges that the United States would finally pay up.
At the time, the election of Mr. Annan, a direct result of the United States campaign to oust his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, appeared to brighten the prospects for payment of the dues, most of which date back to 1994.
But the United Nations remains a target of many Republicans on Capitol Hill despite the Administration's newly vigorous campaign, led by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to persuade Congress to pay the dues.
There is even a bill before the House that would bar any payment, based on the argument that the United States should have been credited for all of its contributions of military materiel to peacekeeping efforts. That legislation, introduced by Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett of Maryland and sponsored by more than 60 others, has little chance of passing, but it underscores the difficulty of winning support for paying the dues.
The Republican proposals are included in a series of bills with similar, though not identical, conditions on paying the dues, including one introduced by Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, and another by Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine.
The staff of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is also drafting a series of demands. Senator Helms's demands carry added significance, since he has insisted, an aide said, on attaching them to the legislation authorizing the State Department's entire budget, as well as to President Clinton's proposal to reorganize the department and the other foreign affairs agencies.
Mr. Helms's proposals -- a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times and confirmed by Senate aides -- would pay the dues in installments over five years and set specific conditions or "benchmarks" for the United Nations to meet each year.
In the first year, for example, the organization would have to agree to erase all outstanding debt owed by the United States. That is sure to be controversial, since the organization argues that the United States owes far more than the $1 billion that the Clinton Administration recognizes.
By the second year, the United Nations would have to cap United States dues at 20 percent of the general operating budget, compared with 25 percent now, and at 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget, compared with more than 30 percent now.
By the end of the five years, the United Nations would have to accept increased auditing, start setting expiration dates on programs, consolidate the myriad environmental and development organizations and eliminate those dealing with regional economic and social affairs.
The proposal would also require the affiliated international organizations, like the World Health Organization, to reduce their budgets.
If the United Nations failed to enact any of the changes, the United States would simply not pay that year's installment.
The Administration has held a series of negotiations with Republicans in the House and Senate to try to work out an agreement on the language of the demands.
Princeton N. Lyman, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, said the Administration hoped to reach an accord with Congress that included "a set of benchmarks that are achievable," though some of those proposed by the Republicans were clearly not.
Another senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Administration could not accept repaying the dues over five years or cementing reforms of an international body into American law, which would have the effect of making them appear to be ultimatums.
"To lock it in will only cause other countries to refuse to negotiate," the official said.
But Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees United Nations issues, said Congress had an obligation to set rigorous conditions, since the United States paid the largest share of the organization's budget.
"Since we're carrying the load," he said, "we have some right to demand that the tax dollars be spent in an appropriate way."

Unannounced and discreetly, Laurent Kabila, Congo's new President, arrived in Kinshasa to take over the capital. But he did not announce the composition of his Government, which had been expected. A3
 
Support for Organ Donors
The top religious authority in Egypt reversed the prevailing interpretation of Islamic rules by saying that he was willing to donate his organs when he died. But conservative Muslims scoffed that the cleric, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, had been appointed as Grand Sheik of Al Azhar, the center of learning in Sunni Islam, by the secular Government to do its bidding. A6
 
Scandal Surfaces in Brazil
The Government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil has been accused of paying five Congressmen nearly a million dollars to vote for a constitutional amendment that would allow a President to run for re-election. A daily newspaper published what it said were transcripts of secret tape recordings in which two Congressmen discussed receiving payoffs. A9
 
Qaddafi Gets Mild Rebuke
The United Nations Security Council mildly rebuked Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi for violating an international flight ban against his country. In a statement, the council said it "takes note with concern" reports that the Libyan leader had flown to Niger and Nigeria earlier this month. (Reuters)
 
Taliban Makes Advance
Local residents said three provinces in Afghanistan had fallen to the Taliban, an Islamic militant group that has imposed strict rules on the two-thirds of the country it already controls. The loss of the three northwestern provinces of Badghis, Faryab and Sar-e-Paul seriously threatened the anti-Taliban alliance led by Gen. Rashid Dostum, and aid workers said heavy fighting was only four miles from his stronghold in Mazar-e-Sharif. (AP)

Senate Votes to Prohibit Method for Late Abortions
The Senate voted to ban a late-term abortion procedure, but the bill's supporters fell three votes short of the number needed to override the veto expected from President Clinton. While the vote may mark only incremental progress for abortion opponents, they gained some ground in the larger abortion debate. A1
 
Birdlike Dinosaur Is Found
A team of Argentine paleontologists reported finding what appears to be the most birdlike dinosaur ever found. Its anatomy appears to be intermediate between dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx, the earliest known bird. The new fossil animal has been named Unenlagia comahuensis, which means "half bird from northwest Patagonia" in the language of the Mapuche Indians of the region. A18
 
Gephardt Opposes Budget Deal
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader in the House, said he would oppose the budget deal between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans. Mr. Gephardt's opposition is unlikely to block passage of the proposal. But Mr. Gephardt is widely considered as a likely challenger to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, and his announcement draws a sharp distinction between him and his potential rival.

Health Care Bill Criticized
Republican senators attacked a children's health insurance bill proposed by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. They said the higher Federal tax it would put on tobacco would cut cigarette sales, costing the states more than $1 billion in annual revenues. The bill's sponsors intend to offer it on Wednesday as an amendment to the budget resolution. A20
 
E.P.A. Targets Mills' Pollution
The Environmental Protection Agency wants to force paper mills to make big reductions in their emissions of dioxins and other toxic chemicals into the water and air, at an estimated cost of $1.4 billion.

Appeals Court Tells Judges To Make Juries Follow Law
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in Manhattan that judges had a duty to insure that jurors did not ignore the law and impose their own values to acquit or convict a defendant. The decision comes at a time when the legal community is embroiled in a continuing debate over race and the justice system, and whether it is ever appropriate for jurors to acquit a defendant as a protest against a perceived lack of fairness in the justice system, which is called "jury nullification."

4 Charged in School Rape
Four teen-agers were arrested and charged with gang-raping a 14-year-old girl after luring her from a public high school cafeteria to an unused classroom, the authorities said. The girl had reported the attack to school authorities a month ago, but a member of the school's staff, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there had been doubts about her account. A1
 
Thousands Rally for Rent Rules
Thousands of tenants converged on the state Capitol to show support for extending New York's rent regulations. They protesters also demonstrated their opposition to Governor Pataki's proposal for a system that would remove rent protections from apartments when the tenants moved out or died. The crowd was the largest seen in Albany since State University students protested tuition increases two years ago. B1
 
Same Proposal, Different Vote
Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee approved legislation that would allow Broome County to eliminate its sales tax on clothing, even though they are resisting a similar proposal from Mayor Giuliani for New York City.

Jobless Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
New York City's high unemployment rate did not budge in April, remaining stuck at 9.7 percent, even as a booming national economy pushed down unemployment rates to low levels elsewhere around the country. The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.3 percent was also unchanged.
Nationally, only 4.9 percent of Americans were unemployed in April, the lowest level in 23 years. The gap between New York City's jobless rate and that of the rest of the nation -- 4.8 percentage points in April -- is now the largest it has been in at least 19 years, according the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The previous record gap, of 4.5 percentage points, was set in March 1997. 
 The New York State Labor Department said that on a snapshot month-to-month basis, not adjusted for seasonal variations, the picture looked better for both the city and the state. Statewide the number of service jobs, construction, and retail and wholesale trade jobs all rose, while banks and insurance companies reduced their job totals.
New Jersey reported last week that its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for April dropped to 5.2 percent from 5.5 percent in March. Connecticut has not reported its April rate yet, but its unemployment rate in March stood at 4.9 percent. KIRK JOHNSON

Aid Lags, Indian Colleges Say

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Leaders of the United States' Indian-run colleges say Federal support has failed to keep up with rising enrollments that are likely to swell further as an overhaul in welfare programs drives more American Indians to seek job training.
The leaders hoped that a new report on tribal colleges being released today would again call attention to their role in moving Indians out of poverty and into higher education. 
 The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said the tribal colleges, mostly two-year institutions, excelled at job training, business creation and community building even though money and buildings were scarce.
"Despite overwhelming obstacles, America's tribal colleges are educating thousands of our people, providing them with perhaps their only chance of economic self-sufficiency," said Janine Pease-Pretty On Top, president of Little Big Horn College in Crow Agency, Mont.
Total enrollment in tribal colleges nationally has shot up to more than 24,000 in 1996 from about 10,000 in 1989. Yearly Federal support for the institutions has remained at about $27 million since 1995, although President Clinton wants to raise that amount by $3 million in 1998.
The amount of support, about $2,890 per full-time student, is less than the $5,820 authorized in the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978.
Robert Lorence, president of Northwest Indian College on the Lummi Reservation outside Bellingham, Wash., said the Indian institutions often served as bridges to four-year colleges.
Mr. Lorence said that his 650-student college struggled largely with teaching basic reading, math, and writing, and that the demand on basic training would rise.
"I'm assuming welfare reform will include some additional funds for training," Mr. Lorence said, "but I haven't seen where that is or how it will come from the colleges."

HEADLINE: Bridging a Gap In the Resume;
When H.I.V. Loosens Grip, It's Back to the Job Market

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
A year and a half ago, a 49-year-old man named Robert was planning his funeral instead of his future. His skin had become infected with festering pimples that refused to heal. His weight had dropped precipitously. He found it physically draining to visit old friends who were also dying of AIDS, fading like wilted flowers. He thought of death constantly.
But earlier this month, there he was, robust and tan in a blue T-shirt and khakis, pondering three job offers and attending a new evening seminar on H.I.V. in the workplace, sponsored by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest AIDS service agency. 
 In a stark white conference room typically used by social workers to help H.I.V.-infected people arrange a safety net of benefits for their death, he was feeling the wonderment of contemplating a return to work after two years on disability.
Powerful new AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors have reduced the lethal virus in his blood to undetectable levels. Now Robert, who used to earn $70,000 a year in real estate and architectural design, hopes to have a new job by the end of May.
"It's like being resurrected," said Robert, who spoke on the condition that he not be fully identified because he feared prospective employers had misperceptions about AIDS. "I feel like a child."
Medical breakthroughs have left G.M.H.C. and other AIDS service agencies across the country suddenly grappling with fragile hope.
Even as they continue to assist ailing clients who do not have access to the life-prolonging treatments or have failed to benefit by them, the agencies are quietly reinventing themselves in concrete and practical ways to keep pace with thousands of people like Robert. For the first time since the beginning of the epidemic 16 years ago, the agencies are creating new classes, like how to deal with renewed health, and shifting the focus of others from finding a funeral home to finding a paycheck.
At G.M.H.C. in Chelsea, workplace issues have dominated the discussion in seminars and workshops in recent months. New classes deal with subjects like the rights of employees with H.I.V. and how to return to the workplace.
"That's all that everybody is talking about," said Lillie Mikesell, a G.M.H.C. spokeswoman. "It's all just exploded."
In San Francisco, AIDS Benefits Counselors, which used to be in the business of preparing clients for disability and death, now manages an employment service and has seen demand for job skills and placement workshops nearly triple since January.
In Atlanta, AID Atlanta, a nonprofit service agency, has conducted a series of free public forums since November to help clients with AIDS navigate the challenges of renewed health. The forums have broached everything from artfully accounting for enormous gaps in resumes (list accomplishments, putting the sizzle up front, rather than jobs in chronological order) to understanding changes in corporate culture and lingo (team leaders, not managers). For the first in the series of six public forums, a few dozen people were expected, but 200 showed up.
"We're in an incredibly pivotal time in the epidemic where we are looking at how to help people live rather than how to help them die," said Sandy Thurman, President Clinton's new director of the National Office on AIDS Policy. "It's a huge shift logistically as well as psychologically."
Even as AIDS comes to feel for some people more like a chronic disease than a death sentence, the shifting role of AIDS agencies has become a touchy subject to service providers. There are still many unknowns about the new drugs, like how long they will remain effective. But as the needs of clients change, some AIDS organizations are likely to be put out of business.
As lower-income minorities rather than white middle-class gay men have become the prime target of AIDS, racially charged tension has increased over the role that leading AIDS service agencies should play and where resources should be invested, according to patient advocates and researchers.
"There is an absolute need to help those who are now finding themselves healthier," said Mario Cooper, the founder of Leading for Life, an initiative to increase political involvement in AIDS issues among blacks, and a board member of the Harvard AIDS Institute and G.M.H.C. "But at the same time," she said, "the majority of those with H.I.V., increasing amounts of people of color, have absolutely no access to anything, period."
Viewing the availability of protease inhibitors as a new lease on life is premature for some, according to Linda Campbell, executive director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS, the oldest minority AIDS service organization in New York.
"Many of our clients have been unemployed for long periods of time and because of despair and issues of inequity have turned to drugs as a way of dealing with the horrors of everyday life," Ms. Campbell said. "For our clients, we still have to think a lot about what supports that people out of the mainstream have. What does their future look like? What is the promise of the future for our clients, given the realities of how the local, state and Federal governments are now rolling back their commitment to social support."
Officials at agencies like G.M.H.C. said they still have an important role to play for dying people, which include many low-income, minority and heterosexual clients. But they say they cannot ignore the changed reality. G.M.H.C. estimates that roughly 70 percent of its clients have taken protease inhibitors.
On a recent Tuesday evening, nearly 20 men and women filled a conference room at Gay Men's Health Crisis. Marla Hassner, a managing attorney there, was guiding them through their rights as H.I.V.-positive employees. Several in the group scribbled notes as the talk turned from insurance benefits to pre-employment interviews and disclosure of H.I.V. status to employers.
Ms. Hassner advised them against disclosing their H.I.V.-positive status to employers, saying the only reasons to do so were if they applied for disability or sought a disability-related adjustment to their job.
"Often disclosing status causes more trouble than it is worth," she said. "Your employer is not your friend. The law doesn't require companies to treat us with compassion."
One man in an elegant gray suit wanted suggestions on how to ask prospective employers about disability benefits without disclosing his H.I.V.-positive status. The lawyer recommended scooping up the summary plan descriptions of all the employer's insurance policies, rather than raising a red flag by asking for one on long-term disability.
As the men and women listened attentively, Ms. Hassner informed them that prospective employers cannot ask about their H.I.V. status, nor can employers legally ask if they are taking medication, only if they are taking medication that might affect their ability to do their job. They may be taking 30 pills a day, but if they are not experiencing any side effects, the answer would be no, she said.
Robert, the man who is weighing three job offers, was eager to know the ins and outs of individual and group insurance policies, but he was also anxious to know what to do if he became sick again. "If you do start feeling sluggish and slow and your job performance is not up to par," he said, "could you ask for a reasonable accommodation?"
The lawyer told him that it depended on whether modifications could be made to the job that would allow him to perform essential duties, but accommodate his symptoms.
Ms. Hassner reminded the group that the law says people cannot be fired because of their H.I.V.-positive status, but they can be fired for other reasons.
"If there's downsizing and a whole department is going under, you can't save your job by disclosing you're H.I.V.-positive," Ms. Hassner said.
She added that it is illegal for employers not to hire somebody or to deny them health insurance purely because they are H.I.V.-positive.
The tenor of the employment seminar echoed that of a debt-management class, where some clients -- who thought they would be dead soon -- have spent the limit on their credit cards. Within the last six months, the focus of the debt-management workshop has shifted from informing dying clients about entitlements and discussing their debts to exploring the possibility of personal bankruptcy and questions of protecting salaries from garnishment.
"A lot of the time, it's putting the client's mind at ease," said Robert Newman, a G.M.H.C. staff attorney who moderates the workshop. "You have a fear of the unknown. Are they going to put me in jail? Is there a debtor's prison?"
In a new class for women on returning to the workplace, the conversation the other day was about how the term "living with AIDS" is no longer merely a feel-good mantra but a realistic expectation.
Iris Maldonado, 41, said that for so long she "was like in a deathbed waiting for my time to come." She has a 15-year-old daughter whom she did not expect to see graduate from junior high school. Now that Ms. Maldonado is taking protease inhibitors, , which have been on the market for 17 months,she looks forward to the day when she might become a grandmother.
Ms. Maldonado, who counsels other H.I.V.-infected women, is learning to deal not only with crisis management, like finding housing, substance-abuse counseling and other help for clients, but also the emotional and practical aspects of perhaps going back to work fulltime. Ms. Maldonado, for one, is a bit worried about having less time to spend with her family.
"But it's a great challenge to go out today and help someone know there is hope for them," said the slender woman, tears welling in her eyes. "It's not the end. It's just the beginning."
She has finally gotten around to writing her will. She said she placed it on a shelf at home where she hopes it will sit for a long time, collecting dust.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
SENATOR JOSEPH R. McCARTHY was not known as a connoisseur. But from time to time he would, said one of his chroniclers, employ a phrase worthy of inclusion in any anthology of culinary bons mots. Asked how he liked his steak, Tailgunner Joe would reply, "Charred -- like the soul of an unbeliever."
Much has changed since the Junior Senator from Wisconsin left us in 1954, but most folks still prefer their grilled meat carbonized, at least on the outside. To the wine lover, this preference poses a dilemma: forgo the grape entirely or come up with something short of cleaning fluid that marries well -- as the food esthetes say -- with charred meat. 
 A third alternative, steaks and chops rare all the way through, which might stand a better chance with wine, can be dismissed out of hand. It's un-American.
Not too long ago, real men, the major consumers of grilled meats, did not drink wine. For me, at least, this perception changed in 1985, when the late Paul Castellano was gunned down on East 46th Street in Manhattan on his way into Sparks Steak House. Mr. Castellano was, as they say, a major underworld figure, a calling in which manliness is highly valued and readily demonstrated by mayhem, which is not always convenient, and by eating steaks.
Since Sparks happens to have a great wine list, Mr. Castellano's demise, whatever else it accomplished, established once and for all a relationship between red meat and wine. Had he made it inside, he almost certainly would have ordered wine, probably Chianti, a variety much favored in his set, as anyone who listens to court-ordered tapes will attest.
Probably a Chianti, but then, Sparks' owner, Pat Cetta, is skilled at steering even the most hide-bound meat-eaters in new directions. The best Chiantis, like the best Bordeaux, are not always the best choices to go with grilled steaks and chops. They can be too subtle, too nuanced.
Granted, skilled chefs and cooks, working with the best meat and professional broilers, can prepare a steak that won't overshadow an elegant wine. But for the most part, grilled meats, and particularly those prepared by backyard amateurs, need big, assertive wines that can hold their own in any company: syrahs from all over the world, barolos and other wines from the Piedmont, petite sirahs from California, any reds from the Rhone Valley, South African pinotages and, most important, muscular zinfandels, also from California.
Zinfandel is a red grape with European roots, but it achieved its own identity in this country long before any other important variety and has been adopted, one could say, as America's own. And since, along with Argentina, we are one of the few nations seriously hooked on grilled meat, it seems only fitting that zinfandel should be our designated grilled-meat wine.
Mind you, not white zinfandel -- a sweet, slightly fizzy, pale pink concoction, more akin to soft drinks than to wine, that at times isn't even made from zinfandel grapes. Real zinfandel is a gutsy red wine, full of spice and fruit flavors and often fairly high in alcohol. Most wines these days average between 11.5 and 13.5 percent alcohol. Zinfandels regularly reach 15 percent alcohol, and some recent monsters from De Loach Vineyards in Sonoma County have gone as high as 17.5 percent.
Delicious wines, but not for the faint of heart or for anyone driving home from the picnic.
Zinfandel can display all the finesse of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, but even the most elegant of the breed will also be full-flavored, ready to hold up to any steak, lamb chop or loin of pork -- overdone, underdone or just right.
Stockbrokers, especially successful ones, can be enthusiastic steak eaters, which, in good times like these, can lead to excess. A few months ago, around bonus time, two Young Turks were spotted at Wollensky's Grill on 49th Street, just off Third Avenue, lunching on hamburgers and Chateau Pichon-Lalande 1970. One evening around the same time, a group of eight young men, at the Post House on East 63d Street, chose to pair their steaks with a jeroboam -- eight bottles in one -- of Robert Mondavi Reserve cabernet sauvignon.
Stock market hubris has its own rules. Under less dramatic conditions, say, around the trusty Weber grill in the backyard, more modest wines should be the order of the day. And not just for economic reasons. An unsubtle grilled steak really calls for an unsubtle wine: one of those De Loach zinfandels, for example, or one from Ravenswood, Fetzer, Rodney Strong, Kendall-Jackson or Ridge. From northern Italy, a Gattinara from Travaglini or a spanna from Dessilani would work well. So would a southern Italian red like Taurino's Notarpanaro. From France, a hearty Cote du Rhone or a Gigondas from Guigal would honor any cookout, as would a solid shiraz from Rosemount, in Australia.
These are all easy-going wines at, generally, easy-going prices, many of them at or around $10. Which means that stocking enough for a crowd is not going to be a problem. It's important to be well stocked: people get impatient waiting for the fire to get hot. And if the steak doesn't turn out as planned, well, these are all wines that will go well with the pizza when it arrives 30 minutes later as a backup.

TASTINGS
Paul Thomas Cabernet-Merlot 1995 (Washington State). About $10.
 
Like many Pacific Northwest winemakers, Paul Thomas started out with fruit wine -- in his case, Crimson Rhubarb. He moved into grapes in the late 1970's and began a few years ago to turn out some interesting wines. Washington winemakers have always emphasized that their growing conditions are more Bordeaux-like than those in California. Their leaner, less aggressive wines tend to prove the point. They may not have the full-bodied richness of the California wines, but, at their best, they display complexity and nuance that their cousins to the south sometimes lack. This blend skillfully combines cabernet structure and merlot roundness in an extremely pleasant package. The blend is 57 percent cabernet and 43 percent merlot. And the price is not unattractive, either.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up as Trade Gap Eases And on German View of Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose broadly yesterday after the Government reported a surprising shrinkage in the monthly trade deficit and a senior German central banker said he favored an exchange rate of about 1.7000 marks.
Traders said the dollar was also helped by rumors of Asian central-bank purchases of dollars as well as remarks by Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's top foreign-exchange policy maker, emphasizing the importance of currency stability. 
 The dollar's gain partly reversed a big drop the day before, when talk about higher Japanese interest rates and a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave United States rates unchanged pushed the dollar sharply lower against the yen.
At one point on Tuesday, the dollar was at a five-month low against the yen. Even with the partial comeback yesterday, the dollar has retreated with remarkable speed from its four-and-a-half-year high of 127.46 yen reached three weeks ago.
In New York, the dollar settled at 114.18 yen, up from 113.04 yen on Tuesday. The dollar cost 1.6946 marks, up from 1.6823. The pound was at $1.6450, down from $1.6570.
The main force helping the dollar was the Commerce Department report that the March trade deficit narrowed sharply to $8.5 billion, largely because of record export sales. Many traders had been expecting the deficit to widen.
The report diminished fears that the dollar's recent strength had hurt exporters by making United States goods too expensive. It also contributed to evidence of healthy economic growth and inflationary pressure that suggested the Fed may nudge interest rates higher at its next policy-making meeting in July. Higher rates tend to make dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
The currency was also helped by Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council, who said he favored "a quiet dollar level in the area of 1.7000 marks for the foreseeable future."
Mr. Kobnick was speaking to reporters in Mainz, where he heads the Bundesbank's regional central bank.
Some traders said the dollar was helped in early Asian dealings on rumors that the central banks of Thailand and South Korea were buying dollars and selling yen.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Detain Reporter Who Is Said to Have Irked Arafat

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 21

 BODY:
A Palestinian journalist was being held without charges by the Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Ramallah today, evidently because of Yasir Arafat's irritation with his live television broadcasts of meetings of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
The journalist, Daoud Kuttab, an American citizen and director of the Modern Media Institute at Al Quds University in Jerusalem, was summoned by a Palestinian police captain to Ramallah Tuesday night, and has been held in the police station in the West Bank city since, Mr. Kuttab's brother and his colleagues said. 
 American officials said they were told by the Palestinians that Mr. Kuttab was detained on the orders of Mr. Arafat, and was likely to be held at least until Mr. Arafat returned from a trip to Egypt. Mr. Kuttab was reported in good condition.
Though no reason was given for Mr. Kuttab's detention and no charges were filed, his brother, Jonathan, said he and his institute had several run-ins with officials of the Palestinian Authority over his live broadcasts from sessions of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
On Tuesday the council, many of whose 88 members are politically independent, fiercely assailed the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat over purported corruption and misuse of official funds. Some council members demanded to see the budget for Mr. Arafat's office and accused the authority with favoritism in hiring and of subsidizing homes for its ministers.
"The council's economic committee found that taxpayers' money has been misused," declared the report of the council's economic committee, which was read by its chairman, Saad al-Krunz.
The session was broadcast in several Palestinian cities -- including Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jenin and Nablus -- through the Modern Media Institute.
The institute, of which Mr. Kuttab is the founder and director, has been broadcasting all council sessions live for about two months with financing from a European grant. In that time, it has had several clashes with the Palestinian Authority, and some of its broadcasts have been cut short by the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, which controls all television stations in the West Bank.
Tuesday's broadcast was not cut. But after the session ended the head of the Ramallah police, identified only as Captain Fares, summoned Mr. Kuttab to his office. Mr. Kuttab lives in Jerusalem, under Israeli jurisdiction, but went anyway.
Jonathan Kuttab said: "I attribute his arrest to some people in the Palestinian Authority, not all, wanting either to stifle the debate or at least not to have the very lively, very democratic debate that goes on in the Legislative Council to be broadcast live to the whole population." He added, "They're trying to limit it, to prevent the publicity as much as they can."
Though the 88-member council has won some concessions from Mr. Arafat, it has not directly challenged his leadership.
The detention of Mr. Kuttab, and the accusations leveled by the Palestinian Legislative Council, added to a growing list of complaints of corruption and human-rights violations by the Palestinian Authority.
Mr. Kuttab was awarded the International Press Freedom Award last year by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists for his opposition to censorship by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities.
Several prominent Palestinians have been detained in disputes with the authority, including Bassam Eid, a human-rights monitor in the West Bank, and Eyad Sarraj, a psychiatrist in Gaza who criticized the Authority in an interview.

HEADLINE: Burmese Crack Down as U.S. Investment Ban Goes Into Effect

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 21

 BODY:
As an American ban on new investments in Myanmar took effect, the Burmese military Government was reported today to have carried out a new wave of arrests of members of the pro-democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The human rights group Amnesty International said that at least 50 members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, had been detained. 
 Foreign diplomats in the Burmese capital, Yangon, formerly Rangoon, confirmed by telephone that arrests were taking place in several cities. An official of the pro-democracy party told The Associated Press that the arrests had begun on Monday and that a number of party members were taking refuge in Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's compound.
The American economic sanctions, intended to punish the military Government for human rights abuses, were announced a month ago, signed into law on Tuesday and took effect today. In announcing the action, President Clinton said it was taken in response to increased political repression as well as to Myanmar's continued production of opium and heroin.
The imposition of sanctions drew a stubborn response from Myanmar's military leaders and from officials of neighboring nations, which are to decide at the end of this month whether to admit Myanmar into their political and economic bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
"Since Myanmar is walking on a straight line towards her noble goal, there is no reason to deviate from its original path to serve the interest of a foreign government," the Myanmar Government said in a statement last month.
The arrests this week appeared to be an attempt to block a congress of the National League for Democracy planned for next week to mark the seventh anniversary of parliamentary elections in which the party won more than 80 percent of the seats. The military Government refused to honor the results and continues to hold power.
A similar round of arrests took place a year ago before similar plans for a party congress. At that time, Government officials said 262 party delegates were detained. Most were released shortly afterward, but more than 20 were tried and sentenced to prison terms.
Since then, Government pressure on the pro-democracy movement and its leader has continued, with more arrests and with tightening restrictions on the activities and movements of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
Her weekly addresses to supporters outside her home have been blocked and soldiers outside her home bar most visitors. Her telephone has been cut off for much of that time, and she could not be reached today for comment.
The sanctions allow existing American business contracts to remain in force, including the largest single foreign investment in Myanmar, a $1 billion natural gas pipeline being developed jointly by Unocal, based in California.
After the announcement of sanctions last month, Unocal said it was suspending exploration activities for additional deposits of oil and gas, and Anheuser-Busch said it was suspending exports of beer to Myanmar.
A number of other American companies have already pulled out of Myanmar because of the publicity surrounding its human rights record.

HEADLINE: Toronto Journal;
After 27,000 Guests, the Great Gabfest Winds Up

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 21

 BODY:
At last count he has done some 27,000 interviews, though he would be the first to admit that after all the rhubarb recipes ("Is there a way to make it less stringy?"), Celtic musicians and Quebec separatists he has introduced, 27,000 sometimes seems too low.
For 15 years, the busy interviewer, Peter Gzowski (pronounced ZAH-ski), has been host of a three-hour daily radio program called "Morningside" heard by more than 1.5 million people from coast to coast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 
 There is even an hour of highlights rebroadcast every night, making his old plaid bathrobe of a voice far more familiar, and certainly more comforting, than any Prime Minister's or other public official's.
With so much exposure, it is no wonder that Canada has been down with a bad case of national anxiety since Mr. Gzowski announced last fall that he would leave "Morningside" at the end of this month.
The show, which features not just cooks and kooks but also political panels, economic discussions and long talks about serious issues like family values and Canadian peacekeepers, will be replaced by a program that is being developed.
"I miss him already," Beth Kaplan of Toronto, a listener, wrote in an essay in The Globe and Mail in February, months before Mr. Gzowski would do his last program. "How can this country survive in the morning if Peter Gzowski vanishes for good?"
In a country forever in search of its own voice, Mr. Gzowski has become a stand-in for Canada, as curious as he is courteous, interested in hockey heroes and indigenous customs and all the forgotten chapters of a national history and culture that he constantly challenges his listeners to cherish and defend.
"When I say this it is not in the spirit of anti-Americanism, but we live next door to the cultural monolith and it washes over us every day and in every way," Mr. Gzowski said in an interview in the downtown Toronto radio studio where he broadcasts "Morningside." "And the more globalized the world gets, the more precarious our culture gets."
It is a culture he feels is as vivid and sprawling as the Canadian landscape itself, if sometimes just as hard to reach. Mr. Gzowski is 62 and remembers how as a child in southern Ontario he did not hear Canadian voices on the radio or read Canadian voices in books. Some 40 years ago, after dropping out of the University of Toronto, he went in search of those voices, landing a job as city editor of The Moose Jaw Times-Herald in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
There he "felt the wrath of prairie thunder and, in its aftermath, smelled the fresh earth and heard the meadowlark sing," he wrote in his latest monthly column in Canadian Living magazine. Out west he also brushed up against the values that separate Canadians from many Americans, mostly based on the need to act collectively to survive a harsh climate and vast empty spaces.
He said the publicly supported CBC was founded on that same shared spirit, and he has spent most of his career there. When he received a Peabody Award this month in recognition of his broadcasting work, it was the first time a Canadian working in Canada had been so honored.
Mr. Gzowski's style gives "Morningside" its wide comfort zone. He stutters often, and trips up on his questions the way, well the way most people do. His smoker's voice sounds rumpled, which is the way he looks, dressed in bulky sweater, suede loafers and shapeless pants.
Listeners find "Morningside" reassuringly Canadian, a phenomenon in these days of shock radio and talk show bombast. The program runs from 9 to noon, when the audience includes a mix of farmers, fishermen and home workers, including housewives and craftsmen.
"If I had wanted to change the face of Canadian crafts I could have said, 'O.K., everybody, today we're working in green,' and every potter in the country would have said 'Yes, Peter,' cause they all had 'Morningside' on," he said.
Mr. Gzowski's guests are unfailingly polite, and blessed with so much time that neither they nor their host ever feel much pressure. He has interviewed former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, the writer Margaret Atwood, the film producer Norman Jewison and many lesser known characters like Clarence Asham, a Winnipeg savant who can instantly replay on his accordion any music he hears. Mr. Gzowski has interviewed him twice.
"Time is one of the real luxuries," Mr. Gzowski said.
But the folksy image of the program rankles some people, and even more offensive to them is the idea that somehow it holds Canada together. "If 'Morningside,' which is listened to by less than 15 percent of the entire nation each day, is all the glue we've got, we might as well be trying to bind the Titanic with Bondfast," Geoff Pevere and Greig Dymond wrote in "Mondo Canuck" (Prentice Hall Canada, 1996).
But there is something about "Morningside" that resonates in many Canadians. During the disastrous Red River flood in Manitoba last month, Mr. Gzowski and his staff organized a fund-raiser that they called the Red River Rally, with performances by dozens of Canadian artists. They raised almost $2 million.
Mr. Gzowski said he would like to write a book when he leaves "Morningside," but beyond that he has not decided what to do. But he is certain that even after 27,000 interviews, there are plenty more interesting Canadians out there to talk to.
"Some days I get up and think, 'My God, I must have talked to everybody,' and then the next day I come in and there's someone I never heard of," Mr. Gzowski said. "And he gives me a mind-boggling interview, just filled with breathtaking wisdom and pleasure and challenge, and I didn't know that guy existed."

Bond Prices Fall on Report Of Trade Gap

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities dropped sharply yesterday after the Government reported a smaller-than-expected trade deficit for March. The report suggested strong economic growth, which the Federal Reserve might eventually decide to confront by raising interest rates.
Other factors, including a decline in the dollar, also weighed on bond prices; a strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments such as Treasury securities more attractive because of the potential for gains in currency translation. 
 The 30-year bond dropped 22/32, to 95 28/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.95 percent, from 6.90 percent on Tuesday, when the central bank's policy- setting committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged.
But investors were not convinced that the Fed will not act to curb strong economic growth in an effort to forestall a resurgence of inflation. The decline of the trade deficit was a further cause for concern for those who think the Fed will raise rates soon, because it suggested surprising strength in the economy.
The trade deficit in goods and services, reported by the Commerce Department, narrowed 19.3 percent, to $8.5 billion, in March, as exports and imports both rose to records. Analysts had expected a $10.2 billion gap.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices in April, or prices that American businesses paid for imported goods, fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, the fourth straight monthly decline. Analysts said the report was in line with other recent Government statistics that suggest inflation is still benign.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that operates on the Internet, said that selling by hedge funds, in addition to the effect of the report on the trade gap, fueled the decline in Treasury prices yesterday.
Next week, investors will face another factor that could weigh on prices in the Treasury market: new supply. The Treasury announced the size of auctions of new notes scheduled for next Wednesday and Thursday. Next Wednesday, the Government plans to sell $16.5 billion of new two-year notes, and on Thursday, $12 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.26 percent, and the five-year at a price to yield 6.56 percent.
Today, the Treasury will sell $13.75 billion of a new 52-week bill. Yesterday, the rate on the current-issue bill was 5.46 percent.
In the municipal bond market, prices were little changed as New York City and other issuers of municipal paper sold $1.25 billion in debt securities.
New York City, the biggest borrower in the trillion-dollar municipal market, last sold bonds about a month ago. Yesterday, New York priced $739.4 million of bonds through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers. Rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's, the uninsured portion of the financing was priced to yield from 4.30 percent, for a bond due in 1998, to 6 percent for one due in 2016.
A 10-year bond, rated triple-A and insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, was priced to yield 5.20 percent. Sylvan G. Feldstein, a municipal bond analyst for Guardian Asset Management, said he thought the New York bonds were well priced. "While there were a number of variables involved, there is not too much supply out there" in the municipal market, he said. Also, reports of an improvement in the city's budget situation may have contributed to solid retail demand, he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls Fashion Ads' 'Heroin Chic' Deplorable

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Asserting that "you do not need to glamorize addiction to sell clothes," President Clinton today accused the fashion industry of making heroin seem "glamorous, sexy and cool" through advertising that enticed young people to try heroin.
"American fashion has been an enormous source of creativity and beauty and art and, frankly, economic prosperity for the United States," Mr. Clinton said, "and we should all value and respect that." 
 "But the glorification of heroin is not creative, it's destructive," he added. "It's not beautiful; it's ugly. And this is not about art; it's about life and death. And glorifying death is not good for any society."
The President spoke at the White House to 35 mayors who met in Washington to draft a plan to control trafficking and use of illegal drugs. While applauding Mr. Clinton's criticism, the mayors sounded more concerned about finding resources for drug prevention and treatment programs in their hometowns.
White House officials said that the President decided to speak out against "heroin chic" in fashion photography after reading an article about it on Tuesday in The New York Times. The article said that after the fatal overdose on Feb. 4 of Davide Sorrenti, a young photographer who posed his models looking drugged and haggard, some magazine editors admitted that glamorizing the strung-out look indeed reflected a use of heroin among young people in fashion and had a damaging seductive power.
Mr. Clinton contended that such images enhanced heroin's renewed popularity.
"We now see in college campuses and neighborhoods heroin becoming increasingly the drug of choice," he said.
While there have been reports of resurgent heroin use at some colleges, the overwhelming choice of students is still alcohol, followed by marijuana. In comparison, heroin use is relatively modest. Still, Mr. Clinton's criticism seemed to be taken seriously in fashion circles.
"The President's right," said Patrick McCarthy, editorial director of W Magazine. "There is a problem, and responsible editors and fashion designers are doing something about it."
"He has stated the obvious," Mr. McCarthy said, "but when the President of the United States states it, he states it even louder. It will have an effect. This is going to be everywhere tonight and tomorrow, and you'd have to be crazy not to listen."
Fern Mallis, the executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said, "The fashion industry should not be the easy target to blame for society's woes."
But Ms. Mallis added, "We are going to take another very serious look at this issue."
"Drugs are not fashionable and we want to make sure that nobody in the fashion industry thinks that it's the case," she said.
The President complained in 1995 about photographs of half-dressed adolescents used to promote Calvin Klein fashions, and Mr. Clinton's senior adviser at the White House, Rahm Emanuel, said today that such advertisements demeaned the fashion industry's credibility.
"This is not about art," Mr. Emanuel said. "It's about attitudes and acceptability."
At the meeting with the mayors, the President also announced new steps to make it harder to launder drug money. He said that currency exchanges and check-cashing and other money services would have to register with the Treasury Department. Such outlets, which are common in poor urban neighborhoods, have become a conduit for drug profits remitted back to Latin America and other regions. Mr. Clinton said further that more businesses would be required to report suspicious business activity, which many American banks already do.
On Monday, the Administration announced that money transmitters and check-cashing services would be required to report wire transfers of more than $750 leaving the United States. The previous cutoff was $10,000.
The 35 mayors visiting the White House represented a study group on drug control organized by the United States Conference of Mayors. In their recommendations presented to Mr. Clinton, they made the first priority persuading young people not to use drugs, which mirrors the Administration's position. They also said that drug abuse would not be reduced without adequate resources to treat drug addicts. And they linked increased prevention and treatment to strong enforcement measures.
"This is a very complex issue," Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago told reporters after meeting with the President. "It cannot be answered by simple solutions."

HEADLINE: Standing the Heat, Wanting the Kitchen

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
They were impressive in their posture, impeccable in their toques and chef's jackets. Fourteen high school students, each standing in front of trays of chocolate shavings, eggs, chives, carrots, zucchini and guinea hens.
Then came the word: On your mark, get set, cook. 
 And so began a cooking competition yesterday for $130,000 worth of scholarships to the country's top culinary schools. Now in its seventh year, the competition is sponsored by a nonprofit organization in Manhattan called the Careers Through Culinary Arts Program, which offers school-to-work opportunities to inner-city students.
With a two-hour limit, the students were expected to prepare poached guinea hen with chive sauce and turned vegetables, crepes sucrees, creme patissiere and sauce au chocolat. "As we go through life, there are many things that aren't math or science or English that we use to live," said Richard Grausman, 59, the program's founder and president. "I hope they look at food in a different way, and gain an appreciation for many things."
Since starting the program in 12 New York City high schools in 1990, Mr. Grausman has expanded it to 18 other New York schools and more than 170 schools in six other cities, reaching more than 10,000 students.
Through home economics classes, the program teaches students the basics: sanitation, safety, food preparation and interview skills. The program is financed by private foundations such as the Bank of New York, Grand Marnier Foundation and Helena Rubinstein Foundation, and companies like General Mills, Land O'Lakes and Pintelle Farms.
The program has offered 300 students more than $2.5 million in scholarships to institutions such as the Culinary Institute of America, Johnson & Wales University and the New York Restaurant School. Past winners include Diannah Pena, 22, now a pastry cook at Gotham Bar and Grill, and Alfred Stephens, 22, sous pastry chef at Mesa Grill. If it wasn't for the program, Mr. Stephens said, "I wouldn't be here today, because I had no real solid plans after high school."
This year's competition was staged at the New York Restaurant School and was judged by chefs from rarefied establishments such as Verbena, Sign of the Dove and Aquavit.
It was a chaotic scene, as students scooped salt, measured milk, cracked eggs and assembled the ingredients -- all from memory. But everyone finished within two hours and 10 minutes, offering samples that were tasty and creative. (One student presented three crepes arranged like tulips, with stems made of chocolate sauce.)
The winners will be announced at an awards breakfast sponsored by Tavern on the Green on June 3.
"I think it went pretty good," said Milton Gotay, 17, a senior at Park West High School in Manhattan. "If I had a sharper knife, it would have been better, because the meat got choppy, almost like tuna. But this is a great opportunity, and some day I hope to open my own restaurant."

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Retreating 12.77

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday as investors continued to worry about the possibility of higher interest rates, despite the fact that the Federal Reserve voted to leave them unchanged earlier this week.
"You wonder how long this scenario of above-normal growth and tame interest rates will last," said John Niedenberger, who oversees $3 billion as a money manager at Advanced Investment Management in Pittsburgh. "We have a lot of good news on the table, and investors are worried about what will derail it." 
 Banks, among the companies most sensitive to rising rates, fell, led by Citicorp. A report of higher than expected profits from Dell Computer a day earlier sent computer-related shares higher, leaving the overall market mixed.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 12.77 points, to 7,290.69, after briefly touching a record high of 7,352.91. Travelers Group, the insurer and financial services company, fell 1 3/4, to 55 7/8, to lead the 30-stock average down. J. P. Morgan, the fifth-largest American bank, fell 1 3/8, to 103 7/8.
Trading surged to 538.2 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the first time in a week that the number of shares changing hands topped the three-month average of 486 million.
A Government trade report showing a decline in the trade deficit in March raised concern that inflation could emerge because it showed record imports and exports, weakening bond prices and fueling speculation that the Fed might have to raise rates at its meeting in July.
By not acting on Tuesday, "the Fed has introduced another layer of uncertainty in the market," said Charles Crane, chief investment strategist at Key Asset Management. "Financial markets hate uncertainty."
The Fed raised the overnight bank lending rate in March for the first time in two years, and in the past it usually has raised rates more than once after it has leaned in that direction.
Bank stocks were the hardest hit yesterday by the worries about rates. Citicorp fell 3 3/8, to 116 3/4; Chase Manhattan slid 3 3/8, to 93 1/8, and BankBoston declined 1 3/4, to 75.
Wells Fargo fell 7 5/8, to 258, and is now down 7.7 percent in the last three days. On Monday, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had pared its stake to 7.82 percent from 8.15 percent. The sale was noteworthy because Berkshire is run by the investor Warren E. Buffett, who is known for his "buy and hold" investing style. And yesterday, William Zuendt, one of the architects of Wells Fargo's $11 billion acquisition of First Interstate Bancorp, said he planned to retire.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 2.31, to 839.35, losing an early gain that pushed it to a record, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 9.87, to 1,373.75. Dell, which jumped 7 1/8, to 106 3/4, led both indexes. The company's fiscal first-quarter earnings more than doubled, topping analyst estimates.
The Compaq Computer Corporation rose 5 3/4, to 102 3/4; Microsoft climbed 1 1/4, to 120 3/8; Intel rose 1 1/2, to 162 1/2; Cisco Systems Inc. rose 1 3/8, to 65 3/4, and Oracle climbed 1 11/16, to 46 15/16.
Schering-Plough, which makes the top-selling antihistamine, Claritin, rose 2 1/8, to 89 1/4. The company said that it expected stronger than expected growth in earnings this year.

HEADLINE: Plan Is Offered To Reorganize Finance Sector

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Retreating from its most ambitious idea allowing banks to own manufacturers or other nonfinancial companies -- the Clinton Administration today introduced a long-awaited plan to revamp the nation's financial services industry.
For more than a decade, repeated attempts to overhaul banking legislation have collapsed from intense industry in-fighting. In deciding not to press for authority for banks to engage in virtually any business -- a proposal that has drawn sharp criticism -- the Administration has provided the framework, analysts said, for a bill with solid prospects of enactment. 
 The Administration did not propose any banking legislation last year, when Congress tried and failed to pass a bill repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1933 law that separates the banking and securities businesses.
The plan, outlined today by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, is an attempt to reflect the deregulatory changes that have already swept through the marketplace, paced by the efforts of Federal regulators that have allowed banks and Wall Street to move onto each other's turf.
"The old lines that separated insurance, securities and banking industries have increasingly blurred as new financial services and products have appeared," Mr. Rubin said today in a speech at the Exchequer Club here.
He predicted that increased competition in the securities, banking and insurance industries would produce savings of as much as $15 billion for consumers.
Marge Roukema, the New Jersey Republican who heads the House subcommittee on financial institutions, called the Administration proposal a "welcome contribution to our efforts to pass financial modernization legislation this year." She warned that if Congress did not act to establish order in the regulatory landscape, piecemeal approval of mergers and other activities could threaten the safety of the banking system.
Financial industry groups gave the Administration's outline cautious support pending its refinement over the next couple of weeks. "The devil's in the details," said Paul A. Equale, senior vice president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America.
Still, the idea of commercial ownership by banks is expected to remain an obstacle for any legislation.
For while Mr. Rubin signaled a retreat from the controversial proposal to allow banks to venture into a wide range of businesses, he did not abandon it all together. The Administration's plan offers such ownership as one of two alternatives.
Mr. Rubin suggested that permission for banks be linked to a specified limit on nonfinancial activity, expressed in terms of total domestic revenue. He also said that Congress might want to bar affiliation between a bank and any of the nation's 1,000 biggest nonfinancial companies.
No percentage was mentioned, but the Treasury is expected to accept a limit of 25 percent on nonfinancial business that is contained in a bill that has been sponsored by Representative Roukema and widely discussed in the financial industry.
Critics of commercial ownership by banks argue that such authority could lead to an overconcentration of economic power. The savings and loan debacle of the 1980's, when taxpayers bailed out failed institutions, has also been cited by opponents, who point to overly ambitious acquisitions and poorly supervised deregulation as a chief cause of those failures.
A coalition of farm groups, small business and small banks joined Ralph Nader and the Consumers Union today in a strong denunciation of any revamping that allows banking to mix with ordinary commerce.
"It would lead to a dangerous concentration of our nation's economic assets, jeopardize the impartial allocation of credit and place an additional strain on the Federal safety net to the potential detriment of the American taxpayer," the alliance said. Even a plan that limits nonfinancial activity is unacceptable, the alliance said, because it would "begin a slide towards massive" affiliation.
Even Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who was an early promoter of allowing banks into nonfinancial commerce, has become markedly less enthusiastic.
If there is to be no such relaxation on nonfinancial ownership by bank holding companies, Mr. Rubin proposed breaking down virtually all the barriers that inhibit competition within the various sectors of the financial services industry so that banks, securities firms and insurers could affiliate with one another.
"Reflecting the consensus that this reform is long overdue," he said, "these affiliations would help promote a genuine two-way street, one in which all participants have the opportunity to compete and innovate."
Under this alternative, Mr. Rubin said, the likely result would be for Congress to retain a separate charter for savings institutions, meaning that the current disparities between banks and savings institutions would remain.
The American Bankers Association congratulated the Administration for putting forward a plan and said it agreed with many aspects. But the association said it opposed the idea of merging the insurance funds of banks and savings institutions without merging their charters.
Still another element of the Administration plan is creation of a new entity called wholesale financial institutions, known as "woofies" because of the initials W.F.I. These would be banks that accept only wholesale uninsured deposits and would have access to the payments system but would not be considered banks under holding company regulation.
Mr. Rubin pledged to strongly oppose any erosion of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires that banks lend money in the low-income areas of the communities they serve, in any overhaul of financial industry regulation.
Over all, he said, "our objective is simple: modernizing financial services in a way that will benefit consumers, businesses and communities, enhance competitiveness of our industry worldwide and protect the safety and soundness of our financial institutions."

HEADLINE: Export Surge Eases Deficit In U.S. Trade

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit narrowed in March as exports surged to a record for the second consecutive month, spurring first-quarter economic growth and suggesting more of the same in coming months.
"The economy is in an extraordinarily strong position," said Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive at Pier 1 Imports in Fort Worth. "Some people feel that the second quarter will slow down a little bit. We just think we're going to continue to see this solid steady growth that we've seen for the last six years." 
 The overall trade deficit in March narrowed to $8.508 billion from $10.538 billion in February, the Commerce Department said. Before today's report, analysts expected a $10.2 billion trade gap in March.
Exports of goods and services rose 4.1 percent in March to a record $76.479 billion, led by sales of commercial aircraft, industrial hardware and consumer goods.
"The U.S. is producing goods that everybody wants and needs," said Michael Fenollosa, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "We're pretty good at making airplanes and we're pretty good at high tech."
Imports rose 1.2 percent in March to $84.987 billion. They, too, set a second consecutive monthly record, reflecting more purchases from abroad of consumer goods, food and beverages. But auto imports fell.
Over all, expectations are for exports to continue growing and for imports to remain close to current levels as low unemployment helps bolster the incomes of Americans, business executives and analysts said.
"With the dollar topping out, we should see good export growth," Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said. "The economy has a lot of momentum."
A surge in commercial aircraft exports was a big reason the trade deficit shrank in March, though that trend probably will not continue, said Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. "You can expect some fallback in aircraft sales, simply based on the fact that what we've had this month is a record," he said.
Still, the Boeing Company says it expects to deliver 340 planes this year, up from 218 last year, and many of those will go to foreign buyers.
And though steel exports are lagging behind other industries, that situation could reverse itself "if the dollar keeps on dipping" and the economies of Japan and Germany improve, said John D. Correnti, chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, a steel manufacturer based in Charlotte, N. C.
Japan and China are two places where United States export growth continues to lag behind imports.
The merchandise deficit with Japan, America's second-biggest commercial partner behind Canada, widened in March to its biggest monthly level since October -- $4.608 billion. That follows a $4.255 billion deficit in February, led by imports of Japanese-made computers, electrical machinery and telecommunications equipment.
And while the annual trade deficit with Japan narrowed last year to $47.7 billion, its lowest level since 1991, the stronger dollar has reversed that trend. New statistics from Tokyo showed that Japan's trade surplus skyrocketed in April as auto makers and other manufacturers cranked up exports to their highest level in 15 years to offset sagging demand at home.
"Six months down the road, growth dynamics of the world's economies will start to shift," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an analytical consulting firm in Essex, Conn. That could aid United States exports and cut into United States imports.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Holes in Internet Security Plan

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
A panel of computer scientists said yesterday that the Government's plans for unlocking data-scrambling software to pursue criminals and terrorists on the Internet could actually increase security risks and raise the costs of on-line commerce.
The researchers, in a study coordinated by the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit policy group in Washington, examined the technical challenges of the Government's Internet security proposal. The plan would permit American computer companies to export powerful data-scrambling software, but only if they established a system that would enable the keys to the code to be obtained by law enforcement officials with a court warrant. 
 The plan calls for these software "keys" -- lengthy numeric codes -- to be held not by a Federal agency but by third-party companies. To get the keys, law enforcement officials or intelligence agencies would have to obtain legal authorization.
The plan to use third-party key holders was advanced last fall by the Clinton Administration. It was made in response to concerns by civil liberties groups, including the center for democracy, that warned that letting a Federal agency hold the keys would make it too easy for the Government to monitor the communications of private citizens and in response to complaints by software companies that it would hurt sales.
But the 11 computer scientists -- experts in the use of software that encrypts, or scrambles, data -- concluded that the Government's so-called key-recovery plan, however well intentioned, would introduce its own set of risks and costs. "A key-recovery system is going to be extraordinarily hard to design and build economically, safely and reliably," said Matt Blaze, a research scientist at AT&T.
Another computer scientist in the group, Peter Neumann of SRI International, a research center in Menlo Park, Calif., said that having a key-recovery system in computing was similar to having a skeleton key to one's house as well as a personal key. The all-purpose skeleton key, it turns out, is easy to copy. "So the existence of skeleton keys or trap doors, as the Government is proposing, is inherently risky," Mr. Neumann said.
Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said: "Key recovery may be a nice idea, but it doesn't compute yet. The technical issues are the Achilles' heel of key recovery, and they need to be debated."
William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration, said the center's study seemed to assume a vast, centralized system that was not what the Administration intended.
Besides, Mr. Reinsch said, a number of private companies as well as the Government are pushing for key-recovery software, and the expense will not be prohibitive. Companies, he noted, want to be able to tap into communications for such purposes as thwarting industrial espionage.
Giving the Government access to the keys to pursue criminals, Mr. Reinsch said, will require the additional step of a court warrant. "But it won't require building a separate infrastructure for the Government's key-recovery plan," he said.
Still, the Administration's plan faces fierce political opposition domestically and skepticism by some foreign governments. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee unanimously passed a bill that would relax export controls on data-scrambling software and permit companies and individuals to use any encryption programs they choose.
Abroad, Germany said it would not do anything to regulate data-scrambling software for at least two years, while waiting to see how Internet markets developed. The United States cannot "force its policy down the throats of other countries," said Peter Harter, global public policy counsel for the Netscape Communications Corporation.

HEADLINE: Virgilio Barco, Ex-Colombia Chief, Dies at 75

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Virgilio Barco, an American-educated former President of Colombia whose dream of combatting rampant poverty with land reform and other ambitious social measures was sidetracked by an American-backed civil war with powerful drug barons, died Tuesday at a hospital in Bogota. He was 75 and had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since shortly after leaving office in 1990.
Hospital officials said the cause was stomach cancer. 
 With one-third of his nation's 28 million people living below the painfully low official poverty line and an array of well-armed leftist guerrilla bands carrying out attacks and demanding reform, Mr. Barco had his work cut out for him when he took office in Bogota on Aug. 7, 1986.
Tall and lean with a shock of white hair, black horned-rimmed glasses and a tendency to stammer, at first glance, Mr. Barco hardly seemed the man to set things straight. He was such a poor off-the-cuff speaker that he refused to give interviews during the campaign. He became the butt of widespread jokes, often likened to an absent-minded professor, one, moreover, with such a pronounced American accent that his English was said to be better than his Spanish.
If so, it was because Mr. Barco had spent 17 years in the United States, earning a degree in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying economics there and at Harvard, earning a master's and teaching at Boston University, serving as Ambassador to the United States and spending five more years in Washington as a director of the World Bank.
He married an American, the former Mary Carol Isakson of York, Pa. In addition to his wife, his survivors include four children, Carolina, Julia, Diana and Virgilio, and two grandchildren.
But for all his difficulties speaking, Mr. Barco established himself as a highly effective administrator and one of the nation's most accomplished politicians.
A native of the steamy, oil producing town of Cucuta, on the Venezuelan border, where his grandfather had obtained a valuable oil concession in 1905, Mr. Barco grew up rich. But against type, he attended public schools as a child and later joined the Liberal Party.
Drawn into politics shortly after he received his degree from M.I.T. in 1943, Mr. Barco ran the Ministry of Communications and later served in both houses of Congress, his first term interrupted by the civil war between the Liberal and Conservative Parties, which forced him to spend several years in exile in the United States.
After he returned to Colombia in 1954, Mr. Barco helped arrange the inter-party peace that laid the groundwork for a stable democracy, serving two terms in the Senate and becoming Minister of Public Works and then of Agriculture, Acting Minister of Finance and Ambassador to Britain before an appointed term as Mayor of Bogota made him something of a national hero when he successfully completed an ambitious construction program to prepare for a Papal visit in 1968.
As President, Mr. Barco made a valiant effort to carry out his economic and social reforms but he was soon sidetracked by American demands for the arrest and extradition of more than 100 drug traffickers, a demand that set off a wave of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations by the entrenched leaders of the nation's cocaine cartels.
Mr. Barco, who had barely mentioned the cartels during his campaign, favored extradition, but after the Colombian Supreme Court twice invalidated the extradition treaty, the President seemed immobilized.
With many Colombians openly favoring a truce with the drug barons, Mr. Barco continued to denounce them as leaders of a renegade state within a state, but he also began a public-relations campaign in the United States aimed at establishing that the problem was was the insatiable American demand for drugs, not the Colombian supply.
In the end, it was not so much the American pressure as the ruthless boldness of the drug barons that prodded Mr. Barco into action. After a wave of assassinations of public officials, he declared a state of siege in 1988, reimposed the extradition treaty by decree and began a full-scale war against the cartels, capturing or killing several high-level traffickers and extraditing a number of them to the United States.
When he left office in 1990 the war was still raging, and although the most powerful and notorious trafficker, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, was eventually killed in 1993, the power of the cartels was demonstrated in 1991, when the Colombian Congress overturned the extradition treaty.
Although reliable assessments are impossible to come by, by most accounts Colombia continues to supply about as much cocaine as it ever did.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Evidence for a modest impact from abolishing rent controls.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
TO economists, the persistence of rent regulation in New York -- the belly of the capitalist beast -- is a delicious irony. To some two million New Yorkers who live in rent-regulated apartments, all the tub-thumping in the world about how price controls are evil incarnate will not change a fundamental fact: While the typical rent on "stabilized" one-bedroom apartments in Manhattan hovers around $600 a month, the cracker boxes advertised in the Sunday papers cost $1,500 and up.
Economists would be delighted to calm the fears of those who worry that their rents will triple overnight. Average rents could not possibly reach the level of rents on free market units, they point out, because there simply are not enough people with both the income and the desire to live in Manhattan for $1,500 a month. But William Tucker, a specialist in housing and the author of a new report on rent regulation published yesterday by the Cato Institute in Washington, offers something better than common sense -- solid (if indirect) evidence that abolishing controls would have only a modest impact on most rents. 
 Rent controls, he points out, create an artificial "shadow market" for apartments at fantastically inflated rents. And the proof, he suggests, is in a city-by-city comparison of median rents against the rents of newly advertised apartments.
Mr. Tucker collected data on rental rates in 18 American cities, counting every "for rent" ad in a Sunday issue of the local newspaper during April 1997. Five of the 18 (New York, San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington) have some form of rent control. One (Boston) abolished rent control in January 1997. The other 12 (ranging from Philadelphia to Chicago to San Diego) have free markets in rental housing.
In free-market cities, rents on advertised apartments cluster around the closest available estimate of the median rent today, namely the actual median rents from the 1990 Census. In Philadelphia, for example, some 200 of the 500 apartments advertised in The Philadelphia Inquirer clustered within $50 of the $498 median from the Census. In Phoenix, close to half of the advertised apartments were within $50 of the $466 median.
Compare those figures with the numbers for the most tightly controlled local rental markets. In San Francisco, the median rent in 1990 was $690, while the median advertised rent on 480 listings in April 1997 was $1,400. In New York City the 1990 median was $545 and the median rental rate of some 3,000 units advertised in April was $1,350.
In the cities with rent control, Mr. Tucker argues, the price pressure created by shortages of housing at controlled rental rates is all focused on the small portion of new, uncontrolled housing. Thus if New York played by the same rules as Philadelphia or Phoenix, rentals would be higher than the current average, and much higher in a few hot neighborhoods such as Greenwich Village. But to fill most apartments -- notably smaller units in the outer boroughs -- landlords would have to keep rent increases modest.
From Mr. Tucker's perspective, the vacancy decontrol approach now favored by Gov. George E. Pataki, is "the worst of possible worlds." The number of units coming onto the free market would be small and market-clearing rents would remain very high, validating the fears of those remaining in regulated units. Indeed, that is precisely what happened during New York's brief experiment with vacancy decontrol in the early 1970's.
What approach, short of overnight decontrol, might work -- and perhaps even persuade New Yorkers that free markets in housing are not a dastardly reactionary plot? Roger Starr, the city's Housing and Development Administrator in the Beame administration, has long peddled the "matched lease" concept, which was used to extricate the city from commercial rent control after World War II.
Under the plan, landlords would be free to look for new tenants at whatever rate the market would bear, but existing tenants would have the right to stay in their apartments at the current rent until the landlord had a bona fide offer in hand. And even then, old tenants would have the option of staying on by matching the offer.
The idea, Mr. Starr says, is to allow prices to equate supply and demand very quickly, but with minimal disruption in the lives of existing tenants. Where the free-market price was actually far above the old rent, the landlord would be able to capture the gain. However, a landlord who reached for the moon would be forced to adjust his expectations before sending his current tenant packing.
"They tell me matched leases are too complicated," Mr. Starr said, "but could they possibly be more complicated than rent control as usual?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON HELPS KILL PROPOSAL TO RAISE TAX ON CIGARETTES

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
President Clinton today helped kill a proposal for a tobacco tax increase to pay for children's health care, clearing the major obstacle to Senate adoption of a resolution promising to balance the budget by the year 2002.
The President acted after Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi threatened to withdraw the budget resolution from Senate consideration if the health measure, which Mr. Lott called a "deal buster," was not defeated. 
 Mr. Clinton had his aides make telephone calls to Democratic senators urging them to back off the plan, offered by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, the conservative Republican from Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.
The plan for a 43-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax was then defeated on a 55-to-45 vote.
The Senate is expected to pass the budget resolution, which sets basic spending and taxing limits, on Thursday. The House passed its version, 333 to 99, at 3:28 this morning after a 13-hour debate, but only after a cliff-hanging, 216-to-214 vote against adding $12 billion to the $125 billion already allocated for highways in the next five years.
Despite the opposition of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, 132 Democrats voted for the budget resolution along with 201 Republicans. Voting against it were 72 Democrats, 26 Republicans and 1 independent.
Both Houses are considering very similar proposals, which include $85 billion in tax cuts and curbs on spending for Medicare, defense and most domestic programs below the level needed to keep pace with inflation. The net of spending cuts would be $204 billion through 2002, and if all goes according to the expectations of the plan's supporters the budget would be balanced in that year for the first time since 1969.
But the seven-hour battle over the $30 billion increase in the cigarette tax to pay for grants to states to help buy insurance for children of the working poor kept the Senate from finishing its work on the measure tonight.
This morning, Mr. Kennedy said, Vice President Al Gore's office called to say the Vice President would come to the Capitol to break a possible tie in favor of the Hatch-Kennedy plan. A White House aide said, "If anything, there was a miscommunication among Senator Kennedy's staff, because that was never communicated by Vice President's office."
By late afternoon, after complaints by Mr. Lott and other Republicans that Mr. Clinton had promised to help produce votes to keep their budget deals intact, Franklin D. Raines, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and John Hilley, his chief lobbyist, started calling Democratic senators.
Some were impressed, some were annoyed, but in the end four likely supporters of the Hatch-Kennedy plan who had been called voted against it. So did at least three Republicans who had said they supported the plan. In all, 47 Republicans and 8 Democrats voted to kill the proposal, while 8 Republicans and 37 Democrats voted for it.
As the vote was beginning around 4 P.M., Michael D. McCurry, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, explained the White House position this way:
"As a free-standing matter, I think this President's sympathies are pretty clear on the thrust of the legislation. The problem is, the amendment doesn't stand freely. It stands encumbering the balanced budget agreement we also fought very hard for. The President is not about to see all that hard work go down the drain, and he had very clearly been told by the majority leader that this amendment is a deal buster, and he is not gong to let that agreement go down."
Senator Kennedy scoffed at the idea of dealing with the measure alone. "That's like spitting in the wind," he said, explaining that as a free-standing bill it would be subject to a filibuster and need 60 votes, and moreover would have to be attached to a tax bill from the House. As part of the budget measure, it cannot be filibustered and needs only 51 votes.
Mr. Hatch told the Senate: "There is no way of knowing, but I think we would have won this one had we held the vote at the scheduled time of 11:30. I think the President and the people in the White House caved here." He said he thought Mr. Lott had been bluffing about withdrawing the budget bill.
Mr. Kennedy was milder, though he made a point of saying his calls to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore on Tuesday had not been returned. He said he thought the vote showed that a majority was attainable, and said he thought the President was "mistaken" to work against the bill. And he said: "We shall offer it again and again until we prevail. It's more important to protect children than to protect the tobacco industry."
When he was asked at a news conference whether he expected the President's support on future efforts, he turned to Mr. Hatch and said, "Why don't you answer that." Mr. Hatch said, "Yes." Then Mr. Kennedy said, "I would hope he would."
Today's battle was not definitive. The budget resolution is a broad outline, to be followed by specific tax and spending measures. And it already includes $16 billion aimed at children's health, although it also reduces money for hospitals serving children by nearly half that much. Mr. Hatch and Mr. Kennedy argued that the $16 billion would only provide coverage for perhaps 4 million of the 10 million children without health insurance and that the additional $20 billion they wanted to spend (with the other $10 billion set aside for deficit reduction) would finish the job.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, complained, "No one in their wildest dreams would have said we should have $36 billion to solve this problem, which I guarantee you is not that big."
Although the most effective attacks on their proposal were the ones that suggested it would destroy children's hopes for a balanced budget, it was denounced substantively from several different, and occasionally conflicting, directions.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, said it would lead to reduced smoking and cause great harm to his state's economy. But Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican, said it would hurt the poor because they would keep on smoking and have to pay higher taxes. He called it "an opportunity to further gouge the working people of this country."
Other Republicans called it an entitlement and said the money would not be enough and states would be stuck with additional costs, or said it was a step toward big government.
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the Republican who heads the Budget Committee, repeatedly attacked the idea as contrary to the budget deal. "There can be no more frontal attack in violation of this agreement than this amendment," Mr. Domenici said. But he also contended that no vote on the budget resolution could guarantee a tobacco tax increase for it would be up to the Finance Committee to decide what taxes to recommend.
Mr. Hatch replied that everyone knew what the amendment was about and he said the Finance Committee would follow the will of the Senate. "It's Joey versus Joe Camel and no procedural niceties can obscure this reality and everybody here knows it," Mr. Hatch said. Joey is a tyke in an advertisement proponents of Hatch-Kennedy put in The Washington Post today. Joe Camel is the cartoon character industry critics say R. J. Reynolds uses to push its Camel brand on children.

HEADLINE: $15 Million In a Fund Will Provide Housing Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A group of banks and foundations led by Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan will announce a $15 million fund today to subsidize New York City's community development corporations, the small, nonprofit neighborhood groups that have built thousands of homes and apartments for poor people since the 1970's.
The fund, about half of which has already been raised, is intended to support the community groups at a time when the Federal Section 8 program and other forms of government housing assistance are being cut, increasing the demand for the groups' services in poor areas. 
 Sponsors of the fund said it was also meant to acknowledge the huge role that the community development corporations -- many of them created by the clergy, advocates for the poor and others who are far removed from the world of high finance -- have taken on in building and maintaining housing across a broad swath of the city, from East New York to the northern reaches of the Bronx.
And since many of the city's banks and corporations have invested in the poor areas -- lured by a program of Federal housing tax credits -- they may view the new fund as a means of protecting the financial commitments that they have already made, officials said.
"These groups are the stabilizing force in their neighborhoods," said Gary Hattem, director of the Community Development Group at Bankers Trust, whose chairman, Frank Newman, is to announce the creation of the fund at a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Money raised through the fund is to be distributed equally among 50 community development corporations, and is to be used for staff salaries, work by accountants and engineers, computer equipment and other administrative costs.
"They need an infusion of capital to become more professional, and more institutionalized in their neighborhoods," Mr. Hattem said. The fund will also support an expansion of the groups' activities into such areas as job training and family services, he said.
Banks that contribute to the fund are expected to use it as a way of enhancing their standing under the Community Reinvestment Act, a 10-year-old Federal law that requires lenders to support low-income neighborhoods. The law applies to foreign banks doing business in the United States, just as it does to their domestic counterparts.
That may account for the presence of several foreign banks on a roster of those that have already contributed. They include the Bank of China, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Trust Corporation and the Fuji Bank and Trust Company. Among New York-based banks that have contributed are the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Republic National Bank.
Among several foundations that have contributed are the Fannie Mae Foundation, the Metropolitan Life Foundation and the New York Community Trust.
Although organizers of the fund have not selected the community development corporations that will benefit, such groups as the Mid-Bronx Desperatos, the St Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation of Williamsburgh and the Abyssinian Development Corporation of central Harlem, which have been in the vanguard of low-income housing rehabilitation, were considered certain to be among them.
Since the community development corporations began their work in the 1970's -- typically to fix up a small number of blighted buildings that had become centers of the drug trade -- the groups have rehabilitated more than 500 vacant buildings and created more than 20,000 apartments.
Since the mid-1980's, the main source of financing for the groups, and the main source of their close ties to banks and other corporations, has been the Federal Government's program of corporate housing tax credits, which are limited and divided between the states. The program enables businesses that provide money to the housing groups to recoup their investment, sometimes with interest, through reductions in their corporate income taxes over 15 years.
The tax credit program is administered by two organizations, the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiative Support Corporation, both of which have contributed to the new fund. Executives of both groups said they considered the fund a logical extension of the corporate investments that have already been made, even though contributors will not receive the tax credits that have attracted them in the past.
"It is a matter of enabling the community groups to do their work more efficiently, and not have to spend half their time writing grant proposals," said Paul Grogan, president of the Local Initiative Support Corporation.

Worries About Fed Persist, And Stocks Are Mixed
Stock prices were mixed as investors continued to worry about the possibility of higher interest rates, even though the Federal Reserve voted to leave them unchanged earlier this week.
Banks, among the companies most sensitive to rising rates, fell. The Dow industrials slid 12.77 points, to 7,290.69. But many computer-related issues rose, and the Nasdaq was up 9.87 points, to 1,373.75. [Page D10.]

HEADLINE: Extending Its Reach, Room by Room;
Marriott Set Out to Prove Itself In New York; Now It Dominates

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
When J.W. Marriott Jr. opened the 50-story Marriott Marquis in the midst of Times Square's low-rise porn shops in 1985, the hotel was described by architecture critics as a mass of concrete looming over Times Square like a giant tombstone.
Jurgen Giesbert, the hotel manager at the time, said that many people in the lodging industry thought "Marriott was not terribly smart spending that kind of money at this location." 
 The pessimists seemed right six years later when the economy went sour. Rates plummeted as hoteliers like Marriott saw half their rooms sit empty. New hotels came on line just as corporations slashed travel budgets and laid off employees. "Even Marriott International had a difficult time," Mr. Giesbert said. "New York was not a market in the forefront."
All that, of course, has changed. Now, towering in Times Square over the beginnings of a new office tower for Conde Nast, a refurbished New Amsterdam Theater and a glitzy Disney store, the 1,972-room Marquis is 90 percent full 100 percent of the year. And no company has been more intent on expanding its franchise in the midst of the New York hotel boom. While some people worried about the "Disneyification" of 42d Street, the hotelier has quietly set about turning New York into Marriott City.
Robert Deeley, Marriott's regional lodging developer, is scouting 15 sites in Manhattan, from the financial district to Times Square and the Upper East Side, for hotel deals, according to real estate brokers and developers. The company is building a 385-room, full-service hotel in downtown Brooklyn and has completed a deal to turn an office building at 866 Third Avenue into a 320-room Marriott Courtyard.
Marriott already operates 5,200 rooms at eight hotels in New York City, ranging from the Marquis to the luxurious Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South and the more modest La Guardia Courtyard in Queens. That is 1,200 more rooms than the chain's closest competitor, Hilton Hotels, and two and a half times more than the expanding Holiday Inn chain. Over all, Marriott plans to add as many as 2,000 rooms over the next two years. In most cases, the company owns the hotels; in some cases it is just the operator.
"Marriott is in the leadership position and probably has more rooms in the pipeline than anyone else," said Michael Fishbin, a hotel consultant with the E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group. "They have a plan in Manhattan to insure that they remain the dominant player."
Like Disney, Sears, discount department stores and supermarkets that had previously forsaken urban areas for the suburbs -- and now find those suburbs saturated with their own products -- Marriott has gotten downright bullish on New York.
"This is a market that's going to be strong for very many years, because crime is down and cleanliness is up," said Mr. Giesbert, now general manager of the Marquis and vice president of marketing in New York City. "New York is considered the shopping capital of the universe. No other city can offer the same kind of arts, culture and entertainment. Leave alone, it's still the commercial and financial capital of the world."
Marriott's competitors say they are not worried about the company's ambitions, best expressed in a billboard depicting a panoramic New York skyline pierced by a dart, with the tag line: "Chances are you'll hit a Marriott."
"I have the highest respect for Marriott and their aggressive interpretation of the marketplace," said Arthur A. Surin, senior vice president and managing director of Hilton Hotels. "One could argue that as supply increases, we want to be sure that demand does likewise."
"They can't control the market," added Paul O'Neil, president of Sheraton Hotels in New York. "Customer demand drives price. Marriott may be the most aggressive, but everybody's looking to expand."
Marriott's growth spurt has not gone unnoticed, either, by union leaders in New York. Most hotel workers in the city are represented by a union, but Marriott has successfully fended off attempts to unionize the Marquis, and labor leaders are vowing to crack what they say is Marriott's anti-union facade.
Marriott has acquired three hotel operations in recent years -- the Marriott East Side, the Marriott Courtyard in Queens and the Ritz-Carlton -- that are part of a citywide union contract, under which the owners of those hotels are prohibited from actively opposing a union drive, said Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council.
"We have a neutrality agreement with Marriott under the industrywide agreement," Mr. Ward said. "We've had problems with them in the past, but we fully expect to organize the new properties."
The sudden boom in the hotel business has been fueled by a dramatic rise in tourism that began in 1993. Last year, 30.3 million people visited New York, boosting restaurant and retail sales. In turn, occupancy rates at the city's hotels soared to 81.4 percent in 1996 from 69.2 percent in 1992, and the average room rate rose to $161 a night, from $126 in 1992, even after the city's hotel tax was sliced to 15 percent from 21 percent.
"The city's business-based economy has expanded to encompass an enormous leisure-based sector, which the hotel industry had previously ignored," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "As New York becomes much more attractive to the rest of America and to Europeans, the Marriott chain realized it needed a bigger piece of the hotel action in New York."
Still, the growing presence of Marriott and other nationwide chains dismays some people.
"The hospitality industry in New York was best illustrated by the grand traditions of places like the Plaza, the Waldorf, or even the new Four Seasons," said Lee Pomeroy, a hotel architect who had proposed a design for the Marriott Marquis that would not have required demolishing two historic theaters. "Homogenous hotels like Marriott's do not appear to be in the New York tradition of special places for a special city."
In any case, the euphoria over the current hotel market seems to have wiped out memories of 1991, when a recession and the gulf war combined to all but eliminate tourism and corporate travel. Analysts and hoteliers say there is little danger of overbuilding this time, even for an admittedly volatile industry. The high cost of new construction and the paucity of development sites has kept the number of new hotels to a minimum.
"I think we're headed for another record year for New York City hotels," John Fox, a hotel analyst with PKF Consulting, said. "I'm not concerned about overbuilding yet. But if every one of these projects comes to fruition, we may be getting to the point where we have enough rooms."
Analysts and Marriott officials say that the company is in a better position today to deal with the ebb and flow of the hotel market. It offers 10 brands, each aimed at a different segment of the market, from the luxurious Ritz-Carlton to a full-service Marriott hotel to the moderately priced Fairfield Inn and the long-term stay Residence Inn.
"The strength of our hotel company is in its broad base," Mr. Giesbert said. "Something always goes down, but something always goes up. You never become dependent on just one market segment. If you do that, oh my god, the risks are huge."
When it made its decision to build in New York in the mid-80's, Marriott was a much smaller company spread across the country. For Marriott to become a major national and even international hotel company, executives said they thought the company had to develop a major presence in New York because the city is considered one of the international capitals of the world, and Marriott had almost no properties here.
"We wanted to prove that Marriott could work in the center of New York as it had in the center of Des Moines," said one executive who refused to be identified. "We needed a major property in New York."
In recent years, Marriott has added a number of hotels to its stable, including the Marriott Financial Center in 1991. Four years later, Marriott International bought a 49 percent stake in Ritz-Carlton, with plans to take over the entire company and to double the number of Ritz-Carlton rooms by the turn of the century. Earlier this year, Marriott bought the Renaissance Hotel Group, which operates 150 hotels in 38 countries, including the 305-room Renaissance Hotel that sits opposite the Marquis in Times Square.
Mr. Deeley, regional vice president of lodging development for Marriott International, acknowledged that the company was not done with New York. He said he was looking for hotel sites in both Times Square and in lower Manhattan, but he declined to say exactly where.
Real estate executives say that Marriott has talked to Prudential Insurance Company about a site at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue in Times Square for a 350,000-square-foot Courtyard, a limited-service hotel aimed at budget-conscious travelers.
Rather than erect a new hotel, the company has considered using office buildings at 17 Battery and 26 Broadway in lower Manhattan for possible hotel projects, said the real estate brokers, who refused to be identified.
Marriott is also talking with Donald Trump, the owner of 40 Wall Street, a largely vacant office tower in lower Manhattan, about transforming 10 floors in the building into a Ritz-Carlton hotel. If a deal is struck, the hotel would sit within a few blocks of the 517-room Marriott Financial Center and the 843-room Marriott World Trade Center. But a boutique-sized Ritz-Carlton would seek wealthy tourists and top executives rather than business travelers, several executives familiar with the plans said.
"The beauty of the Marriott chain is that they're never going to cannibalize the market," said Steven Witkoff, an owner of the office building at 866 Third Avenue, at 53d Street, where Marriott plans to develop a Courtyard hotel. "I'm only seven blocks from the Marriott East Side, a full service hotel. But I'm going to have a Courtyard, which is targeted at the business traveler."

HEADLINE: IN TOBACCO TALKS, LAWYERS HOLD KEY

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Until two years ago, Maryland's shopping list was like any other state's, with its government seeking bids on data processing, canned fruit and road salt. Then its Attorney General, J. Joseph Curran Jr., went looking for something special: a high-powered product liability lawyer to sue the tobacco industry.
Six law firms submitted bids. But the sweetest came from Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles. Maryland would not have to pay a penny to pursue its claim against cigarette companies for Medicaid money spent on smoking-related illnesses. In return, Mr. Angelos would get a quarter of any spoils. 
 By striking a deal with Mr. Angelos, Maryland joined in a rapidly expanding alliance between state governments and private lawyers. Strapped for money, manpower or expertise, states have periodically hired private lawyers to pursue claims on the public's behalf, but never have the stakes, in money or public policy, been so great as 29 states seeking tens of billions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursement.
In the fight against the tobacco industry, private lawyers have assumed a role of extraordinary influence. With a small group of negotiators meeting in New York City over the last 10 days to settle those claims and others, the lawyers now sit in important positions at the bargaining table where the nation's policies on cigarette smoking may be decided for decades to come.
The talks have moved forward on several issues that could provide a framework for a settlement, said several people familiar with the talks. Some state regulators were briefed yesterday and more may be briefed today about the "timing and potential substance of settlement proposals," said one of those people.
Among the topics on the table are the size and shape of a fund to compensate sick smokers, the nature of restrictions on cigarette marketing and possible restraints on lawsuits against tobacco companies. Most notable among the lawyers playing a decisive role in those discussions are one from Mississippi and another from South Carolina, who together represent about 20 states.
Private lawyers take much of the credit for forcing the tobacco industry to the bargaining table. And on that point they have the backing of many states, which contend that they could not have done without lawyers who were willing to invest so much of their own money fighting such formidable opponents.
But critics, including legal experts and public health advocates, are worried about potential conflicts. Lawyers may be looking for a return on their investment, they say, while the states should be single-minded in safeguarding public health.
"Going to trial is a risk for any lawyer working on a contingency fee, because they put up a lot of money and could end up with zero," said Susan Koniak, a professor of law at Boston University. "But in a settlement, lawyers are guaranteed to get their money back and more, even though that settlement might not be in the public's interest."
The lawyers reject such suggestions. But others fear that some attorneys general will cede too much control of their cases to the hired lawyers. "For a deal to work, the public is going to have to be the winner here, not the lawyers, not the tobacco companies," said David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
There are other potential conflicts, too. Some private lawyers involved in talks with the tobacco industry represent not only states, but also individuals. Any financial accommodation with the industry will have to be split between the states and the smokers who have sued or might bring claims in the future.
"These lawyers have interests that may be different from those of the attorneys general," said Geoffrey Hazard, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in ethics. "They have a lot of money invested in these cases. They represent people who are privately suing the companies, and so they could face conflicts when it comes to dividing up any settlement funds."
Although dozens of law firms are involved in state Medicaid cases, just two firms -- those headed by Richard F. Scruggs of Pascagoula, Miss., and Ron Motley of Charleston, S.C. -- represent some 20 states in the tobacco talks, putting them in a crucial position to influence public health decisions. Mr. Scruggs, Mr. Motley and Joe Rice, a lawyer for Mr. Motley's firm, have been part of a small group of negotiators meeting in New York City with industry representatives to try to resolve legal and regulatory issues.
By retaining lawyers who have profited handsomely from lawsuits over such products as asbestos, the states also have riled businesses. Many corporations, keen to clip the wings of plaintiffs' lawyers, have campaigned for legislation that would limit awards in lawsuits over defective products.
The Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce, for example, is backing legislation that would require regulators to seek the approval of state legislators before hiring product-liability lawyers. In response, the state's Attorney General, Dan Morales, has described the group as a "front" for tobacco companies, a charge the businesses deny.
Because of the expense of litigation against the tobacco companies, many states saw no other choice but to pair up with private lawyers.
"I think the trial lawyers of this country are one of the main reasons we are on the verge of tremendous change for the good," said Arizona's Attorney General, Grant Woods.
The interests of state regulators and plaintiffs' lawyers in the war against tobacco first merged in 1993. At the time, the Mississippi Attorney General, Michael C. Moore, was approached by Michael Lewis, a former classmate at the University of Mississippi Law School, who suggested that the state litigate over an untested theory: that cigarette manufacturers were obligated to reimburse the states for Medicaid money spent treating smokers for tobacco-related illnesses.
To spearhead a possible case, Mr. Moore turned to Mr. Scruggs, a longtime friend who made a fortune suing asbestos companies. Mr. Motley, who also made his fortune in asbestos litigation, was soon brought into the Mississippi case.
Mississippi filed its case in 1994, and Minnesota followed a few months later. There, Minnesota's Attorney General, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, chose Michael Ciresi, a lawyer in Minneapolis who had successfully sued the A. H. Robins Company over the Dalkon shield, an intrauterine contraceptive device.
As other states joined in, their methods of selecting plaintiffs' lawyers varied. Like Mississippi, some allowed their attorney general to make that choice. Others, like Maryland, issued bid requests. Some, including Arizona, specifically excluded the Attorney General from the selection process.
As more states jumped into the litigation, a bidding war among plaintiffs' lawyers broke out. Last summer, Steve Berman, a plaintiff's lawyer from Seattle, made a successful bid to represent Arizona by offering to take only 18 percent of any winnings. By January, when Indiana contracted with Mr. Berman and lawyers associated with him, they agreed to take a maximum of 13 percent of any money recovered from the tobacco companies.
Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Motley, who made joint bids in many states, grabbed the greatest share of the states' action. "They brought economies of scale to the litigation," said Tom Miller, the Attorney General in Iowa, which hired Mr. Motley's firm to press its Medicaid claim.
Some people wonder whether Mr. Scruggs and Mr. Motley wield too much influence in settlement negotiations with the tobacco industry.
"Plaintiffs' lawyers have been instrumental in initiating these cases," said Mr. Ciresi, the lawyer for Minnesota who maintains that other states and their outside legal advisers are pressing too eagerly for a settlement before major issues are adequately addressed. "However, clearly it raises public policy implications when one firm represents a dozen or more states."
Mr. Scruggs said that he did not foresee any problem in representing so many states because he was seeking a nationwide resolution of a long-running conflict over smoking. And he contended that plaintiffs' lawyers, by investing their money in Medicaid cases, had already benefited the public by forcing cigarette companies into substantive negotiations.
"Public health groups have been around for 40 years," he said, but lawsuits handled by plaintiffs' lawyers are "the only thing that has brought these people to the table."
The pace of the negotiations is picking up as the start of Mississippi's Medicaid case against the cigarette industry -- the first in the nation -- is due to start in early July.
Several of the lawyers representing states, including Mr. Ciresi, Mr. Motley and Mr. Scruggs, declined to comment specifically on the negotiations. But two people familiar with the talks said that one proposal now under consideration would bar current or former smokers from bringing class-action lawsuits and would prevent them from collecting punitive damages.
The cigarette industry is also seeking to limit lawsuits from those who start smoking in the future. Under a plan being discussed, companies would only be liable if they sold an adulterated product, if a smoker's injury resulted from a violation of Federal regulations or if it was found that smoking caused diseases not currently associated with it, two people familiar with the talks said.

HEADLINE: Stopgap Spending Provision Stalls Flood Relief Measure

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Billions of dollars in flood relief for the upper Plains remained bottled up today, held hostage to several unresolved issues including an impasse between the White House and Congressional Republicans over a provision intended to prevent Government shutdowns during budget battles.
House and Senate negotiators worked to narrow their differences and approve an emergency $8.4 billion spending bill before Congress left for a weeklong recess in the next few days. 
 But the anti-shutdown provision proved a major obstacle. It would provide automatic stopgap spending at this year's levels if regular appropriations bills had not been approved when the next fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.
Republicans want the provision to spare them a repeat of the political black eye they suffered with the Government shutdowns in 1995.
President Clinton and Congressional Democrats, however, are reluctant to go along, because in practice the freeze would amount to a cut in education and social programs for which the President just won more money in the separate balanced budget deal. For that reason Mr. Clinton has vowed to veto any spending bill with such a provision.
Some lawmakers said this and other disputes could prevent Congress from passing the spending bill before the break. The measure includes $5.5 billion in relief to disaster victims, giving residents in soggy Minnesota and the Dakotas more reason to fume at the Federal Government's delay in dealing with their plight.
"Can I go home this weekend?" Representative John R. Thune, a South Dakota Republican asked Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who as head of the Appropriations Committee is the lead House negotiator.
"Yeah, if you want to get scalped," Mr. Livingston told his freshman colleague in a brief exchange in the Capitol this afternoon.
Mr. Livingston suggested tonight that if the sticking points were not resolved by Thursday, the disaster relief might be stripped out of the larger bill and considered separately.
The dispute over the stopgap spending measure was just one of a handful of issues that held up the overall spending bill.
Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee and is the Senate's lead negotiator, insisted that the bill include a provision to retain states' rights to build roads through protected Federal lands.
The Administration says the proposal would clear the way for building close to a million miles of roads across national parks, wildlife refuges and other Federal lands, mostly in Alaska, Utah and Idaho.
Critics contend that under the provision, remote rights of way such as dog-sled paths and hiking trails could be expanded into two-lane highways. Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto the spending bill over this provision.
Mr. Stevens denied any scheme to pave over Alaskan wilderness, saying the provision was essential for economic development in his state.
Administration and Congressional negotiators met for two hours today, and Mr. Stevens voiced optimism that at least a temporary resolution could be reached.
Another obstacle negotiators had not agreed on was a Commerce Department plan to use a method of counting known as statistical sampling when it conducts the census in 2000.
The Administration favors sampling as a way to increase the census's accuracy in counting minorities and other groups that are usually undercounted. Some Republicans believe this would give Democrats greater representation in areas where such voters live.
Negotiators made progress on other issues, agreeing to finance $1.9 billion in Pentagon peacekeeping costs in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf region.
And lawmakers added $76 million for the Women, Infants and Children Nutrition program, and extended Supplemental Security Income benefits to elderly non-citizens through Sept. 30. Without this provision, last year's welfare law would strike as many as 500,000 people from the rolls as of Aug. 22.
Negotiators also agreed to allow American sportsmen who legally killed polar bears in Canada before April 30, 1994, to import their trophies for a $1,000 import fee. Proceeds will go toward polar bear preservation efforts.
As many as 100 polar bears are now in cold storage in Canada, some for as long as 20 years, because United States law had prohibited their import.

Reformist Hand Is Visible In Russian Budget Plan
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin urged Parliament to slash spending on the military and state-subsidized industries to make up for a gaping revenue shortfall in this year's budget. His plan explicitly rejected printing more money and reflected the influence of reformers in President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet. A1
 
Brazil Favors Second Terms
Brazil's Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of a constitutional amendment that would allow the president, state governors and mayors to run for second terms. The amendment must pass a final Senate vote, set for early June. The amendment was the first bill presented by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso after he was elected to a first term three years ago. A3 

Turmoil Across Argentina
Cities and towns across Argentina have been rocked by often violent protests against the market reforms of President Carlos Saul Menem's Government, which have tamed inflation but have led to record levels of unemployment. Riot police officers clashed with tens of thousands of people and arrested hundreds. A3
 
British Meet With Sinn Fein
British officials met in Belfast with leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and discussed the possibility of a new cease-fire that would allow Sinn Fein to participate in peace talks. Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, and the head of the Sinn Finn delegation, Martin McGuinness, both doubted a cease-fire could be arranged by June 3, when formal talks resume. A9
 
New Party in South Africa
Roelf Meyer announced that he was forming a new political movement in South Africa that would focus on matters of concern to both black and white voters: housing, health care, jobs and fighting crime. Mr. Meyer, a chief negotiator during the country's peaceful transition from white supremacist rule, was dismissed two weeks ago from a key post in former President F. W. de Klerk's National Party.

Journalist Held in West Bank
Daoud Kuttab, a leading Palestinian journalist, was held without charges by the Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Mr. Kuttab, an American citizen, had irked the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, with his live television broadcast of the Palestinian Legislation Council's angry questioning of the use of official funds by the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat. A11
 
Burmese Regime Arrests 50
The military Government of Myanmar arrested about 50 members of the pro-democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, according to reports confirmed by diplomats in Yangon. The wave of arrests coincided with the signing into law of an American ban on new investments in the country, formerly known as Burma. A13

The Prosecution Rests In Oklahoma Bomb Case
The prosecution rested its case against Timothy J. McVeigh, calling as its last witness Dr. Frederick Jordan, the Oklahoma medical examiner, who gave the Federal jury a final tally of the 168 who died in the blast. The trial will resume today with witnesses and evidence presented by Mr. McVeigh's main lawyer. A1
 
Lawyers in the Forefront
With talks under way to settle claims against the tobacco industry, private lawyers sit in important positions at the negotiating table where the nation's policy toward cigarette smoking may be decided for decades to come. States have periodically hired private lawyers to pursue claims on the public's behalf, but never have the stakes been so great, as 29 states seek tens of billions of dollars in Medicaid reimbursement. A1
 
Pilot Taken to Task
The Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila E. Widnall, weighed whether to grant an honorable discharge to the country's first female B-52 pilot, who could face a court-martial on adultery, lying and other charges, though Dr. Widnall did not comment on the issue in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee about the Air Force budget. The Air Force Chief of Staff, Gen. Ronald Fogleman, sharply criticized the pilot, First Lieut. Kelly Flinn. A1
 
Tobacco Tax Increase Dies
The plan for a 43-cents-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax to pay for children's health care was defeated on a 55-to-45 vote after President Clinton helped kill the proposal. That clears away the major obstacle to Senate adoption of a resolution promising to balance the budget by the year 2002. The President acted after Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi threatened to withdraw the budget resolution from consideration. A1

HEADLINE: Albert's Accuser in Virginia Faces Criminal Charges of Her Own

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
The woman who accused Marv Albert, the NBC Sports announcer, of assault and battery and forcing her to perform oral sex is facing a criminal charge herself.
According to allegations in police and Superior Court records in the District of Columbia, on three occasions the woman called a former boyfriend who lives in Washington and threatened to kill him, his current girlfriend, his dog and then herself. 
 The charges against the woman were first reported by WRC-TV, an NBC affiliate in Washington, which made the court records available today to The New York Times.
The woman, 42, a resident of nearby Arlington, Va., made the calls March 13, according to a police report that quotes the former boyfriend.
The woman has accused Albert of assaulting her in an Arlington hotel room on Feb. 12. Albert has denied the allegations and said in a statement issued Tuesday that he was confident he would be exonerated.
Albert, 53, was indicted by a grand jury on Monday. A police detective testified that the woman had told the police that Albert threw her on a bed in the hotel and forced her to commit sodomy.
She said Albert had invited her to his hotel room after he had provided the play by play at a basketball game earlier in the evening. A police spokesman said that the woman "had 10 or 12 severe bite marks on her back, big red welts."
The woman was arrested near the apartment of her former boyfriend on March 29 and charged with making threats. The court papers indicate that at that time she had been unemployed for about a month, after having worked five years as a night hotel manager.
The records also indicated there were no other charges pending against her and she had no prior convictions in the District.
The woman was upset by the breakup and by the fact that the man was not taking her with him on vacation, the police report says.

HEADLINE: Abortion Opponents Begin Hunt for 3 Votes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21

 BODY:
Abortion opponents are already remapping their seemingly nonstop Congressional campaign to abolish what they call partial-birth abortion, focusing on a handful of senators they think might change their votes to help them prevail over President Clinton's opposition.
The likely targets of stepped-up advertising include Senators Bob Graham of Florida, Max Cleland of Georgia, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, all Democrats, as well as Senator Susan Collins, a freshman Republican from Maine. All voted against the ban on Tuesday, when the measure was approved 64 to 36, but they are perceived as vulnerable, either because of pressure in their home states or because they have been wrestling with their votes. 
 "There's a debate going on between some of these senators and their own consciences," said Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, which has lobbied intensively for the ban. "We're hopeful that debate will continue and that fear of unemployment will move three more votes."
That is the number needed to override an expected Presidential veto.
Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, which has also been lobbying for the ban, said his organization would continue with a three-pronged approach.
First, Mr. Reed said, "You frame the issue in terms of an inhumane, indefensible procedure that even the American Medical Association has condemned, and you stay on that message and you never get taken off it to talk about the health of the mother or any other rabbit trail that takes you off-message."
He said his group's state and local chapters would organize around the schedules of pivotal senators and attend all of their town meetings, picnics and parades. And, Mr. Reed said, they would continue radio advertising.
In the abortion procedure, which doctors call intact dilation and evacuation, a fetus is partially delivered and its brain is vacuumed out so the skull can be collapsed and the head can be delivered.
The House, which needs to reapprove the measure because the Senate made some changes in it, expects to vote in early June, shortly after members return from the Memorial Day recess. The bill then goes to the White House, where President Clinton has promised a veto.
That sets the stage for both houses of Congress to try to override Mr. Clinton. The House already passed the measure with five votes more than needed for an override, and is expected to do so again.
The Senate has debated and banned the procedure three times. Each time, the ban has gained more votes, 54 in 1995, 58 in 1996 and 64 on Tuesday. But it has never received the 67 votes needed to override a veto. Abortion opponents hope they can do so this year by keeping the pressure on and the momentum up.
Mr. Bauer said, "We even send faxes and letters into the offices of the stalwarts who oppose us, even when you aren't going to change your mind, it still makes you nervous to get all these letters."
While maintaining that there was momentum, Mr. Reed acknowledged how difficult it might be to extract three more votes, in part because it seems that after three debates and three votes, all the arguments have been made.
"At this point, you've gotten every vote of everyone who wants to be with you," Mr. Reed said. "Now it's only a reluctant vote and a tough vote and someone who may resent that you got their vote."

HEADLINE: Foreign Energy, Domestic Politics;
Burmese Project Tests Unocal Resolve

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Ever on the hunt for rich discoveries abroad, American oil companies have long had to factor in fears about the unstable nature of foreign governments when considering huge investments in capital and equipment. But now the companies are finding that politics back home is the new focus of risk.
The threat of unilateral economic sanctions, typically directed by Washington at governments accused of human rights violations, has become big enough to cast a shadow over investment decisions stretching from Southeast Asia to West Africa to the Caspian Sea, oil executives and other industry experts say. 
 No company has exposed itself more to the new unknowns than the Unocal Corporation. In an industry that is rapidly directing its investment focus offshore, Unocal has staked more of its future on overseas projects than anyone else, concentrating on Asia. Last November, it even sold its refineries, gas stations and other assets on the West Coast to free capital to invest in the region.
It has placed its biggest bet so far in Myanmar, where it is part of an international consortium that is investing $1.2 billion to develop the Yadana natural gas field. And while the field will not start operating until next year, Unocal's presence in Myanmar has already become a case study in the politics and pressures that are increasingly affecting the energy industry.
Last month, the Clinton Administration approved the use of sanctions against Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, under legislation that the President signed last fall.
Even so, Unocal will remain in business there. The sanctions, which went into effect yesterday, prohibit American companies from making new investments in the country, which is ruled by a military dictatorship that human rights groups have called one of the most repressive regimes in the world. The Yadana project as well as lesser ventures involving Texaco Inc. and the Atlantic Richfield Company, or ARCO, are shielded from the sanctions by a compromise in the legislation that exempts existing investments.
Unocal helped win that compromise through intense lobbying. It also succeeded because Washington appears to be more willing to talk tough than to act directly against the interests of American business. But Unocal's experience has exposed just how many problems sanctions can create and underscored how readily constituencies can rise up to pose obstacles to projects thousands of miles away.
While it is hanging on to its project, Unocal is also stuck with its critics, risking a legacy of bad publicity along with any profits. Just last month, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union joined the forces opposing the company, upset that Unocal's concentrated move abroad was unnecessarily costing American jobs.
And Unocal's victory is only partial and may not be permanent. Opponents are backing new legislation to force the company out of Myanmar. Even if that effort fails, Unocal will not be able to start new projects that may look promising.
"In the oil and gas business, you continually have to reinvest as you draw down reserves," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "This is an ongoing process and not just a one-time thing."
The result is a war for public opinion -- and lawmakers' support -- that is still being waged in the halls of Congress, in letter-writing campaigns and on the Internet. The fighting even reached the City Council in New York, where a bill was passed last week that would prohibit the city from buying products from any company doing business in Myanmar. The measure becomes law in 45 days unless Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vetoes it.
What seems clear is that what is happening to Unocal will happen to other American oil companies. For example, in the Caspian Sea area, which has become one of the hottest regions for new development, "American companies are already feeling some reluctance to go into partnerships because of the sanctions that have already been applied and might be applied in the future," Mr. Lichtblau said.
Julia Nanay, a director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington, added: "It's devastating for the U.S. oil industry. There is an increasing list of countries that are potential targets. It's having a terrible effect." Potential flash points include Nigeria and Indonesia, experts say.
Whatever the risks and the complications, the industry has little choice but to pursue most projects overseas because that is where the oil is and because American consumers show no signs of trimming their demand.
Indeed, Unocal went into Myanmar in 1993 knowing there were troubles ahead, but saw the potential rewards as justifying the risks.
Company executives recognized that they were in for a long battle with rights groups, Unocal's president, John F. Imle Jr., recalled, but were determined to see it through. " 'This project is going to happen -- there is no way they are going to stop it,' " he recalled the Unocal executives as saying.
The critics were not long in coming. Grass-roots groups of students and immigrants, linked through the Free Burma Coalition, spread reports of rights abuses by the military regime, known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council. The regime, which seized power in 1988, gained notoriety by refusing to recognize the 1990 election victory of the opposition party, whose leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was put under house arrest for years.
The critics accused Unocal of everything from condoning the laundering of drug money -- Myanmar is the world's biggest producer of heroin -- to using slave labor. Through demonstrations and the Internet, the groups picked up support, including backing from American student groups.
By last year, Senators Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, were pushing for an immediate ban on investments, including existing projects.
Unocal fought back, denying the critics' charges and noting Washington's inconsistency when pressing for democratic reforms abroad. China, a neighbor of Myanmar's that is also accused of rights violations, has escaped Washington's wrath because it has far more commercial importance, Unocal argued. Just this week, President Clinton began a campaign to renew China's most-favored-nation status despite growing anti-China sentiment.
Top Unocal executives made the rounds in Washington, arguing that if the company was forced to quit the gas project, it would be replaced by another big foreign company, just not an American one. After all, Unocal said, it is not even the biggest participant in the project, which is led by Total S.A. of France. What's more, the company said, its presence is helping the 35,000 people who live near the project area, where Unocal and Total are spending $6 million on education, medical care and other improvements.
To spread the message, Unocal made use of such prominent lobbyists as Tom Korologos, who served as an adviser to Bob Dole in his campaign for President.
Unocal also sought to influence public opinion by having the Washington office of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide write to professors and other foreign affairs experts, urging them to support its position.
Outside Washington, Unocal worked to head off resolutions in a number of cities that would have barred local governments from doing business with companies that invest in Myanmar.
Without any direct interest in Myanmar, most oil companies kept a low profile in the dispute. One senior executive, who asked that his name not be used, said that they saw little chance to sway public opinion in a debate that pitted economic interests against human rights.
The battle in Washington reached a crucial point last summer. A breakthrough for Unocal, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., occurred when it persuaded one of its home state Senators, Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, that any sanctions should be prospective in nature. The company argued that divestment would not only cost Unocal jobs at home, but would also lead to cutbacks at the many domestic contractors that it used.
In an interview yesterday, Senator Feinstein said she was concerned that foreign companies would have stepped in if Unocal had been forced to divest itself of its interest last summer.
"There's constantly the problem with these things -- that we can shoot ourselves in the foot and not accomplish what we hope to accomplish," she said.
Equally important to the outcome was the fact that the Clinton Administration also did not want to order divestiture, and worked with William S. Cohen, then a Republican Senator from Maine and now the Secretary of Defense, on a compromise proposal.
Ultimately, Senators Cohen and Feinstein co-sponsored legislation that limited sanctions to future investments and then only if the Myanmar regime committed further rights abuses, a judgment that would be left to the President.
Senator Feinstein said yesterday that she wanted the legislation to provide some flexibility, including time to see if the regime in Myanmar would open a dialogue with dissidents. "I wanted to create an opportunity for leverage," she said.
The legislation became law in the fall. In January, Unocal signed a contract with the state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise to expand its operations. (Texaco and ARCO also signed deals in the wake of the legislation.)
Finally, in April, President Clinton, under renewed pressure from rights groups, activated the sanction provisions. The Treasury Department is expected to issue rules for carrying them out in the next two weeks.
Meanwhile, Unocal is proceeding with the Yadana project. Most of the gas to be produced by four offshore platforms will be delivered to Thailand through a 416-mile pipeline. Some will flow to Myanmar, which will reap $150 million or so a year in revenues by about 2000.
Unocal holds a 28.26 percent interest in the project. Total has a 31.24 percent interest. The PTT Exploration and Production Public Company of Thailand holds 25.5 percent and Myanma Oil has 15 percent.
Will Unocal and the other American companies in Myanmar get to finish their projects? Roger C. Beach, Unocal's chairman and chief executive, is cautiously optimistic. The fact that President Clinton has moved to stop future investments, he said, has taken the pressure off Congress "to implement a more onerous sanction bill."
But there are many minefields ahead. How will the Presidential order be carried out? Will opposition from the oil workers' union catch fire? Will events in Myanmar force Washington's hand?
Industry executives say that questions like these are going to come into play in one place after another where American companies will be searching for oil and gas. And while the industry has been slow to recognize the threat until now, Mr. Beach said that was no longer the case.
Six months ago, Mr. Beach said, "we were the Lone Ranger crying in the wilderness." Now, he said, "a lot of companies are sitting up and taking notice."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Sharply vs. Yen, But Is Weaker Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply against the yen yesterday after comments by a Japanese finance official and fell against the mark on signs of economic vitality in Germany.
The Japanese official, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said interest rates would not be rising in Japan for a while, meaning that returns for investors would continue to be higher in other countries. The remarks were viewed by currency traders as further evidence that Japan wanted the rapid appreciation of the yen to ease. 
 Against other currencies the dollar ended mixed, but it rose solidly against the British pound, which fell broadly on reports of an economic slowdown in Britain and rumors that the Bank of England governor, Eddie George, might resign.
The dollar traded as high as 116.23 yen in intraday dealings before settling in New York at 115.96 yen, up from 114.18 yen Wednesday and up more than 5 yen from the five-month low of 111.98 yen touched briefly on Tuesday.
Against the mark, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7005 marks before retreating to settle in New York at 1.6934 marks, down from 1.6946. The pound cost $1.6234, down from $1.6450.
Traders said a main theme that emerged in the foreign-exchange market as the day progressed was the surprising strength in the mark, which rose against all major currencies and the yen in particular. The mark's gain also indirectly contributed to the yen's weakness against the dollar.
The catalyst for the mark's advance was a report from the Ifo economic research institute in Munich that showed a sharp rebound in business confidence last month.
The mark was further helped by news from the German central bank that the broadest measure of Germany's money supply, known as M-3, rose at a substantially slower pace in April than in March, diminishing fears of inflationary pressure.
The pound's decline reflected weak economic data in Britain and rumors that Mr. George, who has taken a tough stance against inflation, would not be reappointed next year. The Government said retail sales barely rose in April and economic growth in the first quarter was lower than previously thought.

HEADLINE: Swiss Reject As One-Sided Study by U.S. Of Nazi Ties

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERN, May 22

 BODY:
Two weeks after the Clinton Administration accused Switzerland of prolonging World War II by acting as a banker to Nazi Germany, the authorities here tartly rejected the accusation today as "unsupported" and termed Washington's assessment "one-sided."
The Swiss statement, read to reporters by Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti, reflected an increasingly prickly sense of embattlement here since the publication on May 7 of a sweeping United States Government report chronicling purchases of gold by Switzerland from Hitler's Germany and the postwar refusal of Swiss commercial banks to offer access to deposits made by European Jews who later died in the Holocaust. 
 The report also accused the Swiss authorities of reneging on a 1946 agreement on the liquidation of hundreds of millions of dollars of German assets wanted by the United States and its allies as war reparations.
The underlying theme of the United States accusations is that the vaunted neutrality of Switzerland cloaked an amorality, not only in financial affairs but also in such decisions as the one in 1942 to turn back tens of thousands of Jewish refugees at its frontiers.
The report, which stunned many Swiss, seemed all the more damning to them since it followed what are viewed here as a series of efforts to atone -- even if belatedly -- for its wartime behavior. In recent months, Switzerland has set up a formal inquiry into its relationship with the Third Reich, started a fund currently valued at $120 million to help Holocaust survivors and proposed a $4.7 billion investment fund to help victims of suffering of all kinds, including those scarred by the Holocaust.
While it went further than in the past in acknowledging what it termed errors, the Swiss Government statement today said it "regards the representation of Switzerland as the bankers to the Nazis as a one-sided, blanket judgment."
"It is suggested," it continued, "that the neutral countries may have prolonged the Third Reich's ability to wage war by trading with it. At least based on the report's contents this comment must be referred to as unsupported."
Months of criticism of the Swiss record have left some Swiss battling to reconcile the disclosures about their trading with Nazi Germany against a more heroic national myth of wartime resistance to Nazism's tide.
The debate has split the small nation between young and old and between those who see the wartime conduct of Switzerland as a justifiable defense of its sovereignty and survival, and those who see the country's wartime behavior as little more than collaboration covered up by postwar propaganda.
Today's Swiss statement acknowledged that there had been "questionable deals which did not affect the survival of Switzerland" between Swiss business interests and the Nazi regime. "Neutrality led to a difficult tightrope walk between adaptation and resistance," the Swiss statement said. "Today we know that this also led to mistakes. The fainthearted refugee policy concerning Jews was inexcusable. In the business and financial sector concessions were sometimes made to the Axis powers which are very hard to comprehend today in view of the inner convictions of the population and measured by absolute necessity."
But the statement renewed the Government's bottom-line argument that the survival of Switzerland, which spent most of the war surrounded by Axis powers, was at stake.
"That Switzerland traded with the Axis powers as well as the Allies was a question of national political and economic survival," the Swiss response said. "Only hypotheses are possible to question whether Switzerland in 1943-1944 would have been in a situation to break off business ties with the Axis powers without provoking the risk of an invasion."
In the immediate postwar era, Switzerland struck the 1946 agreement with the United States, France and Britain to resolve some of the wartime financial issues. It agreed to pay the equivalent at that time of $58 million in gold to offset purchases of looted Nazi gold, and, in return, the Allies agreed to lift a variety of economic restrictions on Switzerland in the United States.
The 1946 agreement also committed Switzerland to liquidating millions in German-owned assets, depicted in Washington as Nazi loot but said by Swiss historians and officials to include prewar assets held by German citizens, including some German Jews. According to the American report, Switzerland never respected the agreement. Referring to that accusation, the Swiss statement said, "We must judge more critically from today's outlook the liquidation of German assets."

HEADLINE: U.S. Budget Surplus Hit Record in April

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The United States Government posted a record budget surplus in April as the vibrant economy generated strong revenue, according to the Treasury.
The surplus totaled $93.94 billion, the Treasury's monthly budget statement said. That is up from last April's surplus of $72.4 billion, the previous record. 
 The Treasury is benefiting from reduced spending and higher tax collections, stemming from the fast pace of economic growth, relatively low unemployment and booming financial markets.
The Treasury typically reports a deficit most months because it spends more money than it receives and borrows the rest. Monthly surpluses usually come in January, April, June and September, which coincide with quarterly tax payments. Individual income tax returns are also due in April.
In April, revenues were 12.3 percent higher than in April 1996, at $228.59 billion. Spending, meanwhile, was 2.7 percent higher, at $134.65 billion.
Since the Federal fiscal year started on Oct. 1, the budget deficit has totaled $16.9 billion, down from the first seven months of the 1996 fiscal year, when the shortfall totaled $55.31 billion.
The White House economist, Janet Yellen, recently said the budget deficit for the current fiscal year could fall to as low as $70 billion. In the 1996 fiscal year, the deficit was $107.33 billion, the lowest in 15 years.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Increase by 5,000

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The number of first-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 5,000 last week but remained in a range that analysts say suggests continued moderate job growth.
New applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 322,000, up from a revised 317,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department said today. Claims for the week that ended on May 10 were initially estimated at 319,000. 
 Many analysts had expected an increase of about 6,000 last week.
Claims jumped into the mid-300,000 range several weeks ago after auto strikes and Midwestern floods. But they fell back to 317,000 in the week of May 10.
The four-week moving average edged up by 750 last week, to 333,250.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Welcomes Back Labor Negotiator as a Top Aide

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Randy L. Levine, who has served as chief labor negotiator for both the Giuliani administration and Major League Baseball, is returning to City Hall as a deputy mayor in the next few days, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday.
Mr. Levine will be in charge of planning and economic development -- a post that has been vacant since Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter left in February to run the Mayor's re-election campaign -- and will also be responsible for City Hall administration during the months in which Mr. Giuliani will be campaigning around the city. 
 Randy M. Mastro, currently the Deputy Mayor for operations, will remain in his position supervising city agencies, the Mayor said. At least for now, there will be no First Deputy Mayor, a title the Mayor bestowed only on his friend Peter J. Powers, who left city government for the private sector last year.
Mr. Levine, who negotiated baseball's new collective bargaining agreement with the players, will remain a $1,000-a-month consultant to the game's Player Relations Committee while serving as Deputy Mayor. He is expected to return to his baseball position next year whether or not the Mayor is re-elected.
The arrangement, approved by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board, provides that Mr. Levine recuse himself from any city decisions regarding the Yankees, the Mets, or Major League Baseball. Mr. Levine, who said he would honor the provision, said he may be available to help on stadium negotiations if necessary and if allowed to by the board.
In his new position, Mr. Levine will supervise the Economic Development Corporation and the Department of City Planning, negotiating with developers and businesses and working to foster economic growth. He will also supervise the city's Office of Labor Relations, the agency that he led until September 1995.
His responsibilities over administration are slightly more ambiguous. The Mayor described him as "Mr. Inside," handling the inner workings of City Hall in a role traditionally handled by the chief of staff. Bruce Teitelbaum, the acting chief of staff, may eventually receive the permanent title, but will report to Mr. Levine. City officials said the Mayor wanted to have a trusted friend like Mr. Levine in charge of City Hall during the summer and fall months while he is out campaigning.
As the city 's Labor Commissioner, Mr. Levine negotiated several major agreements with municipal labor unions that became the foundation of the Giuliani administration's plans to reduce the size of local government. Most notably, he lowered the city's work force by 17,000 by paying workers severance money to leave. But he also attracted criticism from outside budget monitors like the Citizens Budget Commission for not seeking greater productivity savings from unions.
Mr. Levine, 42, who made $600,000 a year as baseball's lead negotiator, will be taking a substantial pay cut to return to government, earning $138,000 in his new position. But his agreement with baseball provides that he can return to his former job and salary within one year.

HEADLINE: Dow Has Decline of 32.56 on Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, hurt by profit taking and by rising bond yields.
Bond prices declined yesterday on concerns that the economy was growing fast enough to compel the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The slump in prices pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.98 percent from 6.95 percent and closer to 7 percent, a level that tempts some stock investors to buy bonds. 
 "The market's just flat-out overvalued, and bonds are pretty attractive," said Arthur Micheletti, chief investment strategist at Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, who keeps both bonds and stocks in his $1 billion portfolio.
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 32.56, to 7,258.13, led by shares of I.B.M., which fell from its first record close in almost a decade.
Small stocks rose for a fourth consecutive session, and the Russell 2000 index reached a record for the first time since Jan. 22, climbing 1.40, to 371.46. The Russell 2000 is now up 2.4 percent on the year.
After months when the companies in the Dow industrials trounced their smaller counterparts, some investors said small stocks might finally break out of their inertia.
"It's a rotation of the marketplace, and it's going to go on for a while," said F. Van Kasper, president of his own investment firm, with $2.2 billion in assets. "Investors are driven to smaller stocks by slower earnings growth in the bigger companies and, I think, a reduction in the capital gains tax." Congress and President Clinton agreed to reduce the rate at which gains from investments such as stocks are taxed as part of this month's budget agreement.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 3.69, to 835.66. General Electric, Coca-Cola and the Exxon Corporation, the three largest members of the index, declined the most. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.15, to 1,372.60. Trading was light, with just 441.3 million shares changing hands. The average for a full day of trading during the last three months is 485 million. Few investors made big bets, with little in the way of earnings reports and a three-day weekend approaching.
Initial offerings enjoyed success in the market yesterday. Hartford Life Inc. surged 3 7/8, to 32 1/8, a day after raising $655.6 million by selling 23 million shares. Summit Holding Southeast rose 3 1/8, to 14 1/8, after selling five million shares to the public late Wednesday. On Tuesday, ABN Amro Holding N.V. sold 14 million American depository receipts to investors at 18 1/2 each. Yesterday, the A.D.R.'s rose 3/16, to 18 7/8.
I.B.M. fell 2 5/8,, to 172 1/2. Among other Dow stocks, Philip Morris Companies. rose 1/4, to 44 3/4, after the Senate rejected an amendment to raise the tobacco tax.

HEADLINE: YELTSIN DISMISSES 2 MILITARY CHIEFS FOR RESISTING CUTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 22

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed the two top leaders of Russia's military today, lambasting them for resisting spending cuts and dragging their feet on restructuring of the armed forces.
The abrupt ouster of Defense Minister Igor N. Rodionov and Gen. Viktor N. Samsonov, the Chief of the General Staff, reflects the growing power of reform-minded officials who insist the primary threats to Russia are economic, not military. 
 The Kremlin took the extraordinary step of inviting a Russian television crew to cover President Yeltsin's scathing assessment of Mr. Rodionov's tenure.
"I rank your work very low," Mr. Yeltsin declared at the start of the meeting of top defense advisers. "Russia cannot afford the current expenditure. You must have pondered over how to get out of this situation and reorganize the army, but you did not do that."
Mr. Yeltsin reaffirmed his intention to slash military spending. He said Russia currently spends about 5 percent of its gross domestic product on the military and that the expenditures needed to be reduced to 3 percent to 3.5 percent by the year 2000.
Mr. Yeltsin's evident commitment to slash military spending suggests that Moscow's objections to the expansion of NATO stemmed more from wounded pride and political considerations then fear of a military threat from the West.
Although the Russian military has been steadfast in its opposition to NATO expansion, there was no sign that this played a role in today's dismissals.
Today's move is part of a broader shift over economic policy in which reformers have pushed for budget cuts, a lower tax-burden on industry and tighter controls on energy and transportation monopolies.
In another announcement that reflected the expanding role of economic reformers in Mr. Yeltsin's Government, the Kremlin said today that Boris Y. Nemtsov and Anatoly B. Chubais would become members of Mr. Yeltsin's Security Council, which handles foreign policy and military matters. The two men are leading architects of the effort to reshape Russia's economy.
The unceremonious departure of Mr. Rodionov, Russia's second post-Communist Defense Minister, comes just 10 months after he was appointed to Russia's top defense post at the urging of Aleksandr I. Lebed, the former national security adviser who was himself dismissed after losing a Kremlin power struggle.
When he was appointed, Mr. Rodionov was touted as a thoughtful, uncorruptable general, despite his role as the top commander of Soviet troops that cracked down on peaceful protestors in Georgia in 1989.
But Mr. Rodionov's go-slow approach on reform and his strategy of publicly belitting his own military's abilities in an effort to gain more funds strained relations with Kremlin officials.
Earlier this month, while Mr. Rodionov was meeting with military officials in Japan and the United States, Kremlin aides assembled a plan to cut Government spending by 20 percent. It calls for the Government to reduce subsidies to industry and agriculture and to slash military spending from about $18.2 billion to $14.5 billion.
Mr. Rodionov, a general who retired from the military after being appointed Defense Minister, would have been a poor spokesman for the new budget plan, which the Yeltsin Government this week urged Parliament to adopt.
Not only did the new budget represent about half the funds he had sought, but Mr. Rodionov had no plan to restructure the ailing military within the new financial constraints.
Economic reformers expressed the hope that the dismissal of Mr. Rodionov would finally open the door to long-delayed reform of the armed forces, an initiative that has thus far involved more Kremlin talk than action.
"Military reform itself will be regarded as an essential way to make the armed forces combat-ready rather than a nuisance," said Yegor T. Gaidar, the pro-free market economist and former Prime Minister.
But the dismissals were denounced by hard-liners in the Parliament, who charged that the Yeltsin Government was simply looking for a more pliant defense chief who would put a good public face on military cuts.
Mr. Lebed denounced the move as a "good maneuver to distract public opinion from the failure of military reform in the country."
The ouster of Mr. Rodionov has potentially important significance for the Russian military planning. Mr. Yeltsin picked Gen. Igor D. Sergeyev, the head of the Strategic Rocket Forces, which controls's Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal, to serve as the acting Defense Minister.
Aleksei Arbatov, a military specialist and Parliament deputy from the liberal Yabloko party, described General Sergeyev as one of Russia's most intellectual and technically versed generals.
General Sergeyev's elevation is an indication of the increasing emphasis Moscow is giving to nuclear weapons to maintain its standing as a superpower. A staunch supporter of new strategic arms accords with Washington, the general could help the Kremlin in the uphill battle to win Parliament's approval of the treaty.
Col. Gen. Viktor Chechevatov, the commander of Russia's Far East military district, was mentioned in some Russian press reports as a possible successor to General Samsonov, though there was no official confirmation.
A politic general who gained favor with the Kremlin last year by withdrawing his candidacy for President in favor of Mr. Yeltsin, General Chechevatov is less highly regarded by advocates of military reform and comes from a military district with a reputation for corruption. The main military task of the new defense leadership will be to create a smaller and more effective military and not simply a shrunken version of the old Soviet armed forces. The main political task will be to accomplish that without causing social unrest.
"For us, the question of military reform is primarily the question of saving the armed forces and defense industry," Mr. Arbatov said. "It is 90 percent a question of internal stability and security and only 10 percent a question of foreign security."
The new military structure will have to be established at a time when the stature of the armed forces appears on the decline in comparison to the Interior Ministry, whose troops maintain order at home.
Mr. Rodionov himself voiced this complaint in a recent interview with the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, asserting that the Interior Ministry troops were better equipped and that the politicians appear to fear internal threats more than external ones.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Clinton Puts Off Effort on Trade Accords

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Just two weeks after traveling to Mexico and Central America to renew his pledge to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Clinton has bowed to political necessities and postponed until the fall his effort to get authority to negotiate further trade accords, Administration officials said today.
For several weeks, Mr. Clinton and economic advisers have been engaged in lengthy behind-the-scenes negotiations over legislation, which has become entangled in sharp disagreements over whether trade accords ultimately benefit American workers. Mr. Clinton's trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, has spent nearly every day in recent months attempting to patch together a coalition that could support the legislation, but has been unable to bridge fundamental disagreements that cross party lines. 
 Technically, the legislation would only result in the inclusion of Chile in Nafta, the free trade accord that links Canada, the United States and Mexico. But much more is at stake. The legislation would also permit a wide variety of negotiations on other trade accords around the world, from agriculture to trade in such services as accounting and engineering.
Latin American nations have said that the passage of the negotiating authority is a test of whether the United States is serious about pursuing a free trade area throughout the Americas, and some Latin leaders have charged that the United States is backing away from its commitments to free trade. The White House has denied that, but all year it has declined to draft a bill for Congress to consider because of divisions within the Democratic Party over what it would contain.
Under pressure from labor unions, for example,the Democratic minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, has announced his opposition to the effort, turning it into one of several points on which he disagrees with Vice President Al Gore. The two men are considered likely opponents for the Democratic nomination for President three years from now.
This afternoon, Ms. Barshefsky and Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, met with Congressional leaders in an effort to obtain an agreement to get some form of negotiating authority through Congress by the end of the year. Next spring, Mr. Clinton attends a meeting of Latin American nations on trade.
The trade-agreement authority that Mr. Clinton is seeking is known in the parlance of Capitol Hill as fast track authority. It empowers the Administration to negotiate trade accords that Congress can then approve or disapprove -- but cannot amend. The theory is that if Congress could change the contents, negotiations would never end.

HEADLINE: Fed Rate Rise On March 25 Was Backed By Full Panel

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in raising the overnight bank lending rate on March 25, though they have decided to take a more relaxed stance toward inflation in the interim, minutes of the meeting showed today.
The Federal Open Market Committee's 10-to-0 vote increased the target for the Federal funds rate a quarter percentage point, to 5.50 percent, the first rate increase in two years. However, the members also relaxed their position in favor of raising the interest rate target again, and adopted a "neutral" monetary policy directive, minutes of the March meeting showed. That stance was borne out this week, when the Fed left the rate unchanged at its most recent meeting. 
 The shift to a neutral stance suggests that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, could have been breaking from his normal pattern of lifting rates in a series of steps and, instead, firing just a single warning shot.
When the Fed last raised rates, in 1994 and early 1995, it did so seven times, doubling the overnight rate to 6 percent. Still, with the unemployment rate at a quarter-century low of 4.9 percent in April, many analysts expect that the Fed will still take interest rates higher, possibly at the next meeting of the policy-making committee, on July 1 and 2.
The March minutes showed that some central bankers wanted to maintain a tougher stance on inflation and raise the Federal funds rate higher than 5.50 percent. "In their view, the outlook called for vigilance," the minutes showed.
While not all of the committee members were willing to go that far, all agreed that the time was ripe for "a pre-emptive policy action that would head off any pickup of inflation," according to the minutes. Moreover, "it was noted that a shift to a tighter policy stance would seem to pose little risk to the expansion" of the economy, the minutes said.
By changing the interest rates it controls, the Fed's actions translate into lower or higher borrowing costs on everything from credit cards to mortgages and business loans -- and directly influence economic activity, though often with a lag of many months.
The committee meets eight times a year at intervals of five to eight weeks. Deliberations are held in secret and minutes are released several weeks later. Full transcripts of the meetings are made available after five years.

HEADLINE: Raises Arrive At Bottom Rung Of Labor Force;
For Now, Earnings Gap Has Stopped Widening

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
In late afternoon, as most people are heading home from work, a large, unmarked room on an upper floor at PNC Bank is just starting to buzz with activity. Among the rows of women in cubicles is Caren Good, 34, tall, thin and stylishly groomed. New to the job, she carefully slips checks into a whirring machine with her left hand, while her right records the amounts on a keyboard. Her evening's work will show up later as thousands of entries on bank statements wrapped around packets of canceled checks. For this she earns $7.10 an hour, her highest wage in years.
Ms. Good, whose schooling ended with high school graduation in 1981 and whose working years have been spent mostly in short-lived clerical jobs or occasional gigs as a poorly paid model, is among the millions of Americans whose earnings have seldom ranged far above the minimum wage, now $4.75 a hour. Caught up in forces that have made incomes increasingly unequal, people at the bottom of the wage scale like Ms. Good have slipped farther behind nearly every year for more than two decades. 
 Over the last 18 months, however, the wages at this low end have picked up. Today, they are rising significantly faster than the inflation rate -- faster, in percentage terms, than the pay of middle-income Americans.
For all their lack of skill, low-wage workers are in great demand today. The strong economic growth of recent years is beginning to pay off for them more than at any time since the 1970's. In a tight labor market -- the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent -- those who employ fast-food workers, retail-store counter people, office clerks, factory assemblers, telephone order takers, gardeners, maintenance workers and others like them are being forced to lift the bottom of the pay scale. An increase in the minimum wage, the first since 1991, has also raised the wages of low-paid workers.
The higher wages, in turn, are helping to draw into the labor force more black women, older men, immigrants, teen-agers and Hispanic Americans. In the last year, the labor force -- people working or seeking work -- has grown by 2.7 million, the largest annual gain in over a decade and more than twice the increase in the working-age population. The surge of new workers, particularly at the low end, tends to keep wages from rising faster than they already are, and helps to explain why inflation has remained at a mild 3 percent a year or less.
The big unknown now is whether the wage gains at the low end will continue long enough to make a meaningful difference for millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet, or whether the raises will be washed away in the next wave of economic distress.
"The primary issue here is that you are six years into a recovery, with 23-year lows in the unemployment rate, and it is not surprising that you finally see some wage improvement at the low end," Rebecca Blank, a Northwestern University labor economist, said. "I want to see how much of the gain is permanent and how much disappears in the next recession."
The improvement means that the yawning gap in earnings between the high school and college educated has stopped widening. If the upturn holds, the gap might even begin to shrink, taking some of the sting out of income inequality as a political and social issue, and providing opportunities to advance for people like Ms. Good.
"I have my foot in the door at PNC," she said, the PNC Bank Corporation being the first big company to suggest that she might have a future there. "When you have your foot in the door, you can transfer to another department. I would like to do that."
Still, the rise of America's low-wage workers is at an early stage and must go a long way to make up for all the ground lost. Starting in the mid-1970's, the weekly earnings of full-time adult workers in the bottom 10 percent of the wage distribution fell by nearly 20 percent, when adjusted for inflation. The improvement over the last 18 months has restored only about one and a half percentage points of that loss. In the late 1980's, a similarly long economic expansion also began to raise low-end wages, but by much less than now. And even that modest gain was wiped out by the 1990-91 recession.
What is striking now is that the wages of those at the bottom are advancing at a faster pace than most other workers. In the first quarter of the year, the weekly wages of full-time, adult workers in the bottom 10 percent of the wage spectrum rose at a 4.4 percent annual rate, bringing the top of that group to $259 a week, or $6.48 an hour. By comparison, the median weekly wage -- midway in the wage scale -- rose 3.5 percent during the same period, to $536 a week, or $13.40 an hour. A similar pattern had already emerged in the fourth quarter, and is also evident in hourly wage data including part-timers.
"The way it works in a recovery," said Alan Krueger, a Princeton labor economist, "is that the lower end overheats and sometimes bids up wages in the middle. This time the lower end is bouncing back, but the middle is still lagging."
Job insecurity plays a role. For people in the middle, employers can be more selective in giving raises, selecting some and passing over others. Those passed over are less likely than in the past to find new jobs that pay as well, in wages and benefits, as the ones they already have.
Low-paid workers are not so insecure. They have little to lose. Already scraping the bottom of the wage barrel, and usually without benefits, they are more willing to jump to another unskilled job that pays an extra 50 cents or $1 an hour. So when they are in short supply, employers find themselves bidding for these workers, and pay at the bottom begins to rise across the board.
To be sure, better-paid workers in short supply -- computer programmers, technicians and the like -- have enjoyed significant pay increases recently. But when employers raise wages to attract people with these skills, the raises often fail to spread to others at the next desk if they can be more easily replaced, like insurance actuaries or lawyers.
Companies that employ large numbers of low-wage workers are having to search harder and pay more to fill their ranks. Take the Aramark Corporation, a Philadelphia-based company that employs 100,000 people in the United States -- up 10,000 in the last year -- to operate food services at schools, hospitals and other workplaces. Roughly one-fourth of its work force earns the minimum wage, which rose to $4.75 an hour from $4.25 last year. Another fourth earned at least 25 cents above the minimum, and when the minimum went up, they got raises too.
"You get a ripple effect in a tight labor market," said Brian Mulvaney, Aramark's executive vice president for human resources, "because any differential you have built in, to reward people, you have to maintain to keep them."
The bidding for workers at the low end gave Ms. Good a leg up on the wage scale. She had been earning $6.10 an hour feeding documents into a Xerox machine at a copy center when she learned of openings for check processers at PNC. She jumped two months ago for $1 an hour more. "I decided that standing over a copy machine, you are not learning anything," Ms. Good said.
But if she had made the same switch to PNC just 18 months earlier, her wage would have dropped. PNC then paid its check processors $5.85 an hour, the same wage rate it had paid for the previous 10 years. By late summer of 1995, however, Jean A. Evans, chief of the check processing operation, realized that her workers were slipping away to a rival bank down the street for better pay.
"We lost our best people," Ms. Evans said. So PNC increased the wage in late 1995 to $7.10 an hour, plus a piece-rate incentive that allows the fastest workers to average as much as $12 an hour. That stopped the defections for a while, but Ms. Evans's shop, normally 100 people, is short-staffed again, and she wonders if another raise might be necessary. "We are going to sit down and see what we have to do to retain people," she said.
Rising turnover, and the higher minimum wage, also pressured Wendy's International Inc., the fast-food chain, into providing fatter paychecks for its 55,000 employees, most of them counter people. Since 1995, wages for these workers have risen by nearly 4 percent a year. Beginning pay is now $5.65 an hour. "Our turnover has dropped significantly," said Dennis Lynch, a Wendy's spokesman.
Similarly, Manpower Inc., which places 180,000 temporary workers each week, has raised everyone's pay by 5 percent in the last six months, and more than that for those earning under $8 an hour, according to Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's chairman. Manpower also scours more intensively than in the past for workers. Its recruiters, and those of other temp agencies, visit community colleges, high schools, churches, housing projects, charities and refugee programs.
Not every employer of low-end workers is raising wages, of course. The influx of immigrants into Southern California and southern Texas, for example, inflates the supply, helping to keep down wages in those areas. And the low-end labor shortages are not as acute in the Northeast as they are in the South and Midwest. What is more, not every employer is responding to the tight labor market by raising wages. Instead, for example, Marriott International Inc., the hotel and restaurant company, invests in training those who apply for jobs as kitchen workers and maids at less than $7 an hour.
"The people we are talking about are really unskilled; not just low-skilled but unskilled people who can't get better wages," said Brendan Keegan, Marriott's senior vice president for human resources.
Low-wage jobs are often entry ports to middle-income pay. But companies that offer these jobs still find themselves bidding up their entry-level wage, to get enough workers. Sometimes that even happens retroactively, as MaryEllen Poellnitz discovered last spring.
When AT&T advertised for operators for its expanding customer service center here, Ms. Poellnitz, 32, jumped at the opportunity, even though the starting pay of $232 a week, or $5.80 an hour, was less than the $6.50 an hour she earned as a clerk at a TV cable company.
"I was unimpressed with myself, sitting at a counter taking customers' payments," said Ms. Poellnitz, who has some education beyond high school and was willing to take a pay cut to grab the lower rung of the ladder at a major corporation.
AT&T's customer representatives respond to questions over the phone about long-distance bills, rates, service problems and the like. The job is unionized, and those who pass a test and survive probation can count on step-by-step wage increases dictated by a labor contract. After four years, an employee makes more than $500 a week. Even so, AT&T could not attract enough qualified beginners at a starting wage of $232 a week. So, just as Ms. Poellnitz came aboard, it jumped the starting pay two steps, to $296.
"To my surprise, on my first day, I found myself making $7.40 an hour," Ms. Poellnitz said.
The AT&T customer service office here hired 386 operators last year. "If we had not raised the pay," said Joan Astrabe, a human resources executive, "we might have only been able to hire 250 in that time span."

Charts: "Climbing the Wage Ladder"
The economy, now in its sixth year of recovery, is finally rewarding fast-food workers, office clerks and factory assemblers with higher wages. With unskilled workers in high demand, the increase in their pay means that the large gap in earnings between the high school and college educated has stopped growing.

HEADLINE: Price Decline In Treasuries Continues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for the second consecutive session, as investors grew concerned that the economy was still growing fast enough to move the Federal Reserve toward another increase in interest rates.
Bond prices were weaker after the Labor Department reported that weekly initial unemployment claims rose by 5,000, to a seasonally adjusted 322,000. Analysts had forecast 324,000 claims, which was more or else in line with expectations. Still the numbers are an indication that the labor market continues to be tight, leaving the door ajar for future inflation and higher rates. 
 "The unemployment claims this week were watched more closely than normal by financial market investors primarily because these figures were compiled during the week that the monthly employment surveys are conducted," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
"It's important to note that the data on initial unemployment claims was contaminated during April to early May by the impact of auto strikes and the Midwest floods. However, data over the past two weeks has been mostly devoid of these effects and has provided strong hints that the economy may not be slowing down as quickly as many credit market investors had anticipated."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32 , to a price of 9517/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.98 percent, from 6.95 percent on Wednesday. For the long bond, the yield has not been over 7 percent since the end of April.
Prices received a little support from the late afternoon release of the minutes of the Fed's policy-making meeting on March. Policy makers were unanimous in voting for a quarter-point increase in the target for the Federal funds rate. Some traders and analysts had been concerned that policy makers were divided.
Still, for bonds to rally substantially, market participants will have to see convincing evidence the economy will slow to a point that is sustainable, but without inflation. So far there is little evidence that inflation is quickening.
One indication that inflation remains constrained came yesterday when the Labor Department also reported that the 12-month changes in its experimental Consumer Price Index were running three-hundredths of a percentage point less than the official index.
Today, trading of Treasury securities, mortgage securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and secondary money market is expected to close early, at 2 P.M. Bond markets will also be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.
Treasury auctions will commence on Tuesday, with the regular weekly bill auction, followed on Wednesday by the sale of two-year notes and five-year notes on Thursday. In when-issued trading late yesterday the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.27 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.58 percent. Both were up slightly from the previous day.
Yesterday the Treasury auctioned $13.75 billion of new one-year bills at an average rate of 5.55 percent, down from 5.72 percent the month before. Analysts said retail demand was good, but that the total number of bids was down slightly. Following are the results of that auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	94.388	Discounted Rate	5.55%	Coupon Yield	5.88%	High Price	94.409	Discounted Rate	5.56%	Coupon Yield	5.89%	Low Price	94.378	Discounted Rate	5.53%	Coupon Yield	5.85%	Accepted at low price	11%	Total applied for	$48,015,258	Accepted	$13,777,108	Noncompetitive	$1,099,258	
 
The one-year bills mature on May 28, 1998.

Elbridge Durbrow, a retired Foreign Service officer who served in Moscow as the wartime Soviet ally turned into cold-war antagonist and who later led the United States Embassy in South Vietnam at the onset of America's longest war, died last Friday at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif.
He was 93. 
 The cause of death was complications from a stroke, his family said. Mr. Durbrow, a longtime resident of Washington, moved to California in 1985.
Mr. Durbrow's diplomatic career spanned 38 years, most of them spent in Europe and Southeast Asia. He retired in 1968.
President Eisenhower named him Ambassador to South Vietnam in 1957, when Indochina meant little to Americans. The French, trying to recover and hold their colonies in the region, had been routed at Dien Bien Phu by the Viet Minh forces three years earlier.
Since then, Washington's determination to hold Communism at bay in the region had led to a low-profile political and military presence in newly divided Vietnam; little of it was noticed at home. For Mr. Durbrow, however, Saigon quickly turned into a diplomat's bad dream.
On the one side, he had to deal with the authoritarian regime of Ngo Dinh Diem and a morass of corruption and ineffectiveness that was hard to overlook. Another bane was American military leaders who considered themselves omniscient.
Disgruntled senior Vietnamese officers sought to enmesh him in their cabals against President Diem. He refused, telling them that Washington was supporting the Diem Government, at least for a while, even as he shed his own illusions about the situation.
In April 1961, President Kennedy formed a committee to chart an array of programs, from military to economic support to social reform, that would keep Diem in power and the Communists away from South Vietnam. Kennedy also replaced Mr. Durbrow because Diem had tired of his aloofness.
In the late 1940's, Mr. Durbrow had been posted to the Soviet Union at an equally dramatic moment in history, when the cold war nearly froze East-West relations for decades. The situation he encountered was a prelude to the confrontation that took shape in Southeast Asia 10 years later.
After serving as chief of the Eastern European division of the State Department in Washington in the mid-1940's, he spent two years in Moscow as Counselor of Embassy and Deputy Chief of Mission from 1946 to 1948 under Ambassador Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, succeeding George F. Kennan. It was his third tour in the country, and he strongly warned his superiors of Soviet expansionism and efforts to divide and subvert the West.
Born in San Francisco, Elbridge Durbrow was a philosophy graduate of Yale University. He continued his studies at Stanford University, at the University of Dijon in France, the Academie de Droit International de la Haye in the Netherlands, the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris and the University of Chicago, where he studied international economics and finance.
He started his career as a vice consul in Warsaw in 1930 and rose through the ranks in Bucharest, Moscow, Naples, Rome and Lisbon. He was an American delegate to the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference that chartered the World Bank.
He also served as a delegate to the NATO Council in Paris from 1961 to 1965, and as State Department adviser to the National War College in Washington and the Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala., the post from which he retired in 1968.
After that he wrote and lectured on foreign affairs. In the 1970's he was chairman of the American Foreign Policy Institute and a director of the Freedom Studies Center in Boston, Va.
Mr. Durbrow is survived by his wife of 32 years, Benice Balcom Durbrow; two sons from an earlier marriage, Chandler W. 2d of Arlington, and Bruce C. of High Point, N.C., and a granddaughter. His first wife, Emily Moore Durbrow, died in 1964.

HEADLINE: Albright Outlines Moves to 'Renew Momentum' in Bosnia

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Fearing that the American-led efforts to forge peace in the Balkans have stalled, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that the United States remained deeply committed to supporting a stable, multi-ethnic state in Bosnia and announced a series of symbolic, if small, initiatives to revive the peace efforts.
In testimony on Capitol Hill this morning, in an interview with editors at The New York Times and in a speech tonight to military officers in New York City, Ms. Albright sought to "renew the momentum" of the peace accords negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995 to end more than three years of civil war involving Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs. 
 Nearly a year and a half after NATO troops arrived in Bosnia to stop the fighting, Ms. Albright said the leaders of the Muslims, Croats and Serbs needed to do more to keep the promises they made in Dayton, or face political and economic isolation.
"Since Dayton was signed, our initial security goals have been achieved and economic reconstruction has begun," Ms. Albright said before the Senate's appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. "Unfortunately, there remain important areas where progress has been slow due to the failure of many Bosnian leaders to embrace true political and social integration."
Ms. Albright said she believed that the NATO troops remaining in Bosnia -- now about 30,000 soldiers, 8,500 of whom are Americans -- could do more to support implementation of the peace accords by increasing security to allow refugees to return to their homes and by rebuilding telecommunications links.
Ms. Albright, however, did not call for any real expansion of the NATO force's role, and other Administration officials later dismissed any notion that the force would have a new mandate or stay beyond the deadline of June 1998 set by President Clinton.
The new programs follow a review of the Administration's efforts in Bosnia, ordered by President Clinton in March amid concerns that the integration of Bosnia into a peaceful nation was lagging. The Muslim and Croat factions, which are supposed to have cemented a federation by now, and the Serbs have failed in varying degrees to carry out important parts of the accords, blocking the return of refugees to their homes and harboring war criminals.
The plans announced today -- like the opening of American liaison offices in Mostar, which is under Croatian control, and Banja Luka, which falls in Serbian territory -- followed a series of announcements and other steps in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, for example, the White House announced the appointment of a special envoy, David Scheffer, to focus attention on the issue of war crimes. The International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague has indicted 75 people for committing atrocities during the civil war, but has brought only eight into custody.
Although the Administration has discussed creating a special police force to capture indicted criminals, Ms. Albright announced no new plans today.
"We are still looking at a number of options," she told the editors at The Times. "I'm sure you can understand that discussing them is not very helpful."

Dow Falls 32 Points, But Small Stocks Gain
Stocks were generally lower as bond yields rose and investors took profits. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 32.56 points, to 7,258.13, led by shares of I.B.M., which fell from its first record close in almost a decade. 
 But small stocks rose for a fourth consecutive session, and the Russell 2000 index reached a record for the first time since Jan. 22, climbing 1.40 points, to 371.46. [Page D6.]
 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond pushed nearer to 7 percent, ending up three-hundredths of a percentage point at 6.98, as prices fell. Investors grew concerned that the economy was still growing rapidly enough to nudge the Federal Reserve toward another increase in interest rates. [D6.]
 
Apple to Give Newton Autonomy
Apple Computer said it would spin off the division that produces the Newton hand-held computer into a wholly owned subsidiary, presumably to better attract a buyer for it. The move allows Apple to concentrate on its core computer business, Apple executives said, at a time when the company's Macintosh line continues to lose market share to personal computers running Microsoft Windows. [D16.]
 
Fed Unanimity on Rates
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in raising the overnight bank lending rate on March 25, though they have decided to take a more relaxed stance toward inflation in the interim, minutes of the meeting showed. [D5.]
 
Shifts in Exchange Rules Proposed
The S.E.C. is setting forth broad ideas for changing the way it regulates stock markets, in an effort to catch up with the innovation and entrepreneurship that have transformed the landscape of American stock markets.
Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D6.]
 
Oppenheimer in Executive Shift
Oppenheimer, which has had unsuccessful talks recently with several potential suitors, has shuffled its senior management and formed an operating committee in an attempt to recognize a new generation of executives and to organize its businesses better. [D2.]
 
Seeking Ways to Lift Digital
Holders of 30 to 40 percent of the stock of Digital Equipment plan to meet to discuss ways to bolster the shares, which have fallen 36 percent in the last 12 months. [D2.]
 
Dollar Rebounds Against Yen
The dollar rose sharply against the yen after comments by a Japanese finance official and fell against the mark on signs of economic vitality in Germany. The dollar, after its recent slide, was nearly 2 yen higher. [D4.]
 
Progress in Tobacco Talks
Negotiators in the tobacco settlement negotiations have taken steps toward a resolution of important regulatory and legal issues, but significant hurdles remain, people close to the talks said. [A24.]
 
Concerns Raised on Patents
A doctor who received a patent for noticing the relationship in tests of pregnant women between levels of a hormone and the incidence of a congenital birth defect has created a dispute by demanding royalties based on the finding, and has raised questions about the use of patent laws in medicine. [A1.]
 
Documents Lost in Fire
Bear Stearns, which has been asked to provide information to investigators and lawyers examining the collapse of A. R. Baron, was among the companies that lost records in a fire at a document storage center in Pennsylvania early this month. But the company said the loss of the records should have no effect on the investigations. [D5.]
 
Delay for 'Fast Track'
President Clinton has bowed to political necessities and decided to postpone until the fall his effort to get so-called fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements, Administration officials said. [D13.]

Russian Military Leaders Are Dismissed by Yeltsin
President Boris N. Yeltsin scathingly dismissed Russia's two top military leaders, criticizing their resistance to budget cuts. The head of Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal was named acting Defense Minister, replacing Igor N. Rodionov, whose dismissal was televised as a warning to other officials. A1
 
Surprise Contender in Iran
To the surprise of the ruling mullahs in Iran, Mohammed Khatami has drawn huge crowds and emerged as a serious liberal contender in the presidential election today. No real competition had been expected for Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, the Speaker of the Parliament and the mullahs' choice. Iran's president has limited powers compared with the unelected "supreme leader," Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A1
 
Albright Announces Sanctions
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced sanctions against two Chinese companies and a handful of Chinese executives, saying they had knowingly helped Iran make chemical weapons. She said there was no evidence that the Chinese Government had been involved in the companies' efforts to export chemicals and equipment. A1
 
NATO to Expand Role in Bosnia
NATO forces in Bosnia will add non-military tasks to their duties, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said. The change is part of an effort to renew the momentum of the peace accords signed in Dayton, Ohio, eighteen months ago. Ms. Albright is to travel to Bosnia next week. A6
 
Swiss Reject U.S. Criticism
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti rejected as "unsupported" and "one-sided" the accusations made in a United States Government report that Switzerland had undermined its vaunted neutrality and prolonged World War II by acting as a banker to Nazi Germany. Mr. Cotti conceded that mistakes had been made but said that his country's national survival had been at stake. A7
 
Israel Plans Arab Housing
The Israeli Interior Ministry said it had approved construction of 3,400 homes in an Arab village next to a hill in Jerusalem where work on a new Jewish neighborhood has seriously frustrated Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Government had pledged to approve Arab housing when it authorized construction of the Jewish settlement, known as Har Homa. Palestinian officials dismissed the Israeli announcement as propaganda. A10
 
Sainthood for Jewish-Born Nun
Pope John Paul II formally approved sainthood for Edith Stein, a Jewish-born nun killed in a Holocaust gas chamber. No date for the canonization ceremony, which would make her a Roman Catholic saint, was announced. The nun's beatification in 1987 drew criticism from some Jews, who said the Nazis had killed her because of her Jewish heritage, not because of her Catholicism. (AP)

Embattled Air Force Pilot Accepts General Discharge
The country's first female B-52 pilot, First Lieut. Kelly Flinn, will accept a general discharge from the Air Force rather than face a court-martial for adultery, lying and other charges that could have sent her to prison for up to nine and a half years. Air Force officials said a general discharge meant that Lieutenant Flinn would almost certainly not be allowed to fly in the Air Force Reserves and would be required to pay back about $20,000 of the cost of her Air Force Academy education. A1
 
McVeigh's Defense Begins
The lawyers for Timothy J. McVeigh opened their defense by raising the possibility that someone else had been the bomber in the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City and had been killed in the blast. Oklahoma's medical examiner testified that that he had never been able to link a severed leg found at the scene to a body. A1
 
Spending Plans Rejected
The Senate voted down the last major amendment to the budget resolution, a proposal to spent more money on Federal highway projects, as it moved toward a Congressional commitment to balance the Federal budget by 2002. A measure to set aside $5 billion to rebuild crumbling schools was also defeated. A21
 
Astronaut Set for Return
Jerry M. Linenger expects to walk off Atlantis when he returns to Earth on Saturday after four months on Mir. NASA wants astronauts to be carried off the shuttle after long stretches in space because that makes scientific tests easier to carry out. But only one of Dr. Linenger's three predecessors aboard the Mir was carried from Atlantis. A23

Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The New York Times, announced the appointments of a managing editor and two deputy managing editors. Bill Keller, 48, the foreign editor and a Pulitzer Prize winner, will become managing editor at the end of September, succeeding Gene Roberts, who will end his leave from the University of Maryland and return to teaching journalism there. The deputy managing editor for news will be Gerald M. Boyd, 46, and the deputy for operations will be John M. Geddes, 45. C31
 
Laurels for Longevity
Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who, at age 94, is already the oldest person ever to serve as a member of Congress, will become the longest-serving Senator in the chamber's history on Sunday. Senator Thurmond says he feels like a "million dollars" but would vote for term limits without compunction. A22

Mobsters' Guards Accused Of Making Jail Cushy
Federal officials announced the arrest of 20 people in a sting operation into corruption among guards at a new Federal jail in Brooklyn. The authorities said corrupt guards let top mobsters turn the jail into a social club, where they plotted crimes and sipped vodka and wine. A1
 
Teacher Accused of Sex Abuse
A 41-year-old Brooklyn music teacher, Michael Williams, was charged with sexually abusing a 13-year-old female student in his locked classroom last month. It was the second case in a week in which officials said administrators in a New York City public school had failed to respond promptly in a case involving charges of sexual abuse of a student. The earlier case occurred in Queens. B1
 
Pataki Yields to Indians
Governor Pataki abandoned his effort to collect taxes on gasoline and cigarette sales on Indian reservations. The move was criticized by owners of small businesses operating outside reservations, who have long complained that selling tax-free goods gaves Indian competitors an unfair advantage. But Indian leaders said the move affirmed the tribes' status as sovereign peoples. B1
 
Harassment Suit Is Filed
The Federal Government filed a sexual harassment suit against Sidney Frank Importing and All States Promotions, a liquor importer and a marketing firm, both based in New Rochelle, N.Y., charging that top executives kissed, fondled and made improper advances to more than 100 women employees. A spokesman for the companies denied the charges. B6

HEADLINE: Landlords Settle Race Discrimination Claim

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors said yesterday that the owners of an Upper East Side apartment building had agreed to pay $15,000 and promised to avoid discriminating on the basis of race to settle a Federal housing complaint.
The complaint contended that the owners of the building, at 242 East 77th Street, would not rent an apartment in 1994 to Michael Porter, who is black, until he obtained a financial guarantor for the $1,099-per-month rent. 
 Mr. Porter, who at the time was a manager with Nynex, earned a salary of more than $60,000 and had a good credit history. He said that when he questioned the requirement, he was told that his income was not adequate and that the decision was final.
The Government asserted in its complaint that the "decision not to rent to Porter unless he provided a guarantor was based on Porter's race." The complaint said that in 1994 the owners had rented at least 11 similarly priced apartments to tenants who were not black. The tenants had incomes similar to or lower than Mr. Porter's, and no guarantors were required.
Before reaching the settlement, the owners, including Lee Pokoik, the Lee Pokoik real-estate company and three other people, denied the Government's assertions in court papers. They said that they did not treat Mr. Porter differently because of his race, and that they imposed financial restrictions uniformly on applicants when there were questions about their ability to afford the rent.
Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District, issued a press release in which she said that the case "clearly shows the Government's commitment to vigorously pursue landlords who would impose different terms and conditions for rentals on minority applicants."
In reaching the agreement, the owners did not admit any liability, and one of their lawyers, Maxwell D. Weinstein, sharply disputed the Government's view of the case.
Mr. Weinstein said that his clients' decision to pay the settlement to Mr. Porter was strictly an economic one and that it "was a form of coercion, legal coercion, to settle this case." He criticized the United States Attorney's office for issuing a press release, calling it irresponsible and inappropriate.
Ms. White, in a statement, responded that the "papers filed in court speak for themselves." She said it was her office's duty to "investigate civil rights complaints within our jurisdiction and enforce the law."

HEADLINE: U.S., Asserting Iran Link, Bars 2 Chinese Firms

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The United States has imposed sanctions against two Chinese companies and a handful of Chinese executives, accusing them of knowingly helping Iran make chemical weapons, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced today.
The sanctions are the first imposed by the United States in an effort to stop any organization in China from helping to spread chemical weapons. [In a statement early Friday, one of the companies denied the charges.] 
 Ms. Albright said the United States had no evidence that the Government in Beijing was involved in what she said were the companies' illegal efforts to export chemicals and equipment for use in Iran's weapons production.
But a senior Administration official acknowledged that Washington had raised concerns with the Government about the companies' activities for at least a couple of years, "both in expert discussions and at the highest levels."
"The Chinese Government knew of our concerns and knew of these activities," the official said today, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The Chinese Government has taken no immediate steps against these particular entities and companies to this point."
The officials said the companies, which are now banned from trading with the United States, are not state-owned enterprises, but it was not clear whether any of their executives might have connections with the Chinese Government or the military, as is the case in many Chinese companies.
The sanctions come at a sensitive time in the relationship with China, particularly as President Clinton seeks to renew China's trade status in the face of deepening skepticism in Congress over human rights and, increasingly, weapons proliferation.
Ms. Albright announced the sanctions before the Senate's appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, under questioning by Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican of Utah, about the extent of China's complicity in delivering weapons to Iran and Pakistan.
"We hope that this action on our part will serve to encourage the Chinese Government to improve its export controls so that these kind of entities are prevented in the future from assisting Iran's chemical weapons program," Ms. Albright said.
The sanctions were imposed under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, which forbids companies from exporting various chemicals and equipment to countries identified by the United States as terrorist nations. The list includes Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Iraq and Cuba.
Iran's chemical weapons program -- and its increasing efforts to develop missiles capable of launching them -- have been a major concern in Washington. Despite various efforts by the United States to undercut it, officials here say, the program has continued to expand, though one official said today that Iran had not yet built a missile with a chemical-weapons payload.
The two Chinese companies sanctioned are the Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and its export division, the Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import/Export Corporation. An official here described them as "key players" in China's chemical industries.
The five executives sanctioned worked for other companies but acted individually to smuggle weapons to Iran, according to the State Department.
The Administration also imposed sanctions against a company in Hong Kong, Cheong Yee Ltd., that an official described as a "middle man" in transactions between Chinese companies and Iran.
Taken together, the companies do about $2 million a year in business with the United States. The sanctions remain in place for at least a year, after which they can be reviewed.
Ms. Albright and the other officials did not discuss the specific accusations against the companies or executives, saying they were based on classified intelligence information. But in a statement the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said they met the law's threshold of "knowingly and materially" contributing to Iran's chemical weapons program.
One official said the companies had shipped glass-lined vessels crucial for the manufacture of those weapons, as well as "sufficient quantities" of three chemicals -- thionyl chloride, dimethylamine and ethylene chlorohydrin -- used to make chemical weapons.
Many of the chemicals covered under the law have benign uses, but the officials said the United States had clear evidence that the companies and executives involved knew the intended use and helped forge documents to get them through China's export controls.

Denial by Chinese Company
 BEIJING, Friday, May 23 (Reuters) -- One of the Chinese companies being punished by the United States denied today that it had sold to Iran material that could be used in making chemical weapons.
"We have never sold any chemicals, chemical products or equipment to Iran," an official of Jiangsu Yongli Chemical said in a telephone interview from Nanjing.
Jiangsu Yongli exports mainly to Southeast Asia, the official said, and abides by Government export regulations.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Little Changed On a Shortened Trading Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday in a shortened trading session ahead of a three-day holiday weekend.
The 30-year bond was unchanged from Thursday at a price of 9517/32 to yield 6.98 percent. 
 Trading was very quiet. Some $42 billion in securities were traded, according to Govpx, a bond pricing service, about 20 percent below the average for a Friday in the second quarter. The market closed three hours early, at 2 P.M., and will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.
Doug Burtnick, a senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that after a modest flow in the morning, trading rapidly dwindled.
There was no market-moving news or data yesterday. Investors looking for clues about the pace of economic growth and the Federal Reserve's intentions on monetary policy this summer will see only a few important reports next week.
The Government will report on April durable goods orders and the Chicago Purchasing Management Association will issue its May survey.
With the Fed's decision to leave the overnight bank lending rate unchanged at 5.50 percent this week, it means that investors will keep close tabs for any signs of growth that could cause the Fed to push rates higher. Fed policy makers meet again on July 1 and 2.
Also, next week the Treasury will sell new two-year notes on Wednesday and five-year notes on Thursday, in addition to its regular weekly bill auction, on Tuesday.
Greg Jones, an economist with Briefing.com, a market analysis firm in Menlo Park, Calif., said he believed the market would do better to focus on the supply of new Treasury debt next week.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's note auctions, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.25 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.57 percent.
Over all, Mr. Burtnick, the Technical Data analyst, said, "absolutely nothing has changed in terms of outlook for next week."

HEADLINE: Police and Troops Break Up Election Rallies in Indonesia

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, May 23

 BODY:
The Government displayed its power today, using tear gas, rubber bullets and an overwhelming armed presence on the streets of Jakarta, the capital, to quash attempts by its opponents to hold rallies on the last day of campaigning for next week's parliamentary election.
As black-uniformed marines, riot policemen padded like hockey goalies and 20,000 soldiers in battle gear guarded key neighborhoods, hit-and-run convoys of young men on motorcycles buzzed through the city waving banners and gunning their engines. 
 Rioting erupted in south Jakarta -- as it has in several cities during this violent, monthlong campaign -- when a mob of young men from the governing party, Golkar, threw rocks and attacked demonstrators from the People's Democratic Party, the bigger of the two legal opposition parties.
As the crowds ran wild, smashing windows and storefronts along a two-mile thoroughfare, security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets as they did during more widespread rioting in the capital on Tuesday in which one person was reported to have been killed.
Starting on Saturday, campaigning will be banned during a five-day cooling-off period before the election, in which 125 million people are eligible to vote.
In his 31 years in power, President Suharto has raised Indonesia from hunger and poverty, producing one of the region's economic success stories but one of its most stunted countries in terms of democratic ideals.
Golkar has held a monopoly on power at all levels, and elections have been orchestrated more as pageants than as contests for office, so the outcome of the voting on Thursday is certain.
But widespread corruption, Government abuses, rising unemployment and underemployment and growing demands for a popular voice in national affairs have exposed a deep vein of discontent and anger here in the world's fourth-largest country. The resulting atmosphere of tension has made this the most violent election campaign here in recent times, with 123 people reported killed.
Golkar is assured of an overwhelming vote in part because millions of people in the military and in Government service -- from teachers to civil servants -- will be required to vote for the Government party.
But it was hard to find anyone on the streets of the city today who spoke in favor of the Government. They talked of corruption and unemployment and injustice, but the passionate issue appeared to be Mr. Suharto's autocratic rule.
"This is not democracy; this is power," said one man who declined to give his name. "This is not a president; this is a king."
Even a 28-year-old marine lieutenant, who said his orders were to bar opposition demonstrators, said it was time for a change.
"We want to have a place that is structured more like America, so that there is social justice for our people," he said. "People should have a voice, but in fact they don't."
Even an opposition landslide on Thursday would not oust Mr. Suharto. Voters are to choose 425 elected legislators. Together with 500 other representatives chosen by the Government and 75 members from the military, they will form a 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly that will elect the next President in 1998.
Though Mr. Suharto has not announced his intentions, he is widely believed to be planning to continue in office. But he is 75, and already the nation is looking ahead toward an uncertain future.
The President has made no public provision for a successor, and that question mark has contributed to a growing restiveness in this country of 200 million. The last transition of power, when Mr. Suharto succeeded Indonesia's founding President, Sukarno, was accompanied by a purge of Communists that led to widespread killings in which some 500,000 people died.
The Government acted early, one year ago, to choke off potential opposition. It engineered a split in the opposition People's Democratic Party that forced the ouster of its popular leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri, a daughter of Mr. Sukarno.
When that action sparked widespread rioting in Jakarta last July, the Government launched a campaign of arrests and interrogations intended to neutralize its opponents.
A growing number of Indonesians appear to have joined a movement to boycott the election, either by staying away from the polls or by spoiling their ballots.
On Thursday, Mrs. Megawati added fuel to this movement, announcing that she would not vote. But she carefully avoided urging others to boycott the election: other people who have called for a boycott have been arrested.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid for the Port Authority

BYLINE: By Richard C. Leone; Richard C. Leone, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1990 to 1994, is president of the Twentieth Century Fund.

 BODY:
One of my earliest memories of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is watching Austin Tobin, the agency's executive director for three decades, testify before a state legislative committee in 1965. Mr. Tobin carefully reminded his listeners that the authority, while a public agency, received no tax money and operated "just like a corporation."
His role, he explained, was similar to that of a company president, while the commissioners functioned like a board of directors. Before leaving the agency in 1973, Mr. Tobin was both praised and criticized for his independence, but governors and legislators usually went along with him. The agency performed so well that its special status seemed justified. 
 Flash forward to 1997: The Port Authority has announced that it will contract out the management of the general arrivals building at Kennedy International Airport to a company owned by the Dutch Government. Most of the reaction has been favorable. The company is described as exceptionally competent and creative, in large part because, while government-owned, it operates with great independence. What is striking about this description is that it fits, almost perfectly, the profile of the "old" Port Authority of Austin Tobin.
In its heyday, the authority had tremendous -- some would say almost total -- autonomy from the two state governments that created it. Politicians and the press complained that its board was unresponsive to the demands of both governors and the mayors of New York, Newark and other cities. But the authority got the job done, building bridges, tunnels, airports and the World Trade Center.
Some governors were savvy enough to support the agency (at least covertly). Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Gov. Richard Hughes saw the value not only of having someone to blame for tolls and airport noise, but also of having an agency with the political insulation needed for long-term capital projects. They knew better than to raid the agency for money to meet budget gaps, and they understood the importance of keeping it strong enough to undertake projects that can mean the difference between a region's prosperity and decline.
But in the past two decades politics and politicians have changed. When it comes to taxes and budgets, governors practice the politics of survival. The turning point came in the late 1970's, when Gov. Hugh Carey of New York and Gov. William Cahill of New Jersey began insisting that the authority give the states the lion's share of any new revenues from, say, toll increases or commercial tenants in the World Trade Center. Thus the agency has handed over about $600 million for commuter cars and buses, and has set aside more than $1 billion for regional "development banks" that finance state projects.
The states have also appointed board members who they hope will be more responsive to their wishes and have driven out career professionals.
The cost of these changes has been immense. While there have been some successes like the Newark Airport renovation, more typical has been the attempted revival of Kennedy, a series of expensive false starts like the now-abandoned master plan for a giant central terminal and an underground baggage system, which became known as the "tunnel to nowhere."
But not to worry, a solution is at hand: We can simply pay a foreign government to do a job that we can no longer do.

HEADLINE: Affluent Town Resents Poverty Aid

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SAUGATUCK, Mich., May 21

 BODY:
The docks at this affluent Lake Michigan resort are lined with the powerboats and yachts of wealthy Chicago and Detroit families. The bed-and-breakfasts are stately mansions where rooms go for as much as $165 a night. When McDonald's tried to open a restaurant here a decade ago, planners refused to grant the permits, successfully arguing that fast food just did not fit with the town's cultivated quaintness.
So local residents have been mystified and a little miffed ever since they were singled out for Federal assistance at Vice President Al Gore's recent conference in Detroit on promoting local economic development to reduce poverty. The Agriculture Department announced at the conference that the its rural development division would guarantee four business loans in Michigan, including a $1.3 million loan to an investor in Grand Rapids for the construction of a Holiday Inn Express here. 
 The loan guarantees allow otherwise risky ventures to borrow at low interest rates from local banks, with the Agriculture Department repaying the loans if the borrower defaults. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman defended the guarantees for "the survival of many rural communities remains largely dependent on their ability to attract and retain businesses to fuel their local economies and provide jobs."
But Saugatuck residents say that their town's survival was never in doubt. In a town that markets itself as "the Martha's Vineyard of the Midwest," the main problem is controlling growth, not increasing it. The town's population soars from 3,000 to 20,000 each summer, as tourists and boaters pour in from Chicago, 110 miles to the southwest, and Detroit, 180 miles to the east.
Innkeepers here pay $7 or $8 an hour for summer workers, but have so much trouble finding them that they take out newspaper advertisements in other towns. The unemployment rate here was just 3.0 percent last month. The 1990 Census found that just 5.4 percent of the residents were living below the poverty line, less than half the national average.
"We are not impoverished; we cannot fill our service jobs," said Catherine L. Simon, the owner of the 15-room Maplewood Hotel, a bed-and-breakfast in a 137-year-old house with two-story Corinthian columns.
Fearing competition, Ms. Simon and the owners of the town's several dozen bed-and-breakfasts and motels have emerged in the last several weeks as the most outspoken critics of the Federal assistance. They complain that local banks never lent them any money because the season lasts only two months, making repayment risky.
Local farmers, the Agriculture Department's traditional constituency, have also been upset by the loan guarantee. The farmers contend that the agency should spend more money helping them during bad harvests instead of aiding hotel ventures.
"We cannot believe the Agriculture Department would back this venture; they wouldn't do it for a farmer," said Connie Krupka, who has been raising blueberries near here since World War II
Bart H. Chilton, the Agriculture Department's senior policy director for rural development, said that in evaluating applications for loan guarantees, the agency used a scoring system that gave preference to communities with high unemployment and a high poverty rate. But the application for the Holiday Inn Express arrived when only seven or eight applications had been submitted.
The Saugatuck application scored fairly high because the loan was for only 70 percent of the project's value instead of the usual 80 percent, thereby reducing the risk for the Agriculture Department, Mr. Chilton said. Even borrowers in wealthy communities can obtain guarantees when there are few competing applications.
Laura Trivers, a department spokeswoman, said that before issuing the loan guarantee for the Saugatuck hotel, it had checked with the West Michigan Regional Planning Commission in Grand Rapids, and that there had been no criticism of the project.
Joseph W. Gorka, the town supervisor in Saugatuck, said that he had never been in contact with the regional commission during his four years in office and was not even sure what the group did.
"They didn't ask us," Mr. Gorka said. "I was completely surprised" at the announcement of the loan guarantee.
Saugatuck has little need for more hotel jobs given the difficulty that innkeepers already have in finding workers, he added.
The loan guarantee was awarded to Shree Krishna Enterprises Inc., a company set up by Dahyalalm Patel, the owner of a bakery in Grand Rapids and an investor in several Michigan and Kentucky hotels. Shree Krishna would operate the new hotel as a franchise of the Holiday Inn chain. Mr. Patel declined to comment. The United Bank of Michigan, a tiny community bank in Grand Rapids, issued the Government-guaranteed loan.
Holiday Inn Express is a low-cost version of the Holiday Inn chain with few services, designed for business travelers.
Construction has already begun at the Saugatuck site, a large patch of dirt surrounded by groves of pine trees. There are already some budget motels in town, like the Captains Quarters, which caters to the crews aboard visiting yachts.
Borrowers default on 7.5 percent of the loans guaranteed by the Agriculture Department's rural development division, forcing the Federal Government to pay the outstanding balance of these loans. The department is setting aside $688.2 million during the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, to cover these losses.
For decades, the department's rural development programs have periodically been criticized for subsidizing electricity and sewage in wealthy Colorado ski resorts and other affluent towns. But members of Congress from rural areas have had considerable success in protecting the programs from budget cuts and avoiding rules that would limit eligibility for subsidies to low-income areas.
The programs tend to be very inefficient, said Daniel A. Sumner, an assistant secretary of agriculture in the Bush Administration, and "are very prone to being diverted to help communities that don't deserve any help at all."
Mr. Chilton defended the programs, saying they often provided opportunities for economic growth in small towns with few other options.
Here in Saugatuck, though, many believe they have other options.
"We are not underdeveloped," said Felicia Fairchild, a longtime resident. "We are an extremely expensive resort town."

HEADLINE: Half Full or Half Empty?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The gap between the national unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in April, and New York City's, at 9.7 percent, is now the greatest it has been in the 30 years extensive records have been kept, Federal labor officials said this week.
That sounds unequivocally bad. But what the gap says about New York's economy, and what possibilities it suggests for the city's and region's future, are far from black and white. 
 The causes of locally high unemployment are familiar: declines in manufacturing; the influx of immigrants; the creation of highly paid jobs that do not affect average New Yorkers, and the welfare overhaul that is encouraging people to leave public aid have all contributed. The city is creating more jobs than it has for years, though not enough.
But what is becoming increasingly important now, economists say, is not so much the causes of the gap as the consequences. Some economists believe that as the national labor market continues to tighten in Sun Belt meccas like North Carolina and across much of the Midwest, a new equilibrium could be reached that will tilt gradually back toward New York's advantage, or at least toward a level playing field. If employers cannot find workers elsewhere, so this reasoning goes, they may be drawn to move to or expand in the city and the region, because that is where the labor is.
"Employers will be attracted by New York's pool of unemployed," said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "It's a significant potential economic opportunity for the metro area."
Rae Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the real significance of the gap is what it says about the surging number of people looking for work in New York. The jobless rate is based on the number of people who receive unemployment benefits, but also on the number who say in surveys that they are actively looking for work. The latter part of the equation is what has soared, and that speaks of optimism, Ms. Rosen said.
"The changes that explain the New York rate have the potential to be significant," she said. "They could be quite positive to the city if we have the wherewithal to place these people."
The labor pool is enormous. In March, nearly 5 percent of all the unemployed people in the country lived in the New York metropolitan area, a higher proportion of the country's jobless than in any single month since at least 1987, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that figure does not include the hundreds of thousands of residents of the region who have moved out in the 1990's, looking for greener pastures elsewhere.
The president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, Charles Millard, said he thought that the main thing to realize about the unemployment rate is that it has risen parallel with an increase in job growth. The imbalance in the labor market that has flooded the city with job seekers, he said, is a direct consequence of New York's improved fortunes.
"The most interesting statistic is that new unemployment claims are going down, even while the number of people seeking jobs in New York is increasing," he said.
Other experts are less optimistic about the labor gap, arguing that the kinds of companies most likely to hire New York's unemployed, who are on average less educated and less skilled than other New Yorkers, are retailers or hotels that do not choose locations based on labor availability at all, but rather on market demand for their products. Wal-Mart goes where it can sell merchandise, not where it can hire clerks.
"I can't imagine any kind of economic process where a tightening in Cincinnati or Denver is going to end up increasing the demand for New York City janitors," said Bennett Harrison, a professor of urban political economy at the New School for Social Research. "There is no national market for Wal-Mart employees or parking lot attendants or janitors."
A continuing gap could have political consequences either way. For years, New York has routinely granted millions in tax breaks to corporations that threaten to leave the city for places where labor and business costs are cheaper. With workers so scarce in many parts of the country, including in the New York region -- the unemployment rate across much of Fairfield County, Conn., was about 3 percent in March -- corporate bluster about pulling up stakes is simply less credible now.
"If a company says, 'I'm going to move, lock, stock and barrel, to Tampa or Des Moines or Minneapolis,' it's a little less likely to really happen today," said Mr. Zandi at Regional Financial Associates. In those three cities, the unemployment rate is 4 percent or lower, he said. In Des Moines, it is 2 percent. "If you can't find the bodies, you can't move," he said.
The unemployment gap appears to be making New York City more competitive with the rest of the country on at least one main sticking point for employers: labor costs. Because the region has grown more slowly than the rest of the nation in the 1990's, and because the big surplus labor pool has kept wage pressures lower still, labor costs in much of the rest of the country have risen faster and have started to catch up.
In 1990, the cost of labor in the New York metropolitan area was 120 percent of the national average, according to an analysis by Mr. Zandi's firm. Now, New York's cost is only 110 percent of the national cost.
So far, state and city economic development officials can point to only a few companies, mostly in financial services and telecommunications, who said they had moved or expanded in the New York City area because of labor considerations. In all the cases they cited, the skills available in the region, rather than the supply of labor, appear to have been the consideration.
A report issued this week by the New York City Comptroller's office suggests that local hiring patterns remain mixed. In the first quarter of 1997, the report said, the number of jobs in the city expanded by nearly 20,000. But the number of city residents with jobs actually declined by nearly 21,000. Not only did city residents not get the new jobs, the report said, but apparently lost many of the ones they had or moved away.
Mark Pendrock looks out at a New York economy that might as well be Des Moines. He cannot find the workers he needs. Simple as that.
"We'd hire six people right now if we could," said Mr. Pendrock, an executive vice president at Application Consulting Group, a Morristown, N.J., business services firm. Mr. Pendrock said he wanted to recruit locally and could pay in the high $30,000 range for new college graduates with consulting and computer software skills. There are few takers. "The competition to hire people is enormous," he said, "and the demand by New York companies in hiring is putting great pressure on us. It's an obstacle to growth."
Daiser Bazan sees a different New York. Ms. Bazan, a native of Colombia who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, used to help run the cafeteria at Grey Advertising in Manhattan, but lost her $500-a-week job last year as an assistant manager when the food service company she worked for was bought out. She has been looking for eight months and has not found anything that will pay her more than $7 an hour, which she says she cannot live on.
"I go to restaurants, the Rainbow Room, Windows on the World, and apply, and they tell me I have an impressive resume, but they only offer me $7 an hour," she said. "They say there are no problems in this city with getting work. There are lots of problems."
A comparison of the performance of various industries in New York and the rest of the country in the 1990's shows partly how and why that divergence in employment has grown. In the 12 months between March 1996 and March 1997, business services and engineering and management services -- the two biggest job engines in the city's economy over the year -- both outperformed the national economy in percentage increase in employment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Both industries also tend to recruit nationally and pay high salaries for high skills.
By contrast, national growth outstripped New York's in many industries that tend to hire and recruit locally and pay less for fewer skills; from food stores to hotel employment, to government and in most manufacturing categories.
One major question for the future is what a slowing national economy might mean for New York's unemployed. Some economists say the nation's unemployment rate would probably be even lower, and the city's even higher, if not for the 1.3 million residents of the region who moved to other parts of the country in the 1990's.
They argue that the population exodus, as in other major urban centers like Los Angeles, which lost 1.3 million people, has acted like a pressure release valve for the national economy, redistributing labor to places where it is needed. Immigration from foreign countries, meanwhile, has kept New York's population from falling precipitously.
Other experts say that the effect of population changes on unemployment levels is more complicated. Reputations about regions of the country are slow to grow and slow to change, and population flows are even slower to react, said James Brown, a labor market analyst with the State Department of Labor who follows the New York City economy.
Mr. Brown said he did not think that the New Yorkers who left the region necessarily moved to places where job growth has been hotter, though some certainly did. They moved, he said, for the same reason others had for generations, from older, port-of-entry cities like New York to less established areas that have been growing faster for many years.
Part of the explanation of the low unemployment rates in the old industrial belt of the Midwest and the Plains States, he said, is that those areas lost so much population over previous years of economic stagnation, and have not had it replaced, as cities like New York and Los Angeles have, through immigration. Labor markets, like cruise ships, do not turn on a dime.
"If a region stays hot over time, that does produce changes, like the oil patch in the 70's," Mr. Brown said. "But it takes a while for word to get out."

The jobless rate for the United States has fallen sharply in the 1990's, but New York City's jobless rate has been rising. While some sectors of the city's economy are weak, part of the reason for the rise is the city has an increasingly large share of the nation's job seekers. Graphs show jobless rate in New York City and in the United States, change in employment in New York City by industry. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics)(pg. 23)

HEADLINE: Volatile Week for the Dollar Concludes in Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended a volatile week on a quiet note yesterday, closing lower against other major currencies in thin, pre-holiday trading, dealers said.
A looming three-day holiday weekend in the two largest foreign exchange markets -- the United States and Britain -- and an early close yesterday in the United States bond market, subdued trading volume and activity, dealers said. 
 In trading in New York, the dollar settled at 115.66 yen, down marginally from 115.96 yen on Thursday and little changed from its 115.55 yen level a week earlier. The dollar edged up to 1.6935 marks from 1.6934 marks. The pound rose to $1.6345 from $1.6234.
Stealing the spotlight was a sudden drop in the Australian dollar, which tumbled on news of an unexpected cut in Australian interest rates.
The Reserve Bank of Australia cut half a percentage point off the official cash rate, the fourth cut since last July, pushing the rate to 5.5 percent -- its lowest since August 1994. The Australian dollar fell to 76.7 United States cents, from 78.15 United States cents on Thursday and the lowest level in three months.
The dollar showed little reaction to remarks from Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's top foreign-exchange policy maker, who said that a rise in Japan's discount rate should be expected by the end of the year.
"The discount rate is currently very low," he said in an interview with Le Monde. " If it rises by 0.5 percent, it will be at 1 percent, which remains low. A move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year. " He also noted, however, that he did not believe the Bank of Japan would raise rates before it was sure of a solid economic upturn.
The dollar gained against the French franc as France prepared for the first round of elections this weekend. Analysts said victory for the ruling center-right coalition would bolster the dollar against the mark as the French franc should respond favorably. But gains by the Socialists could hurt the dollar because currency traders would then buy marks. The dollar rose to 5.7040 French francs, from 5.7015 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Business Bribes To Foreigners To Be Banned By End of 1998

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
After two years of negotiations, the world's largest industrialized nations have agreed to outlaw the bribery of foreign officials by the end of next year.
The agreement represents a major victory for American businesses that have long complained that the anti-corruption law passed by Congress two decades ago puts them at a disadvantage around the world. It was reached this afternoon and is scheduled to be ratified Monday in Paris by the 29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club that brings together officials of most of the richest nations around the globe and some of those that aspire to that status. 
 The pact would be the first global accord making it a crime to bribe foreign officials to obtain the multibillion-dollar contracts that have become the focus of increasingly cutthroat competition among multinational corporations and governments. France, Germany and Japan have historically been the most reluctant to agree to such laws; in Germany and Canada, companies have even been allowed to take tax deductions for foreign bribes simply by listing them as a cost of doing business.
The Clinton Administration has made forging an anti-bribery agreement a high priority. But Administration officials said today that they had no illusions that the corruption accord alone would put a huge dent in the multibillion-dollar international bribery business. Two of the newest member countries of the O.E.C.D. -- South Korea and Mexico -- are regarded as being among the more corrupt nations where American companies do business. And the agreement does not include countries outside the O.E.C.D., like China and Indonesia, where, as any business executive in Asia knows well, a willingness to enrich local and national officials is often considered the price of entry.
Nonetheless, Commerce Secretary William Daley insisted today in a statement that the agreement was "a major step forward in curbing international bribery.
"The O.E.C.D.," he added, "has now reached an agreement on criminalizing bribery as well as a procedure to do so within a short, specified period of time."
Under the accord reached today, each of the nations in the O.E.C.D. has until next April to introduce legislation making foreign bribery a crime. The laws must be passed by the end of 1998, and the O.E.C.D. nations are committed to opening negotiations for an international treaty to deal with bribery. France and Germany pushed for such a convention so that they would not be placed at a disadvantage by other nations that approved less stringent anti-corruption statutes.
The agreement sets out criteria for the national legislation -- some of it similar to the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States -- but it does not mandate specific wording. That leaves open the possibility that some nations may treat bribery as a far more serious offense than others.
"This is an important step," said David Rothkopf, a former senior Commerce Department official who was involved in the compilation of a classified report to Congress in 1995 that detailed over 100 instances where foreign companies used bribery to beat out American bids for business around the world. "But you have to remember that bribery is usually committed by rich companies from rich countries that go into poor countries and bribe their officials. Any agreement that has teeth must be enforced, and it must also deal not just with the supply side of bribery, but with the demand side."
While it is impossible to get a true measure of international bribery, the Commerce Department has estimated that United States companies have lost contracts valued at approximately $11 billion since mid-1994 because of efforts by foreign companies to bribe officials around the world. But those include only the high-profile cases that companies report or that American intelligence officials have picked up.
In his new book "The Big Ten," about the world's 10 largest emerging-market nations, Jeffrey E. Garten, the former under secretary of commerce for international affairs, wrote that "it is often difficult to do business in any of these countries without bribing someone."
French and Japanese companies, he wrote, "routinely provide payoffs of one kind or another without penalties at home."
The new O.E.C.D. regulations will stipulate that the national laws against foreign bribery must attack conspiracy cases, and they must specify that companies cannot offer as a defense that they bribed foreign officials to comply with "local customs." The rules will also include a system that allows other nations to monitor how each country enforces the anti-corruption rules.
"This has very concrete terms in it," said Nancy Zucker Boswell, the managing director of Transparency International USA, the American arm of a lobbying group that seeks to curb corruption in business and in developing nations. The group, which is supported by the Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation and some multinational corporations, among others, publishes an annual index of corruption in nations around the world.

HEADLINE: Russia and Belarus Agree on a New Union

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 23

 BODY:
Russia and Belarus agreed today to form a new union, a largely symbolic move intended to appeal to nostalgia for the old Soviet empire.
President Boris N. Yeltsin signed the accord with the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, in a grand Kremlin ceremony. "Our union is aimed at forging further relations of brotherhood, friendship and all-around cooperation," Mr. Yeltsin declared. 
 Under the treaty, a new supernational body will oversee the union, headed by Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Lukashenko. Decisions must be approved by each President. But the agreement does not establish a common state or set a deadline for full-fledged unity. Such a merger has been blocked by Russian reformers wary of assuming the burden of Belarus, a poor country run by a former collective-farm director opposed to free-market reforms.
But as NATO plans to expand, the watered-down accord gives the Kremlin something to show to support its argument that Russia's influence is increasing.
As the Russia-Belarus accord was being signed, Mr. Yeltsin also appointed Gen. Igor Sergeyev as Defense Minister. The general, the former head of the Strategic Rocket Forces and a supporter of new strategic arms accords with the United States, had been named Acting Minister on Thursday. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the commander of the North Caucasus military district, is to be the Acting Chief of Staff.

Stocks Rise to New Highs In Broad but Quiet Rally
Stocks climbed to new highs in a broad rally. Technology and small-company stocks, in particular, posted strong gains, showing that they are catching up to the big names in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500. The Dow reached its 20th high of the year in quiet trading, rising 87.78 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,345.91. 
 And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index became the last of the major indexes to recover from the market's spring selloff. The Nasdaq rose 17.12 points, or 1.3 percent, to a record 1,389.72. [Page 36.]
 
Bond Market Steadies
Treasury prices were little changed in very quiet trading. For the week, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 8 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- to 6.98 percent. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates unchanged. Next week, with few major economic reports scheduled, bond investors are expected to focus on new supply coming to market. [43.]
 
The dollar slipped in thin trading. The Australian dollar tumbled after the country's central bank made an unexpected cut of half a percentage point in interest rates. [43.]
 
Boeing Seeks Fuel-Tank Checks
Boeing plans to ask all airlines that fly 747's to inspect the the planes' center fuel tanks for signs of anything that could create a spark. More than 1,000 of the airplanes are in service with airlines around the world. The call follows the failure of a 10-month investigation to find what caused T.W.A. Flight 800 to explode. [22.]

Affiliate of Big Japanese Firm Fails
Ogawa Securities, a debt-ridden affiliate of the Yamaichi Securities Company in Tokyo, will be shut down. While it is the first Japanese brokerage house to fail in 17 years, other affiliates of Japan's four biggest brokerage companies have encountered problems. [34.]
 
Ford Leads; Mazda Improves
Mazda Motor, in its first fiscal year under the control of the Ford Motor Company, said unconsolidated profit surged in the year, though it had an operating loss. Still, the report was a sign of progress for the troubled Japanese auto maker. Ford managers have helped Mazda improve its cash flow, reduce debt and cut costs. [34.]
 
Opportunity in Jobless Rate?
New York City's unemployment rate, 9.7 percent last month, has persistently been much higher than the nation's, which was 4.9 percent in April. But some economists say that as the labor market continues to tighten elsewhere in the country, New York may benefit. If employers can't find workers elsewhere, they may be drawn to move to or expand in the city and the region, because that is where the labor is. News Analysis. [1.]
 
Economic Gloom in France
As French voters head into national elections tomorrow, many are gloomy over the nation's economic outlook. Both consumers and companies have been reluctant to spend and invest amid high unemployment, only modest growth and widespread disillusionment with the country's political leaders. [7.]
 
Hot Stock in Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, investor frenzy has surrounded the initial public offering of Beijing Enterprises Holdings. The offering of the so-called red-chip company -- a Hong Kong company with backing from China -- is expected to be oversubscribed 1,000 times. Hundreds of people were still jostling to enter banks even as the noon deadline passed yesterday. The woman above implored police officers to allow her to enter a bank after the deadline for the offering expired. [34.]

South African Bottler Closes
Pepsico has shut down New Age Beverages, its South African franchise bottler, because of overwhelming competition from the Coca-Cola Company. Coke has an 81.3 percent share in the country. Pepsi's share is 4.7.[34.]

Drug King Used Army, Mexican Court Files Say
Some prominent antidrug operations in Mexico in the last year were done at the behest of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a powerful drug baron who had enlisted corrupt generals and bankrolled Mexican Army units in his war against a chief competitor, according to testimony in secret court proceedings. 1
 
Congo Leader Is Protested
A day after President Laurent Kabila of Congo announced his Government, his troops in Kinshasa fired warning shots to disperse a crowd protesting that former Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi had been excluded. They also expressed anger at the presence of foreign troops in the capital. Mr. Tshisekedi, a longtime civilian opponent of Mobutu Sese Seko's rule, said he would not recognize Mr. Kabila's Government. 6
 
Campaign Riots in Jakarta
On the last day of campaigning for next week's parliamentary election in Indonesia, 20,000 Government troops, helped by mobs of rock-throwing young men from the Government party, Golkar, quashed efforts by the People's Democratic Party opposition to hold rallies. Riots broke out nonetheless, as they have frequently in a campaign during which 123 people have been reported killed. 3
 
Iranians Cast Their Votes
Iranians voted for a new President in what has unexpectedly become the most competitive elections in Iran since the Islamic revolution 18 years ago. Many people who indicated that they were tired of religious rule said they cast their votes for Mohammed Khatami, who has advocated a moderate loosening of social control. Conservatives supported Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, the Speaker of Parliament and the candidate preferred by the council of mullahs who have ultimate power. 4
 
Pakistan Urges U.S. to Repay
The Foreign Minister of Pakistan told the Clinton Administration that Pakistan would soon consider suing for the repayment of $650 million it paid Washington for a fleet of undelivered F-16 fighter planes. Since Washington often disregards the rulings of international courts, Pakistani officials said, the lawsuit would be brought in the United States. 3

Congress Goes Home Without Disaster Action
Congress recessed for a 12-day spring break without passing a disaster-relief bill. The major sticking point on the bill has been the insistence by Republicans that it allow for a spending freeze during budget fights to prevent Government shutdowns. President Clinton has vowed to veto any bill with such a provision, saying that a freeze would cut money for education and social programs that are a part of the balanced-budget deal. 1
 
Action Against Citizenship
The Government will move to strip citizenship from nearly 5,000 people whose criminal histories should have prevented their naturalization last year or who misrepresented their records of conviction. Such broad action has never been done and it poses enormous legal and logistical challenges. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has been strongly criticized for allowing about 180,000 foreigners to become citizens without having complete criminal background checks during an election-year campaign to streamline citizenship procedures. 1

A witness who defense lawyers thought would say that a man other than Timothy J.

Scientists have, for the first time, recorded signals from human brain cells making the associations that lead to long-term memories. The signals were found by a team of neurosurgeons who were preparing epilepsy patients for an operation. 9
 
Leaving Hurts Enough
First Lieut. Kelly J. Flinn, the first woman to pilot a B-52, said leaving the Air Force, even with an honorable discharge, would be heartbreaking. She made the comment in a letter to the Secretary of the Air Force, before she was given a general discharge to avoid a court-martial. 8
 
Alaska Logging Expanded
The Forest Service authorized extensive new logging for the next 10 years in the nation's last expanse of old-growth temperate rain forests, the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. The plan calls for less logging than loggers and the state's Congressional delegation have sought, but more than environmental groups deem acceptable. 9

While the gap between the national unemployment rate and that in the New York City is worse than it has been in at least 30 years, some economist say that might lead companies to move to or expand in the city and the region, because that is where the labor is. 1
 
Asylum Plea Seems False
A man who won publicity and offers of help after he applied for asylum, claiming he was subject to persecution in Nigeria, appears to be an impostor. The man said he was a brother of Lieut. Col. Happy Kefas Bulus, who was accused two years ago of plotting the coup. But Colonel Bulus's family say there is no such brother. 24

HEADLINE: More Retirees Discover Small-Town South

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: HATTIESBURG, Miss.

 BODY:
There are no beaches here. No mountains. The public parks are equipped for softball, not shuffleboard. If there is a regular mah-jongg game anywhere in town, it is well hidden.
Yet retirees are migrating here in a steady stream, leaving the bustle and culture (and snow and congestion and crime) of the North to spend their leisure days in the piney woods of southern Mississippi. In the last four years, 267 retired couples have settled here in Hattiesburg, not an invasion of Floridian proportions perhaps, but enough to attract attention in a metropolitan area of only 100,000 people. 
 They are not alone. All across the rural South, retirees are moving to improbable places, lured by temperate weather, inexpensive living and savvy marketing by community leaders who have learned to court senior citizens as aggressively as they recruit automobile manufacturers.
Retirees who once would have flocked to the condominium canyons of South Florida, the golf resorts of coastal South Carolina or the mountains of North Carolina are today discovering small towns and country crossroads like Guntersville, Ala.; Mena, Ark., and Bainbridge, Ga., places that have never made anyone's list of retirement hot spots.
In other cases, huge retirement villages are springing up quite literally in the middle of nowhere, often far from airports and even midsize cities. In western South Carolina, for example, Cooper Communities of Bella Vista, Ark., has sold 3,600 home sites in its Savannah Lakes Village development near McCormick, a city that was described 15 years ago as a ghost town by U.S. News & World Report.
With the aging of the baby boomers making retirement a growth industry, several states are beginning to compete tenaciously for retirees. Some have established state agencies dedicated to the task.
And local governments and business groups around the South are developing tools for working the retirement market -- Web-site testimonials about the pleasures of small-town retirement, for example, and hospitality seminars that remind waitresses to show particular courtesy to elderly diners.
Mark Fagan, a professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama, said his studies of retiree migration had demonstrated that senior citizens could help revive a slumbering economy.
"These counties in eastern Alabama didn't really have what it takes to compete in the smokestack chase, didn't have the infrastructure," Professor Fagan said. "But there are other ways to increase spending in an area."
Retirees have come to places like Hattiesburg, which is home to several hospitals and the University of Southern Mississippi, because of a growing sense that traditional retirement destinations like South Florida, Arizona and California are not as inviting as they once were. And many have come, demographers and sociologists say, because of a yearning for a sense of community that has vanished from many cities.
"We've lived in Los Angeles and Washington and New York and London, and when you live in the city, you don't become a part of the community," said Jean W. Carbonar, who moved here with her husband, Anthony, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan two years ago. "In New York, you don't meet your neighbors unless there's a real bad fire."
On paper, the Carbonars would seem unlikely prospects to spend the rest of their days in Hattiesburg. Before retiring, Mr. Carbonar was a partner with Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon, the Wall Street law firm where Richard M. Nixon hung his hat. In Manhattan, the Carbonars rented a $4,000-a-month apartment overlooking the Queensboro Bridge, and Mr. Carbonar collected boxes of exotic cigars. For a while, they considered retiring to New Zealand.
But after looking at Hattiesburg on the recommendation of their son-in-law, the Carbonars decided they liked the climate, the cost of living, the undulating fairways at the Hattiesburg Country Club and, perhaps above all, the hospitality extended by the community.
"We just felt we could look a long time and not find a place that duplicated it," said Mr. Carbonar, 63. "My friends in New York say, 'Isn't there a big culture shock down there?' And I say, 'Yeah, people here are polite, and for no good reason.' "
In couples like the Carbonars, business and political leaders in Mississippi and other Southern states see vast potential for economic development. When retirees relocate, they bring bank deposits and buy houses. They buy food, clothing, insurance and toys for visiting grandchildren. A 1990 study by William H. Haas, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, concluded that the average retiree household in western North Carolina injected about $36,000 a year into the local economy.
In addition, retirees pay taxes, usually on time, and place little strain on most municipal services. They do not pollute. They rarely commit crimes. They volunteer in schools and hospitals.
"Retirees have got more money than most folks," said Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, who created his state's Hometown Mississippi Retirement program in 1994. "They also are less of a strain on the infrastructure system. They don't use schools. They are what you might call ideal citizens."
The Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans age 65 and older, which was 33.5 million in 1995 (12.8 percent of the population), will grow to 45.6 million in 2015 (14.7 percent) and to 61.9 million in 2025 (18.5 percent).
In addition, some demographers predict that the percentage of retirees who migrate may begin to increase. From 1985 to 1990, 4.5 percent of all Americans 60 or older moved to another state, said Charles F. Longino Jr., a sociologist at Wake Forest University.
Florida, which has no state income tax, is still by far the most popular destination for migrating retirees, with 24 percent of the total moving there from 1985 to 1990, a study by Mr. Longino found.
But Florida's share of the retiree market declined by 2.5 percentage points during that period, while the share increased in states like Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Many of the migrants to other Southern states are moving from Florida to escape crowds, crime and traffic.
Demographers said the movement of retirees to small towns in nontraditional retirement states was too recent to have been measured by the 1990 census. But they predicted that the 2000 census would show an acceleration in the decline in Florida's share of the market and an increase in the share of states like Mississippi.
In the last eight years, several states, including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi and Pennsylvania, have established agencies and budgets devoted solely to recruiting retirees. South Carolina has enlisted a for-profit company, the Center for Carolina Living, to do the job.
There are, of course, potential liabilities in creating an economy that is excessively dependent on retirees. In some states, notably Arizona and Florida, retirees have shown a propensity to vote against tax and bonding measures for school construction. And if the Federal Government reduces Medicare benefits, state and local governments may be forced to pick up health care costs for their elderly populations.
The potential for a heavy health care burden concerns Patrick Mason, co-founder of the Center for Carolina Living.
"We are saying to ourselves, 'Yeah, we need retirees, but we need the Cadillac-class retirees,' " Mr. Mason said. "The no-taxes, y'all-come approach in Florida drew a few millionaires but thousands of middle-class retirees. And when they spend down their assets, they're on Medicaid."
But most states seem to have decided that the benefits outweigh the liabilities. And nowhere has that conclusion been reached more definitively than in Mississippi.
The state appropriates $500,000 a year, one-fifth of all state dollars spent on economic development marketing, to the Hometown Mississippi Retirement program. To make Mississippi more appealing to retirees, the state pointedly eliminated its income tax on pensions and other forms of retirement income in 1995.
Since the state retirement program began advertising in 1995, it has helped at least 700 couples relocate to the state and fielded 100,000 inquiries via a toll-free phone number. It publishes a glossy guide to retirement cities, provides matching grants to towns that undertake their own marketing campaigns, and pays for national advertising. A typical advertisement depicts a snow shovel and the text, "You could always use it to dig out of a sand trap."
Inquiries are followed up with telephone calls, handwritten notes, Christmas cards and invitations to visit, often extended by retirees who have already moved to the state.
"A lot of states just mail out brochures," said Barbara P. McDonald, director of the program. "We knew that Mississippi, not being a traditional retirement destination, would have to go a step farther. So we try the personal touch."
A central component of Mississippi's plan is the designation of 20 cities as certified retirement communities. The state deems that the cities have met certain standards for public safety, recreational amenities, health care and housing.
In Hattiesburg, one of the certified cities, officials sell the city's proximity to New Orleans, Jackson and the casino-clogged Gulf Coast, all within a 90-minute drive. They also highlight the area's 13 golf courses, its two hospitals and large medical clinic, its four-season warmth, and its low housing costs and tax rates.
The culture of college towns appeals to many retirees. The Institute for Learning in Retirement at the University of Southern Mississippi offers bargain courses.
The Area Development Partnership, the city's chamber of commerce, sponsors outings for retirees who have moved to town. It has also put more than 200 employees of motels, restaurants, gas stations, banks and stores through a half-day refresher course in Southern hospitality. The workers are encouraged to fawn over older customers on the theory that some may be considering moving to town.
Charles Short, a marketing executive from Rochester, and his wife, Helen, a microbiologist, got a heavy dose of hospitality when they happened upon Hattiesburg while on a camping trip in 1991. After expressing interest in retiring here, they received telephone calls every other week from other retirees who had already moved to Hattiesburg.
Now the Shorts are making the calls, telling prospects how the produce manager shakes their hands when they enter the grocery store and how they bought a larger house in Hattiesburg than they owned in Rochester and still save $4,000 a year in property taxes.
They also enjoy dispelling the notion, whether held by prospects or old friends in Rochester, that they have moved to a cultural backwater.
"The response from our friends and neighbors was universally negative, that we were going to some morass down here," said Mrs. Short, 67. "So it was with some pride that I wrote them to tell them that Itzhak Perlman was headlining the symphony series. That took the wind out of their sails."

HEADLINE: VICTIMS OF FLOOD FEAR DELAY IN AID

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The White House called it short-sighted. Congressional Democrats said it was arrogant. And soggy Midwesterners and Californians worried it could hurt them in the long run.
Congress recessed today for a 12-day spring break, leaving unfinished a bill that would have provided billions of dollars in disaster aid for flood and storm victims in 33 states and subjecting Republican leaders to charges of politics-as-usual. 
 While as much as $2 billion in emergency aid will continue flowing to flood-ravaged areas from California to Kentucky, many rebuilding and economic-recovery efforts will be delayed until Congress returns from its vacation early next month. Even then, it may take weeks longer to resolve unrelated budget issues that got tangled up with the flood bill.
Midwestern ranchers will have to wait at least two weeks longer to receive Federal payments for cattle drowned or frozen in the calamities. Mayors in Minnesota will have to delay awarding contracts to repair damaged roads, bridges and water-treatment plants. Homeless South Dakota residents will have to wait longer for relocation aid. And some rebuilding in storm-struck Yosemite National Park in California will have to be postponed.
"Communities that have been depending on this funding to get back on their feet are being left short-changed by a short-sighted Congress, which does not reflect well on the Republican leaders of Congress," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who represents one of the hardest-hit states, said Republican legislators were more concerned with getting away for the long holiday than with disaster victims.
"Republicans wanted to leave in the worst way, and they did," Mr. Daschle said at a news conference today. "They put a greater priority on plane tickets than disaster payments. They set a new low for responsibility in the Congress."
By today many House members were winging their way on Government-paid trips to China and NATO meetings in Europe. Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, attended a fund-raising event in Florida.
Democrats immediately tried to make political hay of what they saw as a glaring public-relations blunder by Republicans.
"While hard-working families in North Dakota are trying to bail the water out of their homes, it's amazing to me that Newt Gingrich has the gall to bask in the sun and rake in the bucks at a posh Palm Beach hotel," said Representative Martin Frost, a Texas Democrat who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Officials in afflicted areas also complained. J. Edward Tewes, city manager of Modesto, Calif., which was inundated by the Tuolumne River in January, said flood repairs continue, but Congress's inaction will halt important long-term projects like studying the river flows.
"We need to get on the work now in advance of next year's storms," Mr. Tewes said. "Any delay in money will slow it down."
Republican leaders tried to play down the significance of the disaster aid in the $8.4 billion emergency spending bill that lawmakers failed to approve before packing their bags.
"Not one American in need is without assistance, not one American in need is without emergency funds," said a letter sent today to President Clinton by Mr. Gingrich, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate majority leader.
But senior House Republicans late Thursday night were divided over whether to approve at least $1 billion of the $5.5 billion in disaster aid in a slimmed-down bill.
In a closed meeting on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Gingrich and Representative Robert L. Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, favored the plan, but Mr. Armey and Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the third-ranking House Republican, successfully opposed it, fearing it could weaken Republicans' leverage with the White House on a handful of extraneous issues tacked on to the disaster aid bill.
Two issues in particular torpedoed a compromise between Republicans and the White House. Republicans insisted that any emergency spending bill include a provision aimed at preventing Government shutdowns during budget fights by freezing spending at current levels.
But Mr. Clinton opposed the stopgap-funding provision, arguing that the freeze would in practice cut education and social spending for which the President just won more money in the balanced-budget deal. Mr. Clinton vowed to veto any bill that included the provision.
The other sticking point was a provision to allow the Commerce Department to use a method of counting called statistical sampling for the census in 2000. The Administration says this approach would increase the census's accuracy in counting minorities and other usually underreported groups. Some Republicans believe this approach would give Democrats greater representation in areas where such voters live.
While House and Senate negotiators were narrowing their differences with the White House on these and other resolved issues, the bill ultimately fell victim to the calendar. House Republican leaders promised to let their members go home today, and they decided that disaster aid was not urgent enough to delay that.
Before leaving on its vacation today, the Senate easily approved a balanced-budget deal between Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders. The vote was 78 to 22, with 8 Democrats and 14 Republicans voting against the resolution. The measure envisions $85 billion in tax cuts over the next five years plus savings from Medicare, defense and other programs totaling $321 billion.
One dissenting Democrat, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said the resolution "fails to ask the rich to make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and rewards them with massive tax breaks instead."
But most Republicans and Democrats praised one another effusively after the vote. "It truly was a bipartisan effort," said Senator Lott. "We should be proud of it, and it's an example of what we should do more of in the future."
House and Senate negotiators will convene when Congress returns next month to reconcile the differences in each chamber's balanced-budget resolution.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Seeking To Strip 5,000 Of Citizenship

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will seek to strip the citizenship of nearly 5,000 immigrants who were wrongly naturalized in an immigration drive last year, Federal officials said today.
Revoking that many citizenships at any given time is without precedent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and it poses enormous legal and logistical challenges for the Federal Government. Until now, the agency has never dealt with more than about two dozen revocations a year. 
 Beginning last fall, Republicans accused the Administration of mounting an election-year campaign to streamline citizenship procedures to allow more than 180,000 immigrants to become citizens before the November elections without having their criminal records fully checked.
As a result of these criticisms, the I.N.S. undertook a review of the nearly 1.1 million people who were granted citizenship from September 1995 to last September to determine how many were wrongfully naturalized.
An audit whose findings were released to Congress today found that 16,400 of the new citizens had a record of at least one felony arrest. Arrest or conviction, by itself, is not grounds for revoking someone's citizenship.
But the audit, which is nearly complete, also found 4,946 cases in which a criminal arrest should have disqualified an applicant or in which an applicant lied about his or her criminal history.
"We believe that we are on firm ground in proceeding on administrative revocations where somebody has factually made a misrepresentation on a felony arrest," Assistant Attorney General Stephen Colgate said at a news conference today.
Today's findings mark the latest blow to the beleaguered immigration agency and its Citizenship U.S.A. program. The program was started in late 1995 to address a mounting backlog of citizenship applications, but Republicans contend that it has been hijacked by White House political operatives along the way for electioneering purposes.
Doris M. Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, issued a set of sweeping safeguards to prevent immigrants with criminal records from becoming citizens. But an independent review concluded in April that many of the agency's own employees had ignored the directives.
Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who has been the Administration's most severe critic on the citizenship issue, praised the immigration service today for "making good progress" in tracking down the scofflaws.
"The big question is, 'Is the I.N.S. going to be successful in correcting their mistakes, are they going to be successful in denaturalizing these roughly 5,000 individuals who were wrongly made citizens?' " Mr. Smith said.
In some cases, the offenses may be serious enough, such as a felony conviction for rape or murder, that an individual could have his citizenship revoked and be deported to his native country.
But lying under oath to an immigration examiner is not by itself a deportable offense, and in those circumstances a naturalized citizen would revert to a legal resident alien.
The immigration agency faces enormous hurdles in revoking the citizenship of the immigrants. In the 1995 fiscal year, the latest year for which figures are available, the agency revoked the citizenship of 20 people in procedures that typically took months to complete.
In the past few months, the immigration agency has adopted a simpler revocation process that no longer requires each case to go before a Federal court judge. Under the new system, an immigration administrative officer decides a revocation case; a defendant can appeal the decision to a Federal judge.
Carole Florman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the time to process each revocation case would depend on whether an individual contests the process, but could range from days to months.
As to when the nearly 5,000 revocation cases would be completed, Ms. Florman said, "I have no idea."
The immigration agency's general counsel, David Martin, is expected to provide to Congress on June 22 an approximate schedule of when the agency thinks it can complete the revocation proceedings, Ms. Florman said.
At that time, the immigration agency is also expected to ask for more money from Congress to hire additional lawyers and clerks to help deal with the sudden mountain of revocation proceedings.
Of the 4,946 problematic cases that the audit identified, 296 of the immigrants were convicted felons and 2,507 had lied about their criminal history and had a felony arrest or conviction that might have disqualified them from citizenship.
The remaining 2,143 will face revocation proceedings because they lied when asked whether they had ever been arrested, but had only minor offenses. If they had told the truth and said yes, their offenses would not have disqualified them or threatened their citizenship.
In addition to the nearly 5,000 immigrants who were wrongfully naturalized, the immigration agency has been trying to determine how many of the 180,000 people whose criminal backgrounds were never properly checked might have been wrongfully naturalized, too.
It is much harder to weed out the wrongfully made citizens in this group because in many cases, their applications were filled out improperly or the fingerprints that must accompany any application were illegible or missing.
So immigration officials, working with specialists from the accounting firm KPMG/Peat Marwick, have gone through a painstaking match of each individual's name against the Federal Bureau of Investigation's criminal data base.
This review turned up 9,100 people who had the same name as someone in the criminal data base. Whether they are one and the same person, and whether their offenses would disqualify them, is still under review.
The auditors are also reviewing the records of 300 newly naturalized citizens who were arrested on misdemeanors, such as prostitution, that could result in the revocation of their citizenship.

HEADLINE: Where 'Shine' Plays And Is Played Out;
Efforts to Aid Mentally Ill Result In Happy Ending for Movie House

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: WALTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
Walton's cherished old movie theater almost had the same rueful ending as the Texas theater in "The Last Picture Show," with a darkened screen taking another bite out of the spirit of a struggling country town.
But the story of Walton's theater has a happy ending because of an unlikely group of rescuers -- a mental health agency and five of its clients who now sell tickets and popcorn and help operate the projector. 
 They have made it possible for Walton's 3,500 residents to see movies like "Liar, Liar" and "101 Dalmatians," the same movies the rest of America is seeing. And the survival of weekend picture shows means the village and surrounding town, which are cut off from many modern pleasures by a ring of Catskills mountains, will keep its social center. Farmers, teachers and factory hands can go on greeting each other in the lobby with pleasantries about the weather; teen-agers can court in the balcony and younger children can have a chance to escape from the routines of small-town life.
"You lose your theater, it's like the last vestige of your sociability," said Andrea R. Paternoster, editor of The Delaware Register and Review, a local weekly. "To me it means you've given up as a town. You've given up any pretense of independence. You're leaving town to go shopping. You're leaving to go the movies. You're leaving to do virtually everything."
Although some civic leaders had misgivings about turning the theater over to a mentally ill staff last July, there are few complaints now, and Mayor Carl Vogel has become the theater's biggest booster.
"The operation is better than I ever remember it," he said. "From the service to the movies to the popcorn."
And the workers say they have found real benefits in dealing with the public.
At a midweek matinee 10 days ago, Theresa Seymour, 44, who suffers from the steep mood swings of bipolar illness, worked the concessions stand, trying to satisfy customers craving popcorn and sodas before the lights dimmed for the movie, "The Saint."
"There's seasoned salt on the table," she told one customer. "Help yourself."
"Thank you. Enjoy the show," she told another as she handed her change for a soda.
Ms. Seymour lives at home with her husband, Gerald, and two sons, Joel, 22, and Gerald Jr., 18. Trying to explain her illness, she said that as a child she was abused by her parents. Then, after she married, she lost a baby shortly after birth and the loss seemed to paralyze her, making her afraid to go out among people. She is happy, she said, that the theater job forces her to deal with the public.
"I'm growing from it," she said.
Walton is hidden away in a valley in the Catskills. Years of economic decline have given its main street the forlorn and faded look of the Texas town called Anarene in the Peter Bogdanovich movie "The Last Picture Show," about a desolate plains town in the 1950's sadly succumbing to the onrush of modern life.
Several stores in Walton's 19th-century utilitarian brick buildings stand empty, and, in those that remain, the merchandise is often shopworn and out of fashion. Though a large Kraft Foods cottage cheese plant employs 210 people, most young people leave to find work elsewhere.
Ambling through Walton, a fan of the Bogdanovich movie almost expects to see a tumbleweed come rolling down a windswept street.
There never was much to do in Walton by big-city standards. The movie theater, the bowling alley and the games of the high school football team, the Warriors, who won the state championship in their division in 1994, were about it.
The 600-seat movie house, though, was a particular treasure. It was built in 1914 with a neo-classical facade featuring four stout Doric columns. Teddy Roosevelt gave a speech at the theater, and it was a stop on the vaudeville circuit. It has been showing films since the heyday of silent movies, though television, videos and the increasing cost of tickets have put a dent in patronage in recent decades.
Last spring the latest operator of the movie theater -- an independent based in Oneonta, N.Y., -- gave up, and the village could not foresee finding a replacement. "Lights out at the Walton Theater," was the front-page headline in The Delaware Register and Review, and a sign on the theater's front door on April 1, 1996, thanked customers for their support.
A closed theater would have forced village residents who wanted to see a movie to drive 45 minutes across mountains to Oneonta. But the theater stayed shuttered for only a few weekends. On July 5, it reopened with the natural-disaster epic "Twister," and it has remained open for weekends and Wednesday matinees ever since.
The Walton Theater has been taken over by one of Walton's less publicized resources, Rehabilitation Support Services, a nonprofit agency that helps the mentally ill find housing and jobs and adapt to their communities. John Phillips, the agency's program director for Delaware County, said that the agency had already been operating a bagel shop in Oneonta for a few years and was looking for another business to employ its clients.
So when it heard about the closing of the local theater, it decided to make a bid to the village board. A couple of board members, Mr. Phillips said, wondered, "How can you have mentally ill people working with the public?" But Mr. Phillips argued that mental illness was not that different from other disabilities and that his clients could be trained to work with the public.
The agency worked out a deal to pay the town rent of $550 a month, the same as the previous operator. It purchased a new popcorn popper and replaced a Pepsi dispenser with a Coke fountain. It bought the projector and other equipment for roughly $4,000. Then it put its clients to work, paying them $4.75 an hour and outfitting them with crimson T-shirts and baseball-style caps advertising the movie theater.
Diane Fehsal, 39, runs the ticket booth. She has bipolar illness, which is also known as manic depression, and is on an antidepressant. Her four children live with her estranged husband. She has worked most of her adult life, she said, and finds it especially congenial to take movie tickets while a soundtrack drifts out of a darkened theater.
"It's the most fun for me because of the idea of going to the movies," she said. "The movie is always on. I like being around movies. And when I'm not working I get to go to the movies for free. I went to see 'Liar, Liar.' I was very tired and the more I got to thinking about it when I got home, I really laughed."
She describes seeing movies as a hobby, "something to get away from life in general, something that makes you laugh, especially with having a mental illness." But she avoids movies with violence and horrors.
"I've always been influenced by what I watch," she said. "I may have nightmares. The movies are pretty extreme."
Marjorie Johnson, 39, has been working with Stanton (Stub) Hogan, who has been projectionist at the theater since 1951. He has been teaching her how to splice movie reels and thread the film along the serpentine path of spools in a projector.
Ms. Johnson, a tall, friendly Brooklyn native who wears her red hair in a braided bun, also has bipolar disorder. She lives with her 4-year-old, Zachariah, in a trailer she rents outside town. Her 7-year-old son, Isaac, is in foster care. Over the years, she has worked as a chambermaid and landscaper, and she was dismissed from her last job as a hairdresser in Oneonta after a customer complained that her hair was cut too short.
Now, she is looking forward to operating the projector by herself.
"Hopefully, it's going to be a lifetime thing," she said. "I'll be like Stub when I get done."
Mr. Hogan, who is in his late 70's, thinks she can soon take his place. "She's doing pretty good," he said.
Don Furgeson, an agency counselor who supervises the operation, said that the theater expected to end its first year in the black and was investing its profit in a new retractable screen that would allow more space for live productions. On Thursday afternoon, the agency celebrated its first anniversary of running the theater, a tad early to be sure, with a free show, a raffle and a barbecue.
Appropriately, the movie was "Shine," the story of a mentally ill person who also manages to make a productive life for himself.

HEADLINE: A Question of Honor;
THE SUBVERSIVE

BYLINE: By Michael Lewis; Michael Lewis is a columnist for the Magazine. "Trail Fever," his book on the 1996 Presidential campaign, will be published next month by Knopf.

 BODY:
By the time Larry Pressler lost his Senate seat last November, he and Ernest Hollings were barely speaking. For most of the last Congress, the two Senators sat together during Commerce Committee hearings -- Pressler was the Republican chairman, Hollings the ranking Democrat -- doing their best to contribute to the general rancor. It was not a struggle for the fate of the earth; it was not really even a matter of principle; it was simple personal disdain, born of partisan suspicions. Hollings thought Pressler an incompetent fool; Pressler found Hollings overbearing. "The committee was the laughingstock of Washington, a mess," one senior staff member says. "Pressler had no control of things, and so Hollings rolled him every time."
After Pressler lost last year, even as the Republicans retained control of the Senate, the committee chairmanship fell to John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona. One morning in late February, McCain presided over an inquiry into the television ratings system. He sat at the center of the long curved wooden dais with an expression that alternated between the earnest interest of an elder statesman and the manic impatience of a 14-year-old boy. At one point, a staff member entered and whispered into his right ear and McCain rose to leave. A dozen times each day in Congress, a chairman leaves a committee hearing and passes off the gavel to a fellow party member -- who, in this case, was Conrad Burns, the Republican from Montana. But that morning McCain did something unusual; he handed the gavel to Hollings, the Democrat. A look of alarm crossed Hollings's face; he and McCain exchanged words. Then McCain moved quickly away and was gone before Hollings could fully adjust. 
 Two weeks later, when I asked Hollings what he had said when McCain handed him the gavel, the incident was still pleasantly fresh in his mind: "I said to him, 'John, I'd be delighted to take it, but some of your colleagues might object.' And John said, 'Screw that.' . . . I do admire that John McCain."
 
To Change the Nature of Public Life
 Russ Feingold was elected to the Senate as a Democrat from Wisconsin in 1992 and quickly made it clear that he was willing to be different. His quixotic, poorly funded Senate campaign had featured a list of pledges nailed to his garage door, which, when he arrived in Washington, he adhered to with the zeal of a man who had nothing to lose. "Senators are very good at delivering a message," he explains, by way of illustrating how difficult it is for a freshman Senator to challenge a senior Senator's God-given right to spend public money on his friends. "They'll come up to you in the cloakroom and say, 'What are you trying to do, ruin the Senate?' and then vanish. You never know whether they are kidding or if there is some bite to it." Feingold has no hard evidence that he has paid a price for his cause. On the other hand, he says, "I don't have a great deal of social contact with my colleagues."
After the 1994 elections, in which the Republicans recaptured the Senate, Feingold returned to Wisconsin. He was driving around his state, resigning himself to a future not merely as a social pariah but as a social pariah in the minority party. "Out of 100 Senators," he says, "I was now ranked No. 100." Then a member of his staff handed him a cell phone and said that John McCain was calling. Feingold didn't really know McCain and had no idea why he was phoning.
"This was not a time when a senior-ranking Republican typically would reach out to the lowest-ranking Democrat," Feingold says. "I mean, I was the last Democrat. There was nothing I could do for anybody. What did this guy want with me?"
What McCain wanted was first to compliment Feingold on his conduct over the past two years and then to talk about working together. What McCain was saying without putting it into words was: You are a Democrat, and we disagree on many issues, but we agree on something more important than those issues. Talk soon drifted to the role of money in politics. "What are the odds that a Republican Senator will come anywhere near my vision -- public financing of elections?" Feingold says he asked McCain. The reason no Republican would ever sign on to radical reform, as Feingold saw it, was that money helped Republicans to remain in office even more than it helped Democrats. Why would McCain act so obviously against his party's narrow interests? Why would he jeopardize his new authority?
But as it happened, McCain's ambitions exceeded Feingold's expectations. He had an entire reform agenda that, if enacted, would shatter Washington's political economy -- by limiting Congressional perks, cutting pork and barring retired members of Congress and certain members of their staffs from lobbying for five years. McCain also had the Ferret. The Ferret was the young man on McCain's Senate staff whose duties included sitting in the Senate and blowing the whistle on Senators who tried to slip pork into bills in the dead of night.
But more than any of these things McCain wanted to change the way politicians paid for their campaigns. Private money, he maintained, was corrupting public life. Total public financing of campaigns was out of the question -- McCain objected to the burden it would place on the Treasury -- but everything else was negotiable. As far as he was concerned, a McCain-Feingold bill needed only to pass two simple tests: 1) It must limit the influence of private money in public life. 2) It must reduce the financial advantage incumbents enjoy over challengers and thus make it easier for outsiders to get in and for insiders to be tossed out.
McCain and Feingold put together their bill two years ago, and at first it was something of a joke. "We were like the guys who introduced the bill to convert to the metric system," McCain says. But early this year the joke ceased to be funny. At last count there were 58 alternatives to McCain-Feingold, a lot of them dreamed up by Senators bent on derailing specific provisions of the bill. The details of these bills vary; the message is pretty much the same: Take away his money! Take his, not mine!
Senators tight with well-financed causes (pro-life, pro-guns, pro-trial lawyers, pro-women in Congress) want to ditch the McCain-Feingold ban on political action committees, through which particular causes reward Senators with contributions. Senators beholden to broadcasters object to the McCain-Feingold provision of free television ads to candidates who accept voluntary spending limits. Senators from small states decry the McCain-Feingold provision that requires politicians to raise 60 percent of their funds from people eligible to vote for them -- that would cut into their advantage in raising money from the causes and the corporations. The minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, for instance, who raises 88 percent of his money out of state, mainly from corporations and PAC's, has told fellow Senators that as written McCain-Feingold won't fly. He's for reform, of course. Just not this particular version.
Of course, all Democrats, including Daschle, claim publicly to support McCain-Feingold. Their enthusiasm derives from their certainty that Republicans will find a way to kill it. The single biggest edge Republicans hold over Democrats is the huge sums of money available to them for re-election campaigns. Nothing would blunt the Republican edge so quickly as the most ambitious provision in McCain-Feingold: a ban on soft money.
The phrase is a euphemism for donations that can be made without limit, through a loophole in the present laws, to the political parties and that then can be doled out, in large sums determined by a complicated formula, to individual candidates. People who set out to influence politicians run directly into the $1,000 limit on personal contributions; the limitlessness of soft money is thus crucial to them. It is also important to Republicans because they raise twice as much of it as Democrats. It is especially important to the majority leader, Trent Lott, because he exercises control over the small fortune given to Republican Senators like him. When Lott rose this February at a Republican Party fund-raiser for six-figure donors in Florida and declared that soft money was "the American way," he was merely sanctifying the source of his power.
McCain's ambition is outlandish: not to win a debate (there's no one to debate), or to cut a deal (there's no one to cut it with), but to create a climate of political opinion -- a national mood -- that will overwhelm the immediate interests of some of the shrewdest characters on the planet. The goal is not merely to take money out of politics but to change the nature of public life. "This is a very seductive kind of environment," McCain says. "You are here and you are called a Senator. You have an aura of infallibility. You develop a thing where you feel you really are different and should be treated differently. And live by a different set of rules."
At the moment, any sort of money reform appears unlikely, but that is true of all reform until the moment it occurs. "The model for this," McCain says, is the gift ban. This is the Senate rule McCain and Feingold pushed through two years ago limiting the value of gifts to Senators. "Everyone was against that, too. But when it came to the floor, they couldn't control it -- in that climate nobody wanted to be seen to be against it. It passed 98-0. If campaign finance reform passes, it will pass the same way." To an outsider, it seems strange that Senators could fight a reform nearly to the death and then cave in completely, but then an outsider could not possibly appreciate the importance to Senators of keeping up appearances. To most of them, the war over the role of money in politics is not a matter of principle but a dance between perception and reality.
And so if just a handful of Republicans join with Democrats to create a majority, every other Senator will follow. A small band of Republican Senators either have signed on (Fred Thompson) or have hinted they will sign on (Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, Sam Brownback) to reform. These politicians are organized not by common interest but by common sentiment, and McCain is not so much their leader as their inspiration. "Without McCain," says Ann McBride of Common Cause, the public interest group that has pushed hardest for campaign reform, "you could forget about it. With him, there is still a chance."
 
The Rise to Power of a Politician Who Lived Dangerously
 I had been following the 1996 Presidential campaign for three months when I first met McCain. He came as a bit of a shock. I was sitting in a private air terminal in Columbia, S.C., late one night waiting for Bob Dole's campaign plane to land when McCain ambled in, unescorted. This in itself was unusual: every big-time politician I had met over the prior months traveled with a posse of aides to rope him off from the world. McCain introduced himself without staring me in the eye meaningfully for 10 seconds, which was also unusual. But what was truly unnerving was that, even though he was a Dole backer, he violated the Dole campaign's three most sacred taboos: he praised Pat Buchanan, he called Ross Perot "a nut" and (the deepest heresy) he suggested that Dole should ignore his paid political operatives who were busy issuing anodyne statements on his behalf instead of letting the candidate speak openly for himself.
At the end of this astonishing monologue, I put down my notebook and tried to figure out what to do. A politician who lived dangerously! A politician who spoke his mind! It was all I could do to stop myself from shouting: Lie! Lie for your life! Lie or some journalist will take a quote from you and twist it around your neck! The man clearly needed to be protected.
It was then that I noticed the faint scar over McCain's right eye and asked him about it. "Oh," he said, "that was just a knife fight back in high school."
Just a knife fight?
With only the vaguest notion of who this man was, I took to following him around -- in the spirit of the beggar who looked for the loose change under the street lamp not because the money was there but because the light was better. It was hardly an original investigative strategy; every political journalist in America seemed to be mining McCain's indiscretions. Once I found myself sitting on the long leather couch in his Senate office watching McCain field calls from The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times and a gaggle of local Arizona reporters while in the background a television replayed over and again some diatribe he had just delivered in front of the White House. I became used to opening the morning paper and finding McCain's quotes on the front page and his opinions echoed on the editorial page. It was a testament to the growing distrust between the press and the more ordinary politicians. Here was a Republican Senator -- a red meat, pro-life, strong-army kind of guy -- and yet somehow he had become the preferred source of the putatively liberal media.
This paradox had a self-reinforcing logic to it. In the most recent Presidential campaign, for instance, all three major candidates dodged any media they hadn't paid for. Their terror of free talk (and honest scrutiny) led directly to a greater need for paid talk, in the form of television ads that spoke directly (and sometimes dishonestly) to the voters. The greater need for paid talk led to a greater demand for cash. And the greater demand for cash led to tycoons in the Lincoln bedroom and to Chinese arms dealers at a White House "coffee" and to even more distrust between the press and politicians. But it led also to the rise of campaign finance reform -- and with it John McCain.
Every day, the street lamp shone a bit more brightly, until it took in the main events of American politics. For most of his political life, Until early last year, McCain had been effective mainly on small-bore issues: the gift ban, returning power to Native American tribal government, protecting the Grand Canyon from further noise pollution. Then a year ago he pushed through the line-item veto. He had long had an interest in international affairs; but with Sam Nunn's decision not to seek re-election and then Bob Dole's retirement last June, McCain became one of the Senate's leading spokesmen on foreign policy. Last August, he narrowly missed being selected as Dole's Vice Presidential running mate before playing a starring role at the Republican convention in San Diego; after the fall election, he ascended to the chairmanship of the Commerce Committee and was dubbed by one of the broadcasting trade sheets "the most powerful man in American television." By sheer good fortune, I was witnessing up close a politician's rise. What McCain was up to, it turned out, was rising from prominence to power. But there was something odd about this politician: his rise through the power structure seemed merely to increase his desire to blow it apart.
You can tell a lot about a Senator by who finds it worth their time to visit him. There were days earlier this spring when the reception room of McCain's Senate office was jammed with Washington's version of political terrorists: people who wanted McCain to help them to park a 900-pound pig in front of the National Press Club to dramatize the problem of political pork (he did); people who wanted him to spend his vacation flying around the country insulting people who gave large sums of money to politicians (ditto); people who wanted him to declare war on the networks by insisting that the digital television spectrum be auctioned publicly rather than simply given away for free (he did and lost). Maybe a dozen times I turned up unannounced in McCain's office (he keeps the door open) and found him pacing back and forth behind his desk, ginning up trouble. "I knew there would be a scandal because I knew the system was out of control," he would be saying. "But I didn't know there would be a foreign money scandal." Or, "Both parties are equally guilty." Or, "We need to go outside the Beltway, and we need to go hard." Or, "I'll tell you when we'll know it's time: Trent Lott will come to me and say, 'O.K., let's bring the bill to the floor."'
You can also tell a lot about a Senator by what other Senators say about him when he's out of earshot. When I mentioned McCain's name to John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, for instance, he stopped the conversation cold and said: "That man did things for his country that few people could go through. Never forget that! And never forget that his tribal instincts do not overwhelm what he thinks is right and wrong." And when I asked Fred Thompson -- who will lead the Senate's hearings on campaign finance reform now scheduled for this summer -- whether McCain was a typical Senator, he nearly jumped through the telephone. "No, no no," he said. "He's an inspiration. It doesn't bother him to go against the grain. He feels just as strongly about how we do things, not just what we do." Before Thompson declared for his Tennessee Senate seat in 1994, he flew to Washington to talk to McCain, "to see whether or not any of this amounted to anything, whether or not it was worth it."
The unflattering view of McCain in the Senate is never offered for attribution, but it is easy to hear: that he is a creation of the media who exploits virtue for personal advancement. "What's in it for him?" is the question that lurks beneath the surface of the conversation of such Senators and their staffers. They view his desire for reform -- and his openness to the media -- as part of a cynical strategy for self-advancement. I was told more than once around the Senate that campaign finance reform is an issue McCain is seeking to ride to the White House. And, of course, there's no arguing with this line of thinking because McCain does benefit from his crusade -- reprters write about it, people care about it.
 
The Making of an Idealist
 Most Senators start out as junior-class president, shimmy their way into state legislatures or onto Senate staffs or maybe into the House, until finally their turn comes and they make a little death lunge for the big time. Occasionally, they have the passion of those who are called; more often, they have the feeling of those who suddenly can afford to move up in the world, like a Monopoly player who has landed on Park Place. But either way, they ascend to their positions, and the arc winds up defining them. When they die, they will be remembered chiefly for having been Senators.
McCain's path was different. Like Bill Bradley and John Glenn, he more or less descended into American Government: no matter what he does in the Senate, he will always be remembered chiefly for what he did before he became a Senator. But McCain differs in spirit even from the conventional heroes. From very early on, both Bradley and Glenn handled their careers with the most extreme caution; as they rose in life, both men seemed to keep politics in the back of their minds, or others, at any rate, kept politics in mind for them. McCain was a little darker and far messier: for most of his life, he seemed intent on proving that he'd never be elected to anything.
He finished 790th out of 795 in his Naval Academy class of 1958, where he set some sort of record for incurring the wrath of the authorities. On graduation, he became one of those Navy pilots who lurched from brawls to accidents to women and then back to brawls. Had he succeeded in killing himself in a Navy jet (as he nearly did twice), no one would have thought that it had any bearing on the future of American Government. Politics -- its obligations, its risk aversion, its sober responsibilities -- never crossed McCain's mind, at least not until he returned home from Vietnam. He was 37 years old, and every politician in America wanted to have his picture taken with him. Politics had found him, or at any rate his experience.
Public accounts of McCain's experience as a prisoner of war tend to focus on his physical toughness. Here is how Robert Timberg, in his gripping book "The Nightingale's Song," depicts McCain after two months in a North Vietnamese prison camp:
McCain weighed less than 100 pounds. His hair, flecked with gray since high school, was nearly snowwhite. Clots of food clung to his face, neck, hair and beard. His cheeks were sunken, his neck chickenlike, his legs atrophied. His knee bore a fresh surgical slash, his ankle an angry scar from the bayonet wound.
 His right arm, little more than skin and bone, protruded like a stick. But it was McCain's eyes that riveted [his cellmate, Bud] Day. "His eyes, I'll never forget, were just burning bright. They were bug-eyed like you see in those pictures from the Jewish concentration camps. His eyes were real pop-eyed like that. I said, 'The gooks have dumped this guy on us so they can blame us for killing him,' because I didn't think he was going to live out the day."
For nine days, McCain received no treatment for the injuries he sustained when he parachuted into a North Vietnamese mob: two broken arms, a shattered knee, a shattered shoulder and bayonet wounds in his ankle and his groin. He survived in captivity for the next five and a half years under constant, exquisite torture. His captors would hang him by his broken arms from dangling ropes for hours on end, for instance, the sort of stuff that even to read about causes sweat to pop out on your brow. But McCain's capacity to suffer was the least of what the experience revealed about him. The truly astonishing part of the story -- the moment where you cease cringing and go numb with wonder, when you, too, want to have your picture taken with McCain -- is that he did it . . . voluntarily.
McCain belongs to a distinguished military family; his father and grandfather are the only four-star father and son in United States military history, and his father was commanding the bombing of Hanoi at the time McCain's Navy fighter was shot down. The North Vietnamese planned for their famous P.O.W. to violate United States military policy, which dictated that prisoners return in the order they arrived. His early release might demoralize American troops, they figured. Except that he wouldn't go along. For five and a half years, they tortured McCain. For five and a half years, he refused to go home.
He had no choice in the matter, he later explained. To accept early release would have dishonored not only himself but his family. You just didn't do that.
When he did return home from Vietnam in 1973, McCain stepped into the arms of Republican America. He met President Nixon at the White House and Ronald Reagan, then the Governor of California, at a . Perhaps sensing a lobbying opportunity, the Navy named McCain its attache to the United States Senate. "I couldn't believe how much power a Senator could have," McCain says, by way of explaining why it dawned on him to become one. But it is easier to put the man into politics than to put the politics into the man. Just as others, including the Reagans, hoped he was grooming himself for political office, McCain ejected from his first marriage in a semipublic blaze of womanizing. In 1980, he married an Arizona native named Cindy Hensley. Two years later, having moved to Arizona, he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives.
McCain's early political career had the flavor of an arranged marriage: all that Arizona knew of McCain was his war record, but that was more than McCain knew of Arizona. "I got lost on the way to my own rallies," he says. But for so many reasons, none of this mattered, and one of those reasons was Charles Keating. Keating is the former owner of Lincoln Savings and Loan whose various machinations wound up costing the taxpayers more than $3 billion. He first offered McCain his political support in 1981, after a speech McCain gave in Phoenix at a Navy League dinner to which Keating had brought his family. A year later, McCain called him back. Together with friends and associates, Keating contributed $56,000 to McCain's first House race, another $56,000 to the second and $54,000 to his 1986 Senate campaign. Between 1983 and 1986, McCain and his family spent a week a year at Keating's vacation house in the Bahamas.
Of course, money in politics is rarely a direct bribe. Often, people give not because they expect anything in return but because they find it easier than not giving. When your biggest client calls you and asks you to contribute $1,000 to the Clinton campaign, you don't think much about it; you write the check. But Charlie Keating, it turned out, expected something in return. He expected McCain and others to pressure Federal regulators to look the other way while he played fast and loose with taxpayers' money.
All of this quickly came out when the story broke in early 1989 that McCain, together with four other Senators similarly favored by Keating -- Glenn, Donald Riegle of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Alan Cranston of California -- had gathered twice in 1987 to discuss Keating's complaint that he was being treated too harshly by Federal bank regulators. McCain was branded one of "the Keating Five" and dragged into a Senate investigation to determine exactly what he had done in exchange for Keating's money. When you go back over the Senate Ethics Committee hearings, which lasted 14 months, you see pretty clearly that he did surprisingly little. Both the committee and the transcripts are conclusive on this point. One incident in particular leaps out. When he saw that McCain would not interfere with the law on his behalf, Keating took to insulting McCain behind his back. Word got back to McCain that Keating had been all over the Senate calling him "a wimp." A McCain staff member who was present at a subsequent meeting between McCain and Keating recalled for the Senate Ethics Committee how it played out:
In all the time . . . I've been around John he, himself, although he will answer questions in response to his experience in Vietnam, I have never, except for this one occasion, heard him raise his prisoner-of-war experience. And very early on in that meeting, I remember him vividly telling Mr. Keating that he hadn't spent five and a half years of his life in a prisoner-of-war camp to have his courage or integrity questioned. And he gave Mr. Keating a dressing down, the likes of which I, in my experience on the Hill, have never experienced a Senator giving a major employer of his state. It was startling to me.
From that moment on, McCain had nothing more to do with Keating. And in the end the Senate Ethics Committee decided that McCain had done nothing seriously wrong. He was guilty only of "poor judgment." But the Senate Ethics Committee had long before lost its moral authority, and with it, its power to absolve anyone. Before the dust settled, a poll in The Arizona Republic would show that nearly half of all Arizona residents thought he should resign immediately or at the end of his term. More importantly, the motives behind his behavior would always be questioned. For example, in late 1989 McCain called Senator David Boren, an early leader on finance reform, to say that he would like to help. His offer was accepted, but no one doubted why he had made it. "McCain's only interest in a Boren bill," Boren's chief aide later wrote, "was to further distance himself from the Keating bombshell."
One of the traits McCain's staff finds most maddening in their boss is his tendency to recall for journalists only his most damning moments. Ask him about Vietnam and he'll tell you about the time he stole a washrag from the guy in the adjoining cell. Ask him about his first marriage and he'll leap right to his adultery. It was he who first mentioned Charles Keating to me. We were sitting together in the back seat of a car on the way to a fund-raiser for another candidate. McCain was flipping through an album of photographs taken during the Republican convention. The album was a Who's Who of Republican politics, and McCain seemed to be at the center of every picture. I made some comment about how much more valuable his time had become in just the few months since we had met in South Carolina. He fixed me with a stare. "One thing I learned from the Keating affair," he said, "was that this could all end tomorrow. Just like that." He snapped his fingers.
That is one kind of explanation of why he is so insistent on pressing his reform agenda: if he doesn't get it done now, he may never have another chance. But he quickly went on to saying something else, something demonstrating another motive. "You know," he said, "my honor and integrity were at stake in Vietnam when the Vietnamese offered me freedom. I was very tempted to take it. But when I didn't, it was over -- at least when the beatings stopped it was over. In the Keating scandal, my honor and integrity were at stake again: I was accused of betraying my oath of office. I've never been able to explain very clearly how I felt. How painful it was. And, by the way, I did wrong. I shouldn't have attended that meeting. But I don't think I'll ever be absolved. I'll always be known as one of the Keating Five."
 
The Realist
 We tend to assume that the trait that most clearly defines a politician is his party affiliation rather than, say, his temperament or life experience. But it is hard to imagine a man more different in this respect from John McCain than Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, his fellow Republican Senator. McConnell has sought and gained precisely those positions that give him the power to block McCain's reform agenda. As chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, for instance, he successfully stymied the investigation of Bob Packwood. Twice he tried and failed to win the chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which controls the tens of millions of dollars the party spends on their own. Last year he finally won the post, which gives him control over the money his colleagues need for re-election. In a meeting with the Republican leadership earlier this year, called to discuss the McCain-Feingold bill, McConnell reportedly said, "if we stop this thing, we can control the institution for the next 20 years."
It's one thing for a Senator to work behind closed doors to preserve his job and perks even when there is an overwhelming public objection to his doing so. It's quite another for a Senator to summon the nerve to go to the Senate floor and defend the role of big money in politics. But that is what McConnell has done. One morning in March, McConnell staged what must rank among the more audacious and brave news conferences ever held. He gathered together representatives of a dozen special interest groups that had banded together to fight campaign finance reform: the National Rifle Association, the Christian Coalition, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Association of Realtors, the American Civil Liberties Union. (The list is strikingly similar to the list of names John Glenn has submitted for subpoenas in the campaign finance probe soon to be conducted by the Government Affairs Committee.)
Perhaps 60 reporters found their seats as McConnell moved to a bank of microphones. There is something old-fashioned about his appearance. A high pink tints his soft fleshy cheeks and his lips are pursed in a way that suggests perpetual disapproval. Beside him was a placard bearing the words of the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, and his disapproval's immediate source:
 What we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy. You can't have both.
The text served as the keynote for McConnell's address, in which he came down firmly on the side of free speech. His approach was to steamroller his audience with his superior knowledge of the relevant Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, in 1976. "How many of you have actually read the Buckley case?" he asked. Two hands rose -- not enough to stop him -- and before long McConnell was saying things like "soft money is just a euphemism for free speech." At length, McConnell finished, and one by one the lobbyists took turns at the podium decrying this threat to their First Amendment rights. Thirty minutes later, they were through, and an uncomfortable hush descended upon the room. A single hand finally went up at the front of the room. Ed Chen of The Los Angeles Times had a question.
"I'm trying to understand," he said. "Would any of you like to see any change in the system?"
The room went silent again; the lobbyists shifted back and forth; the portrait of George Washington stared down upon the proceedings; the crystal chandeliers hung ponderously from their hoary chains; the oak paneling creaked. At times like these, it's left for the architecture alone to give politics any aura of credibility.
"Next question," McConnell said.
The more you watch McConnell at work, the more you can see that it isn't only a bill at stake but an attitude toward public life. He is as pure an expression of political realism as McCain is of political idealism. The realistic view of politics these days runs something like this: the guy with the most money gets the power and the guy with the most power wins. McConnell won his Senate seat in 1988 with an expensive negative advertising campaign aimed at the incumbent, Dee Huddleston. Money has been his organizing principle ever since, which is why he went to such great lengths to get his hands on the Republican Party's senatorial war chest. His most lethal weapon against finance reform is not the First Amendment, though it is true that the best way to kill an issue is to complicate it. His most lethal weapon is the narrow interest of his fellow Senators, coupled with the public apathy that enables them to act on it. (A recent New York Times/CBS poll showed, for instance, that while 90 percent of the electorate say that money is corrupting politics, only 23 percent expect Congress to do anything about it.) "There is absolutely no chance that McCain-Feingold will become law," McConnell often declares. And when he does, you know that he knows things about his colleagues that you and I never will.
 
Building a Fire
 Next to McConnell, McCain appears naive - and doomed. One evening I left his office and went immediately next door to see the senior Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe. I was following up on a rumor that Snowe -- like her Maine colleague, Susan Collins -- was one of the Senators on whom McConnell, on behalf of the Republican leadership, paid a vaguely threatening call. At a time when McCain-Feingold needed Republican support, Snowe was an obvious candidate to provide it, since Maine had just passed strict new state campaign finance rules. When I laid out the story and asked her why she hadn't joined in, she said, "John never asked me." This was disingenuous but also extraordinary. When I asked McCain why he hadn't applied the sort of pressure on his colleagues that the other side had, he said: "I'm not good at asking people for things. If she wants to co-sponsor the bill, she will co-sponsor the bill."
There's vanity in his approach, but there's also an acknowledgment that if he sinks to the level of his opponent he undermines the source of his power. The source of McCain's power is not the money he can provide fellow Senators for their re-election campaigns but public opinion. He doesn't need to ask Snowe for her help because he knows his only hope for it is to light a fire under Maine that will have her running to join his cause. After all, the gift ban passed the Senate only because the public became enraged. "Once it gets to the Senate floor," McCain says of the finance reform bill, "it may be hard for anyone to control it."
In mid-March, the Senate Republicans met for lunch to discuss the probe into Clinton's campaign finance scandal. Republicans, led by McConnell, wanted to limit Fred Thompson, chairman of the investigating committee, to examining only illegal campaign activities. The Democrats hoped to widen the probe to include "improper" activities as well and to implicate Republicans and Democrats alike, thereby lessening the heat on President Clinton. Trent Lott told his fellow Republicans that their vote against the Democratic proposal was "a test of party loyalty."
"The thing you have to remember," McCain often says to explain why he likes and admires Lott, "is that Trent Lott only came to the Senate eight years ago. And now he is the most powerful man in Washington." But after Lott spoke that day at lunch, McCain rose and said he could not go along. How in good conscience could one refuse the chance to investigate what is obviously improper? McCain was quickly followed by Fred Thompson, who concurred. Thompson was followed by Arlen Specter, then Susan Collins, then Dan Coates and then Olympia Snowe. Just a month before, it had been unthinkable that this many Republicans would defy the leadership on this issue. But the nearly daily revelations of campaign finance scandals turned up the heat. Eventually, Lott realized that he had a full-scale rebellion on his hands and conceded the point.
Afterward, McCain told me that a broad public investigation of both parties was campaign finance reform's only hope. I asked him if it bothered him that President Clinton's authority was certain to be undermined by the scandal. Clinton has declared himself an ardent supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill, and so his authority is useful to McCain. "I'd rather have the scandal than his support," McCain said. The statement says as much about the way the political world now functions as anything I've heard: what happens to Clinton is more useful than any positive action Clinton could achieve. "If it happens," says McCain of reform, "it will happen for the wrong reasons."
 
Politics Is Not Life
 One morning not long ago, just after 7, I met McCain at his Senate office. The rest of the Senate was still asleep; the typical Senate staffer, knowing that his day might not end until well past 8, doesn't wander into his office until 9:00. But half a dozen of McCain's closest aides already were working. McCain looked as if he'd had a bad night, and with reason. "I woke up at 3 in the morning and stared at the ceiling about this McConnell thing," he said.
The previous night, an Administration aide had told McCain that he -- the aide -- was scheduled to appear the following morning before a Senate subcommittee headed by Mitch McConnell. He had been told that McConnell planned to grill him about a political trip McCain took last fall to Burma. In exchange for letting McCain pay a call on the Burmese dissident Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest, the Burmese Government required the presence of the other opposition parties. The United States charge d'affaires agreed to the conditions and McCain went off to Burma. But among the opposition, it turned out, were several drug traffickers. The question McConnell intended to put to the White House man was, "What was John McCain doing in the same room in Burma with these notorious international drug dealers?"
On the one hand, it was a trivial thing. It's possible that McConnell meant nothing by it, that his target was the White House and that he merely forgot to warn McCain. On the other hand, there is no better way to stop reform than to discredit the reformer.
By 7:30 we were on the road, and McCain was reminiscing about his early political career. When he was elected to the House in 1982, he said, he was "a freshman right-wing Nazi." But his visceral hostility toward Democrats generally was quickly tempered by his tendency to see people as individuals and judge them that way. He was taken in hand by Morris Udall, the Arizona Congressman who was the liberal conscience of the Congress and a leading voice for reform. (Most famously -- and disastrously for his own career -- Udall took aim at the seniority system that kept young talent in its place at the end of the dais. "The longer you're here, the more you'll like it," he used to joke to incoming freshmen.)
"Mo reached out to me in 50 different ways," McCain recalled. "Right from the start, he'd say: 'I'm going to hold a press conference out in Phoenix. Why don't you join me?' All these journalists would show up to hear what Mo had to say. In the middle of it all, Mo would point to me and say, 'I'd like to hear John's views.' Well, hell, I didn't have any views. But I got up and learned and was introduced to the state." Four years later, when McCain ran for and won Barry Goldwater's Senate seat, he said he felt his greatest debt of gratitude not to Goldwater -- who had shunned him -- but to Udall. "There's no way Mo could have been more wonderful," he says, "and there was no reason for him to be that way."
For the past few years, Udall has lain ill with Parkinson's disease in a veterans hospital in Northeast Washington, which is where we were heading. Every few weeks, McCain drives over to pay his respects. These days the trip is a ceremony, like going to church only less pleasant. Udall is seldom conscious, and even then he shows no sign of recognition. McCain brings with him a stack of newspaper clips on Udall's favorite subjects: local politics in Arizona, environmental legislation, Native American land disputes, subjects in which McCain initially had no particular interest himself. Now, when the Republican Senator from Arizona takes the floor on behalf of Native Americans, or when he writes an op-ed piece arguing that the Republican Party embrace environmentalism, or when the polls show once again that he is Arizona's most popular politician, he remains aware of his debt to Arizona's most influential Democrat.
One wall of Udall's hospital room was cluttered with photos of his family back in Arizona; another bore a single photograph of Udall during his season with the Denver Nuggets, dribbling a basketball. Aside from a Congressional seal glued to a door jamb, there was no indication what the man in the bed had done for his living. Beneath a torn gray blanket on a narrow hospital cot, Udall lay twisted and disfigured. No matter how many times McCain tapped him on the shoulder and called his name, his eyes remained shut.
A nurse entered and seemed surprised to find anyone there, and it wasn't long before I found out why: almost no one visits anymore. In his time, which was not very long ago, Mo Udall was one of the most-sought-after men in the Democratic Party. Yet as he dies in a veterans hospital a few miles from the Capitol, he is visited regularly only by a single old political friend, John McCain. "He's not going to wake up this time," McCain said.
On the way out of the parking lot, McCain recalled what it was like to be a nobody called upon by a somebody. As he did, his voice acquired the same warmth that colored Russell Feingold's speech when he described the first call from John McCain. "When you called Feingold . . ." I started to ask him. But before I could, he interrupted. "Yeah," he says, "I thought of Mo." And then, for maybe the third time that morning, McCain spoke of how it affected him when Udall took him in hand. It was a simple act of affection and admiration, and for that reason it meant all the more to McCain. It was one man saying to another, We disagree in politics but not in life. It was one man saying to another, Party political differences cut only so deep. Having made that step, they found much to agree upon and many useful ways to work together. This is the reason McCain keeps coming to see Udall even after Udall has lost his last shred of political influence. The politics were never all that important.

RUSSIA
 People and Empire, 1552-1917.
 By Geoffrey Hosking.
 Maps. 548 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 The collapse of the Soviet Union -- the last of the European empires -- has stimulated keen interest in the subject of Russian national identity. Britain, France and the other Western powers surrendered their colonies with varying degrees of good grace. If they resisted decolonization, it was to retain valuable economic and strategic assets. But their ultimate loss did not affect the way these onetime imperial powers viewed themselves, because their ethnic identity had been formed long before they acquired any colonies.
Russia was different. The separation in 1991 of the 15 so-called union republics not only reduced its population by nearly one-half but transformed it, for the first time since the 16th century, into an ethnically homogeneous country in which Russians, who had constituted around 50 percent of the Soviet population, make up 83 percent of the inhabitants.
Their predicament results from the fact that unlike the English, who never confused themselves with their Indian subjects, or the French, who remained French even as they lorded it over Algeria, Russians never drew a clear distinction between themselves as a nation and as an imperial power. This was partly because their empire grew at the same time as their national state, and partly because their colonial possessions lay not overseas but along Russia's land frontiers. As Geoffrey Hosking, the Professor of Russian History at the University of London, explains in the introduction to "Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917," "There are two kinds of Russianness, one connected with the people, the language and the pre-imperial principalities, the other with the territory, the multinational empire, the European great power." The first kind is rendered by the term russky, the second by rossiisky -- a distinction impossible to translate but not unlike that distinguishing "English" from "British."
The loss of empire has left many Russians bewildered because their view of themselves as a nation had been intimately connected with their self-image as a great imperial power. It has revealed how weakly developed is the Russians' sense of national identity. Mr. Hosking attributes that weakness to imperialism overwhelming nationhood in Russia's history. Or, as he puts it in explaining the objective of his book, he is seeking to demonstrate "how the building of an empire impeded the formation of a nation." Paraphrased, this means that Russians have difficulty feeling Russian unless they rule others.
The problem Mr. Hosking raises is not new, but he is the first to explore it in depth. Because the subject is embedded in the entire past of Russia, much of his book has slight bearing on the subject at hand and turns into a straightforward account of Russia's political, social and cultural history from the birth of the Russian empire under Ivan the Terrible until the Revolution of 1917.
Following a survey of Russia's territorial expansion and absorption of many European and Asian ethnic groups, the author proceeds to a description of the Russian state. He explains the highly centralized and autocratic nature of the Muscovite regime by the "patrimonial outlook" that placed the "lands and people . . . completely at the disposal" of the ruler, with the result that society, being "structured for service to the state," failed to acquire an independent existence. It is an interpretation with which I am in full agreement: the Weberian concept of patrimonialism, under which the state treats the realm as property and assigns its subjects no rights but only duties, has always seemed to me the best explanation of the course of Russian history.
In the middle section, Mr. Hosking examines imperial Russia's social classes, religion and culture. It is not always clear what bearing the descriptions of such groups as the nobility or the army have on the subject of nation building, but they are interesting in themselves, being well informed and lucidly presented. The chapter on the peasantry, however, which at one time constituted over 80 percent of the population, does bring out clearly how their confinement to the "rural ghetto," where they lived as serfs of the state or its nobility, prevented them from feeling themselves members of a nation. Such loyalty to a larger group as they managed to develop was confined to the community of Orthodox believers. Mr. Hosking castigates the Orthodox Church, however, for its dependence on the state and its failure to socialize peasants.
The true founders of Russian national consciousness, Mr. Hosking says, were the writers and intellectuals who emerged as an independent force in the second quarter of the 19th century and assumed the role of spokesmen for the mute masses. It is they who created the modern Russian language and literature, along with the ideologies that whether radical or conservative, gave educated Russians a sense of common destiny. I believe Mr. Hosking overstates the patriotism of Russian writers like Turgenev and Tolstoy, for they rather scorned its common manifestations. But he is correct in saying that as a result of the writers' achievement, "by the end of the 19th century, a genuine Russian nation was beginning to take shape, though only as yet in the form of a reading public, an 'imagined community.' "
The concluding part of the book deals with the turbulent period of reforms, counterreforms and revolutionary upheavals. Defeat in the Crimean War (1854-56) persuaded the conservative monarchy that it could not aspire to the status of a great power without bridging the gap between the state and society. The emancipation of the serfs, along with the introduction of a modern judiciary system and of local self-government boards in the 1860's, contributed to the strengthening of national bonds. So did the constitutional regime inaugurated, under revolutionary pressure, in 1905-6, especially when headed by Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who made a conscious effort to involve a larger proportion of the people in the political process and transform the monarch from a remote, bureaucratic head of state into a leader of the nation.
But even so, the links that led to the temporary bonding of Russian society at the outbreak of World War I or after the collapse of czarism in 1917 were not strong enough to prevent Russia's disintegration and the assumption of power by a Bolshevik dictatorship, "a new kind of imperial regime," which "rested on nothing more substantial than its own internal discipline." In the civil war, which decided Russia's fate for most of the 20th century, patriotic appeals by White generals fell on deaf ears while Bolshevik calls for the seizure of private property found wide resonance.
DOES it matter in an age when the world seeks to transcend nationalism that Russians have failed to develop a strong sense of nationhood? Indeed it does. Such a development "would have made their evolution less unstable, polarized and violent. . . . The nation-state has proved to be the most effective political unit . . . because it is the largest one compatible with creating and sustaining a feeling of community and solidarity, such as induces loyalty and reduces the need for coercion."
This means that the Russians of today would be well advised to give up fantasies of reconquering their lost empire -- fantasies common to both conservatives and democrats -- and concentrate on building a genuine nation-state. Nationalism, defined as "a feeling of community and solidarity," which the West has put behind itself and which it has turned into a reactionary doctrine, is distinctly progressive at the stage of history at which Russia happens to find itself.

Flying Into Sarajevo: Possible, but Not Easy

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO

 BODY:
EVEN though the Bosnian war has been over for more than a year, there is still something faintly incongruous about the idea of taking a scheduled flight into Sarajevo -- a city associated for many people with spiraling descents from the air by military transport planes, sniper fire on the streets and danger.
Yet since last fall Croatia Airlines has been flying twice-daily flights by propeller-driven airplanes from Zagreb, and earlier this year Austrian Airlines became the first Western European airline to schedule services from Vienna. 
 That being said, the Sarajevo schedules are erratic and still provide something of a frisson if only because the civilian airplanes that now compete with military planes for Bosnia's airspace fly under what aviators call visual flight regulations -- meaning that if the pilots can't physically see the runway to land, they don't fly to Sarajevo.
On one recent trip to the Bosnian capital, that made for a jagged kind of journey for a reporter who took off from Cologne airport in Germany with a confirmed ticket on Austrian Airlines to Vienna and Sarajevo, only to find, in Vienna, that the Austrian Airlines staff had just announced the cancellation of the onward flight.
Bad weather was the given reason. Snow on the runway, one Austrian Airlines official told the huddle of passengers clamoring around the check-in desk.
But there was an alternative. A flight to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, was about to board. And from Zagreb there were scheduled flights on Croatia Airlines the following day.
This is not the kind of travel easily accomplished on a tight budget, because the air fares are steep in the first place ($610 for a round-trip economy ticket from Cologne on Austrian Airlines, $250 round trip for the short hop between Zagreb and Sarajevo) and an overnight halt in Zagreb meant an unscheduled hotel stopover, not to mention the ludicrously overpriced cab fares between Zagreb airport and the downtown area (around $35 to $40 for a run that takes half the time of J.F.K. to Manhattan).
Neither is it the kind of travel for those who love their sleep. The wake-up call the next morning came at 4 A.M. because the Croatia Airlines flight to Sarajevo was leaving at 5:40 A.M. -- except that it didn't, but travelers had to get to the airport first to learn of the cancellation.
"Bad weather in Sarajevo. We wait," said a somewhat surly Croatia Airlines officer at around 5 A.M. By 6 the flight had been canceled, and passengers had rebooked on the 12:55 P.M.
Back to the hotel. Back to bed. Then back to the airport at noon. And -- presto -- the flight was on.
It is only a short hop, perhaps 45 minutes as opposed to a drive that can take anything up to seven hours. But, that April noon, it was the kind of flight to concentrate the mind, despite the assurances of people in Zagreb that the Croatia Airlines pilots know the terrain and the conditions better than anyone else.
"If they don't want to fly, neither do you," said one American expatriate in the Croatian capital.
The twin-engine airplane sped skyward and almost immediately was in cloud that provided an occasional earthward glimpse of a snowscape covering the former killing grounds of Croatia and Bosnia. Then the cloud closed in for good, which was fine while the airplane was cruising -- with all the courtesies of cabin service and coffee -- but not so fine when it started to lose altitude on a final approach that still did not reveal a glimpse of the runway.
The passengers, many of whom seemed to be business types seeking a fast buck in Sarajevo's freewheeling black market economy, were uncannily quiet, and at least one of them was trying to remember geography -- how high was Mount Igman, the mountain overlooking Sarajevo? What other heights stood on the approach line? Finally, though, the questions were answered. The airplane dropped from the clouds. Mount Igman was somewhere off and above to the right, its snowbound summit shrouded in the murk the plane had just left. The landing was smooth as silk in a city still partly in bombed-out ruins.
The airport itself was a war-battered monument to the siege of Sarajevo, with shell-pocked buildings and one passenger walkway leaning crazily out from the half-lighted main terminal toward a runway dotted with military installations. Then came a ride into town past gaping, gutted houses on the former front line.
Even today, driving along the broad boulevard between Communist-era high-rises, it is all too easy to recall that those high buildings gave cover for the snipers who, in turn, created the deathtrap known as Sniper's Alley. And lest anyone think Bosnia is even close to a normal kind of life, my hotel -- the downtown Hotel Bosnia -- insisted on cash settlement in German marks, the principal currency, of the exorbitant $180 a night it charged for a modest room.
For the return journey to Croatia, the passenger who had pondered geography from the air took a sudden interest in the terrestrial, found a friend with a Land Rover and drove back to Zagreb.

HEADLINE: The View From: New Haven;
Day Care: What Works, What's Needed

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
IS Calvin Hill (a) the name of a former Dallas Cowboy running back (b) the father of Grant Hill of the Detroit Pistons basketball team or (c) the name of a 26-year-old day care center at Yale University in New Haven?
The answer is all of the above. 
Calvin Hill, the father of the basketball player, lent his name to the child care establishment years ago when his Yale classmate Kurt Schmoke, now Mayor of Baltimore, asked him to.
And alumni of all ages remain a loyal constituency.
Katie Halleck, 8 years old and now a third grader at Beecher Road School in Woodbridge, reminisced: "When I was younger I went to Calvin Hill every morning. I used to go to the corner to see my friend Adam. We liked the monkey bars best and meeting time." Meeting, when the children at the center may discuss whatever is on their minds, continues to be a favorite time for the youngsters.
Carla Horwitz, director of the center for more than 20 years, said, "We believe in solving problems. We help them find their own voice, negotiate and solve problems without violence. The way to do that is to model that behavior for children and help them when they feel overwhelmed. Words are the thing you want them to begin to use and make work for them because words are very powerful."
She recalled that during the Persian Gulf war the children were worried they might not be safe. During meeting time one 5-year-old asked, "Why don't they use their words?"
Calvin Hill has a complex mission: to provide intellectual, social and emotional care and make it all fun. "We want our school to serve as a bridge between home and school. We feel like family," Ms. Horwitz said. "Kids learn to take care of each other." They learn cooperation, not competition.
"We listen to the kids, pay attention to their wishes and design the curriculum based on their interests and what they already know," she said. "We believe in doing what's best for the children, which may not always be best for the parents" -- or the staff, for that matter.
For example, Calvin Hill's program runs from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. or, with special arrangements, a bit later. "I feel a little bit like a dinosaur," said Ms. Horwitz, "Society makes so many demands on parents. It used to be unusual for a child to be here from 8 until 5 P.M. Now all over the country that is the norm. Parents are asking for us to remain open later than that or earlier than that or more time than that. People used to leave at 3 or 3:30 P.M. or whenever they could get away."
Parents are enthusiastic in their praise of the center.
Melanie Ginter, a psychotherapist who lives six blocks away and is expecting a baby in June, sometime joins her daughter, Natalie, for lunch. "I feel very welcome," she said. "We love it. There is support here for parents."
Ms. Horwitz, like many professionals in her field, is deeply concerned about what she sees as a two-tiered day care system."There are those who can afford quality day care and those who cannot, who receive abysmal care," she said. She is especially troubled by some for-profit care. "It can look okay on the surface but when you look deeper you find high staff turnover and untrained people." At Calvin Hill, she sets salary and benefits high enough to keep staff members, and treats them like professionals, not baby sitters, she said.
"There is so much bad child care that when I see a place like Calvin Hill I rejoice," said Prof. Edward F. Zigler, Sterling professor of psychology and a founder of the Head Start program during the Nixon Administration. "I like their economic and ethnic diversity, their sensitivity to a developmentally advanced curriculum," he said.
Dr. Zigler also suggested that the measure of a successful day care center would be a child's reluctance to leave at the end of the day. "They love being there so much they are too busy to go home," he said.
Calvin Hill houses programs for 3- and 4-year-olds as well as the Kitty Lustman-Findling Kindergarten. The two programs share an old brick firehouse donated and renovated by Yale, which pays the center's utilities. The Yale Child Study Center also recently gave Calvin Hill a grant to support the creation of a formal internship program.
The Calvin Hill center began as a student effort to support striking Yale employees who could not find affordable day care for their children. Today 75 percent of the center's children come from Yale families with the rest drawn from the city. Families are charged on a sliding scale, ranging from $1,280 a year up to $9,224.
John Cafferty, a teacher there for 23 years, says one secret to Calvin Hill's success has been the intense involvement of parents. It is not unusual to find a Yale-New Haven Hospital neurosurgeon scrubbing little toilets next to a Korean graduate student. Parent architects planned the renovation from firehouse to school. Another parent group designed and constructed the playground.
"This is the most rewarding job. When the kids smile it makes my day," Mr. Cafferty said. In return, teachers never talk down to the children, but treat them as just people.
Mr. Cafferty, who said he briefly considered following the family tradition of working on the railroad, expressed fondness for his co-workers. "The staff does a lot for each other. Everyone brings a different strength." He also appreciates the team teaching approach, high degree of teacher autonomy and the opportunity for staff development.
The walls are covered with artwork and projects and photographs of busy youngsters at play. They dress up in firefighter's boots and hats or long shiny dresses and feather boas for dramatic plays and create fanciful stories. They earnestly tap maple trees across the street to make syrup. They draw and paint and mess around with clay. They choose vegetables to make natural dyes, dye yarn and learn simple weaving techniques. They take field trips to a museum, a pumpkin field, a weaver's studio. They chat with Cocoa and Piggy Pig, the upstairs and downstairs gerbils. They learn to count and sing the alphabet and some even begin to read. They also nap to recharge their batteries for more activities. "I like nap best," said 5-year-old Bailey Hanum of New Haven much to the astonishment of her teachers.
Libby Rinder, also 5, of Guilford, adores the recycling truck that picks up paper, plastic and metal. The driver always beeps hello to the children.
A 4-year-old from Israel named Noam spends his time with his buddies, Earl, David and Nick. His observations on his parents' employment stand out on a large wall poster: "My Mom works with neighbors. She's got a new job now. She talks. My Dad works with mice."
"Everything they learn is as important as everything else. Reading is not the only thing," explained Ms. Horwitz. Children, she said, must have "opportunities to explore an their own level."
Thus, neither mindless worksheets or teacher-directed drills ever happen at Calvin Hill. She feels preschool is a place where children begin to make sense of their world and begin to form friendships and learn to become a part of the larger community outside their own families.

HEADLINE: ART;
An Art World Emerging Into the Cuban Sun

BYLINE: By EDWARD M. GOMEZ; Edward M. Gomez, a contributing editor of Art & Antiques, writes frequently on Latin American modern art.

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THE PASSAGEWAY IS LONG and narrow, its thick outer wall pierced by a row of lookout slits for riflemen, the opposite wall leaning oddly inward, like a side of a gravity-defying fun-house cabin. Posters of a blindfolded man juxtaposed with pictures of tanks, baby dolls, waterfalls and sunsets line this awkwardly angled stone surface that a visitor fingers gingerly for support before emerging from the cool darkness into the bright inner court and the heavy heat of another Havana morning.
Here, a sign inside the massive Castillo del Morro, the 16th-century, Spanish-built fortress overlooking the Bay of Havana, announces this year's sixth Bienal de la Habana, a survey of contemporary art from the Americas, Europe and Africa that sprawls through several locations in the Cuban capital. 
 The show had already begun dramatically in the entrance tunnel, of course, with the Brazilian artist Claudio Goulart's posters from a series of Orwellian images called "The Toys." Now, through a portal, more work comes into view. There are the full-size metal figures by the Nigerian Sokari Douglas Camp, sculptures inspired by African ritual masks. And there is the monumental "Boat" by the young Havana artist Kcho, an exuberant but unsettling floor-to-ceiling pileup of bottles, tables, wood scraps and a rowboat that unabashedly alludes to the pack-up-and-go fantasies of would-be Cuban emigrants.
"Thank our soldiers here at the fort for helping to make this stimulating show possible," says Llilian Llanes Godoy, the Havana biennial's organizing-committee president, savoring the irony of presenting so much provocative material in a bastion of military might. "Normally we use the National Museum of Fine Arts, but it's closed for renovation, and we couldn't have done it without this facility." Other sites include the army-controlled Fortaleza de la Cabana nearby and the architecturally rich Old Havana district.
Perhaps overshadowed by Cuban music, which has long been this country's most accessible cultural export, the biennial has provided a considerable opening for local artistic expression since it began in 1984, with Cuban artists often addressing sensitive themes like emigration and economic hardship. Indeed, the event has helped lift a new generation of Cuban art makers out of isolation while also becoming a major showcase for contemporary art from Latin America and the world's developing regions. Visitors from Europe, South America and even the United States, despite travel restrictions for Americans, now attend the biennial in increasing numbers. And many American and foreign publications send reporters to cover it.
The 1997 biennial, which features 177 artists from 44 countries and runs through the end of the month, comes at a time when international awareness of Cuba's severe problems is growing and the market for Latin American art is more active than ever. This week in New York, for example, collectors from around the world will vie for works by the respected Cuban modernists Wilfredo Lam and Amelia Pelaez at Sotheby's, while Christie's will offer three definitive paintings by Ignacio Iturria, the important Uruguayan painter-sculptor, in the annual springtime Latin American art auctions.
Art-world habitues note that unlike its more famous, better-financed and traditionally more contentious counterparts in Venice and Sao Paulo, Havana's still-young biennial makes up in high spirits and unpredictable freshness what it sorely lacks in money or manpower.
"Our budget is practically nonexistent," says Ms. Llanes Godoy, an architectural historian who is also the founder and director of Havana's Wilfredo Lam Center, a Government-backed gallery focusing on Cuban, Latin American and third-world artists. The center serves as mission control for Havana's biennial bash.
"Today, with shortages abounding," Ms. Llanes Godoy adds, "Cubans have become masters in the everyday art of scrounging and making do. We welcome donations and volunteers. This year, one Ministry of Culture allocation totaled $20,000, but it immediately went to pay for the flurry of faxes between our offices and participating artists' countries. We still can't say how much this will all cost, because in this economy it's impossible to calculate."
MONEY WAS SO SHORT that many of the participating artists, who were chosen by a curatorial committee, stayed with Cuban families while setting up their works. And the event's hefty catalogue was paid for by the Paris-based Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, a partly public, partly French Government-financed organization that primarily promotes French culture abroad.
The art at the Castillo del Morro has been gathered under the heading "Faces of Memory," while works at the Fortaleza de la Cabana are grouped under the title "Interior Enclosures." Other presentations at various sites in Old Havana, including the Wilfredo Lam Center, the Colonial Museum and the Fototeca de Cuba, are united under the title "Collective Memories." Yet the themes overlap in many of the artists' works.
Throughout the show, too, the preferred modes of expression are documentation and installation, or so-called environmental art. The two central themes are the search for personal identity, especially with regard to cultural and social definitions of it, as well as the individual's place in history.
"I want my countrymen to confront the historic and everyday reality of violence in Argentine society," says Oscar Bony, 55, a Buenos Aires-based artist who is showing "Gunshots and Suicides," a series of large black-and-white photographs of families, marching workers and himself, both as a boy and as an adult, each photograph riddled with bullet holes.
"To make each piece, I used the same firearms cited in news reports of suicides or killings," Mr. Bony explains. "Some viewers are repelled. In them, others recognize references to the political terror of the 1970's and our collective capacity for violence."
The painter Edilson Viriato, 30, from southern Brazil, examines the extremes in thinking and behavior that surface when sex and religion intersect. "I come from a deeply Catholic family and region," Mr. Viriato observes with a toothy choirboy's grin. "I'm fascinated by my religion's preoccupation with sex and power, with the sacred and the profane."
Other artists have taken a more pensive look at that part of human nature where a person's sense of self takes shape. In her installation, "The Black Book of Life," the Aruban artist Glenda Heylinger features a thick book suspended, as if ready for burial, over a gravelike hole of real dirt. "That tome represents everything one has to absorb, like basic knowledge and society's values and expectations, before being able to take off and live," says Ms. Heylinger, a theater-design alumna of Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam.
Ernesto Pujol, a Cuban-American who lives in New York, offers a kind of tableau vivant without the actors in "The Void," a grouping of dark-wood furniture pieces borrowed from various Havana homes (a seating ensemble, a dining table, a bed and an armoire). Also set on a carpet of actual dirt and dotted with white accessories -- gloves on the table, toy airplanes -- "The Void," Mr. Pujol says, alludes to the moment just before a sudden, forced departure, of a family of Cuban emigrants, for instance. "Sometimes memory is our only defense," he says. "To remember who we were is the only thing left to us when we have lost everything." (His precisely ordered environments will be the focus of a Bronx Museum of Art Show in the fall.)
Similarly, an installation by the Aruban Osaira Muyale, "Listening and Being Heard," consists of a lonely gathering of chairs and appliances around an empty metal bed frame. It, too, suggests a yearning for a special time or place, or perhaps for a lost love. Its most potent component is a cascade of white plaster ears set in a wall niche from which the sound of a heartbeat pulses through the vaultlike room.
"INSTALLATION HAS become the lingua franca of many contemporary artists from Latin America and the developing world," the French art critic Pierre Restany observed during the biennial's opening week. "Its theatrical qualities make it a good vehicle for artists who are sensitive to, and want to evoke, a sense of atmosphere -- cultural, political or historical."
Still, painting is here too, in the work, for example, of Mr. Iturria, who won critical praise two years ago at the Venice Biennale. The 48-year-old Mr. Iturria, of Montevideo, Uruguay, is presenting a group of new paintings and constructions that aptly touch upon all of this year's Havana themes; Mr. Iturria, after all, has long explored the mysterious-poetic, private-public aspects of history and identity in his deeply humanistic work.
With its oddly alluring images of trees, giraffes, speeding trains and Everyman figures, Mr. Iturria's art finds affinities both in the bittersweet nostalgia of Federico Fellini's memory films and in Francis Bacon's soul-scraping oil-on-canvas gristle. Mr. Iturria's curator in Havana, Olga Larnaudie, a fellow Uruguayan, points out that Mr. Iturria "expresses in the visual arts the magic realism and the peculiar surrealism that are so much a part of the literature of the Rio de la Plata region." Those qualities, she says, "travel well and are accessible to international audiences." So is much else here.
Miguel Kehayoglu of Buenos Aires, a senior member of the Argentine Association of Art Galleries, observed that "the broader public is catching up with the richness of Latin American modern and contemporary artists' work, whose themes unite us all and are well expressed here."
"This biennial has quickly come to have a special value for both the participants and the region," he said.
"Si, senor!" Ms. Llanes Godoy shot back to him as she walked by arm in arm with Mr. Restany, her longtime friend and consultant. Like a flamenco dancer, she rustled a little paper fan, and added, "Would you believe we've already begun thinking about the next one?"

Fine Tuning Expansion at Bridgewater Commons

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: BRIDGEWATER

 BODY:
FOR nine years the sole occupant at the 120-acre Bridgewater Commons mixed-use center here has been its 900,000-square-foot namesake mall.
But after more than a year of negotiations the Bridgewater Township Council early this month approved a new agreement with the owner/developers of the center that makes its continued growth more flexible in responding to changing market trends. 
 The agreement calls for a $300-million, eight-year expansion and development program that will rearrange the size and mix of office and hotel uses at the center and strengthen its retail component.
"With this new agreement we are able to fine-tune the highest and best use for the site," said Kurt Sullivan, vice president for property management at TrizecHahn Centers, the San Diego-based retail division of TrizecHahn Corporation of Toronto. Trizec Hahn Centers is developing the center with the Prudential Realty Group, the real estate arm of the Newark-based insurer.
Approvals from the Township Planning Board still must be obtained for each stage of growth of the center, which sits at the intersection of Interstate 287 and Routes 202-206 and 22 at the core of this Somerset County community.
Under the initial 1984 agreement with the township, the center was to comprise the mall, which was to remain fixed at its current size, plus 500,000 square feet of office space and a 300-room full-service hotel.
But because of the real estate recession the office and hotel were never developed. As a result, the developers have paid a penalty of about $350,000 a year since 1988 in lieu of the estimated annual revenue that the town expected. The new agreement relieves the developers of the need to build the office space. But the penalty will only be removed once the hotel is completed.
Under the revised plans, the mall will be expanded by up to 750,000 square feet with the first 250,000 square feet scheduled to be built within the next two years. That will add about 70 shops to the 160 existing stores, which include Brooks Brothers, Williams Sonoma and the Gap. The anchors are Macy's, Stern's and Lord & Taylor.
Also within the next two years the General Cinema multiplex will be expanded to at least 14 screens from the present 7 and two free-standing restaurants, together totaling 18,000 square feet of space, will be constructed. Parking spaces will grow by 1,250 to 5,750 with the construction of parking decks.
The office building will be reduced to 300,000 square feet or replaced by an all-suite hotel or 160,000 more square feet of retail space on a separate site within the center.
"Demand from retailers is fueling the expansion," said Mr. Sullivan. "For the mall to remain competitive and service the market it needed to grow."
Mayor James T. Dowden agreed, noting that the mall was essentially the community's commercial center and that its expansion "is the renewal of our downtown."
THE expansion of the mall, and by extension the center itself, is moving ahead at a time when the retail market in Somerset County in general, and in Bridgewater in particular, is heating up. A spate of projects -- mostly power centers, which are mainly made up of big-box retailers, and shopping strips -- are in various stages of the approval process.
If realized, they could double the 6.5 million square feet of existing retail space in the county, of which 2 million square feet would be in Bridgewater Township, according to data from the county and township.
Retail brokers say the activity is not surprising given the area's demographics. "In that market there has been an increase in housing and population, and no significant increase in retail," said John G. Orrico, senior vice president of the West Orange office of Grubb & Ellis, the national brokerage based in Northbrook, Ill.
From 1980 to 1990 Bridgewater's housing stock increased from 8,804 to 11,273 residences and its population grew from 29,175 to 32,509. It is expected to increase to 38,120 by the year 2000, said Michael Sarkissian, its planning director.
Until now the only sizable retail project has been the mall, he said, noting that all the proposed developments conform to the township's master plan and have a different focus and location to serve separate markets.
Within Bridgewater's 32 square miles there are 3.5 million square feet of office space. An additional 2 million square feet have been approved and this, of course, will mean more shoppers.
For instance, not far from the mall along the strengthening I-78 office corridor, SJP Properties of Parsippany is constructing a 240,000-square-foot office building. With that building 95 percent leased and scheduled for completion in November, the plan is to start a similar size building "sometime this year," said Peter Eppie, executive vice president at SJP.
Projections are that the county's population will grow to 296,000 by the year 2010, up 23.2 percent from 1990, according to figures from the Somerset County Department of Planning.
As for jobs, the projection is that 36,000 will be added by the year 2005 to the 154,500 as of 1994, the latest figure available. The average household income in the county is $84,761.
Even with such strong demographics brokers express some caution. There are opportunities to build more retail space, said Mr. Orrico of Grubb & Ellis, but there are only so many retailers.
Some proposed projects will fall by the wayside as retailers shop for the best locations and leasing commitments, said Richard Brunelli, who heads a retail brokerage firm bearing his name in Old Bridge.
But, said Mr. Brunelli, Bridgewater Commons "has a lock on its market" since the nearest regional mall is about 20 miles away. And, he added, it "can handle an expansion."
Mr. Sullivan of TrizecHahn said all the ingredients from location to size and access -- $20 million in road improvements are in place at the site -- were there to make it a success. The timing is also appropriate, he said, noting that the mall's nine-year track record was important in securing the new expansion agreement.
When the mall was first proposed some 13 years ago community opposition and concerns of traffic congestion and crime were high. But those concerns "didn't bear out," said Mayor Dowden, who back then was an strong opponent of the mall. He now describes it as "an asset."
REVENUE generated from the center is also significant. Along with real estate taxes the township shares in the rental income from the mall, now receiving about $400,000 a year, which will increase as the mall expands, said Mr. Dowden. "With the rent revenue guaranteed for the future the township gets a stable source of income other than taxes," he added.
It also gets jobs. The initial 250,000-square-foot expansion alone is expected to add 450 permanent jobs to the 2,300 already at the mall and mean 500 construction jobs. As part of the new agreement the developers will contribute $2 million to the township for continuing improvements to Commons Way, which cuts through the site and is considered the gateway into the community. And as the expansion continues they will make the necessary road improvements to accommodate the expanded center.
Asking rents for the stores in the first phase of expansion have not yet been set. But brokers say rents in the better malls in the area range from $35 to $70 a square foot, depending on size, use and site.
Mr. Sullivan said construction on the first phase is expected to begin early next year and be completed by the fall of 1999. Construction of the remaining two phases will depend on demand for space, with the completion of the entire project expected by 2005, he said.

HEADLINE: House Sales Strong as Sellers Dwindle

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
FOR the second year in a row, a strong spring selling season has brought Long Island home buyers out in force. Business has been so good that potential buyers are having difficulty finding homes to buy, real-estate agents say.
More than 2,000 fewer houses were on the market in March in Suffolk County, nearly 20 percent down from two years ago, according to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island. The area that includes Cold Spring Harbor, Dix Hills and Huntington had 40 percent fewer houses for sale. 
 In the first three months of the year, the value of home sales increased more than $94 million in Nassau and Suffolk Counties over the first quarter of 1995, continuing a trend from last year.
Last year a record total of more than $3 billion in homes was sold on Long Island through the listings service. Real-estate agents said a lack of houses to sell was holding them back.
"We have plenty of buyers without adequate housing to show them," a co-owner of Remax Shores in Massapequa, Nick Gigante, said. "It's frustrating. There's plenty of mortgage money around. There's plenty of buyers. But no inventory."
Georgianna Finn, co-owner of Coach Realtors, a seven-office chain that covers eastern Nassau and western Suffolk, said: "There are fewer homes available. We've been in an active market for so long that we've used up a lot of the inventory."
The resurgence, which began last year, is a byproduct of a strengthening economy, said Dr. Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association. In the 12 months that ended in March, Long Island gained 15,000 jobs, the business group said.
"We've seen a fairly strong and recovering economy, which is driving the real-estate market," said Dr. Kamer, who also tied the increases to growth of the financial industry. "The New York City economy has been booming, which has helped the Long Island housing market," she said. "Many in the financial and professional services fields have chosen to live on Long Island."
One couple, Lauri and Bill Cutrone, and their two children are moving into a larger home next month. Mr. Cutrone is a stockbroker. "He's done well in the last three years," Ms. Cutrone said. "So we were able to make this move."
The Cutrones, who had tried to sell their ranch house in Huntington on their own, signed with a broker in November and sold it three months later for $2,000 under their asking price. "I thought there was going to be a bidding war," Ms. Cutrone said. "We sold it to a nice couple who are getting married in the fall. The husband also works in the financial industry."
Interest rates, near 8 percent for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, are another factor. "The recent upsurge in sales can also be attributed to the belief that rates will rise," Dr. Kamer said. "You have a lot of buyers trying to beat the increase."
Mark Wolf, president of Saxon National Mortgage Bankers in Hauppauge, agreed that the relatively low interest rates had helped fuel sales. Mr. Wolf also credited added flexibility in lending for housing.
"People can get into a house for less money," Mr. Wolf said. "There's a wider availability of mortgage programs and an expanded credit criteria."
Mr. Wolf said that his business had been strong since the summer and that people were feeling better about the economy. "People are more comfortable about keeping their jobs," he said. "There seems to be a general feeling of well being."
Dr. Kamer said investors in the booming stock market "are more secure about their incomes and are willing to commit long term to purchase a home." She added that "Manhattan money" had started a building boom on the East End, where land prices for new lavish houses are rising.
"We have an incredible number of new homes for sale," Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East Hampton said. "Land is going very well. There are parts of town where you almost can't find any land."
Permits for construction of single-family houses in East Hampton, excluding Montauk, increased 27 percent from 1995 to last year, according to Ms. Saatchi.
"There are a lot of builders willing to pay close to retail market value for land just to have inventory," said Jed Schutz, president of the Windemere Development Corporation in Hauppauge and Sag Harbor.
Mr. Schutz said the recent activity was different from the boom that ran from the mid- to late 80's.
"Dentists aren't spec builders any more," he said. "The market has gotten smarter. They're not paying a premium for junk. In 1986 and '87 you could put up the cheesiest house, and it would sell. Now the homes are better thought out and are better product built by professionals."
A vibrant resale market is apparently helping some new developments. When Mr. Schutz started to build 30 town houses in Smithtown in January 1996, sales were slow, he said.
"The second half of '96 it just kicked in," he recalled. "The people that couldn't sell their homes before were suddenly selling them, which enabled them to buy into our development."
A 94-unit development in Coram that Mr. Schutz began in February 1996 sold out in 15 months. He said the turnover of the houses, priced from $120,000 to $155,000, were helped by a special state mortgage program for new buyers.
"There's a lot more first-time-buyer programs out now," Bob Ragonesi, a vice president of Genesis National Mortgage in Northport. said. "The lenders are also allowing buyers to afford a larger payment. Their mortgage payment can now be as much as 40 percent of their gross income."
The dizzying pace is keeping his company busy, Mr. Ragonesi said, but sometimes frustrated. "We are doing a lot of preapprovals that don't translate into sales, because there is no inventory," he said. "People can't find a home. There is an increase in buyers, but not an increase in mortgages."
"We have more buyers for particular segments of the market than we have product," Ms. Saatchi said. "We scrounge around for listings to show. But usually we can sell them before we advertise them."
Some brokers said what they call the "move-up market" had slowed won. "People are buying homes and staying in them longer," said Ms. Finn.
Paul and Jane Longo and their two children, who have lived for 10 years in their hi-ranch in West Hills, have been looking for a larger house for two years.
"There's not much around in the price range and the area that we are looking in," said Ms. Longo.
Because the house would be their third, Ms. Longo conceded that she was being a bit fussy. "We don't want to have to do renovations," she said. "We did that with this house."
Mr. Wolf said he believed that the former widespread emigration of retirees had also slowed. "People used to retire to Florida," he said. "Now they're not in such a hurry to move. Between the floods and the droughts and the earthquakes, they say, 'We'll stay on Long Island.' "

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
On a Clear Day, Nary a Sludge Ball

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
IT first hit the news in August 1987. A huge garbage slick washed up on the New Jersey seashore, draping itself like a filthy necklace along the barrier islands from Point Pleasant to Surf City.
People were aghast. Beaches were shut. Action was demanded. But it was only Jersey at this point, and we know how they sneer from the far side of the Hudson. 
 But the next summer, during a blisteringly hot July, similar trash started to wash up on the beaches of Long Island. Suddenly, with the Hamptons in peril, the story became Armageddon. Though medical waste formed only a small portion of the garbage, it was quite photogenic. Hysterical television pictures firmly imprinted a lurid image on the cultural consciousness: A day at the beach, with bloody syringes poking from the sand like dandelions beside hairy sludge balls.
"The ocean sent back some of the nastier stuff," recalled Cindy Zipf, who runs Clean Ocean Action, a coalition of environmental and business groups she helped start in 1984 in a room above a hardware store in Sea Bright.
In 1984, there were still eight ocean-dumping sites off the Jersey coast, ranging from a few miles to more than 100 miles out to sea. At the same time, vast coastal development was overwhelming old sewage and storm-drain systems. Not to mention the river of raw sewage and trash launched into the sea whenever rainwater caused New York City's ancient sewers to overflow.
Three years later, the ocean "basically puked," said Ms. Zipf. But the hideous trash, which washed ashore like seaborne bottles from hell, was actually a cosmic press-agent's most brilliant media stunt.
"The medical waste was in some ways the best bad news we had," Ms. Zipf said. "It galvanized public attention -- and we saw that as a major opportunity, especially in fund raising and getting business on board. The business community for a long time had been, like, 'shhhhh', on the ocean dumping stuff. Suddenly, when billions were lost over those two summers, there was a greater appreciation of the economic value of the marine environment. That gave us a whole new kind of clout. We weren't just fish-huggers anymore."
Doctoral dissertations should examine the amazing story of those two summers when time and tide coincided at the media nexus and created landmark policy changes. Spurred by the medical-waste horror stories, Congress banned ocean dumping in 1988. Even now, the ripples are felt. Today, Clean Ocean Action begins a 100-day countdown until the closing of the only remaining ocean dump, six miles off Sandy Hook, where sludge dredged from New York Harbor has been piled on the ocean floor since the 19th century.
"When I was a little girl, I went to the beach at Sea Bright every single day in the summer," Ms. Zipf recalled. "Then, beachcombers found sea-shells."
"By the early 1980's, when the first plastic bags began washing up, beachcombing had become an entirely different thing," she said in a conversation the other day on the porch of a Victorian house on a former Army post in Sandy Hook, where her group shares space with the American Littoral Society, a national beach environment group.
Ms. Zipf got a degree in marine policy at the University of Rhode Island and returned to the Jersey Shore to run Clean Ocean Action. The group's first publicity coup was in 1985, when it commissioned a huge sculpture made of plastic tampon applicators and other trash that had washed up on Sandy Hook beaches. A few summers later, it hired a plane to fly along crowded beaches towing a banner denouncing a chemical company for plans to dump industrial waste at sea. The company quickly surrendered.
For years after the medical waste publicity, Ms. Zipf said, "I would still hear mothers say things like, 'I will never let my child go into the Atlantic Ocean.' I just thought that was tragic."
Now, though overloaded urban pipes still burp forth the occasional reminder that our aged sewage systems are an insult to the sea, people have a much better awareness of the complex natural and economic ecologies of the seashore. She said that even the whales seem to have noticed the improvement.
"I mean, who would have thought then," Ms. Zipf said, "that there would be a whale-watching ship leaving out of Atlantic Highlands?"

HEADLINE: At the Intersection of Supply and Demand

 BODY:

Tierney paints a rosy picture of life in New York after the end of rent regulations -- full of better homes and better neighborhoods, where landlords and tenants live together in perfect harmony. But we can see the success of this "free" housing market elsewhere in urban America -- Detroit, Cleveland, Hartford, St. Louis -- where the middle class, encouraged by tax breaks for mortgage-interest deductions, has fled to the suburbs, abandoning the inner city to its fate. That New York hasn't succumbed to this fate might very well be because of the rent regulations that Tierney so disparages for disproportionately benefiting middle-class households. 
 Tierney also relies too heavily on surveys by economists who try to blame rent control for all kinds of urban ills, in particular the abandonment of buildings. Why is it then that abandonment is greatest in neighborhoods like East New York, where the market rates are nearly the same or even lower than the regulated rates? Yet, on the Upper West Side, where the disparity between regulated and market rates is greatest, there is little abandonment. Quite the contrary. The Upper West Side, once a scene of urban blight, has improved steadily in the past three decades, so much so that residents now complain of overcrowding from all the new luxury buildings going up.

HEADLINE: Haiti Takes Policing 101

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Rubin; Elizabeth Rubin is a contributing editor of Harper's magazine. This is her first story for the Magazine.

 BODY:
To the untrained eye, Jean-Jacques Dessalines Boulevard in the heart of the Port-au-Prince business district looks like a carnival of commerce. Hundreds of Haitian vendors are whittling sugar cane or selling old light switches, stereos, knives, shampoo, batteries, even schoolbooks from cardboard boxes that spill out into a jumble of traffic and pedestrians. For Gus Tavernier, an officer with the New York City Police Department, however, the boulevard is a lesson to be mastered. To be a good cop, Tavernier explains to a Haitian rookie named Accius, you've got to know your environment: the street, the people, their wares, everything. And you've got to know yourself: the equipment you carry, your capabilities, your image -- what Tavernier calls "impression management."
 A Haitian-American from Long Island, Tavernier, 40, is one of two dozen Creole-speaking police officers who came from the United States last year to professionalize Haiti's new civilian police force. On a sweaty afternoon, he leads Accius out on the beat for a lesson in proactive policing, Yankee style. As they cut a path through the vendors, Tavernier asks Accius what he has noticed. Accius turns his head this way and that, walks back a few paces and looks up at Tavernier with no answer. 
 "What you see here," Tavernier says, gesturing to a man selling knives, "is a clue that you're throwing away if a crime is later committed." Accius is eager to learn, and he readily admits that this is all new to him. Tavernier next points out a vendor selling ice picks -- another potential weapon or clue. They move on, squeezing through more merchants, and after a few yards pass a box displaying both ice picks and knives. Tavernier again asks Accius what he sees. Accius looks around and says, "Nothing."
 Tavernier is trying to teach the basic skills of investigative policing, but he faces a peculiar challenge in communication -- even though he speaks Creole and spent the first 11 years of his life in Haiti. "The idea of policing in Haiti has always been that of an authority figure who tells the people what to do," he says.
 Under the military rule of Gen. Raol Cedras, who led the 1991 military coup that toppled the popularly elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and throughout most of Haitian history, the army ran the criminal-justice system. So there was no need for time-consuming tasks like gathering evidence, securing a crime scene, collecting testimony. When the military brought in a suspect, he was presumed guilty. No questions asked. But since 1994, when a United States military intervention returned Aristide to office, Haiti has been moving toward an investigative model of justice, which presupposes that the burden of proof is on the accusers, not the accused. This is a revolutionary idea in Haiti, where for centuries dictators like the notorious Duvaliers and Cedras, along with their militias -- known as Tontons Macoutes and attaches] -- maintained "order" by extortion, torture and murder.
 Tavernier has a visceral as well as politicial aversion to what he calls the Duvalier-macoute religion. "Duvalier's regime was very simple," he says. "You criticize the government, you're dead. So you knew what to do." Now the kind of social unrest that has accompanied the end of repression in many countries around the world is taking root in Haiti. The poor -- that is, most Haitians -- are frustrated by the fact that neither Aristide, their popular hero, nor Rene Preval, his more pragmatic successor, who has been in office since February 1996, has improved their lot.
 Tavernier walks the streets every day with trainees from Cafeteria, a busy precinct from which, only a few years ago, one of the coup leaders dispatched his hit squads. Drilling the men in the rudiments of police work is only part of the job, though. Perhaps the more important task, as Tavernier sees it, is "to dilute the mentality of the tonton macoute]."
 When Tavernier declares this idea aloud, his colleagues in Cafeteria, Officers Ives Orne and Guy Jean-Baptiste, both from the Boston Police Department, look at him as if he's dreaming. "Every Haitian is a tonton macoute]," says Jean-Baptiste, a soft-spoken immigration officer whose eyes seem permanently jacked open in astonishment by the poverty and chaos around him. "It's here," he says tapping his temple.
 "Take that cop who brought in the guy from the market," Orne says. Earlier, an undercover cop wearing dark shades and a camouflage jacket, with a Magnum and a .38 stuffed in his jeans, slammed an unarmed suspect from the market up against the wall while pushing a third gun into his head. "What would you call that cop?" Orne asks. "He has the macoute] mentality. The same guys that are telling you macoutes] did bad things will now come in and do worse."
 Tavernier disengages from the conversation. His right eye squints repeatedly, a twitch he contracted after serving in the gulf war. Tavernier, who has the compact, spry physique of a welterweight boxing champion, believes that Haitian political tyranny is rooted not only in Haiti's history but in the way Haitian men are reared to become authoritarian at home. He had his first tastes of that oppression at the fist of his abusive father, a businessman who prospered under the corrupt Duvalier regime. At the age of 11, Tavernier and an older brother escaped from their father and joined their other siblings and their mother, Jeanine Tavernier, who had fled to America two years earlier.
 His mother had made her mark in Haiti as a poet, writing about women's liberation. She raised all five children on her own in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, taught them about the injustices in Haiti and planted in them the seed of activism.
 At 19, Tavernier returned to Haiti, and as an emboldened American wound up having a lot of run-ins with the gun-toting tontons macoutes]. Ultimately he had to bargain for his life with the all-powerful district chiefs, who accused him of being a subversive. So he went back to New York, went to Queens College and drove a taxi while waiting to get citizenship so he could join the police force. Because he found it tough to make ends meet, Tavernier joined the military in 1982. As far back as Tavernier can recall, he has wanted to be a cop. "I could have been a very good bad guy," he says. But the idea of being a cop coincided with his inchoate notion of justice and "doing the right thing."
 In 1989, he married a Haitian dance instructor, and when their first daughter was born he named her Kia -- "killed in action" -- in memory of his best friend, Caco Laguerre, an anti-Duvalier activist who was assassinated and "died like a dog in the streets of Florida."
 Like Laguerre, Tavernier has always felt strong ties to his homeland. So when he heard last year that Creole-speaking cops were needed to help train the new Haitian police force, he volunteered. Ten days later, Tavernier flew down to Haiti to begin the latest chapter in a quiet war he has been waging for much of his life -- to change Haiti and teach Haitians to stand up for themselves. Tavernier's thinking dovetailed with that of Raymond Kelly, a former New York City police commissioner who commanded the international police monitors during the United States intervention in Haiti. "I thought that if we could bring in Haitian-American police officers who have a knowledge of the culture and the language and have been practicing the tradition of American law enforcement, that it would make quite an impact," Kelly says. "Policing is one of the most valuable commodities we can export to emerging democracies."
 Since last October, 48 Creole-speaking cops from police departments all over the country have been exported, at a cost of about $4 million for 10 months in one of the first such experiments in the fledgling field of international policing. Like Tavernier, almost all the Haitian-American cops were born in Haiti and fled with their parents during the Duvalier era. Some say they signed up to escape the cold northern winters. Some for the money. Some are Republicans, some Democrats. Many have, or had, ties or sympathies with the elite, anti-Aristide classes. Others profess to hate both the elite and the Duvalierists. But all of them feel that they are on a personal and professional mission to give to their homeland some of the privileges and skills they acquired in America.
 Back in 1994, after Aristide demobilized the despised Haitian Army, the Haitian Government recruited a new police force of educated young men and women and promised them a decent salary by Haitian standards -- about $500 a month. The first graduates of the police academy were heralded as pioneers of the country's new democracy. But in the year and a half since, that enthusiasm has waned in the face of rising crime, continued corruption, a bankrupt economy and a beggared criminal-justice system.
 In keeping with the Clinton Administration's determination to withdraw American troops by February 1996, the 5,200 police cadets were rushed through an inadequate four-month training course run by the United States Department of Justice. Many did not know how to drive, let alone handle a weapon or conduct investigations, and were thrust into the streets with no supervision, little or no equipment and no experienced officers to show them the ropes. Their job was made even more precarious by the fact that they were threatened by thugs of the old regime whom the American troops had failed to disarm.
 When the last of 1,300 United Nations troops pull out in July, the survival of Haiti's nascent democracy will rest almost entirely on the shoulders of this new and uncertain police force. Yet Haitians, reared in a system where impunity was the norm, tend to mistrust authority figures and thus place more stock in the old Haitian proverb "Laws are paper; bayonets are steel," than in any notion of a real criminal-justice system.
For their part, the new Haitian police officers are so undermined and demoralized by their own resourcelessness, the deaths of their colleagues and the debilitated prosecutorial process that they are beginning to adopt a policy of equally unworkable extremes: free the criminals or execute them. And as the laws fail to bind, the population is resorting to its own disciplinary codes to punish deviant social behavior -- whether murder or stealing a chicken -- by burning government buildings and publically executing criminals.
"There is an ever-growing frustration on the part of the population with a system that doesn't work," says Pierre Denize, the Director General of the Haitian police forces. "There's a delay in the treatment of cases, which has caused an appalling overpopulation of an already inadequate penal structure." The national penitentiary, built to hold about 350 prisoners, currently has close to 1,000. Many judges work two jobs just to survive and often release accused criminals almost as soon as they are arrested, either for bribes or out of fear of retaliation. "When it happens often enough," Denize says, "the policeman tends to say: 'What's the use? He's going to walk tomorrow.' Or he tends to be fearful: 'I arrest him today and he could be shooting at me tomorrow.' "
When Tavernier, Orne and Jean-Baptiste took up their posts at Cafeteria in November, they were shocked. The two-story, colonial-era building looked more like a crack house than a police station. Floorboards were missing. The roof was crumbling and leaking. There was no electricity, no potable water, no sanitation. The police lacked ammunition, radios, handcuffs.
 Some 20 detainees were jostling for space in a filthy holding cell about the size of a news kiosk. When one of the prisoners jutted his infected, swollen foot past the bars, Jean-Baptiste promised quietly to get him to a hospital, then sidestepped a bucket that was being used as a latrine. "I detain people in Boston," he says. "But I have never seen this kind of thing before. At home, if you commit a minor crime we separate you or transfer you and then you see a judge. But here? They're all thrown in together. They haven't seen a judge. And they don't eat or drink unless family brings them food."
 It's not just the squalor that the Americans find so disturbing. They are equally puzzled that the police leadership could deploy a force that is so poorly trained and equipped. When a call came in saying that a policeman had been kidnapped, Tavernier told a Haitian officer to keep him covered when they moved out. The Haitian cop asked Tavernier what exactly he meant by "cover." "If I'm running, you watch my back," Tavernier explained. "With what?" asked the Haitian cop, shooting at Tavernier with his finger to remind him that he had no gun.
 One night just two weeks into their mission, Tavernier and Orne were suddenly called upon to save their Haitian counterparts from a lynch mob. Shortly after midnight, they heard the panicked voices of seven young cops on the isle of La Gonave shouting into the radio, "If you don't send help, we are going to die." Angry residents had already torched the courthouse and were hurling Molotov cocktails at the police station to smoke out the cops.
 The riot had erupted after the police tried to make an illegal arrest of a boy they had decided wasn't showing them enough respect. In the dark, they shot and killed an innocent passerby. After months of police abuses, resulting in four civilian deaths, the people finally rose up to enact their own justice.
 Tavernier, Orne and three other international police trainers were dropped off by helicopter to negotiate with the crowd. As they made their way to the public square, they encountered some 200 men, women and children wielding machetes, knives and rocks, climbing the steps of the burning police station for the final assault and chanting: "Soldiers, charge. Whoever dies it doesn't matter."
 Yet when the people in the crowd spotted the foreigners in uniform, they broke into cheers of welcome. Someone had finally come to hear their complaints. Several young men, however, were disappointed, and were still out for blood. A voice called out, "If you'd only given us a few more minutes, we could have killed them." They had no intention of letting the captive cops go.
 Tavernier didn't doubt that the rookies were swaggering about La Gonave like macoutes], and he had no sympathy for their conduct. But vigilantism, he told the people, was not going to resolve their problems. Orne and Tavernier tried to bargain with the crowd all night long, explaining that the police would be brought to trial, that they were training good cops in the capital.
 The residents of La Gonave saw no reason to trust anyone's justice but their own. What's more, they were fed up with the new politicians. They'd had no electricity for 14 months and only one telephone line for the main town's 64,000 residents. At least under Duvalier, they said, life was cheaper and there was less crime.
 By daybreak, thousands had gathered in the town square. United Nations military and Haitian police reinforcements were flown in. Surrounded by the dancing and chanting islanders hurling stones, the U.N. officers finally managed to evacuate the rookies to the mainland.
 In the square, children were jumping in and out of the burned-out police trucks as the Haitian flag flapped at half-staff. Young men rummaged through the smoldering police house pulling out bikes and beds as flames ate away at the corners of a police poster that read: "Don't take justice into your own hands. Report all criminals and thieves to the Haitian National Police."
Simon Lepoint, the 32-year-old Mayor, said he had a premonition that such an explosion would occur. He had long ago asked Port-au-Prince to replace his corrupt police force. "Now we are abandoned -- how can we keep law and order here with one baton?" he asked, waving a wooden police club he had salvaged from the wreckage.
 A few days later, back at Cafeteria in Port-au-Prince, Tavernier and Orne, who had been smacked in the head with a rock, were still stunned by the drama on La Gonave. The last thing they had expected when they came down to the island was that they would wind up rescuing bad cops from a mob. The incident laid bare to them the political, economic and social obstacles they are up against.
 "These cops are kids with no experience," Orne says. "So before they use communication, they use force. And then the people get pissed off."
 It is this enormous gulf of mistrust between the population and the police that Raymond Kelly hopes the Haitian-Americans will bridge. But Orne is not so optimistic. Despite the fact that they speak Creole and that many still have family in Haiti, the Haitian-Americans are discovering just how far they have traveled from the culture into which they were born.
 Although Tavernier has worked the toughest precincts in Brooklyn, he insists that "N.Y.P.D. is a vacation" compared with Haiti. "I've never seen killing like I've seen here," he says. "Everybody's killing everybody, or trying to, because they are living in a punishment-free society."
 What the Haitian police need as much as training, equipment and supervision is time. But with a July pullout date for the United Nations, time is running out. One Haitian-American trainer believes that almost every middle-class Haitian family has automatic weapons. The middle class, he says, are all sympathizers with the former army and the tontons macoutes]. "If they didn't know Big Brother was watching over them, they would probably stage a coup," he says.
 Paul Desrossiers, a trainer from the Los Angeles Police Department, has been helping to gather information on the forces that are trying to sabotage the new Haitian police. He says that demobilized soldiers have either gone underground or gone out to the provinces, where they work as bodyguards for government officials.
 Coming from the L.A.P.D, Desrossiers is accustomed to a police force that looks after its own. But in Haiti, he points out, the authorities are recruiting and arming their own private security forces with automatic weapons -- which is exactly how the tontons macoutes] evolved. This practice is undermining the morale of the new cadets, who get no medical attention or insurance if they're wounded on duty. "These kids are so afraid that everybody is contemplating leaving or quitting when their contract expires in 18 months," Desrossiers says. "At the current rate, there will not be a Police Department. The army will eventually come back."
 The State Department wants to keep the Haitian-American trainers as technical advisers to the Haitian police after the United Nations withdraws from Haiti. Some Haitian officials, particularly in the Police Department, resent the superior attitude that the Haitian-Americans have carried down with them. Given the troubled history of U.S.-Haitian relations, they are also wary of being bullied by their more powerful neighbors. But the trainers have brought a commitment to, and understanding of, the country that cannot be equaled by their U.N. colleagues from other countries. "I might want to retire here someday, and I'd like to have a police force with knowledge," Orne says. "I'd also like to pay back something to the country."
 Just a couple of months into the mission, Cafeteria started to take on the air of a real police station, with signs for different offices and a receiving desk. Tavernier says that his men have learned how to talk to the population, keep their weapons clean and secure a crime scene. But he fears that after the United Nations troops pull out, Haiti will descend into a gangland like Somalia.
 With no sign of economic recovery in sight and a rather steady 70 percent unemployment rate, Haitians are losing faith in the politicians they elected and in the new system that was supposed to change their lives. And as the frustration and despair mount, everyone is looking for someone to blame. Aristide accuses his former ally Preval of being an American pawn, caving in to American economic reform packages like the privatization of state-owned companies. The bourgeoisie are aching to have one of their own back in power. And even the poor, once devoted Aristide fans, are becoming nostalgiac for Duvalier's "order."
 While Tavernier can tolerate such sentiments from the disenfranchised, he loses patience when he hears middle-class people bemoaning the rise of crime in their formerly protected neighborhoods. "I tell them, 'They're revolting against you because you've been oppressing them for centuries.' The intensity that people put into work here compared to what they are paid -- to me that's slavery or apartheid, or a form of it, anyway."
 Tavernier still clings to the ideals of the social revolution inspired by Aristide. And although he has become increasingly disappointed in the former President, he is equally disturbed that everyone he talks to is blaming him for Haiti's decline. "Aristide simply turned over the soup so everybody could see what was at the bottom of the pot," Tavernier says. "Before, people made it their business to cover up the poverty. Aristide told the people, 'Get your expletive] out there and get what you need.' People who cherish Duvalier are angry at this man because he told the people, 'This is your country.' "
 Given enough manpower, financing and authority, the Haitian-Americans believe they could have a significant impact on the police force. With only a 10-month contract and an uncertain commitment on the part of the United States, the mission looks quixotic at best. But like Don Quixote, Tavernier inspires himself with an old story: "A guy is walking on a beach where hundreds of starfish have washed up onto the sand. He sees his friend down the shore rescuing them, throwing them back into the water one by one, and he shouts to him, 'Do you think throwing one starfish in the water is going to make any difference?' The friend replies, 'It'll make a difference for this one.' "

HEADLINE: There's No Place Like Work

 BODY:

In her article "There's No Place Like Work" (April 20), Arlie Russell Hochschild misses how work contributes to the time bind in households. Why has the stress of family life increased? For too many parents, it is because the growing demands of their jobs leave them too tired to take pleasure in being with their families. 
 Hochschild's argument that many employees don't use work-family benefits because work is more fun than home ignores the reality of today's corporate cultures, where long hours are viewed as evidence of commitment to the job. Employees worry that taking advantage of flexible programs may cause them to be perceived as less committed and that as a result, their careers will suffer, threatening the economic security of their families.

Paul's Big Adventure

 BODY:
Seething with frustration during last year's debate on welfare reform, Senator Paul Wellstone, the liberal Democrat from Minnesota, scrapped his prepared speech and declared that he would tour the poorest parts of the country in 1997, just as Robert F. Kennedy did 30 years ago. He's starting in the Mississippi Delta, and though most Mississippians aren't aware of it, Wellstone is headed their way this week.
 Wellstone is betting that exposing brutal living and working conditions will demonstrate far better than words the absurdity of slashing the Federal safety net. There's certainly real suffering to be seen -- Rims Barber, a poverty activist who accompanied Kennedy, maintains that half the Delta's population is now as bad off or worse than it was in 1967. After holding a town meeting in the Rose Fort High School in Tunica, Miss., Wellstone will visit harsh workplaces, like commercial catfish farms where women have stood in icy water for hours on end. The goal? Wellstone aims to rattle the established political hierarchy in ways that are impossible with child-welfare amendments that go nowhere. "The Democratic Party has lost some of its soul," he insists. 
 Whether the gesture will accomplish much remains to be seen, but some Mississippi locals are bristling at being advertised as the nation's neediest. Brenda Van Cleave, director of the Tunica Chamber of Commerce, boasts that the county now has 10 casinos, 16 hotels and fast-food
 outlets from McDonald's to Subway. Van Cleave is unimpressed by talk of some residents' declining fortunes. "If that is happening," she says, "there's no reason for it."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Former B. Altman Site;
From Department Store to Storehouse of Knowledge

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
WHEN the B. Altman store that occupies the block between 34th and 35th Streets and Fifth and Madison Avenues opened in 1914, it was a temple of commerce with floors devoted to ladies' bonnets and gentlemen's furnishings, with its own trade school and medical clinic.
When the landmarked building completes its transition in the summer of 1998, it will have become a temple of learning, housing the graduate school of the City University of New York, with its 32 doctoral programs and 24 research centers. Already installed on its Madison Avenue side are the Science, Industry and Business branch of the New York Public Library and, in the tower, Oxford University Press. 
 The undertaking represents a considerable investment in a building that had sat idle since Altman's went out of business in 1989, until Oxford moved from across the street at 200 Madison Avenue in May 1995. The Oxford project represented an outlay of $30 million, the library branch $100 million and the graduate school, $163 million.
Each organization owns a condominium interest in the building, with operations of facilities held in common, such as the freight elevator and roof, governed by a board made up of owners' representatives.
Peter L. Malkin, who with his partner Morton L. Olshan first became involved with the Altman properties in 1985, said selling the condominiums was a fallback strategy after efforts to redevelop the building or rent it were foiled by the real estate recession of the early 1990's. "We spent a year and a half trying to develop the building as a showroom for the contract furniture industry, but the companies involved could not make it work," he said. "So we took an alternative approach."
Daniel A. Biederman, president of both the 34th Street and Grand Central Partnerships, which meet at the north end of the building at 35th Street, said he expects the graduate center to generate street traffic and night life in the surrounding area.
"It's almost like a residential conversion," he said."You will have people walking around and spending money for food and other things and it will increase foot traffic at night."
The whole building will be quite a bookish place. In addition to the public library branch, the graduate school will have its own library, and Oxford Press has a library for all the titles it currently has in print.
The new and prospective occupants of the building happily nod to their antecedents. "People will still shop in this building, but now they will shop for ideas," said Frances Degen Horowitz, president of what is formally the Graduate School and University Center for CUNY. She said the graduate school's current location at 33 West 42 Street was no longer adequate for its needs, with faculty offices spread to two nearby buildings at a rental expense that was approaching $6 million a year.
"We outgrew the building," Dr. Horowitz said, noting that the graduate school only had a handful of programs when it opened in 1961, but now has 4,000 students. The 42d Street location was originally chosen, she said, so students would have easy access to the research collections at the main branch of the public library, which is almost directly across the street.
The location of the main branch dictated that the graduate school stay in the general neighborhood, Dr. Horowitz said, despite the presence in the same building of the Science, Industry and Business Library. "SIBL has the technical data bases, but we had to have access to the humanities collections at the library," she said. "It is just a few blocks' difference." Although inadequate for the graduate school, the state-owned building on 42d Street was deemed suitable for the State University of New York School of Optometry, which will move there from rented space once the floors have been remodeled to meet its needs.
Unlike other universities, where the graduate schools are part of an integrated academic community, the CUNY graduate school operates semi-autonomously, with a core faculty of about 100. The remaining 1,600 doctoral faculty are drawn from colleges within the university system. It is also decentralized, with science research and professional programs at college campuses around the city.
As the owner of a nonprofit condominium unit in the building, the school will be spared the real estate taxes that are passed on to tenants in rental charges, although it will have to make payments to the State Dormitory Authority until the bonds used to finance the project are retired. The school will occupy 580,000 square feet of space on eight floors and a mezzanine along Fifth Avenue. Strollers who window-shopped the latest fashions in the past will be able to see graduate students studying in the library and study spaces near the display windows.
Since one of the needs of the school was for performance and meeting spaces, the big floors and high ceilings of the old store provided a good beginning. "This building is well suited for adaptive reuse," said Robert Siegel, whose firm, Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, did the design work for both the graduate school and the library. "It's really a grand old loft building with well-placed columns and none of the load-bearing walls you often find in old buildings."
With this as a base, Mr. Siegel was able to carve out the space for a 400-seat auditorium, a 200-seat recital hall and a 72,000-square-foot library. Since they do not need windows, the two halls were placed in the basement, while the library occupies parts of the basement and first floors and all the second floor, in its section of the building.
The middle five floors of the graduate school's space are occupied by lecture halls, seminar rooms, faculty offices, a science center and computer laboratories. The top two floors are reserved for administrative offices, a conference center and a central dining facility under the skylight of the original Altman restaurant, with a view of the soaring Empire State Building diagonally across the street.
Adequate meeting space is essential at the doctoral level, Dr. Horowitz said. "In doctoral programs, education takes place as much outside the classroom as in it," she said. Meetings and seminars are an important part of that process, she said, and including the meeting spaces in the design will make such events easier to hold. Space will also be provided for a physical fitness center, a day-care center and improved laboratory and computer facilities.
The graduate school expects to move into the building in the summer of 1998 , which has the advantage of being a slow time academically.
One of the glories of the Italian palazzo-style building are its windows, both the vaulted displays at street level and the rectangular ones on the upper levels. The result is that a lot of people, in the library and Oxford Press as well as the graduate school, have or will have offices with windows. "One of the few concerns we had was that the building had too much interior space for its perimeter," Mr. Siegel said. "We had to work on getting natural light as far into the building as possible."
WITH the public library, the solution was to put the people on the outside and the books -- 1.2 million of them -- in the middle. Since the ceilings were high, the library was able to squeeze five floors of stacks into what was three floors of store. Because of the heavy loads of the book stacks, this was one of the few places in the renovation where the building's structure had to be reinforced. The new branch effectively liberated the library's technical collection, 60 percent of which had been in storage, said William D. Walker, senior vice president of the library. He said it was visited by an average of 2,400 people a day.
The appeal of the facility was obvious on a recent workday, when a crowd was waiting outside the front door for the 11 A.M. opening, and patrons raced to computer terminals to do their research. The main floor contains a reading area with periodicals and a 40,000-volume circulating collection.
But the main area is downstairs, where Altman's had its gift-wrap and mail-order operations. "The deeper you go, the more serious it gets," Mr. Walker said. He said a library facility such as his was intended for graduate-level research, with neighborhood branch libraries for undergraduate-level study. To make the below-grade space more attractive, part of the first floor was removed, allowing light from display windows to fall on an open floor intended as a meeting hall. Farther in are the service desk for the main book collection and 70 work stations in the Electronic Information Center.
Oxford University Press has its own entrance and reception area on Madison, where the latest titles are displayed in windows. Its own library occupies the second-story mezzanine and its own elevators take employees to the 9th to 13th floors.
"We have been in here since May 1995 and we like it," said Gerald Sussman, senior vice president for administration and planning. "In fact, we wonder how we managed to survive in our old quarters."

HEADLINE: More to Say On Adoption Law

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thank you for printing my letter in the New Jersey section April 13 regarding adoption in general and, specifically, the case of "Baby D." It obviously struck a chord, a very emotional chord. I would like to respond to letters printed later that alleged misstatements on my part. 
 I am not anti-adoption. When adoption provides a family for a child who needs a home, it is an honorable act. When adoption is used to satisfy the needs of adults for newborns, it is a questionable practice.
My letter accurately described New Jersey law, which provides that relinquishments of newborns may be procured 72 hours after birth. The law does not require independent counseling, nor legal representation for the birth mother. A baby may be relinquished by the birth mother, even if a minor, with a single signature only three days (72 hours) after birth, and that relinquishment serves as an irrevocable termination of parental rights. Interested readers may look at New Jersey Statutes Annotated, Title 9 Children, Subtitle 2 Adoption, Apprenticeship and Indenture at 9:2:16 and 9:3-41e.
New Jersey law also provides that when one parent surrenders custody or has parental rights terminated, the other parent's rights are not affected. (N.J.S.A. 9:2-15). This law is relevant in the Baby D case. Although the father has committed a crime, his parental rights have not been terminated. The past commission of a crime is not a bar to being a parent by birth or by adoption.
Even in cases where the surrender has been found by a court to be void because of undue pressure or coercion, and the surrender is declared a legal nullity, the baby is not automatically returned to its family of birth. Read the decision in Sorrentino v. Family & Children Services.
Another letter-writer stated that when there is a dispute in an adoption case, the child is returned to its birth family. If that were true, Baby D would have been with his father for the last 32 months or so.
That letter-writer also addressed the issue of counseling for birth mothers. Although some reputable agencies may provide psychological counseling, it is not independent. The agency's fee is paid by prospective adoptive parents. Even when agencies do provide psychological counseling, they are under no requirement to provide legal counseling.
In some cases, prospective adoptive parents pay expenses for indigent birth mothers. This can include relocation to states where they have fewer rights and where adoptions may become final more quickly than in New Jersey.
Yet another letter asserted that there is a prejudice against adoption. If anything, there is a prejudice in favor of adoption, a prejudice that denies the biological connection and asks us to believe that children will be "better off" and "grow to full potential" if adopted. This prejudice is reflected in social policy that promotes adoption rather than social and economic justice.
It is unfortunate that the procurement of infants for needy adults has created a market in babies. This is not a misrepresentation of adoption. I do not intend to insult those present and future adoptive parents who acted to provide a home to a child in need. On the other hand, those who seek to use their advantages to obtain babies from less fortunate families must recognize this is wrong.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Dueling Gift Funds: Similar Aims, Different Styles

BYLINE: By JULIETTE FAIRLEY 

 BODY:
COMMENCEMENT season serves as an annual reminder for parents, grandparents and others to commence saving for a young child's future education.
A popular way to set aside money for college has been the American Century-Twentieth Century Giftrust fund, which combines some features of a trust with a high-growth stock portfolio. But that fund has slumped recently, at least temporarily cooling interest. 
 Royce Gift Shares presents a possible alternative. Though smaller and newer, it is much like the American Century fund in structure. Both funds allow someone to make a gift, to a child or anyone, really, other than oneself or a spouse. The gift is irrevocable, which means investors cannot touch the money once it is committed, and each fund requires the money to be invested for at least 10 years.
When it comes to investing style, though, the similarities end quickly.
Though they buy small stocks, the funds' portfolios are worlds apart. Charles M. Royce, the primary manager of the fund that bears his name, sums up the difference this way: "We have a conservative fundamental approach to investing that is value oriented. American Century has a growth momentum style."
That divergence and the market's recent preference for value investing show up in the fund's total returns. Through Thursday, Giftrust had lost 13.0 percent for the year, while Royce Gift Shares had gained 3.94 percent. Last year, the Royce fund returned 25.6 percent, while Giftrust was up just 5.8 percent. The Royce fund, which is less than two years old, achieved those gains on a slim asset base, now $1.2 million, compared with $725 million now for Giftrust, which is 14 years old.
Glenn Fogle, 36, the lead manager of Giftrust for the last four years, chalks up the underperformance to the vagaries of market cycles.
"Investors flocked to large-cap stocks and cheap stocks because of fear of inflation and fear that the economy was too strong," Mr. Fogle said. "This slump has been a short-term event triggered by obvious factors that don't worry us in the least because it doesn't affect our ability to generate long-term returns."
Indeed, the fund's long-term record has been good. For the 10 years ended in 1996, its annual return was 21.8 percent on average, 6.5 percentage points ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar, the fund trackers in Chicago.
Given that investing styles come in and out of favor and that a trust fund is a long-term commitment, Kevin Kresnicka, a fund analyst with Morningstar, encourages investors not to place too much weight on short-term results. "Whenever you try to time something -- a sector or investment style -- a lot of times, investors can get whipsawed," Mr. Kresnicka said.
For the long haul, though, people who are choosing between the two funds are deciding between two approaches to investing: value and growth. And a debate has raged for years over which is preferable.
To explain the difference, Mr. Kresnicka pointed to some standard measures of valuation. "Giftrust invests in companies with high P.E. ratios and price-to-book, and is willing to pay up as long as they see strong growth rates that justify those price multiples," he said.
Consider the fund's biggest holding at the end of 1996, the latest date for which complete portfolio information is available. It was the American depository receipts of the CBT Group, a Dublin company that makes software for technology training, trading at an extraordinary 91.6 times trailing earnings, a ratio several times that of the S.& P. 500.
In an interview last week, Mr. Fogle said his fund's top holding is now McAfee Associates, a software company in Santa Clara, Calif., that produces network security and management products. It is trading at about 38 times its projected 1997 earnings of $1.60 to $1.65 a share.
Over all, Giftrust had more than one-third of its assets in technology stocks at the end of the year. Royce Gift Shares had 21 percent of assets, its biggest portion, in industrial services, and its top holding was Sevenson Environmental Services, a company that handles environmental cleanups. Its stock is trading at a more modest 18.6 times trailing earnings.
"Our approach takes into consideration risk and reward," said Mr. Royce, 58, the primary manager of 10 open-end funds and 3 closed-end funds, all in the small-cap and micro-cap area. "We don't expose the shareholder to too much risk, and we invest in small-cap stocks that have great prospects that we can buy cheaply."
Lately, he has been adding to his big position in Bassett Furniture Industries, which is revamping and is now trading at about 19 times trailing earnings. "It sells just above book value," he said, "and it's a significant brand in the furniture world."
Mr. Royce also likes Standard Commercial, which processes tobacco leaves and has a substantial wool business. "They've just completed a deal to pay down a lot of debt," he said. Furthermore, the stock is trading at a mere 9 times earnings.
BESIDES investment styles, there are a few other considerations for investors choosing between the two funds. The minimum investment in Royce Gift Shares is $5,000, while Giftrust can be bought for as little as $500.
For tax purposes, contributions are not quite the same, either. Anyone can make a gift of up to $10,000 a year to another individual without estate or gift tax consequences under the Federal annual gift tax exclusion. As a present interest trust, Royce allows such gifts.
Contributions to Giftrust don't qualify for this exclusion because they are considered a gift of future interest, explained Gunnar Hughes, a spokesman for American Century Investments. Instead, investments count against the $600,000 that each person is allowed to leave free of estate and gift taxes over a lifetime. (Congress is considering whether to raise this threshold as part of its budget package for the coming year.)
Fans of Giftrust, however, note that it pays taxes as a trust each year, sparing donors and recipients that paperwork burden. Investors in Royce Gift Shares can choose to set up their trust this way as well.
For gifts to either fund, the donor determines in advance when the beneficiary will receive the assets -- no small comfort to grandparents who worry that a grandchild will squander the money before the college bills have been paid.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GERRITSEN BEACH;
A Hop, and Another, and a Lucky Library Lands on Home

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
It was five minutes to one last Thursday afternoon, and the line outside the new Gerritsen Beach Public Library was 20 people deep.
Among the patrons were the elderly, the unemployed and two schoolchildren who were not in school because, they said, their school does not have Internet access. 
 The doors to the $4.2 million library, at 28-08 Gerritsen Avenue, opened officially on April 30, marking the end of a 65-year odyssey. "We finally have a home," said Mary Graham, the branch librarian, "a big wonderful home."
Opened in 1932, the library originally occupied a small storefront on Gerritsen and Florence Avenues. The city tried to close it in 1954 because of budget problems, but community pressure kept it open.
The next year the library moved a block north, into what is now a pet shop.
In 1989, the library moved again into a 1,000 square-foot space next to Big Al's Barber Shop. Residents say the space was too small and the 9,000 volumes woefully inadequate.
"We had to demonstrate community desire for a new library," said Debbie Dong, who led the community effort to collect 5,000 signatures and encouraged children to write letters to city officials. Borough President Howard Golden was impressed enough to pledge $4 million from the discretionary funds of his office. The new branch is the first library built in the borough in four years.
"We are now realizing our goal of having a branch library within a half-mile of every Brooklynite," said Linda Locke, a library spokeswoman.
The new library, a 10,000-square-foot brick and cast-stone building, overlooks Shell Bank Creek to the west and the Marine Park marshes to the east. It has 26,000 volumes, an archive of local history and six new computers hooked up to the World Wide Web. Last Wednesday, 27 children applied for their library cards.
"It's amazing that kids come here after school instead of loitering around the neighborhood," Mrs. Graham said. "All of the sudden, they're sponges wanting to soak up anything and everything." Some 50 children sign up for the computers every afternoon. The most popular book, she said, is R. L. Stine's horror tales, called "Goosebumps."
Two sixth-graders at Marine Park Middle School, Nicole Coppolino and Shannon Carroll, said they passed up a class trip to Philadelphia to visit the library.
"We'd rather surf the net," Ms. Carroll said. "Yeah, it's not true that all kids are spoiled and like to only watch TV," Ms. Coppolino agreed. "Some like the library." CHARLIE LeDUFF

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Staying Put: The Surprising Longevity of Lifetime Employment

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
IN 1968, Lea Wait had just graduated from college and was looking for a temporary job to pay for graduate school. Her father suggested that she try AT&T, where he had spent his entire 45-year career as an accountant. So she donned a suit and matching hat and went to the personnel office.
"I wasn't too enthused," recalled Ms. Wait, 50, of Bernardsville, N.J. "I was a drama major. I thought they hired only engineers and secretaries, and I didn't want to be either." 
 Twenty-nine years later, she still works for AT&T. Her first job was writing executives' speeches. She has also had stints in the engineering, investor relations, strategic planning and sales departments. "It never occurred to me that I'd work here my entire life," said Ms. Wait, now a manager in public relations. "But it's not as though I've sat at the same desk for 29 years."
In a world of mergers, downsizings and reorganizations, people who spend the bulk of their careers with one employer are bound to be viewed as an endangered species. Cradle-to-grave employment and loyalty between employers and employees supposedly died long ago. Yet despite all the talk of multiple careers and the jobless future, a surprising number of midcareer workers appear to be on their way to collecting their gold watches. And many companies are thankful they have such old-timers.
At Custom Coach, a Columbus, Ohio, company that converts buses into motor homes and offices, Jerome Nunn, the president, said he could not satisfy his customers without his long-term employees. About half of the 18 workers who convert the vehicles have been there more than 10 years; one employee has been there 40 years.
"It takes a year to get an employee up to speed," he said. "If you have a customer with an eight-year-old bus who calls with a question, if there is no one here who worked on that unit, you have a problem."
IN 1996, nearly half of all American workers aged 45 to 54 had worked for their employer for 10 years or more, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; one-fifth of those in that age group had been with the same employer for 20 or more years. And among those 55 to 64 years old, nearly one-third had worked 20 or more years for the same employer.
AT&T, like many other companies, has had its share of layoffs and reorganizations in the last 15 years. Yet, according to Burke Stinson, a company spokesman, the typical retiree last year was 55 years old with 27 years of service; in 1978, the typical retiree was 57 and had 32 years of service. About 30 percent of its domestic work force, or about 35,500 employees, have been with AT&T for more than 20 years, he said.
The oft-quoted maxim is that the average worker can expect to change employers six or seven times before retiring. But most of that upheaval occurs in the early years of a career, according to Jonathan Veum, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The agency reported that in 1992, workers held an average of 7.5 jobs between the ages of 18 and 30. That average includes all paid work of any duration, like summer jobs during college. Job-hopping, Mr. Veum said, is most intense for people in their 20's, when many workers are single, childless, and willing to play musical jobs so they can land one that is a perfect fit.
"You slow down as you get older, and you don't have quite as much mobility between jobs," Mr. Veum said. "As you age, most of your mobility occurs within one company."
There are, of course, many benefits to long tenures, like anniversary celebrations, more vacation time and seniority, which can protect workers -- especially those in union jobs -- from layoffs.
But staying with one company, and being successful there, can be tricky, especially if your mobility is more lateral than upward.
"The impression is, you're not a go-getter," said Ron Fry, the publisher of Career Press in Franklin Lakes, N.J., and the author of "101 Great Answers to the Toughest Interview Questions" (Career Press, 1996).
"You're not on the fast track; you're on the retirement track," he said. "Another question is: 'You've been here so long, you're like an old dog. Can you convince me you can learn new tricks?' "
Stan Wood, 49, an I.B.M. employee for 18 years, has not been afraid to prove that he could. He has adapted to five different jobs since he has been with the company; in 1990, he moved from marketing management to sales when he suspected that his position might be eliminated during job cuts.
"It was a calculated career move on my part to increase the odds I wouldn't be laid off," Mr. Wood, of Jacksonville, Fla., said. "I was starting to hear rumblings, and the best place to be was calling on customers."
Learning new tricks requires a bit of balancing. Most difficult tasks are mastered in three to five years, according to Judith Bardwick, management consultant and author of "Danger in the Comfort Zone" (Amacom, 1991). So for employees to stay at peak form within an organization, they must take on new challenges about that often. If the challenges are too daunting, employees may become too anxious to perform well. On the other hand, too little risk can cause them to fall into a state of complacency, losing their value to the organization.
"On the outside, your job may continue to have the same title, but the content should change," Ms. Bardwick said. "You need to keep learning, stretching, and be required to perform at the highest level you're capable of."
Stephen Cheney, 42, of Haymarket, Va., has worked for Cherrydale Harman Auto Glass for 19 years. He said that he never intended to spend his life at one company, and that he had often thought about starting his own business. But since being promoted to store manager in 1980, he has been given plenty of autonomy and just enough challenge to keep him interested. In the early 90's, the company asked him to open up a new business. Recently, he was appointed to a business development team to come up with new markets for the company.
"I couldn't go for much more than a year without something different to work on," Mr. Cheney said.
One danger of staying with one employer is that it may take long-term employees for granted, passing them over for promotions in favor of newcomers. And because companies have eliminated layers of management in recent years, it has become more difficult for everyone who wants a promotion to get one. Hence, the common complaint: the only way to move up the organization is to threaten to move out.
When Robert Sullivan, 30, a Chicago marketing consultant, announced that he was leaving his job at an advertising agency after four years, he was suddenly offered his choice of two plum overseas assignments. "When I told them I intended to leave, that's when they said: 'Yes, we do appreciate what you do. If you need a change, here's what we can do for you.' " He decided to leave anyway.
MANY longtime employees value stability and are fiercely loyal to the company, saying they enjoy passing along its lore and culture to the next generation.
United Press International has been struggling for years to stay afloat. Yet Helen Thomas, 76, who became a reporter with United Press 54 years ago, has never wavered, even as many of her colleagues have jumped ship. "It's sad when your colleagues leave," she said. "But I've been hanging in there. I have faith." Ms. Thomas started her career there during World War II, and has been covering the White House since John F. Kennedy was President. She is amused by some of the questions younger staff members ask her, like "What is D-Day?"
"You feel a little like an antique, but you're also glad that you know the answer," Ms. Thomas said.
Johnny Glaze, 65, has also tended to stay around. A salesman for Parker Cadillac in Little Rock, Ark. for 23 years, Mr. Glaze has been a pastor at Little Rock Community Church for 36 years. He has lived in the same house for 27 years. He has been married to the same woman, Denva, for 42 years. He keeps a list of every customer to whom he has ever sold a car and sends each one a card at Christmas. When he attends the Cadillac sales meeting once a year, he marvels at all the new faces he sees, and can't understand why people don't have the patience to stay put.
"I'm like the Rock of Gibraltar," Mr. Glaze said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will China Choose Power or Wealth?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
More than two centuries ago, in 1790, a crass political deal was struck. The Virginians, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, agreed to let the Federal Government assume debts issued by the states during the Revolutionary War, and in turn Alexander Hamilton, a New Yorker, agreed to let the new nation's capital be in the South.
The ramifications of that deal are still here. The political and financial capitals of this country are hundreds of miles apart, and inhabitants of each neither know nor understand the other as well as they should. 
 Nowhere is that split more evident now than in the divergent American attitudes toward Hong Kong's impending absorption into China. "The political and economic lenses are very different," said Douglas Johnston, Merrill Lynch's senior international strategist, in an understatement.
In Washington, it is assumed that Beijing will break its promises to preserve Hong Kong's separate system and basic freedoms. Most members of Congress would deem it absurd to contemplate investing in Hong Kong on the eve of Communist rule.
But in New York, where financial thinking is dominant, Hong Kong looks much more attractive. "Global investors are looking for earnings and value, and Hong Kong has both," said the bullish Mr. Johnston.
To hear some people talk, you'd think it was Hong Kong taking over China, "You've never before taken 1.2 billion people and moved from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy," exulted Thomas B. Tuttle, the manager of the Colonial Newport Tiger fund. The fund's investments are concentrated in Hong Kong.
The Hang Seng index, Hong Kong's leading market barometer, is up 30 percent in the last year, and is 12 times higher than it was in 1984, when Britain agreed to withdraw on June 30, 1997. It has performed far better than the American stock market.
In fact, things are getting a bit giddy in Hong Kong, where regulators warned last week that some stock prices "appear to have no relation to the assets, profitability or prospects of the companies concerned." The warning was generally ignored, just as similar talk has been discounted here..
Mr. Tuttle, who wears a Mao watch, is confident that the Chinese authorities will do whatever it takes to keep Hong Kong healthy and wealthy. He thinks a greater degree of political freedom is inevitable. By 2047, when China's guarantee of a special status for Hong Kong is to expire, he thinks China will be "one of the most free-enterprise economies in the world."
That summarizes the disparity in outlook. To those versed in money, the idea that a country would not follow the path to wealth is unbelievable, and allowing more political freedom seems like a small price for China's leaders to pay. To those more attuned to ideology and human rights, the idea that one of the world's most repressive regimes will change seems equally hard to believe.
Mr. Tuttle says he would start taking money out of Hong Kong if he thought the independence of Hong Kong's courts, and with it the basic rule of law, was being compromised. Or if China tried to substitute its own paper for Hong Kong's dollar reserves, threatening to unhinge the Hong Kong dollar from its American counterpart. But he doesn't expect that either will happen.
Who's right? Markets are usually wiser than politicians. But politicians know how much people are willing to do to hold on to power. On this, Washington's crystal ball may be better than Wall Street's.

Mimi Smartypants Takes On the Assassins

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
ZIP through the aisles at the local computer store and the mayhem mounts quickly: "Ravage," "No Flesh Shall Be Spared" and "Assassin" ("Shoot first, think fast . . . or get smoked") are typical CD-ROM titles. Market research and sales show that carnage counts with teen-age boys, the target audience for many computer games.
But CD-ROM designers have discovered an emerging audience: girls 9 to 11 years old. Wired magazine recently reported that 200 new "girl games" were expected to reach store shelves or go on line this year, up tenfold from 1996. 
 Like most computer games, many will be developed on the West Coast, but one of the most critically acclaimed designers of such games for young girls, Theresa Duncan, can be found in Manhattan, in "Silicon Alley," the city's growing downtown computer district.
Ms. Duncan and two colleagues at Nicholson NY, a new-media firm in the Puck Building, at 295 Lafayette Street, just south of Houston Street, develop games with no treasures to stalk and no life forms to splatter. Their most recent CD-ROM, "Smarty," depicts the partly funky and partly dreamlike summer of a brainy 9-year-old, Mimi Smartypants.
It was widely praised by reviewers and much sought after by parents last Christmas, although it was distributed only by toll-free telephone number and sold only 6,000 copies. Wider distribution is planned for this Christmas. An earlier collaboration by Ms. Duncan, called "Chop Suey," was named "CD-ROM of the Year" for 1995 by Entertainment Weekly magazine and has sold more than 25,000 copies.
At a trade show next month in Atlanta, Ms. Duncan and her collaborators -- Jeremy Blake, an illustrator, and Wells Packard, a computer programmer -- plan to introduce a new CD-ROM game for girls. Called "Zero Zero," the game follows Pinkee Le Brun, a young French girl who explores the rooftops of Paris on New Year's Eve 1899 ("a time before Popsicles and dimestore paperbacks") and is scheduled for release in stores in September.
"I love books and I love CD-ROM's, but most of all, I love storytelling," said Ms. Duncan, 28, whose senior thesis at the University of Michigan was titled "Electric Fairy Tales: CD-ROM's and Literature."
One major difference between books and computer games is that the games can provide interactive choices, like deciding that Romeo and Juliet do not die. In "Smarty," when Mimi visits her Aunt Olive, the user can let Mimi watch television with her aunt, or double-click and have her visit Moscow, Paris or Miami Beach.
What is beginning to change the boy-dominated computer game market, however, is not computer equipment but Barbie, the popular doll by Mattel. Last Christmas, Mattel sold more than half a million copies of "Barbie Fashion Designer," making it one of the best-selling CD-ROM's ever. It enables users to design dresses for Barbie on the screen and then print them on a standard computer printer.
Headbone Interactive, a new-media company in Seattle, has been conducting focus groups with pre-teen girls, in part to find out how to duplicate Barbie's success. Their research seems to indicate that girls prefer treasure hunts, mysteries and "open-ended play" promoting collaboration. "They clearly don't like violence," said Susan Lammers, president of Headbone.
Ms. Duncan is a Detroit native, her mother a social worker and her father a factory worker. She began learning about computers in earnest when she helped edit economic fact sheets at the World Bank in Washington. There she met Monica Gesue, a photographer, who followed her to Magnet Interactive Studios, a multimedia company. Ms. Gesue illustrated "Chop Suey," Ms. Duncan's story of two sisters named Lily and June Bugg, whose adventures begin when they eat too much Chinese food.
Ms. Duncan says she bases many characters on herself (Mimi's voice is hers speeded up electronically) and on her own whimsical grandmother, Margaret Lundgren, an art teacher with an antic sense of humor. Ms. Duncan recalls the day her grandmother spilled coffee on her blouse, then painted flowers on it to disguise the stain.
Her granddaughter's approach to computers is similarly offbeat. "I don't like verisimilitude," Ms. Duncan said. "I like folk art. Computer screens are intrinsically alienating, and folk art, with its quirkiness and its hand-drawn flaws, adds warmth."
"Smarty" required 3,000 drawings, said Mr. Blake, the illustrator, adding, "Theresa and I have similar senses of humor." In the CD-ROM, a butterfly plays Chopin on the piano and a Martian shows slides of his summer vacation on Earth, both Blake ideas. "Some of our best ideas come up when somebody says, 'You've got to be kidding,' " Ms. Duncan said.
Translating her text and Mr. Blake's pictures into computer data is the job of Mr. Packard, who teaches CD-ROM programming at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. He also has to animate things like swimming fish in an aquarium and determine the element in a scene that a child might want to click on, like a teapot at the center of a table.
Ultimately, Ms. Duncan said, what is important is not the form of the storytelling, but its content. As Mimi's Aunt Olive put it, "Poetry is what spices up smarts."

Unlike many CD-ROM games aimed at teen-age boys, those marketed to pre-teen girls stress cooperation over conquest, whimsy over weaponry. Chart/photos shows how Theresa Duncan and her collaborators conceived their CD-ROM, "Smarty," starring Mimi Smartypants.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Signs of Gold in Latin America's Blue Chips

BYLINE: By LARRY DIGNAN 

 BODY:
TRUE to their name, blue-chip stocks are not cheap these days. Indeed, their increase in value has been the primary engine of the bull market. But not all big companies come with big price tags: the Latin American stocks that trade here as American depository receipts are often relatively inexpensive, even though they come from one of the world's hottest economic regions.
Yet, making money in Latin America, as in any emerging-market region, is neither quick nor easy. "If you're investing in Latin America with a three-month view, you are going to get hammered," said Stephen Oler, portfolio manager of the Templeton Latin America fund. "You will be rewarded handsomely," but only "if you take a 5- to 10-year view, and can stomach the blips." 
 Still, blue chips in Latin America often weather crises like the 1994 Mexican peso devaluation somewhat better than smaller companies do. Add in the region's recent market performance -- Brazil's Bovespa index is up 48 percent this year, and Mexico's Bolsa, about 19 percent -- and these stocks can look alluring.
Consider Telebras, the Brazilian telephone company, which accounts for 40 percent of the market capitalization of the Bovespa.
Money managers love Brazil because it has earmarked various state enterprises for privatization. On May 6, the Government sold off Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, a mining giant; the event strengthened investor confidence that the sale of parts of Telebras late this year or early in 1998 will proceed as scheduled.
These hopes have doubled the price of Telebras A.D.R.'s, from about $60 in early 1996 to $128.25 at Friday's close. But that run-up does not bother Donald Hoskins, portfolio manager for the Excelsior Emerging Americas fund, which counts Telebras among its holdings.
"Telebras is still extremely cheap, so don't be put off because it's appreciated so much," Mr. Hoskins said. He thinks Telebras will hit $150 a share by the end of the year, and will still be a buy at that level.
Mr. Hoskins judges the A.D.R.'s cheapness by the ratio of its stock price to the amount of cash flow per share, a measure often used in analyzing foreign companies. Telebras has a ratio of 5.5, based on consensus earnings estimates for 1997, compared with 6.6, on average, for the Baby Bells of the United States. That makes Telebras far cheaper than the Bells, he said, even after discounting the company because it is an emerging-market play.
Mark Madden, a portfolio manager for the Pioneer Emerging Markets fund, says Telebras has great growth potential. There are 8 telephone lines for every 100 people in Brazil, compared with 63 per 100 in the United States, he said, and Brazil's cellular market has hardly been tapped. Telebras should also be able to widen its profit margins by modernizing its network and increasing prices for local service.
OVER all, Mr. Hoskins estimates that earnings at Telebras will grow 28 percent or more annually for the next five years.
The big caveat with Telebras is regulatory uncertainty in Brazil. "They still have to set the regulatory environment," Mr. Hoskins said. "Essentially, an entire F.C.C."
Telefonica de Argentina, one of that country's two major telecommunications plays, also holds promise. The company controls the country's northern market and a large part of the business in Buenos Aires.
"Argentina hasn't been in the limelight because the focus is on Brazil," Mr. Oler said. But "economic growth has been surprisingly good" there, he said, and telecommunications, privatized in 1990, should benefit.
Argentina is coming out of a recession, and its annual economic growth rate, 4.4 percent last year, was expected to reach 7 percent for the first quarter this year. Inflation is almost nonexistent, at one-tenth of 1 percent last year, Mr. Oler said.
Telefonica also stands to gain from a growing cellular market, and from its connection to Spain's telephone company, Telefonica de Espana, which recently teamed up with MCI Communications and British Telecommunications, the industry giants that will form a company called Concert. The alliance should help Telefonica de Argentina keep long-distance costs low, improving margins.
Mr. Madden is less bullish over Telefonica, however, because Argentina has 16 telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants, double the number in Brazil. And while the regulatory framework for telecommunications is settled in Argentina, there are other unknowns, like a pending Supreme Court decision on whether the industry can increase local rates.
In Mexico, too, there is uncertainty, mostly over elections in July. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, long in control, is expected to lose some power. But the question is how the PRI may handle that loss.
"The key is that the transition goes smoothly," said Gabriel Wallach, an analyst for Fiduciary Trust Company International.
But many analysts are optimistic, and hope that after the elections, the Mexican market will reach levels not seen since before the peso devaluation.
ONE beneficiary may be Desc Sociedad de Fomento Industrial, which produces a wide range of goods, from foods to chemicals. Desc's primary growth business, however, is transmissions, pistons, axles and other car parts, and it has become a large supplier to General Motors, Chrysler and Ford.
"This company spent 10 years positioning itself for Nafta," Mr. Oler said. When the trade treaty took effect, Desc had much business in the United States and continued to be a big supplier to Mexican auto makers. Mr. Oler, whose fund owns Desc A.D.R.'s, estimates that the company's cash flow will grow 15 percent annually for the next two years.
Like many other Latin American A.D.R.'s, Desc's are inexpensive, Mr. Oler added. Indeed, the shares trade at just 8.6 times current earnings -- not much more than one-third of the 21.4 average multiple for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
A stronger peso could hurt Desc, Mr. Oler said, but the company, which has cut expenses, should be able to keep reasonable margins.
Mr. Hoskins likes Grupo Elektra, an appliance and electronics retailer with nearly 500 stores in Mexico. The company profited greatly during Mexico's recent recession by focusing on lower- and middle-income consumers, which account for 92 percent of the country.
Elektra is also using this network of stores to offer high-margin financial services like cash transfers and credit. The company has formed links with Western Union and with Grupo Financiero Serfin, a Mexican bank, to sell the services, which also help Elektra's customers to buy its appliances and electronic goods.
In the first quarter, Elektra's revenues were up 48 percent from the corresponding period last year. Earnings, excluding extraordinary items, were up 22 percent.
"This is a well-run company that has a store in nearly every neighborhood," said Mr. Hoskins, whose fund owns shares in the company. "And there's upside. Elektra can have a 25 percent growth rate a year for the next five years." Grupo Elektra's A.D.R.'s trade at just 14.9 times current earnings.
On the downside, the company's success will breed imitators, analysts say.
Moreover, investors in Grupo Elektra, as well as other blue-chip A.D.R.'s, may lose one of the benefits of international investing. That advantage focuses on "correlation," which measures whether stock markets move together, in opposite directions or follow no pattern.
By putting money in stock markets -- like those of emerging nations -- with low or negative correlations with the United States market, investors hope to hedge their holdings. If the American market falters, they reason, a foreign one may improve. But blue-chip A.D.R.'s, because they are big and because they are traded in the United States, often act in the same way as domestic equities and thus cancel this advantage.
"You have to watch out for who owns the securities," said Eric Fry, president of Holl International, an asset management firm in San Francisco. "Seventy percent of A.D.R.'s are owned by Americans, so it makes sense that they will track the U.S. markets."

As for Best Friends, Marilyn Knew Best

BYLINE: By SUZY MENKES; Suzy Menkes is the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
I MAGINE Courtney Love, poured into her white Oscars dress, recreating for the 1990's the breathless whisper of Marilyn Monroe. She opens her lipstick-smeared mouth and sings, "Diamonds are a girl's best friend."
Diamonds for Courtney Love? Those flashy trinkets of trophy wives are cool? 
 You would think so if you watched the celebrity lineup in high-wattage sparklers at the Cannes Film Festival. There was Isabelle Adjani with a lattice of diamonds round her John Galliano Chinese-style gown, Liv Tyler in a Harry Winston gem trellis, Demi Moore up to her neck in rubies and diamonds, the Chinese actress Gong Li in a chain of brilliants and Naomi Campbell with a diamond-fringe necklace and dark shades above a Givenchy Empire gown.
All that strutting the stuff in Cannes had followed the Academy Awards, which People magazine memorably described in 1996 as about "tears, cleavage and diamonds." This year, Ms. Love redefined glamour in her snowy Versace gown, with a cascade of diamonds at her neck -- a far cry from Sharon Stone, who last year wore a Gap turtleneck to the Academy Awards.
In "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," Marilyn's lyric goes: "Talk to me Harry Winston, tell me all about it." Did he ever! For the Oscars, that New York jeweler put Winona Ryder in cluster earrings, Mira Sorvino in dangling ruby and diamond ones. Even Brenda Blethyn had swapped her downtrodden persona in "Secrets and Lies" for razzle-dazzle.
There is nothing new about rocks and stars. An exhibition at Cannes showed photographs of a sophisticated Marlene Dietrich and an ingenue Katharine Hepburn, both draped in diamonds. Cartier's archives feature the chunky glitter bracelets that once belonged to Gloria Swanson. Elizabeth Taylor's appetite for diamonds is legendary.
Of course, we know that celebrities today are lent diamonds by jewelers so that they can sparkle in public. But they also wear them in the real world. Brooke Shields and Gwyneth Paltrow both wear a diamond solitaire on a chain (said to be engagement gifts). Models are mad for Isaac Mizrahi's "angel rings" (so dainty, they must be hung round the neck) and for Marc Jacobs's celestial sun, moon and stars scatter pins.
The final seal of approval for diamonds as the quintessence of cool came when Visionaire made them the subject of its latest issue, packaged as an oversize deck of cards. At the opening party during New York's fashion week in April, drag queens in a glitter-gulch of (fake) gems competed with the striking visual images from the Visionaire deck: Karl Lagerfeld's hunky male with a diamond tear drop in one eye; Iman with gilded nipple, ram's horns and diamond rings in a computer-enhanced photo by Inez van Lamsweerde.
It seems only a moment ago that diamonds represented stolid suburban values -- matrons (present and future) celebrating engagements and anniversaries. Or they belonged to the Ivana Trump school: if you have your man, flaunt his wallet.
To be sure, showing one's wealth has crept back into style now that the economy has picked up. But what alchemy turned diamonds from vulgar globs to the height of hip?
The jewelry revival could be dated from 1993, when Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss pulled down their mini-kilts on Vivienne Westwood's runway to show off their bejeweled navel rings. Rocks in new places became a fashionable secret.
After the great clear-out of the 90's, when fashion junked the gilt and glitzy, the absence of visible jewelry was the style. Then, fine jewelry, something precious that was inconspicuous, crept into the shows of hip designers like Mr. Galliano and Mr. Jacobs. Post-minimalism, fashion was searching for a fresh start in adornment. What could be purer than the clear-as-water diamond?
British club kids picked up on vintage jewelry that was so out of style that paste versions could be bought for a song. Think tiaras. Mr. Galliano put diadems on his models in a 1993 show, and Amanda de Cadenet and Ms. Love appeared in Los Angeles in tiaras, like trashy fairy princesses.
Gianni Versace entered a tiara anonymously for the 1996 Diamonds International Awards -- and won first prize. Miuccia Prada turned out in a diadem at a party in Milan, Italy. Improbable as such a revival might seem, when the London jeweler Wartski staged an exhibition of tiaras in March, 50,000 visitors gaped at creations belonging to the famous, from Elton John to Joan Rivers.
 A DEFINING moment for diamond jewelry came in Chanel's summer couture show, when Karl Lagerfeld sent out the wacky aristocratic model Iris Palmer with a tinselly diamond tiara, necklace, earrings -- the works. It was a smart way to celebrate Chanel's new fine jewelry line.
But hang on a minute. Wasn't it Coco Chanel who decided back in the 1920's that diamonds were irredeemably bourgeois -- heavy-handed symbols of wealth and status? Her piles of gilt chains and faux bijoux were supposed to show the world what fun fashion jewelry could be.
It is a nice irony that after the glitzy 80's, nothing looks more bourgeois and matronly than loads of gilt. The symbols that Chanel used to free women from over-opulence now chain them to an older generation.
What makes diamonds look new and modern is the attitude of the women wearing them -- forthright and independent. There is a delicious defiance in Madonna flashing her diamonds. You know that she didn't have to rely on a man to get them for her. Now, is that cool, or what?

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Retailers Swim Against a Tide of Shoppers' Bad Debts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
FOR much of 1996, retail analysts and investors were gleeful as they watched same-store sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company rise past their monthly marks of a year earlier. But a sizable chunk of those sales never made it into the company's coffers, let alone to its bottom line.
While Sears, Roebuck's gross sales rose 9 percent last year, to $38.2 billion, its write-offs for shoppers' bad debt increased much more quickly -- about 50 percent, to $1.0 billion. Add it all up, and the company gave away 9.6 days' worth of shirts, washing machines and nightgowns last year. 
 And Sears is not the only unwilling philanthropist in retailing. Last year was one of the worst for the industry in terms of bad debt, or customer accounts that went unpaid. High rates of personal bankruptcies and the industry's breathless pursuit of new charge accounts over the last few years combined to create the increases.
As a result, many retail companies have been struggling to bring the debt levels down. They are cooling their courtships with new credit customers and fattening reserves to cover the expanding bad debt.
"Bad debt was a record cost issue to be dealt with in 1996," said Tom Tashjian, a retail analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "Most department stores that offer credit cards had to increase bad-debt reserves and the write-offs they took."
But solving the problem may not be easy; bad debts are rising fast. At Nordstrom, for example, bad debt grew 30 percent in 1996, to $51.3 million. And in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federated Department Stores cited a 35 percent increase in bad debts, to $172 million last year from $127 million in 1995.
Of course, write-offs are well worth it, even when they rise rapidly, if the income provided by credit card sales and the hefty interest rates and fees that accompany them is large enough.
"The finance-charge revenues we got were on plan last year," said Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated, adding that this made the high levels of bad debt tolerable though still unpleasant. Increases in such levels are "a cyclical thing," she added, saying that Federated is not too concerned about a continuation of the problem.
But consider it this way: Federated had sales of $15.2 billion last year -- or $41.6 million a day. So if bad debts accounted for $172 million, Federated would have needed more than four extra shopping days to recover the revenue that went up in smoke.
Investors should particularly keep their eyes on Sears, because its credit card operation is among the largest in the country. Retailers with smaller credit card businesses may not be hit as hard by bad debt come earnings time, but all investors in retailing should be vigilant.
"I think it is an issue, though not a major one," Mr. Tashjian said. "It can eat up to 5 percent of company's earnings."
The industry is trying to fix the problem in several ways. For example, Mr. Tashjian estimated that it increased reserve levels -- the amount that companies put aside to cover bad debt -- by about 50 percent in 1996.
Several companies have also slowed their energetic courting of new accounts, analysts said. Some retailers, like Carson Pirie Scott, a department store chain based in Milwaukee, started doing so in the second half of 1995, when the bad-debt monster surfaced on the balance sheets.
"We decided at that point we would be better served not going after so much new credit," said James Stoffel, vice president and treasurer of the company.
While curtailing new credit seems the easiest way to stave off bad debt, the process has big risks. For one, identifying who among potential card holders will ignore their bills is no easy science; Mr. Stoffel and other retail executives said that many of their customers who filed for personal bankruptcy were a mere 15 to 30 days late in payment, or in fact not behind at all.
Further, department store credit cards are used to drive sales and profits in several ways. Retailers send their credit card customers special-sales mailings and can easily track their spending habits and market directly to them. Interest rates and fees are generally high. Also, credit card sales tend to be about 50 percent higher than those made with cash, which not only lifts the top line but helps fatten same-store sales figures, an important number retailers use in selling their worthiness to Wall Street.
"My sense is that people are tightening their standards," said Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst at NatWest Securities. "But you don't want to do it too much or you lose market share."
Other retailers, like Sears, May and Montgomery Ward, have taken a different and more controversial route. They have asked credit card holders who have filed for bankruptcy to sign agreements reaffirming that they will pay on some sort of schedule. This aggressive approach -- which may reveal how seriously the retail industry is taking the bad-debt problem -- has prompted criticism and even lawsuits against some of the companies.
Consumer debt levels, meanwhile, are still rising, though more slowly than last year.
"The problem is not getting better in level," said David A. Poneman, a retail analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "We are still seeing double-digit increases in personal bankruptcy. Some people say it is improving because they are seeing 20 percent bad-debt increases over last year, while last year it was up 40 percent. That is an improvement, but it remains a significant problem."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A Tale of Unraveled Fortune

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: EVANSVILLE, Ind.

 BODY:
AS Robert Z. Morris was building a fortune in southern Indiana grain and Florida real estate, his mind often flashed back to a scene from his youth. It was the middle of the Depression and his father was desperately trying to borrow money to keep his farm and grain elevator going. Finally, he turned to his life insurance policy. Mutual of Omaha came through with $500, and the family business was saved.
That powerful lesson left the younger Mr. Morris with a deep faith in the value of life insurance. As the years rolled by and his own business empire flourished, he became as addicted to insurance as some investors are to the stock market. In 1934, he started with a $5,000 policy that named his wife as beneficiary. From then on, he snapped up policies "off and on for all of my life," he said, believing he was buying protection for his family and an investment vehicle for passing on his wealth. He ultimately acquired nearly 100 policies that he expected would pay roughly $30 million on his death, squirreling them away in an office vault. To keep track, he had a secretary draw up a list of the policies in longhand on a pale green ledger sheet. 
 But 12 years ago, Mr. Morris entered into a deal that undermined his confidence in the insurance industry and wiped out a large chunk of his wealth. In the process, he became one of tens of thousands of people who say they were burned by an industry marketing push in the early 1980's to hold onto policyholders' money -- a push that has since resulted in a barrage of lawsuits and hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and compensation payments.
But the unusual combination of his wealth, his passion for insurance policies and his readiness to pay a stream of unexpected bills totaling millions of dollars with barely a peep of protest makes Mr. Morris's story one of the most spectacular financial follies of recent years.
Now 82 years old and fighting Parkinson's disease, Mr. Morris is embroiled in a bitter dispute to get some of his money back.
And the insurance companies that provided the policies -- the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company and the American General Life Insurance Company -- as well as a Michigan agent who handled the transaction, James W. O'Neill, are not budging. They say the deal was fair and square and that Mr. Morris was showered with details.
"This is a not a situation where an insurance agent goes out to Ma and Pa Kettle on the farm on one visit and sells them a bill of goods," said Brent R. Weil, an Evansville lawyer who represents Mr. O'Neill. "This is a transaction that involved at least 10 visits to Mr. Morris over the course of nearly a year and volumes of projections were generated. Mr. Morris is a very financially sophisticated person."
At the time Mr. Morris made his move, interest rates were soaring, and millions of Americans were either abandoning or borrowing from their low-yielding whole-life insurance policies -- those that accumulate a cash value over time -- and moving the money into higher-yielding money-market funds and certificates of deposit.
To stanch the flow, insurance companies urged customers to convert their old policies, with returns of 4 to 5 percent, into new ones that paid twice as much or more. At the instigation of his agent, Mr. Morris did just that. After reviewing all of Mr. Morris's insurance holdings, Mr. O'Neill reduced the portfolio to about 60 policies. In his most striking move, he converted about 30 of the old policies, with death benefits for the Morris family of $6.4 million and annual premiums of $326,012, into 15 policies with death benefits of $10.1 million.
It was almost like waving a magic wand and doubling your money. Best of all, the projected interest on $2.28 million that was being shifted into the new policies, mainly as loans from the cash value of the old policies, was expected to pay all future premiums. It seemed a rather painless way for a 70-year-old man to make his money grow for his heirs.
That, at least, is how Mr. Morris says the agent explained it to him. In truth, such a happy outcome depended on the very unlikely event that interest rates would stay in double digits indefinitely. If they fell, however, Mr. Morris would have to make up the difference. All of this was explained in the fine print, but savvy as Mr. Morris was in his own business ventures, he says he never read the fine print. He says he didn't think he had to; after all, his absolute trust in insurance companies had been ingrained for more than half a century.
Besides, he said, "You could put 100 people on the witness stand and ask them if they'd read their insurance policies, every word of them, and you might find one."
So it came as a bit of a shock when, just a year after he made the switch, he received bills totaling roughly $300,000 from the two insurers. Puzzled, he dialed the toll-free number that each company had listed on its premium notice, he said, and, in each case, spoke with a woman whose name he did not catch. Both representatives, he said, told him the payments were necessary to bring his policies up to a point where no further premiums would be required.
THOSE brief telephone conversations were enough to satisfy Mr. Morris. His belief in the integrity of the insurance industry outweighed any doubts. He wrote both checks.
He did not hear anything from the companies, he said, for nearly three years. Then in late 1989, Manufacturers Life told him he owed $142,720. He paid. The next year, it sent a bill for $243,961. He paid again.
The next year, 1991, he got a bill from Manufacturers Life for $249,521. Then for the first time since 1986, he got a bill from American General, for $54,530. He paid both.
The next year, he paid the two companies $250,682. In 1993, he forked out a total of $726,208. In 1994, he paid $683,539, and in 1995 and 1996, he paid an additional $1.3 million. In all, the policies that he says should have cost him nothing in additional premiums had drained away roughly $3.8 million in a little more than a decade.
Finally, he decided he had had enough. On July 31, 1995, Mr. Morris, his wife, Alice, and their three children -- David, Joe, and Sue Morris Leonard -- sued the two companies and the Michigan agent, for full reimbursement of all the premiums he had paid since 1985, plus interest. The suit also demanded assurances that there would be no future requests for premiums, that the policies would stay in force until Mr. Morris's death and that the two companies would pay the death benefits.
Judge David A. Hamilton of Federal District Court in Indianapolis is studying arguments from both sides and has given no indication when he will rule.
Even if Mr. Morris never recovers a penny, his potential losses -- including the initial $2.28 million and the $3.8 million in subsequent premium payments, will hardly drive his family to the poorhouse. He figures his net worth today is roughly $7 million, besides the insurance policies. Even so, he and his wife are angry at the way they believe they were cheated, and frazzled by the emotional toll of their battle with the insurance companies. "The premiums have been devouring us," Mrs. Morris said.
THE deal with Mr. Morris, who even now, at 82, can summon up minute details of business ventures he undertook years ago, was very much like those that drew in tens of thousands of other Americans. Scores of companies, including giants like the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the New York Life Insurance Company, have been sued by clients who say they were coaxed into exchanging perfectly good policies for new ones in a practice known as churning, and plaintiffs' lawyers say they receive calls every week with new complaints. Most of the suits involve policies in the $25,000 to $200,000 range, not in the millions, as with the Morrises.
One company being sued by the Morrises, Manufacturers Life, is also trying to fend off policyholders seeking Federal court approval for a class-action suit.
"There are in excess of 1,800 life-insurance companies in the country and the vast majority engaged in this behavior through the 80's," said John Stoia, a San Diego partner in the law firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach, which has handled many of the cases and is engaged in the class-action effort against Manufacturers Life.
So far, about a dozen insurance companies, including Prudential, Metropolitan Life and New York Life, have agreed to pay more than $815 million in fines and compensation. In one of those settlements, Prudential has said it will be paying at least $410 million to compensate up to 10.7 million policyholders, and some analysts estimate that the costs for the company, the nation's largest life insurer, could run to $2 billion.
The lawsuits generally contend that agents -- who stood to gain a lot in commissions when they sold new policies -- misled customers by telling them that if they replaced their old life insurance policies with new ones providing double-digit returns, they would get more coverage and the new policies would virtually pay for themselves. Some companies, like Manufacturers Life, armed their agents with sales literature about "Vanishing Premiums."
According to most of the suits, the agents didn't adequately explain that premiums for new policies would start higher simply because customers were older, or warn them that interest rates were likely to fall eventually, forcing up premiums.
The new policies sold like hot cakes. But interest rates did decline, and the Morrises and legions of other policyholders found themselves confronting higher premiums than they had ever imagined. Many people, unable to keep up the payments, let policies lapse and lost everything they had put into them.
Mr. Morris's unusual strategy for transferring his wealth to his heirs through insurance policies rather than trusts gets mixed reviews. His plan was to spend most of his fortune -- which by the early 1980's totaled $31 million in cash, stocks and real estate -- in his final years and leave his family with roughly $35 million in insurance benefits. His twist was to grant ownership of the policies to the beneficiaries. While he has had to pay gift taxes of up to 55 percent on the premiums, he has eliminated the far larger estate taxes of up to 55 percent that they would have to pay on the $35 million if he had maintained ownership.
"It's a rare and sophisticated person who will pay gift taxes," said Alan S. Halperin, a Manhattan trust and estate lawyer. "A lot of people would rather hold on to the money thinking they'll be able to do something magical with it. Or, they tell themselves, 'Maybe the tax laws will change.' "
On the other hand, because insurance has a relatively low rate of return, Mr. Morris might have been able to build a bigger estate -- and still distribute it through gifts -- by investing in stocks and bonds. Bart L. Fooden, a financial planner in New York, said Mr. Morris probably would have been wise to diversify his portfolio beyond insurance. "If he lives to 90," Mr. Fooden said, "he will probably come out worse than if he had invested in stocks and bonds because he will have paid so much in premiums."
No one can say what is the right number of insurance policies to own. But most experts say they usually think of a dozen as a lot. Lee Slavutin, a New York agent who represents several life insurance companies in transactions with wealthy clients, said people rarely buy insurance coverage that equals or exceeds the value of their estate, as Mr. Morris did. Dr. Slavutin, a physician who says he derives more joy from selling insurance than from practicing medicine, said people often estimate the cost of their estate taxes and buy a life insurance policy just to cover that amount.
But once Mr. Morris had amassed all his policies, consolidation may not have been the best remedy, Dr. Slavutin said. Because Mr. Morris was older, he had to pay a higher premium rate for the policies he bought in 1985. His health had deteriorated, and that pushed up his premiums, too. According to court papers, commissions drained more than $400,000 from money that might otherwise have gone to bolstering his old policies' cash value.
At the time of the consolidation, the Morrises' agent presented them written warning notices, as required by Indiana, Michigan and many other states, including New York. One warning from Manufacturers Life, signed by Mr. Morris, cautioned that the decision to buy a replacement policy "could be a good one -- or possibly a mistake." It went on to advise, "make a careful comparison of your existing policy and the proposed policy."
Mr. Morris had always displayed a razor-sharp business acumen. He grew up helping his father in the corn fields of their 200-acre farm and in the family's weathered wooden grain elevator. At 14, he took a part-time job as a handyman at a Willy's Overland dealership run by his cousin. With a small loan from the local bank, quietly backed by his father, he began raising hogs. At 15 he bought his first car, a new Willy's Overland Whippet. That same year, 1929, on the day before the banks were closed, he withdrew $900 in savings and bought a new Chevrolet truck to start an ice-delivery business. And, at one of the worst points in the economic history of the country, he made money.
He married Alice Wood out of high school and never gave much thought to college. Instead, he settled in at his father's grain business. At 22, he was entrusted with half a dozen grain elevators.
When he sold the grain business for several million dollars 29 years later, he had 13 elevators, 17 tractor-trailer rigs and a fleet of 52 river barges, making him one of the biggest independent grain-elevator operators in the country. Mainly as a hedging device, he also held a seat on the Chicago Board of Trade.
To avoid heavy taxes when he sold the grain business, he found a clever way to reduce the cash in the transaction by getting his buyers to trade him a Florida cattle ranch, which, until he had come up with it, they had not owned. Then he went on to specialize in making big profits on real estate that no one else wanted to buy. He revived a failed plastics company and invested in banks. Once, he bought 100 half-finished railroad boxcars that were headed for the scrap heap. He sold the cypress interiors for more than he had paid for the cars, then made more money by sawing the cars in half and selling them as construction sheds.
MR. MORRIS was also an incredibly trusting man. In New York to sell his grain business, he left his suitcase with a taxi driver who promised to pick him up later and take him to the airport. The buyers in the grain deal were so stunned at what Mr. Morris had done that they trooped down to the front of their skyscraper, expecting to commiserate with the naive out-of-towner. To the amazement of everyone but Mr. Morris, there was the cabbie waiting at curbside, just as he had promised.
With the 7,000-acre ranch he received in the grain-business sale, Mr. Morris moved into real estate in Florida. He bought an agency in Sarasota with 13 employees and more than quadrupled the staff, earning commissions from the sales of homes and businesses, but just as important, using the company as a way to find properties he could buy and quickly resell at a profit.
It might seem incredible for a man with Mr. Morris's Midas touch to stumble into an insurance quagmire. But it isn't unusual at all, said Melvyn Weiss, a New York partner in Milberg, Weiss who has worked out more than a half-dozen settlements between big insurance companies and angry customers.
Mr. Weiss says the wealthy are as susceptible as anyone to insurance pitches and are just as befuddled by the arcane legal language in the documents. And, like everybody else, they usually assume that agents representing brand-name companies like Manufacturers Life and American General talk straight with them.
"They don't spend an inordinate amount of time studying the policy," Mr. Weiss said. "The contracts are typically very, very confusing. The big companies have cultivated images of trust and people tend to believe what they're told."
That is just about how Mr. Morris, a hulking man with a voice that has grown raspy as a consequence of his Parkinson's disease, says it went for him. "I relied a great deal on the fact that he was a licensed agent for the insurance people and that as such, he should be reliable," Mr. Morris said of his agent, Mr. O'Neill.
Another factor leading to his imbroglio was the pride Mr. Morris took -- and still takes -- in doing things his way. While he says he calls on lawyers now and then to chisel into legalese the deals he has single-handedly shaped, and relies on a consulting firm to advise him on his taxes, he scorns the idea of seeking outside advice on whether to buy insurance or anything else.
"What for?" he asked with a crusty edge one morning, straightening himself in a barrel-backed Windsor chair in the raw-brick lounge of his office. "Who the hell could tell me when to buy or sell?" On the walls were a couple of original Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey posters. An antique slot machine sat on a roll-top desk and the brass nameplate from a Florida hotel that Mr. Morris bought and sold three times was propped up in a bookcase behind a miniature 1956 pink Cadillac convertible, like the red one he once owned.
And there really wasn't much to understand about insurance policies until the late 1970's, when companies began introducing a complex structure known as universal life. Previously, the most widely sold policies had paid a rather steady, albeit low interest rate with unvarying premiums and a gradual buildup of cash values that could be borrowed against. The new policies not only provided sharply higher interest yields, but permitted customers to vary what they paid in premiums, depending on how big a nest egg they were shooting for. They could even skip payments entirely, as long as enough cash had accumulated in the policy to cover certain basic operating expenses.
Not understanding the innovations, Mr. Morris now says, he felt he was paying up the new policies forever with the initial installment of $2.28 million. In fact, he was establishing a base against which he could earn interest. In court documents, Mr. O'Neill says that at Mr. Morris's suggestion he used 10 percent as the basis for projecting the performance of the policies. The two companies were then paying 10.5 percent and 11 percent. But interest rates fell. The two companies in the dispute are now paying between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent. And, by not paying into the policies, but leaving them to draw down money to cover the minimum expenses, he was making matters worse, eroding the base against which interest might have been earned.
Besides, Mr. Morris says, Mr. O'Neill was pretty convincing. They had met when Mr. O'Neill bought a penthouse in one of Mr. Morris's condominiums in Sarasota. They struck up a friendship, and in 1985 Mr. O'Neill looked over Mr. Morris's vast insurance portfolio.
While Mr. O'Neill says in court documents that he showed computer projections of how the policies would perform with interest of 10 percent over 20 years, Mr. Morris says he and the agent did not dwell on the matter of interest rates. Rather, as he recalls, the agent explained that because of demographic and economic changes, insurance companies were able to offer more coverage at lower cost: People were living longer and, with higher interest rates, companies were receiving higher returns on their investments.
Mr. Morris said his understanding was that interest rates would not affect his out-of-pocket premium expenses, but would only alter how much the company made. "They wouldn't lose," in any case, Mr. Morris said. "They just wouldn't come out as well" if rates dropped.
Mr. O'Neill would not speak with a reporter. But his lawyer, Mr. Weil, said Mr. Morris's version was contrary to what he was told and shown by the agent. Spokesmen for both companies declined to go beyond the voluminous documents in the case, although John E. Pluhowski, the director of corporate communications for the American General Corporation, the parent of the life insurance company, said his company had "acted properly" and strongly believed that the Morrises' complaint was "without merit."
In a letter to Mr. Morris's accountant that is dated March 6, 1985, and is part of the court record, Mr. O'Neill wrote that the annual premium for the 15 policies would be some $300,000, about $25,000 less than Mr. Morris had been paying on the policies that were to be consolidated. His point was that Mr. Morris's coverage would go from $6.4 million to $10.1 million and he would wind up paying a tad less in premiums.
"My client never represented to him that he would not have premiums to pay," Mr. Weil said.
Mr. Weil said the computer projections that are now a part of the case record, indicated that annual payments would be required on all but 2 of the 15 policies. In letters in the case record, Mr. Morris asked in late 1986 for a clarification on interest rates and asked at one point, "Won't these policies carry themselves for the next three to five years without any additional payment." Responding to a query from Mr. Morris, Mr. O'Neill said in a letter on Nov. 24, 1986, that without further payments, 2 of the 15 policies would run for 14 years and the others would continue in force for four to seven years. Every year, Mr. Weil said, the companies sent Mr. Morris reports on each policy that included the warning that coverage would end in a few years if no further payments were made.
All that may be technically true, said Mr. Morris's son, David, a commodities trader who sat sat in on some of the discussions between his father and Mr. O'Neill. Even so, he believes his father was misled.
"I don't think he ever came out and said, 'here's a deal where I can assure you you will never have to pay any premiums again,' but that was the impression he gave," David Morris said. "No rational person would have done what we did if he realized there was such a potential downside to it."
Even Mr. Weil concedes that Mr. Morris may have been confused. As recently as a year ago, when Mr. Morris was questioned by lawyers for nearly eight hours, he was saying that no loans -- which he says he always avoided in his business ventures -- had been used to finance the 15 policies. "But the bulk of this was pure loan money coming from existing policies," Mr. Weil said. "He still couldn't fathom that."
Mr. O'Neill's letter laying out the deal on the 15 policies did not mention the balance of Mr. Morris's policies, which now number 43 with a face value of about $25 million and annual premiums of about $220,000. Some of those policies are similar to the ones in dispute. But Mr. Morris says no one ever told him he would not have to pay premiums on them and he says he has no complaints. Most of the policies are on the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Morris, but some are on the lives of their children and grandchildren; consumer advocates discourage such policies on young children because they have no one to support and because other investments often provide better returns.
Mr. O'Neill was apparently up front about the $400,000 to $500,000 in initial commissions that he would receive in the transaction. In court documents, he said Mr. Morris directed him to share $50,000 to $100,000 of that fee with an agent who would be losing commissions on policies he had earlier sold Mr. Morris and who has since died.
THE fact that Mr. Morris made a series of payments over several years before the suit was filed has provided his opponents with ammunition to argue that the six-year statute of limitations in Indiana had run its course and that the case should be dismissed. Mr. O'Neill's lawyer says that if Mr. Morris expected not to pay any more premiums, he should have either filed suit in 1986 when the first demands for premiums were made or taken action "to clarify what the situation was."
But Mr. Morris's lawyer, Henry S. Alford of Louisville, says that his client regarded the payments in 1986 as reasonable adjustments to the deal and that when no premium requests were made in 1987 and 1988 he believed the policies were doing just as he had expected. It was not until late 1989, Mr. Alford says, that Mr. Morris began to believe he had been misled. Using that benchmark, Mr. Morris would be just within the time limit for bringing suit for intentional fraud.
But Mr. Weil said there was no fraud. "There may have been some misunderstanding," he said, "but there was no intentional fraud."
Struggling to cope with the mounting costs, the family has abandoned two policies worth $1.68 million at redemption and turned over six other policies worth $5.1 million to a Chicago company that has agreed to keep up the premiums and give the family a diminishing percentage of the death benefit, depending on how long Mr. Morris lives. Five policies, with a face value of $4,605,811, are involved in the suit.
Mr. Morris still goes every morning to his rambling office on the second floor of a bank building he bought years ago in the heart of this southern Indiana city. In shirt sleeves, open collar and wide suspenders, he manages a substantial securities portfolio and a string of properties and keeps an eye out for new deals. Now, as he has for most of his life, he operates mainly on his own, assisted only by a secretary.
Over the years, Mr. Morris says, friends advised him that he had accumulated more than enough insurance. But he just kept buying, thinking he understood insurance. Now though, he confessed the other day, "I don't think I know much about it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
For Digital's Chief, A Last Grab for Glory

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
EAGER to change its stodgy image, the Digital Equipment Corporation was host for "a night of fun and frivolity" for reporters and industry analysts at a Manhattan comedy club last week, a world away from its headquarters in a converted mill outside Boston. But Robert B. Palmer, Digital's chairman and chief executive, skipped the event, choosing instead to have dinner on the town.
"In this job, you don't get much time to decompress," he explained. 
 Indeed, after five years of trying to halt Digital's seemingly inexorable slide from the top ranks of corporate America, the pressure on Mr. Palmer is building.
Since taking the helm in 1992 after the ouster of Digital's legendary founder, Kenneth H. Olsen, Mr. Palmer has cut 59,000 of the company's 114,000 jobs and posted billions of dollars in losses. But in this booming market for information technology, Digital still has not been able to find its way: it is expected to post only a modest profit this fiscal year after losing $112 million last year. While its products are praised by analysts, the computer maker, long plagued by weak marketing, has been unable to figure out how to sell them.
Known as a demanding leader who expects his executives to make their numbers, Mr. Palmer has forced out three of his top lieutenants and ushered in two major corporate reorganizations after a series of embarrassing management fumbles. Digital's stock price, which closed on Friday at $36, is slightly below where it was when he won the top job, while the values of rivals like Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems have quadrupled.
Now, in the wake of the company's headline-grabbing patent infringement lawsuit against the Intel Corporation, filed earlier this month, and with another corporate reshuffling set to take effect on July 1, Mr. Palmer seems poised to either start making his numbers or find himself out of a job.
"The company has to start showing a sustainable turnaround, or you would assume that the board is going to start to get frustrated and get somebody else," said Gary Helmig, an analyst at the Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn.
Even Digital's shareholders, who have accepted the 40-year-old company's dismal performance with little protest, may be losing patience. Next month, Digital investors will gather in Manhattan for a meeting held by Providence Capital Inc., an investment firm known for its aggressive campaigns against corporate management.
In addition, shareholder resolutions have been proposed for consideration at the company's annual meeting later this year to force Digital to remove its poison pill anti-takeover defense and to hire an investment banker to consider selling the company.
Two years ago, Digital, the nation's fourth-largest computer maker, came close to selling itself to the third-biggest, Compaq Computer, for about $60 a share, according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal. But the negotiations were said to have fallen apart when it became clear just how much operating independence Digital would lose. Both companies declined to comment.
With its stock now trading at just over half of what Compaq reportedly offered, Digital appears to be even more attractive to a potential buyer, especially because it has $2.48 billion in cash, or nearly $9.50 a share after accounting for its debt.
THE president of Providence, Herbert A. Denton, said that he expected to draw 30 percent to 40 percent of Digital investors to the meeting his company is sponsoring. It will feature experts discussing the various aspects of Digital's business, he said, and is merely a forum for shareholders to learn more about the company. But Mr. Denton was quick to add that a similar meeting held last fall for the shareholders of the oil refiner Ashland Inc. led to big changes at that company.
"Palmer has been there for a while," he said. "A lot of folks have come and gone. I don't know how many cards he has to play."
In an indication of how Digital views the meeting, the company, based in Maynard, Mass., has declined to send a representative, saying it already has adequate communications with its shareholders.
One thing that activist stockholders are most likely to criticize is Digital's board. Most of the directors are retired executives from other companies whose experience predates the rise of the Internet and other developments that are transforming the computer industry. In addition, no director other than Mr. Palmer holds a substantial number of Digital shares.
"I like to see directors who are willing to make a capital commitment to the company and put some of their net worth at risk," said Nell Minow, a principal at Lens, an investment firm that also specializes in shareholder activism. "If they don't feel bullish on the company, then how can you expect anybody else to?"
Born in Stephenville, Tex., in the northeastern part of the state, Mr. Palmer worked his way through Texas Tech University, where he received a master's degree in physics. He eventually helped to found the Mostek Corporation, a semiconductor maker, which was later bought by United Technologies. He joined Digital to run its chip operations in 1985.
In an interview last week, Mr. Palmer defended the board, which he said has given him its full backing. He also readily acknowledged that he had made mistakes. "I've made errors," he said. "People who worked for me made errors for which I am responsible. I am not trying to duck it."
Yet he says he is the right man to be running Digital. "I've learned a tremendous amount in this job, and it is not the sort of thing you can learn by reading textbooks," he said. "I think I have accomplished a great deal, not by myself, but with all of the support of the Digital employees."
Others disagree. "He doesn't understand computers," said C. Gordon Bell, who led the team that created Digital's Vax minicomputer, which rang up huge profits for the company in the 1980's. Mr. Bell, now a senior researcher at the Microsoft Corporation, added, "He has only been able to do one thing and that is financial control," referring to the job cuts.
But Mr. Palmer also has his defenders. "He is a very smart guy," said Larry Walker, the former head of Digital's networking products division who now runs Certco, an Internet software company in New York. "He is decisive. He is a person driven with the right values. I don't know what else you can ask for."
KNOWN around Digital as GQ Bob, the dapper Mr. Palmer, 56, was wearing his trademark double-breasted suit during a visit to Manhattan last week. With his hair slicked back and his face tanned, he appeared relaxed. He still jogs four or five miles a day, he said, and highly recommends it.
But he also acknowledged that he was in the hot seat, admitting that he put his reputation as chief executive on the line when he decided to sue Intel. The suit, filed in Federal court in Worcester, Mass., contends that the chip maker violated 10 Digital design patents to increase the performance of its Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II chips, which are at the heart of more than 85 percent of the world's personal computers.
Most analysts have concluded that Digital has little chance of getting anything from Intel, which said it will vigorously defend itself against Digital's accusations. They assume that Intel, which holds hundreds of design patents of its own, will countersue. And while the legal action drags on for years, Intel will continue to sell its products.
But Mr. Palmer and other Digital executives said they never intended to stop Intel from selling Pentiums. Doing so would cause the PC industry to grind to a halt, hurting Digital, which sells more than $2 billion of Pentium-based computers a year. (Intel is also a Digital customer, and both companies have said that the lawsuit will not affect their commercial relationship.)
Instead, the suit is aimed at slowing Intel's efforts to introduce its next-generation chip, which is a crucial step in the company's campaign to move from low-end desktop computers into the more powerful servers that are the workhorses at large enterprises. These machines had been the preserve of companies like Digital and I.B.M.
Based on an architecture jointly developed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, the new family of chips will process 64 bits of data in each gulp, compared with today chips, which process 32 bits. It will also run software written for today's Pentiums as well as for Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC chip, which uses the Unix operating system. The first of these new chips is code-named Merced (pronounced murr-SED), and is set to be introduced at the end of the decade.
That is a direct threat to Digital, which was the first company to introduce a 64-bit chip three years ago. That chip, called Alpha, is the world's fastest. But Digital has had trouble selling it, in large part because it does not run all the software written for Intel-based machines. For the last year or so, however, Digital has offered a translator that enables Alpha machines to run software written for Intel-based computers.
The greater the performance of Alpha over the Pentium, the easier it is for Digital to sell customers on the chip's raw power. But 18 months ago, Intel introduced the Pentium Pro, which narrowed the gap with Alpha. Many of Digital's corporate customers are willing to accept a somewhat slower chip to avoid the headache of changing their software. And now with the promise of Merced in the near future, the case for Alpha is that much weaker.
"The acceptance of Alpha by other systems companies would have been much greater had Intel not been able to improve the performance of their own processors by a wide margin," Mr. Palmer said. "In that regard, there is no question that we have been greatly damaged."
DIGITAL believes that the patent-infringement suit will either delay the introduction of Merced, giving Digital more time to establish Alpha, or force Intel to introduce a slower chip than it might have otherwise.
"As they move up into the enterprise world, we want them to do it on Intel technology, not Digital technology," Mr. Palmer said.
Of course, if Intel ends up paying Digital some of the billions of dollars in damages it is seeking, that would be nice for the company, too. To lead its fight, Digital hired Herbert Schwartz, a New York lawyer who helped Polaroid win an $873 million damage award from Eastman Kodak in a patent infringement case in the 1980's. But few people in the industry seem to believe that Digital will ever receive that kind of money. Another potential resolution could be some sort of settlement between Intel and Digital that assures a future for Alpha.
"I think there are many possible outcomes," Mr. Palmer said. "But it is hard to speculate on what those might be."
Inside Digital, the lawsuit has proved to be a surprising morale booster.
Digital, well known as a technology innovator, invented the minicomputer, which was the first challenge to the mainframe, back in the 1960's, and it was the first company to link its computers in networks. In the 1980's, its Vax minicomputers were as hot as Intel chips are today. And the company's financial results were equally heady: growth in revenue and profits averaged 30 percent a year for the 20 years prior to 1990.
But the losses and layoffs that came in the early 1990's, as a result of Mr. Olsen's refusal to acknowledge that the Vax line was going out of style, have shaken Digital to its core.
"The company has been going through an identity crisis, or maybe a grieving process," said Lucia Quinn, a Digital marketing executive who will soon be in charge of Digital's global brand image. "The Intel suit has energized people. It changed the conversation inside the company. Instead of talking about growth and profitability, people are taking pride in the fact that Digital was responsible for all those innovations."
But outside Digital, the suit is increasingly seen as a sign of desperation, an attempt to make up in the courtroom what the company has failed to do in the marketplace.
"Digital doesn't have a lot to lose," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
After taking over from Mr. Olsen, who racked up $3.4 billion in losses in 1991 and 1992, Mr. Palmer set out to embrace the open standards that were sweeping the computer industry. The bottom had fallen out of Digital's business because customers were no longer willing to buy from a single vendor complete systems that came loaded with proprietary operating software, like Digital's minicomputers.
The new era was a culture shock for companies like Digital, I.B.M., Unisys and Data General. Selling complete systems provided profit margins of nearly 50 percent, while selling the parts was much more competitive, leading to lower prices and profits. Technological prowess became less important than speed and slick marketing.
DIGITAL, which prided itself on its technology, was fat and slow. It could no longer support 114,000 employees. Mr. Palmer had the unenviable job of shrinking the company while remaking its strategy.
He focused on Alpha, with its world-beating speed, and cut a deal with Microsoft to have Windows NT, its new network operating system, run on the new chip. (To Digital's embarrassment, David Cutler, the leader of the team that created Windows NT, was a longtime Digital employee who was lured away by Microsoft after Digital canceled a similar project he was working on in the 1980's.)
In August 1995, Mr. Palmer and Microsoft's chief, Bill Gates, announced a broad alliance in which, among other things, Microsoft would pay to have 1,500 employees of Digital's large services division trained as certified Windows NT engineers -- more than the number at Microsoft itself.
But because Windows NT is still only a 32-bit operating system, Mr. Palmer ordered Digital's engineers to write a version of the Unix operating system to take advantage of Alpha's 64-bit capability. The results have been a powerful line of computers that are now used to run some of the busiest sites on the World Wide Web, among other applications. For example, an Alpha server powers Digital's popular Alta Vista search site.
But the market for such products has remained narrow because there is still relatively little software that can take advantage of Alpha's power. As a result, Digital has failed to get a large computer maker to sell Alpha-based systems, though Samsung, the South Korean chip maker, has agreed to produce inexpensive Alpha chips that Digital says will soon be available from outside vendors in PC's priced as low as $2,500.
The Microsoft pact, while still promising, has been slow to show results because Windows NT is only now beginning to be widely adopted. While Digital's NT revenues have more than doubled in each of the last two years, they still only amount to about $450 million, a small fraction of the company's roughly $14 billion in overall sales.
In March, Hewlett-Packard, Digital's archrival, announced its own partnership with Microsoft to promote Windows NT to businesses. The move was widely seen as a blow to Digital, which has been trumpeting its close relations with Microsoft. But Mr. Palmer and other Digital executives played down the significance of that agreement, saying that it was not as deep as Microsoft's alliance with Digital.
Digital has also been plagued by Mr. Palmer's inability to settle on an executive team and on a corporate structure that produces sustained earnings growth and profits.
In 1993, Edward E. Lucente, who spent more than 30 years at I.B.M., was hired to be the head of sales and marketing, which has been a particular weakness for Digital for years. But after a disastrous quarter in early 1994, Mr. Lucente was forced out after just a year on the job.
Another casualty was Bernard Auer, who was hired to increase Digital's personal computer sales. Mr. Auer was ousted in 1995 when he did not produce the desired growth.
Mr. Auer was replaced by Bruce L. Claflin, who was hired away from I.B.M.'s PC division. Two weeks after he arrived at Digital, in November 1995, Mr. Claflin recalled recently, he asked members of his team how many Digital PC's had been sold by computer dealers. He was greeted by blank stares.
That quarter, Digital had its best PC sales ever but Mr. Claflin quickly realized that few of the machines were actually getting to customers. Digital had been booking millions of dollars in sales to dealers without paying attention to how many computers the dealers themselves sold.
"Every quarter, we were putting in 30 to 50 percent more than was selling out," Mr. Claflin said.
THE bubble burst when PC prices began dropping sharply in the spring of 1996. Like other PC makers, Digital was committed to taking back unsold computers and covering dealers when prices fell. The inventory glut cost Digital tens of millions of dollars over the next few months as it discovered similar practices had occurred in other parts of the company.
Digital's stock price, which climbed as high as $76.50 in February 1996 as investors became optimistic about its prospects, began to decline. Enrico Pesatori, Mr. Lucente's successor and Mr. Palmer's de facto No. 2, resigned in July 1996 after Mr. Palmer dealt with the mess by announcing a $492 million restructuring charge and 7,000 new job cuts.
Mr. Palmer now attributes the costly mistake to the fact that Digital, which had always relied solely on a direct sales force, was new to selling through a network of dealers.
"That clearly was an error that had to be corrected," he said. "That was because we had to learn the channels business practically overnight while our competitors spent years learning it."
The news got worse last October, when Digital reported a quarterly loss that was three times larger than analysts had predicted. Mr. Palmer said that the company had cut its direct sales force too deeply to reduce costs. To fix that problem, he said, the force, which had been reduced to 1,000 people, would be expanded to cover Digital's 2,500 largest accounts.
Last month, Mr. Palmer announced a third reorganization that would put Mr. Claflin, who has succeeded in turning around the PC business, in charge of worldwide sales and marketing, beginning July 1.
Mr. Claflin said Digital had stumbled because its various divisions had operated independently of each other. He likened Digital's marketing to Mercedes-Benz's selling cars by engine type, with different showrooms, sales forces and marketing efforts for each engine.
"Every little piece of Digital had their own market budget and none of them really cared about the brand," he said. "That was assumed to be somebody else's problem."
Aping I.B.M.'s turnaround strategy, Mr. Claflin said he would bring together Digital's products and fast-growing services business and stress the company's ability as a global player with strong technology and decades of experience to pull together many types of technology and make it work for customers.
As part of the effort, he is planning a new global branding campaign, with Ms. Quinn in charge, that will use the company's strong technology heritage to promote its new emphasis on solving customers' problems.
"We are going to look at every way we touch the customer," Mr. Claflin said. "The boxes we ship, the literature we send out, even our stationery, and ask: Is it consistent with the brand we want to establish?"
While investors and analysts praise Mr. Claflin's record and energy, many on Wall Street have lost faith in Mr. Palmer's ability to deliver on his promises, including higher per-share earnings.
"He said at last year's annual meeting that they would earn $2.32 this year," said Mr. Helmig, the analyst at Soundview Financial. "Now he says they will earn a dollar. When they don't make that, they will have lots of excuses as to why -- everything from the change in the organization to customers not understanding the lawsuit."
The consensus among analysts is that Digital will earn around 64 cents a share this fiscal year, which ends next month.
Despite Digital's poor performance over the years, Mr. Palmer has been richly rewarded by the company's board. Although he earned no bonus on his $900,000 salary last year, he received options worth $10.7 million. Graef Crystal, the compensation consultant, said that was 74 percent higher than the average compensation of a chief executive at a company of comparable size and performance.
SEVERAL board members, including Thomas P. Gerrity, the dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, declined to comment on Mr. Palmer's performance.
Interestingly, three Wharton professors, in a recent study, found six characteristics of boards that are linked to higher pay for the chief executive and weak performance by the company. Digital's board exhibits at least three of them: the same person serves as chairman and chief executive, the board has busy outside directors and several outside directors are over 70.
The average age of Digital's nine-member board is 66; except for Mr. Palmer they are all outsiders, and five are over 70. For example, Delbert C. Staley, 72, retired as chairman and chief executive of Nynex in 1989 and serves on five other boards. Colby H. Chandler, the former chairman and chief executive of Kodak, is 72 and retired in 1990.
Asked about the advanced age of the board, Mr. Palmer said: "I like having seasoned executives that know that there aren't any quick fixes. They understand what it takes to change an entire culture." But he also said that the board included younger members, referring to Mr. Gerrity and another director, the economist Kathleen Foley Feldstein, who he said were in their 40's. Mr. Gerrity is 55; Ms. Feldstein is 56.
"Digital is an interesting situation because there are lots of moving parts here," said Mr. Denton, of Providence Capital. "There is no question that the stock is cheap. The issue is, what does the company need to do?"
One thing that some critics have suggested is a new chief executive who understands sales and marketing. But Mr. Palmer is convinced that no change is necessary.
"When you look at marketing gurus around the industry," he said, "it's not obvious what individual knows more about marketing than we do."

HEADLINE: Global Investing's Logic, and Lunacy;
The World's New Financier Is You

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
INVESTORS flocked to Eastern Europe after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, eager to scoop up bargains in what they were sure would be a quick economic revival. A year later, the technology boom drew their money to the Far East. Then Latin America heated up -- that is, until the Mexican peso went bust, which sent investors scurrying back to the Pacific Rim. Russia got sexy as an investment early this year, and more recently South America has had allure.
Billions of dollars are sloshing back and forth over the globe with seemingly little rhyme or reason, chasing investments in once-obscure markets from Santiago to Kuala Lumpur. But there is at least some method to the madness -- despite occasional debacles like the recent Bre-X gold mining fraud, in which mutual fund managers poured scads of money into what amounted to little more than holes in the ground in Borneo. 
 To begin with, foreign stock and bond markets are growing much faster than those in America, providing much higher returns to investors. In 1970, foreign markets accounted for only a third of the value of the world's stock and bond markets, with the United States alone accounting for the other two-thirds. But by last year, they had grown to nearly 60 percent of the total.
Stock markets in newly emerging economies like those of Turkey, Argentina and South Africa now account for 14 percent of the world's total stock market value, up from 4 percent 10 years ago.
Investors have flocked to them as global economic trends have shifted since the end of the cold war. Centralized, state-planned economies have been scuttled for ones favoring private ownership of industry. With the transformation, the resulting vibrant new economies no longer need to rely on international development agencies or giant New York banks for foreign investment, as they did in the 1970's and 1980's; instead, much of their seed capital since 1990 has come from a more surprising source: millions of average Americans who invest in mutual funds.
"This is a trend that has been led by America, which pushed the international lending agencies to encourage the development of private enterprise, to open up these markets and get the hands of governments out of industrial ownership," said J. Mark Mobius, who oversees several Templeton mutual funds that invest in emerging markets. "That led to the development of capital markets -- bond markets and stock markets -- in many of these countries, and now to people like me trying to invest all the money that is flowing into our mutual funds."
 
Cash Cows
 That is no easy task. In the past five years, the assets of American mutual funds that invest in a broad array of emerging markets have grown more than 35-fold, to $22 billion. One such fund existed before 1989; now there are more than 70. And billions more are being invested by funds that are even more specialized, focusing only on markets in, say, Latin America or Southeast Asia.
And these days, when the finance minister of a developing country wants to encourage foreigners to invest in his country, he is less likely to court the World Bank or the Agency for International Development than someone like Mr. Mobius.
Mutual fund managers say their investments are sought because they have enormous flexibility in the types of projects they can underwrite. Coca-Cola can build a bottling plant in South America, or General Electric can build a factory in Eastern Europe, but those companies are less likely to use their profits to re-invest in other businesses, as mutual funds would.
For investors, emerging markets can provide eye-popping returns -- as in 1993, when the average emerging-market mutual fund gained 72 percent. But they also can take gut-wrenching dives. In 1994, funds with a heavy dose of Latin American investments fell more than 24 percent after Mexico devalued the peso.
"There are going to be periods of time when many of the emerging markets do quite badly," said M. David Testa, chairman of Rowe-Price Fleming, the international investment arm of the T. Rowe Price mutual funds. "But on the whole, they tend to move fairly independently of each other. The politics of Turkey will have a great effect on the Turkish market but could have nothing to do with what is going on next door in Lebanon."
 
Volatility
 Mutual funds, however, have contributed to that volatility as money managers simply chase the highest rate of return on their investments around the globe, often with disregard for underlying economic trends. "I think there is an element of faddishness and hype" in emerging-market investment, said Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management and author of a new book, "The Big Ten: The Big Emerging Markets and How They Will Change Our Lives" (Basic Books, 1997).
Too many investors, mutual fund managers included, "are making a naive assumption that the current level of development in these countries will continue in a straight, upward line," Mr. Garten said. "But emerging markets are a frontier and, like on any frontier, there will be surprises."
As economic reforms move from addressing budget and inflation issues to more political questions like labor policy and how to improve education, progress will be more difficult, Mr. Garten said. In addition, certain regions can be influenced by external factors.
Latin America, for instance, is highly susceptible to changes in interest rates in the United States. Asian economies are prone to overproduction in industries like automobiles or semiconductors, which causes prices to plunge. And Eastern Europe is very much at the mercy of developments in the European Union, which sees some of its neighbors as more of a competitive threat than an investment opportunity.
"No one can predict any of those things," Mr. Garten said. So while emerging markets have benefited from the enormous amounts of money that mutual funds have contributed, "the kind of investment these countries need the most is from the Coca-Colas and General Electrics of the world, the kind that is not susceptible to quick withdrawal" when the economic winds temporarily shift. "In the long term, there is cause for significant optimism in emerging markets," Mr. Garten said. "But there are going to be real crises along the way."

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Hollywood Kids;
Like, Duh: a Mercedes Instead Of A BMW for Graduation? As If.

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN 

 BODY:
FOR several years, Lauren Greenfield, a 30-year-old documentary photographer, has chronicled Hollywood from a novel angle: she focused not on the entertainment industry itself but on the children, from privileged high-school socialites to street-gang members, who grow up under its influence.
The results, a series of striking photographs and equally striking interviews with the subjects, are on display in "Fast Forward: Growing Up in the Shadow of Hollywood." Her project is being presented simultaneously in a new book by that name (published by Alfred A. Knopf) and two Manhattan exhibitions (at the International Center of Photography Midtown, through July 13, and the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo, through June 28). 
 Here are excerpts from Ms. Greenfield's interviews with her more affluent subjects. To give them some anonymity, she withheld last names. DAVID CORCORAN
Emily, 10, shown at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, where she lived with her family for several months:
My mom says my life is like the story "Eloise." It's about a little girl, just like me, who lives in a big hotel and is very good friends with all the staff. I am good friends with a lot of staff.
When you come to the door of the hotel, there are, like, 80 people welcoming you and talking to you. Every time you pass by one of the staff, they go, "Good day." It's part of their job to say that.
When my friend sleeps over, we wake up at 7 and go to the pool and splash around, because everybody here wakes up at 12 and has breakfast at 3. They are sleepyheads.
I can do more things here, like jump on my bed. It's kind of weird, though. You make a mess and when you go back to clean it up, people have already come and cleaned it. Every second they are cleaning your room.
Adam, 13, shown with a go-go dancer at his bar mitzvah party at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in Hollywood:
The bar mitzvah scene is really glamorous. Everyone tries to compete for the nicest bar mitzvah. It just so happens I had a great bar mitzvah. I mean, for kids that can't afford it or are not as fortunate, I guess they are out of luck. People usually spend between 15 grand -- 15 being the lowest, really low -- to 90 grand. I had a glass blower and carnival games, lots of them. I had a sweatshirt maker, a make-your-own video game. I had dancers. I had a steel drum band during the appetizers. I had fake stuffed lions and parrots. I felt really good after the bar mitzvah, and I was getting a lot of play with girls. . . .
My parents know that money ruins kids, so they try to help. I go to camp in Michigan, and the kids there are so different that it is just sad. They are not really nerds. They are nice. If you have a problem, they will talk to you. . . . I mean, they are down to earth. . . .
I don't think it's good for a child to grow up in L.A. Education stinks in L.A. The kids stink. The kids are conceited.
Not that I am not, partially. L.A. is not a good environment for kids or anyone. I hate how we have homeless people starving on the streets. I'm in a house with two VCR's and cable. I mean, if we could just substitute one of the VCR's and give to those people -- it would make such a difference in our world.
Alison, 13, shown doing abdominal exercises with her personal trainer at a track in Santa Monica:
I have a trainer, I have a counselor, I have a nutritionist, I have a singing coach. And I think that's it. Oh, yeah, I have a driver, too.
Everything kind of works together, because by eating right, getting all my feelings out and literally working my butt off, it makes me feel a lot better about myself. I am getting thinner, and guys are looking at me more now. . . .
Kids today grow up faster than kids when my parents were young. I look at my parents' yearbook pictures and people look their age. Now kids look older than they are. I don't think it is their clothes. Maybe it's the fact that kids now have freedom. Their faces just look older.
Lindsey, 18, shown at a Fourth of July party in Calabasas, wearing a nose guard three days after her plastic surgery:
I think there is a lot more plastic surgery in Los Angeles than anywhere else. It's not even a big deal. Most families in Calabasas can afford for their children to have plastic surgery. I mean, they can afford to get them their BMW's and their utility vehicles, so I think they can afford to get their plastic surgery done, too.
I have no idea what costs are for plastic surgery. All I know was that my friend's breast enlargement was less than my nose. My nose was an insane amount of money. I was shocked. I thought that nose jobs were just like a few grand, like $2,000 to $3,000, but I was wrong. Mine was about three times that amount. I think her breast enlargement was like four or five. So my nose was a good $3,000 more than her breasts.
It was definitely worth getting done. It changed the way I feel about myself. It definitely changed my life.
Wendy, 23, shown at poolside with her father, chairman of a talent agency:
It's very hard for our generation, Generation X. All my friends have started in the entertainment business and are just figuring out that they're not happy. It's not fulfilling. It's not what they thought it would be. We're all in this total confusion as to what we want to do. And there are not that many great jobs around to get excited about. There is unemployment all over the country. . . .
It's hard. I don't have the same life style I had when I was 14, because I can't afford to stay at the Kahala Hilton Hotel in Hawaii and my parents aren't going to take me anymore. I'm working harder than ever, and I certainly don't have what I had when I was younger.
I blame my father in a way, because when I graduated from college, it was sort of like "Here you go. Here are all your bills. Now pay them." And a part of me is like, "O.K., he's doing this for a reason." But it's really hard having grown up with so much and then having it all taken away. All my friends' parents pay for their apartments. And I can't afford one and neither could any of them. It's really difficult for me, and yet I know that to anyone else outside of L.A. it would be like, "Their parents are completely spoiling them." But it's still difficult when I see all my friends living on their own and I don't yet. . . .
When I graduated from college, my dad wanted to buy me a new car, knowing that he was never going to get me another car again. Because he has two Mercedes, he has a very good relationship with the Mercedes people. I had wanted a BMW really badly, and I was really uncomfortable about getting a Mercedes, but I didn't have a choice. And if that was going to be my last car, I obviously was going to accept it. I just didn't think it was an appropriate car for a 21-year-old. It's the stigma attached to a Mercedes.

TOBACCO WARS
Cigarette Taxes: Not Yet
How can society tackle the public-health disaster of teen-age smoking? Well, raising taxes and banning cigarette advertising are two options. But so far, at least, this nation has not moved strongly on either front. In Britain, the new Government said last week that it would ban all cigarette ads and bar tobacco sponsorship of sports events. The White House, meanwhile, grasping for a budget deal, ditched a plan to raise tobacco taxes to pay for children's health care. Yes, this is the White House of Bill Clinton, sworn enemy of smoking, and Al Gore, who delivered that emotional anti-smoking speech at last year's Democratic convention. Mr. Clinton backed down after Senator Trent Lott called the tax a "deal buster" in the budget wrangle. But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a key backer of the cigarette tax, said Mr. Lott was bluffing. "We would have won this," he said.

NATURAL ECONOMICS
Planet for Sale (Not Cheap)
A price tag for nature? A dollar value for our planet? Absurd. If a nuclear disaster makes the earth uninhabitable, we can't exactly stroll into Earth Depot and order a new one. But we live, alas, in a society that simply loves doing studies, loves hunching over calculators and spewing out numbers. So, inevitably, the journal Nature just put the value of 17 "ecosystem services" (sounds like Roto-Rooter: "Here to clean your ecosystem, ma'am") at, conservatively, $33 trillion. But wait. Beyond the absurdity, there's something to this. We constantly make economic choices about nature -- we just don't focus on the cost. An example: New York City water. It's still good, but getting worse because society made a bunch of economic choices not to protect the watershed. Now the city must spend $660 million to protect the watershed -- unless it wants to spend $4 billion for a water-treatment plant. Another example: a growing region builds malls on a flood plain, and the flooding simply moves elsewhere, with more devastating force. Economic choices everywhere. The point of issuing that obviously debatable number is to remind people that those choices, often nearly invisible, are made constantly.
 
ENVIRONMENT
Welcome Mat for Polluters?
"Pollution credits" have seemed like odd creations ever since they were born in 1990. A company that's less filthy than the law allows need not wait for heavenly recompense -- it can sell its virtuous deed right here on earth, a license for filth that can be snapped up by some less fastidious outfit. Or some benevolent soul can buy credits and simply retire them. But in a new twist at this sooty bazaar, Gov. George E. Pataki is offering pollution credits as little Welcome-to-New-York door prizes for companies that relocate to the state. Environmentalists are not amused.
 
MARKETING DEALS
Tiger Woods, Blazing
Tiger Woods is having one heck of a run in his 15 minutes of fame. He's young, he's a superstar, and he has stormed the white citadel of golf. Outlandish as it may seem, he may even be bigger than Michael Jordan. ("He's fading," one observer decreed.) And is he cashing in! No superstar could get by on a trifling $2 million in golf earnings, but weren't those Nike and Titleist contracts, together worth $60 million, enough? Apparently not. Last week, Tiger Woods signed a five-year contract -- reportedly worth $13 million -- to become a spokesman for American Express. And what does being a golf whiz have to do with credit cards? Oh, you just don't understand marketing.
 
MANAGED CARE
Reforming Health Reform
The word "reform" normally brings to mind something battered with age; welfare, to its critics, fit that description perfectly. But last week a Connecticut legislator used the word in a startling context, talking of "reforming managed care." Huh? Managed health care is still in its infancy -- well, early adolescence, maybe -- and was itself created to "reform" a health system in dire need of repair. To many people, though, it, too, already needs repair, and last week Connecticut tried to do just that as legislators passed a bill to let the state overturn managed-care companies' rulings on what treatments they will cover. The industry fought the proposal, saying external review was unnecessary because of in-house appeals processes. But lawmakers were swayed more by testimony from hundreds of customers outraged at being denied what they considered reasonable care.
 
PRISON HEALTH CARE
Economics Behind Bars
Politicians have this thing about being tough on prisoners. It's not enough to deprive someone of sweet, irreplaceable liberty -- they are determined not to appear to "coddle" inmates. New York City's jailers are convinced that many prisoners go to clinics as a social occasion, as a break in the grim routine -- and no doubt some do. But when the Giuliani administration last week proposed charging inmates fees for medical care, it outraged prisoner-rights advocates. True, the fee would just be $3, and would be waived for those deemed indigent. But critics say that's a substantial sum for an inmate with limited resources, and they argue that it would lead to delays in seeking care -- and possibly to far more costly treatment later. With contagious diseases lurking in jails, "it is pretty stupid" to make it harder to get care, a Legal Aid official said.
 
MEDICAL RESEARCH
Progress vs. Progress
Medical research keeps bestowing priceless gifts on humankind -- gifts like the discovery, a decade ago, of a way to screen pregnant women for Down syndrome. But our world takes on a bizarre symmetry sometimes -- even as progress gives, progress can take away. No one can deny that lawsuits have evolved into a high art, but it is an art that is not, well, always used to improve the human condition. Take that Down syndrome test: Dr. Mark Bogart discovered the hormonal link that the test is based on, then patented it, then demanded that laboratories pay him a $9 royalty every time they used it (a fee sometimes higher than a lab's reimbursement), then threatened lawsuits against labs that refused. And even though legal experts don't think the patent will survive court scrutiny -- it's "a little like patenting Newton's law of gravity," one said -- some labs are settling, while others are dropping the test. Progress, full circle.
 
WAGES AT THE BOTTOM
Catching a Rising Tide
If a civilization is judged by wage inequality, the United States gets dismal marks for its record of the last two decades. For even as executive pay has gone through the roof, the wages of workers in the bottom 10 percent of the wage heap have slid 20 percent, adjusted for inflation. Suddenly, though, in recent months those wages have picked up, now rising faster than inflation -- and faster than middle-income pay. And this, in turn, is luring more people on the fringes into the working world. Why the change? Partly it's the ripple effect of the rise in the minimum wage, but mainly it's just a strong economy creating demand for low-skill workers. Temper your rejoicing, though, for the low-wage worker's lot in life, because the recent upturn makes only a tiny dent in that two-decade loss. And when this economy hits a bump, it won't always be top executives tightening belts.
 
GRADUATING TO JOBS
Downsizing's Children
Remember downsizing? Remember how some nonbelievers said meekly that corporate America was perhaps overdoing it and might one day, its ranks threadbare, repent of its ruthlessness? To judge by the rosy job picture for college graduates, the nonbelievers were right. Schools everywhere have seen a record number of recruiters this year, and the job offers are descending like desperate confetti. The explanation, to some: companies blew it, and desperately need to replace those workers they laid off a few years ago.

HEADLINE: Helping the Young, At Whose Expense?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Let's Give Parents an Extra Right to Vote" (Viewpoint, May 4), Alexei Bayer argues that the vote should be extended indirectly to children. But the proposal is just one more bad idea in the attack on America's growing aged population and retirement benefits. 
 In a cause-and-effect argument that has no basis in economics, the article implies that the United States is spending less on children today because of the resources that it lavishes on the old. Stop them, it seems to argue, before the oldsters use their numerical superiority to turn us all into indentured servants -- legally.
Sadly, the cost of taking care of the elderly won't change one dime, even if we disenfranchise them and slash their benefits.
If the government does not provide the money to sustain them in retirement, families will have to pay directly. While the simplicity of such a system might appeal to some theorists, the families thus encumbered won't much like it. Besides, they know that they, too, will probably be among the old and vulnerable one day.

At Appomattox in the Culture Wars

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
NOT long ago, one could hardly get through a week without stumbling across somebody or other's culture war -- outraged fundamentalists or neoconservatives or righteous multiculturalists raving about Hollywood or political correctness or Robert Mapplethorpe or Allan Bloom.
All of a sudden, the phrase is beginning to seem out of date. "Culture war" is starting to sound a little like "leisure suit" -- a throwback to a bygone era before the welfare reform act, before "Ellen," before old antagonists started acting so curiously mellow. 
 Now David Horowitz, conservative thorn in Hollywood's flank, invites Hollywood liberals out to breakfast at the Four Seasons with Robert H. Bork, and Ralph Reed is busy promoting repentance and racial reconciliation among his Christian Coalition co-religionists.
Talk of speech codes has died down. The ebonics flap blew over. It is getting harder and harder to pick a good fight. "We Are All Multiculturalists Now," Nathan Glazer titled his new book. A few culture warriors have declared the years of conflict over, at least for now.
Well, who won?
That depends on which culture war you have mind: traditionalist v. multiculturalist in academic life, orthodox v. progressive in religious and family life, the war over popular entertainment, the war over the media, the war over government financing of culture and the arts.
All of which are related wrangles over what Rhys H. Williams, a sociologist at Southern Illinois University and the editor of an upcoming book, "Cultural Wars in American Politics: Critical Reviews of a Popular Myth" (Aldine deGruyter), calls "culture in the identity-giving sense." They are battles over the symbols and ideas by which American society defines itself.
Plenty of people on both sides make the case that the left has won -- from The Village Voice to Herbert London, the conservative New York University professor who helped form the National Association of Scholars in 1987 to shore up the traditionalist position.
Richard Goldstein, in The Village Voice, inventoried his evidence of victory: porn videos, Gay Day at Disney World, "the cornucopia of abject degradation that is popular music." The left won, he said, because there is more money to be made off "a limitless assortment of life styles and identities" than off "a single, sanctioned set of 'family values.' "
Professor London, gloomy in defeat, harbors diminished expectations. All he asks now is one mainstream university "that represents a traditional view of the academy," one newspaper with "a different editorial position," one museum unlike the Whitney, one movie studio making real family entertainment.
"I call it an oasis strategy," he said.
It is certainly true that in much of the culture, the image of America seems permanently changed. It will never again be monochromatic. P.C. or not, the accepted standards for representing gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability have irreversibly shifted.
Inside academia, where much of the conflict surfaced first, the defeat seems most clear cut. Despite scandalized traditionalists, changes in curricula have stuck. Though courts have struck down speech codes and race-based preferences in hiring and admissions, campus life has been transformed.
But the outside world is another story. To the public at large, academics are now suspect. "My sense is that the conservatives have the upper hand in the battle of ideas and the liberals have the upper hand in the battle of institutions," said Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Illiberal Education" (Free Press, 1991), a best-selling denunciation of the academic left.
"In other words, the professors in the universities are seen in the broader culture as cranks to a degree that they certainly weren't 10 years ago," he said. "So the critique of political correctness has cut off the university intelligentsia from the larger current of political ideas."
Conservative pundits dominate opinion pages and the airwaves; their counterparts on the left huddle close to the political center. Conservative ideas, such as the critique of affirmative action, have moved into the mainstream, and the mainstream has moved right.
"You might say the culture wars are over because they have won," Stanley Katz, president of the American Council of Learned Societies, an umbrella organization of scholarly groups, said of the right. "If you ask what is liberalism these days, nobody wants to answer the question. They won a lot, in terms of the way people think about things."
As some historians see it, culture wars are unwinnable. They have recurred throughout the 20th century in various forms -- noisy skirmishes, like the ones around the time of the Scopes trial, over what kind of a society American society should be, breaking out at those moments when social changes become impossible to ignore.
So, why the lull now? Economic issues, particularly in higher education, may be eclipsing cultural conflicts (which media attention made look like the norm and therefore too normal to remain news). Culture-war hyperbole makes stirring campaign rhetoric, but 1997 is not a national election year.
Furthermore, it is unclear that the public was ever all that deeply split. Paul DiMaggio, a Princeton University sociologist, reviewed several decades worth of national survey data and found no dramatic rise in polarization of public opinion on social issues over the last 20 years.
Looking at attitudes on everything from race and gender to family values, he found increased polarization only on abortion. The only people who seemed to have grown generally more polarized were those who identified themselves strongly as Republicans and Democrats.
 
A Way to Think
 By searching newspaper and magazine databases for the term "culture war," Professor DiMaggio found that the phrase began cropping up in conservative publications in the late 1980's and early 1990's, then moved into widespread, more mainstream use during the 1992 Presidential campaign.
"Part of the strategy of the Christian right was to construct a culture war, or to make the culture war a salient way for people to think about their political views and alliances," he said. While the left traced discontent to economic inequality, the right blamed a cultural or moral crisis.
Not too long ago, Ellen Willis, the writer and feminist, found herself discussing with her partner, Stanley Aronowitz, the sociologist and Marxist, "how odd it is that everybody feels they've lost the culture war."
It all depends on the standard of measurement used, she figures.
"If you're a conservative and you're measuring today's culture against the 50's, you've been completely devastated," Ms. Willis said. "And if you're a feminist and a cultural radical and measuring today against the 60's or early 70's, it's pretty depressing.
"In fact, I think the cultural left has made enormous inroads into the culture that can never entirely be rolled back. At the same time, for me, compared to the visions I have for cultural liberation, this is culturally, as well as economically, a depressing situation."

Why Africa Can Thrive Like Asia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: KISANGANI, Congo

 BODY:
ONE of the great paradoxes of Africa is that its people are for the most part desperately poor while its land is extraordinarily rich. East Asia is the opposite: a region mostly poor in resources that over the last few decades has enjoyed the greatest economic boom in human history.
The area around this river port city in eastern Congo, the former Zaire, is a case in point: it is dilapidated and impoverished yet studded with diamonds, like a billionaire on Skid Row. Back in the 1950's, when this country and several others in Africa were at the same income level as South Korea while blessed with far more natural resources, it might have seemed reasonable that Africa would soon leave Asia in the dust. 
 Now South Korea has a per capita income of about $10,000 a year, and Congo stands at $150 per person. Narrowing the gap is a fundamental challenge for Congo's new leaders as they try to rebuild their country after the overthrow this month of the longtime Zairian dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. And a vital first step, not only for this country but for others across Africa -- and for big aid donors like the United States -- is understanding why such yawning disparities have occurred.
A wave of new research into the contrast between Africa and East Asia is producing some surprising findings. The most striking and reassuring conclusion is that although East Asia enjoyed some significant cultural and historical advantages, its economic boom relied on factors that probably can be replicated elsewhere.
In a nutshell, the formula was an outward-oriented, market-based economic policy coupled with an emphasis on education and health care. Countries in other regions like Chile have followed the strategy with great success. Several African countries, led by Congo's neighbor Uganda, are trying to learn from the Asian experience and are enjoying their own Asian-style boom.
 
Encouraging Signs

Uganda, a beautiful, vividly green nation on the banks of Lake Victoria in East Africa, with vast herds of antelope that graze beside modern highways, now has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Yet it is simply at the crest of a wave of African countries experimenting with privatization and stock markets -- there are 16 so far in Africa -- and trying to prove that rapid economic growth is not a prerogative of East Asia alone.
"This is still in the early days, and we're not euphoric and jumping up and down, but we think that parts of Africa are moving in the right direction," said Alan H. Gelb, chief economist for Africa at the World Bank. "I think there are grounds for optimism."
At last count, four countries -- Uganda, Angola, Lesotho and Malawi -- were enjoying growth rates of 10 percent. That is about as fast as the peak growth rates for the Asian "tigers," Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.
"There's an emerging consensus that Africa is not hopeless, and that in fact there is an emerging renaissance going on in Africa," said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
But to travel the back roads here and in Asia is to be reminded how many opportunities Africa missed over the last few decades, and how much it continues to mortgage its future by giving short shrift to education and health care. The new research suggests that a central feature of the successful East Asian model was a high level of education and public health -- a level partly inherited from past centuries and partly nurtured in recent decades. Despite its own ancient educational traditions, Africa lags far behind in building this "human capital."
In the little village of Lalia, in eastern Congo, the principal of the mud-brick elementary school throws up his hands at the challenges he faces educating the barefoot children who swarm around him.
"We have no notebooks and no teaching materials, and some teachers don't come because we cannot pay salaries," said the principal, Bibi Masakama, an energetic 32-year-old, as he showed a visitor around the school. The mud walls leaned ominously, and light came from holes in the walls that functioned as windows. Lizards ran about on the walls and on the rough wooden planks that served as desks and benches.
"None of these kids has ever been vaccinated against any disease," Mr. Masakama added. "None has ever had a medical examination."
Many reasons have been cited over the years for the different economic trajectories of Africa and East Asia. Some said that the colonial burden on Africa was much heavier, or that Africa was troubled more by artificial boundaries and disparate tribes and languages. Others, including some Africans, pointed to climate or culture.
"In Africa the climate is such that there's always fruit around, in back of the house, and you just reach up and pick it when you're hungry," said Alauwa Lobela, the mayor of Kisangani. "But in Europe and Asia, the climate forced people to get food, to protect themselves from the cold in the winter, to develop a spirit of battle."
Such climate-based explanations are common, and analysts have found that the economies of tropical countries do indeed grow a bit more slowly than those of temperate countries, all other things being equal. But the statistical relationship is slight, and one study suggested that climate explains only one-twentieth of the difference in economic performance between Africa and East Asia since 1965.
Of course, East Asia includes North Korea, healthy and well-educated but an economic disaster area facing famine, while Africa includes countries like Botswana that have prospered over the years. But regionally per capita incomes grew about 11 times faster in East Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa in the years since 1965.
 
Educated and Healthy
 Why? Economists point to a conjunction of factors associated with rapid growth: places like Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea underwent land redistribution after World War II and became relatively egalitarian societies; they were relatively well-educated and healthy, and they experienced a sharp drop in birth rates. On top of that, economic policies were ideal: the East Asian countries sooner or later adopted relatively open, market-oriented policies emphasizing exports.
East Asian countries pursued various economic models, but there was also a common economic strategy, which countries like Uganda are now emulating. The strategy emphasizes fiscal prudence and avoiding inflation while vigorously promoting exports and keeping the currency undervalued. In the past, African countries often tolerated soaring inflation and overvalued their currencies, keeping exports uncompetitive on world markets.
 
The Socialist Path

A central issue was politics: many African countries flirted with socialism and an anti-capitalist brand of nationalism that was in fashion during the cold war. In East Asia, the most successful countries avoided socialism and, in the case of South Korea and Taiwan, flirted with fascism. Even China since 1980 has arguably been closer to fascism than Communism, not so much Marxist-Leninist as market-Leninist.
Another critical factor has been savings, which are needed to finance new factories and other investments that stimulate economic growth. Partly because of market incentives and government dictates, national savings rates have been much higher in Asia (more than 30 percent of gross domestic product) than in Africa (about 12 percent).
"Our problem is that we don't save," lamented Samuel Ndomba, a British-educated professor at the University of Kisangani in Congo. "When people get a bit of money, they just spend it to buy a beer."
That might change, though, were there more incentives for investment. There is nothing intrinsically Asian about high savings, for Japan had very low savings rates in the 19th century. They soared in part because of Government campaigns and the spread of deposit-taking institutions, and eventually financed Japan's industrial revolution.
One major reason not to save and invest in Africa has been inflation and instability: when people save money, it often ends up being confiscated. Victoria Baenongandi, for example, lasted just two weeks as an entrepreneur in eastern Congo. She bought a pile of merchandise to resell, but everything was seized by soldiers. So she returned home and gave up on business -- and put her savings into beer.
Economic policy aside, East Asia enjoyed another crucial advantage over Africa, one that may be harder to replicate. Countries like South Korea or even China started the development process with citizens who were more literate and more healthy than those in other nations at their income levels, and they continued to improve. For all of China's persistent poverty, a child born in Shanghai in the early 1990's was more likely to learn to read and more likely to survive childhood than a baby born in New York City.
Some experts argue that East Asia's success in education derives not from Government programs -- Asian governments actually spend a smaller share of G.N.P. on education than do African governments. Rather, literacy and other education achievements in Asia may have been helped greatly by a culture of parental concern that supports enormous private spending on education, arising from a Confucian reverence for scholarship.
Because of Confucianism, China has had national exams and the rough equivalent of university graduates for 2,000 years. In contrast, Tanzania is said to have had only 13 university graduates at independence in 1961.
Their histories also meant that most Asian countries slipped fairly easily into the form of the modern nation-state, for they had a sense of nationhood that in some cases went back for millenniums. On the other hand, some African countries -- a hodgepodge of ethnic groups within borders drawn arbitrarily by colonial rulers -- are still struggling to adjust to modern nationhood. Such instability has always been fatal to economic development, whether in Cambodia or in Mozambique.
Health problems have also been a greater economic burden on Africa than is often realized. Most Africans, for example, have stomach worms, and as a result millions of people cannot study or work energetically, and some children have their intelligence permanently impaired because of anemia caused by the parasites.
"From the age of two, most people here have worms," shrugged Bakondagama Barandala, a 24-year-old nurse at a shabby clinic in Mambasa, in northeastern Congo. The clinic is a metaphor for public health in Congo: it is the only clinic in the region, yet it has no doctor, no electricity, no drinking water, no instruments and no medicines.
 
The Graft Factor
 For all the importance of education and health care, the cultivation of human capital seems to be effective only in tandem with the right economic policies. China was healthy and literate for its income level in the early 1960's when under Mao it underwent one of the worst economic contractions and famines in world history, one in which 30 million people died. Likewise, Tanzania for many years vigorously promoted education and health, but it stagnated because of catastrophic economic policies inspired by a quasi-socialist ideology.
One reason for some optimism about Africa now is its parallels with Asian countries earlier this century. Much like Asia was before its boom, Africa is relatively egalitarian in wealth, partly because land is not concentrated in the hands of a small elite (as in parts of Latin America). Similarly, in many African countries birth rates are dropping and literacy is rising.
Moreover, it's instructive to recall that Western pessimism over global basket cases was once directed at Asia too: it used to be fashionable to say that Chinese had no capacity for hard work and no feel for business, and that China was destined, as Samuel Taylor Coleridge put it, to "permanency without progression."
Among the most important studies of the lessons of East Asia are a 337-page report edited by two Harvard economists and just released by the Asian Development Bank, and another major report published by the World Bank in 1993. Those studies and related research point to other factors that go along with the nurturing of financial and human capital -- especially the effectiveness of Asian governments.
Asian governments have often been more effective than Africa's in part because they have been less corrupt. Asia has huge amounts of corruption by American standards, but for the most part graft there is just another cost of doing business; in Africa it often prevents business from being done at all. A joke heard in business circles makes the point:
An African visited an Asian friend, a Government official, and admired the official's spectacular home and opulent life style. The Asian explained his wealth with a wink toward his "cut": "You see that highway out there? Fifteen percent!"
Then the Asian visited the African, also a Government official, and found that he was living just as lavishly. Asked how he had prospered, the African pointed outside, saying: "You see that highway out there?"
"No," the Asian said, peering helplessly out the window. "What highway?"
"That's just it. One hundred percent."

Social Moderate Wins Upset Election in Iran
In a surprising upset, Iranians elected as president a candidate who campaigned on a platform of tolerance and social reform. The winner, Mohammed Khatami, was supported by millions of Iranians who oppose the controls on private and public life imposed by the Government. Although the President's power is limited, the election marks the first time since the revolution of 1979 that a figure associated with moderation has won a broad public mandate. 1
 
Mr. Khatami may be soft-spoken and worldly, but it was his black turban that cemented his victory, by resolving any voter doubts that he was not sufficiently orthodox. 10
 

Afghan Opposition Crumbles
The Afghan Government triumphed against a key opposition leader, practically completing a three-year battle to seize total control of Afghanistan. Fighters for the Islamic Government and defectors from the military opponent, Abdul Rashid Dostum, took over one of the last centers of the holdouts. That left only a few pockets of resistance. 9

Victim of Park Attack Was Mutilated, Police Say
The two 15-year-olds accused of killing a man whose body was found slashed and disemboweled in the Lake in Central Park had tried to cut off his hands and burn the contents of his wallet, apparently in an attempt to conceal his identity, prosecutors said yesterday. The victim was identified by the police as Michael McMorrow, 44, a real estate broker who lived on the Upper East Side. 1
 
From Failure to Gunfire
The story of a man charged with murdering a police officer is filled with failure. He followed his family into the garment trade, but left it in a haze of distrust. He followed a childhood friend into stock sales, but that only deepened his debt. When Scott E. Schneiderman finally struck out on his own, police say, it was with a gun in his hand, cocaine in his blood and a desperate plan to rob his own father. 29

HEADLINE: WARY ON ECONOMY, A SULLEN FRANCE GOES TO THE POLLS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24

 BODY:
The French vote Sunday in a sullen mood, unhappy with themselves and the economy, envious but wary of American economic success and unsure that even a more closely united Europe can solve their economic problems.
"France will fulfill its European obligations," President Jacques Chirac told voters this week, referring to the economic demands that France must meet to join its European partners in setting up a common currency in 1999. 
 He called elections a year early hoping the country would give him a conservative majority for the remaining five years of his economically troubled term, which began two years ago.
"Let us never forget that she can only defend her interests if she is capable of speaking with a single voice, and a strong one," he said of France.
The statement was one of numerous warnings from the conservatives this week against turning the Government over to a Socialist-Communist majority.
But as discontent with Prime Minister Alain Juppe's policies is widespread, a large protest vote is also expected to go to the far-right National Front party -- around 15 percent, public opinion polls indicate.
In constituencies where the vote is so fractured that no candidate wins more than 50 percent on Sunday, a strong National Front showing will enable its candidates to compete in a June 1 runoff with those of the left against deputies of the conservative parties in the Government coalition.
By fragmenting the vote from the right in the runoff, the National Front could help the Socialists win enough seats to take over the Government, a result that the National Front's leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has said he would prefer to a victory for Mr. Chirac's forces.
This is far from a foregone conclusion, nevertheless. Polls predicted that in the first round Sunday, the Socialists would win substantially more than the 17.8 percent they won four years ago, though perhaps not the 30 percent or more they would need to have a chance of forming a Government with the Communists, as they did briefly in the early 1980's.
Mr. Le Pen's party, which wants to send millions of foreign immigrants back where they came from, also has a chance of winning a few seats in southern France, where hundreds of thousands of people of North African origin have settled.
But even if Mr. Chirac wins his gamble, the Government will almost certainly lose most of the huge edge -- 464 out of 577 seats in Parliament -- that it won in a conservative landslide in 1993. That followed revelations of widespread political corruption during the two-term presidency of his Socialist predecessor, Francois Mitterrand.
The best the conservative coalition parties can hope for this time, nearly all polls agree, is a majority of no more than 40 to 60 seats over the Socialists and Communists.
Mr. Chirac decided on an election now, his advisers say, because he concluded that the conservatives had a chance of winning, but would almost certainly have none next year if the economy continued to stagnate.
For a decade and a half, under both Socialists and conservatives, French unemployment has steadily risen. It doubled in the 1980's and rose this year, despite Mr. Chirac's campaign promises two years ago of profound change, to 12.8 percent, the highest of any big European economy.
"If you look at the years past, including when the left was in power," the Socialist leader, Lionel Jospin, said the other day, "you see that as far as public deficits, debt, prices and social protection were concerned, we were more effective than the right. But we weren't any more able than they were to nip rising unemployment in the bud."
Mr. Jospin and the Communists promise that if they form a government, they will get the country moving again by stimulating economic growth, abandoning Prime Minister Alain Juppe's policy of holding down spending so France can meet the stringent criteria set for entry into a common European currency in 1999.
The criteria can be loosened a bit, the Socialists say. That idea is anathema to the Germans, who want the new money, the euro, to be as sound as their mark.
Both the Socialists and the conservatives say that a successful start for the euro will spark economic growth and create jobs, but a Socialist coalition with the Communists would somehow have to get around fundamental Communist opposition to the idea of the common currency.
Both the French and the German economies are yoked to social welfare systems that they can no longer afford, something leaders in each country keep telling their people. But change is painful, and constantly put off.
Things like five-week paid vacations even for beginning workers, pensions that kick in as early as age 50, and cradle-to-grave medical care are all financed by payroll taxes. These in France fall mostly on employers -- to the tune of an additional 52 percent on top of a truck driver's annual salary of $25,000 a year, for instance.
Given the cost of hiring people, French and German employers often don't, many deciding instead to build factories where labor is cheaper, in Central Europe, East Asia or even the United States. Unemployment thus stays in the double digits; it topped 11 percent in Germany last winter.
Things have to change, both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr. Chirac say. But every time the kind of change that has transformed the American economy and created millions of jobs is attempted in France, it is resisted.
This week, pilots on short and medium hauls for Air France were on strike, protesting the state-owned airline's plans to hire short-run pilots at lower pay scales than senior ones on long hauls get, an arrangement familiar to employees of many American lines.
Conductors on parts of the French national rail network struck, too, protesting the conservatives' reported plans to privatize some operations if they win the elections.
And museum guards at the Louvre have shut it down since Thursday in a protest over longer working hours.
At the end of 1995, a transportation strike paralyzed the country after Mr. Juppe tried to reduce pension benefits that allow some railroad employees to retire at nearly full pay at 50.
Labor unions would take a Socialist victory as a sign that further changes were unnecessary. But even some French Socialist leaders agree that the current system of paying for the welfare state by levying unemployment, pension and social security taxes on payrolls, and making employers pay a higher share of them than employees do, is killing jobs in France.
Some, like Martine Aubry, a former Labor Minister, say that benefits could be maintained at high levels if the money to pay for them came from a tax on all income, savings and property and not just salaries, but the Government says the plan would hinder investments and not produce enough revenue.
"We need to stop waste," said Maurice Marlier, a corporate employee from northern France who describes himself as a "born Socialist."
"I'm getting close to retirement myself," he said, "and I know the current system can't pay for my pension."
But few voters understand that things simply cannot go on much longer the way they have for 50 years. A result is a bizarre combination of comfort and malaise, prosperity and paralysis, that Mr. Chirac promised two years ago to change and hopes now that this election will somehow alter.
He needs a new mandate, he said last week, to prepare France for its European future, "to enable the emergence of a regional grouping here that is capable of rivaling those that are forming in Asia and America and will be our partners, but also our competitors, tomorrow."
Mr. Jospin echoed this European unease in one of his last campaign appearances, in the Mediterranean city of Montpellier. The Socialists, he said, want the euro, but don't want it to be so sound, like the German mark, that it is overpriced against the dollar and makes French exports too expensive for Americans and other non-Europeans.
That, he warned, could enable the United States to grab export markets away from France. Mr. Chirac, too, has supported the euro as a way for France and all Europe to keep the United States and Asia from dominating the new global economy -- a vision not shared by most of France's German neighbors.

HEADLINE: Tour of Kodak Alters Views of Legislators

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, May 22

 BODY:
In this industrial town on the shores of Lake Ontario, the Eastman Kodak Company is affectionately known as the Big Yellow Box. The film-making giant remains a powerful and ubiquitous presence here, the city's main source of jobs, taxes and philanthropy. It is the last great survivor of upstate New York's once-flourishing manufacturing base.
In Albany, the Assembly Democrats are widely viewed as the last bastion of another endangered creature, the big-city liberal. For decades, they have been the Capitol's main source of pro-union, pro-environment and anti-big-business legislation, a group that can instill dread in a corporate lobbyist by just gaveling into session. 
 So why was a delegation of 14 Assembly Democrats, several of them liberals, getting the red-carpet treatment at Kodak headquarters this week?
At the invitation of Kodak's top executives, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, brought a group of younger lawmakers -- whom he described as the Assembly's next generation of leaders -- to look inside New York's largest manufacturer (35,000 jobs) and imbibe a bit of high-octane capitalism. It was a peacekeeping mission of sorts, a chance to break bread with a company some Democrats have viewed as an undertaxed, pollution-prone bad guy.
Over two days, the legislators, who make up almost a tenth of the Assembly, toured the construction site of a $200 million plant, watched robots mix chemicals, chatted with line workers whose families and friends have depended on Kodak paychecks for decades and tipped glasses with executives, including George Fisher, the chairman.
Almost to a person, they left -- gifts of fanny packs and disposable cameras in hand -- expressing pleasant surprise at how neighborly such a big company could be and professing newfound concern about the problems confronting the behemoth.
"This was the most exciting thing I've done since entering the Legislature," said Assemblyman Steve Englebright of Suffolk County, who at the outset of the trip described Kodak as the biggest polluter in New York. "I'd like to help spread their gospel."
Assemblywoman Melinda R. Katz of Queens said that before the trip she viewed Kodak as "this huge, impersonal company."
She added: "What I found was a very friendly atmosphere. Workers really seem to like working here."
Beneath all the pleasantries, however, a more calculated political strategy seemed to be at work. Mr. Silver, of Manhattan, is the state's most powerful Democrat, charged with rebuilding a party left in shambles by the election of the state's first Republican Governor in 20 years, George E. Pataki. He is also the most conservative Democratic Speaker the Assembly has seen in decades, one who has ever so gently been nudging his fractious 97-member caucus away from its left-leaning moorings.
To many Democrats, the Kodak trip was one more attempt by Mr. Silver to reposition the party and bridge the yawning divide between conservative members from upstate and downstate liberals. Mr. Silver denied such motivations. But he acknowledged that his downstate members were not always sensitive to the needs of big corporations.
"We're expanding their awareness," he said. "We're looking at a different focus."
From Kodak's point of view, the trip was an unusual opportunity to win support for its extensive agenda in Albany, where it already holds significant sway in the New York State Business Council, an influential lobbying group. At a luncheon today in one of Kodak's opulent wood-paneled conference rooms, Daniel A. Carp, the company's president, bluntly told the Assembly members that Kodak wanted the state to further reduce taxes, regulatory burdens and other labor costs, such as unemployment insurance and workers' compensation rates.
"New York continues to be a big-tax state," Mr. Carp told the group. "I encourage you to do all you can on that front."
Kodak paid for the Assembly members' dinner and lunch as well as the parting gifts, which is allowed under state ethics laws because each cost less than $75. The legislators' travel expenses and hotel rooms were paid for by the Assembly.
As might be expected from such a mixing of cultures, the gathering had its share of awkward moments and amusing incongruities. At lunch, Mr. Carp repeatedly praised the lawmakers for having made New York State more attractive to business in recent years by cutting corporate and personal taxes, reducing regulatory requirements and cutting state spending -- not realizing, perhaps, that many Democrats, including a few seated before him, had fought those things tooth and nail.
He also not so subtly praised Mr. Pataki, saying that positive changes in the state "have actually accelerated in the last two years" -- the length of the Governor's tenure.
During a morning of plant tours today, several Assembly members raised questions about Kodak policies, only to have their concerns melt away in the face of amiable answers. Ms. Katz asked a plant manager whether robots were replacing human workers. He answered that Kodak actually had to hire additional workers to maintain the robots. Mr. Englebright fired off numerous questions about Kodak's handling of toxic waste. He liked the responses he got.
"Their pollution inventory process is excellent," he said.
By and large, the encounter was exceedingly polite. No one asked questions about the thousands of layoffs Kodak has made in recent years. Except for Mr. Englebright, no one discussed the company's environmental problems. And while Kodak officials occasionally raised the specter of moving operations out of the state, they tried to sound upbeat about staying in New York.
Mr. Silver himself sounded oddly like Mr. Pataki at times, taking credit for personal income tax cuts that had been promoted mainly by the Governor and occasionally making use of one of the Governor's pet phrases. "We all believe in making New York more business friendly," the Speaker told a group of Kodak executives at a Wednesday night dinner. This morning, he said that growing up around his father's Lower East Side hardware store had given him "an appreciation of business."
But at other times, Mr. Silver, who is considering challenging Mr. Pataki next year, also sounded like someone sounding out potential campaign themes, either for himself or his party.
He chided Mr. Pataki for not doing enough to spur new investment. And whenever Kodak officials expressed worries about the quality of public education, which was quite often, Mr. Silver chimed in with reminders about Democratic proposals to increase spending on public schools, colleges and pre-kindergarten programs. (Mr. Pataki has tried to cut spending on education, and many Democrats think this will be his major vulnerability in 1998).
Some Democrats who did not go on the trip said that Mr. Silver had invited younger members because he wanted people who would not know about Kodak's history of conflicts with the Democrats. Mr. Silver did not disagree with that thesis.
"I chose people who were not set in their ways," he said. "We're trying to break the mold."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Cash to Spare, Giuliani Is Set To Unleash Ad Campaign

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The towering pile of contributions supporting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's re-election campaign has already performed what may have been its paramount task: helping to scare off many of his most formidable contenders, including Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx. Now, as the summer season begins, the Mayor is preparing to open the vault and begin the more prosaic work of winning voters with all that cash.
Over the last three years, Mr. Giuliani has raised $10 million (including $1.25 million in city matching funds) faster and in larger amounts than any other mayor in the city's history. Having spent about $2.5 million already, his campaign still has available more than $2.5 million that it must spend between now and the September primary or give back in accordance with the city's campaign finance rules. After the primary, the Mayor will be able to spend an additional $5 million on the November general election. 
 Campaign aides will not reveal the precise details of their plans, but voters should not be surprised to encounter the first of the Mayor's radio and television advertisements in the next month. Adam Goodman, the campaign's media consultant, has been at work with his film crew since St. Patrick's Day, capturing Mr. Giuliani in a variety of flattering, sunlit settings around the city, and some of the footage is ready to go.
Although the ads surely will relentlessly promote Mr. Giuliani's record fighting crime and improving the city's quality of life, the most intriguing question -- still under debate in the Mayor's inner circle -- is whether to use ads to attack his Democratic opponents, particularly the most likely victor in the primary, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan.
One of the biggest concerns of the Mayor's campaign advisers is how to combat a sense of complacency among his supporters, and it is there that such attack ads can be the most effective. If voters are aware of the Mayor's substantial lead in the polls and see him as cruising toward an easy re-election, they may stay home on Election Day unless they are given a strong reason to fear one of his opponents.
To that end, Mr. Giuliani and his surrogates have with great relish begun to portray Ms. Messinger as an extremist, an anachronistic liberal who is out of touch with every borough but Manhattan. (Ms. Messinger, in turn, has been trying to link the Mayor to the far right wing of the Republican Party.) Further attacks can be expected on her management style during her eight years as Borough President and on her relationships with the "old-fashioned politicians" of the city, to use one of the Mayor's favorite catch phrases.
"This campaign should be about people's records, about their vision, and it should be about leadership qualities," said Fran Reiter, the Mayor's campaign manager. "It's all well and good to say that if elected I will do this or that, but the real issue is, do you have the skills, the management ability, the leadership ability, to in fact make the things you say you want to have happen, happen."
The danger in airing such attacks, of course, is that they could substantially increase Ms. Messinger's name recognition at a time when she remains little known to many voters, particularly outside Manhattan. On the other hand, it could define her in a negative way before voters can learn of her policies and plans. Her aides say they are prepared. "Either way he goes, we're ready for it," said Jim Andrews, the Messinger campaign's political consultant. "He has his cash advantage right now, and my guess is he'll use it."
Ms. Messinger's campaign is not expected to pick up the largest bulk of its fund-raising until about the time of the primary.
Most of the ads, however, will stress Mr. Giuliani's record, seeking to portray him as a Mayor who brought prosperity and tranquillity to a once-troubled city.
Last week, for example, Mr. Goodman's cameraman elbowed reporters aside for a shot of the Mayor at a construction site in downtown Brooklyn, where the borough's first new hotel in decades is rising from the site of an old garage. With cheering workers in hard hats carefully arrayed behind him in the camera shot, Mr. Giuliani accepted the endorsement of several of the city's construction unions, which credited him for the city's current economic upswing. It was not difficult to imagine the commercial that will be fashioned from that moment, although the hotel had less to do with the Mayor than with the decadelong persistence of Borough President Howard Golden.
The Mayor's most powerful weapon will continue to be his increasingly calculated use of ordinary news coverage of his activities and public statements. At least half a dozen television news cameras and all of the city's daily newspapers are regularly present at his daily news conferences, which are now routinely held in settings around the city chosen to make a point about the Mayor's political priorities.
At least once or twice a week, Mr. Giuliani appears with children in an effort to counter his image as a chilly leader perpetually at war with the school or hospital systems. Last week, in announcing that infant mortality rates had fallen to a new low (as they have almost every year this century), the Mayor went to the maternity ward of Metropolitan Hospital to be surrounded by babies and beaming mothers and doctors. The Mayor's rivals may be frustrated by his insistent use of such imagery -- events are sometimes delayed until all the cameras have arrived -- but they are helpless to stop it.
"He cut all that money from education, and now he's turned the schools into a photo studio for his campaign," Mr. Andrews grumbled.
But Mr. Giuliani's aides say that if anything, the public will begin to see even more of the Mayor being "mayoral." He will spend a great deal of time outside Manhattan to contrast himself to Ms. Messinger, stressing issues like closing the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island and beginning free transfers between buses and subways. Although such events are not political, strictly speaking, they constitute the core of the Mayor's campaign to emphasize "the politics of performance," in Mr. Goodman's phrase.
"The best thing the Mayor does is what he does each and every day on the job," Mr. Goodman said. "Whether or not a camera is out there that comes from the campaign, that is something that New Yorkers are seeing each and every day, courtesy of the press and media. So you might say that the most important commercials in the campaign have already begun."

HEADLINE: Unseasonal Treat: Gasoline Prices Stay Low

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
With the needle pointing to empty on his Chevrolet Blazer, Mark Rilley slowed at the Amoco station in Tenafly, N.J., and considered filling up on regular unleaded for $1.149 a gallon.
Cheap as that was, Mr. Rilley was on a tight budget, and he knew gasoline prices had been declining for weeks. So he kept going, and a block later hit pay dirt: Exxon's sign read $1.139. He pulled in and filled up with 23 gallons. His saving: 23 cents. 
 "I shop around," said Mr. Rilley, a painter in his late 20's who drives to jobs across New York and New Jersey, his equipment piled up in the back of his sport utility vehicle. "I'm glad to see it go down."
As millions of Americans hit the highways this Memorial Day weekend, they are getting a break on their gasoline bills. Nationally, the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas has dropped 4.5 cents in the last three months, to $1.24. In some parts of the country, the drop has been even more precipitous. At the Exxon station in Tenafly, for example, the price has slid to slightly less than $1.14 from $1.26 in March.
Gasoline prices have dropped even though Americans are expected to do more traveling this summer than ever before.
Moreover, the decline is in sharp contrast to a run-up of almost 18 cents a gallon at the outset of last year's summer vacation season. That surge set off a furor against the oil industry, and gasoline prices became a Congressional campaign issue as well as a target of Congressional investigations.
Nobody is complaining now, though. "This has been a very uneventful season at the gas pump," said Michael Morrissey, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. The association's latest monthly survey found that prices were 9 cents to 10 cents a gallon lower in May than a year earlier.
Last year was actually more typical; prices generally drift up as people begin making more pleasure trips in the late spring, putting pressure on gasoline supplies.
But this year, the increase in demand has been more than offset by a huge drop in the price of crude oil, the raw material from which gasoline is refined, to $22 a barrel from $28 early this year. Crude oil prices have sagged because production is up in much of the world and because international sanctions against Iraq were eased this year, permitting the export of 700,000 barrels a day.
So, most experts expect the price of crude, and the price of gasoline at the pump, to stay low for the foreseeable future. "We should see flat and maybe lower gasoline prices," said Kevin Lindemer, a senior director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting group.
That is not to say there will not be upward spikes here and there as temporary shortages develop. Such imbalances are more likely because the industry's inventories of gasoline have slid by 4 percent in the last year, to about 197 million barrels.
That still represents a 24- to 25-day supply, but the shrinking national reserve has made the market for gasoline more skittish. With refineries running close to capacity, users and distributors often react to protect themselves by bidding up prices for future delivery. This week, for example, gasoline for June delivery went up as demand rose and inventories did not build significantly.
Even so, prices tend to move up and down so quickly that the fluctuations have little effect on prices at the pump. "It's unlikely that you are going to see any significant impact on the consumer level," Mr. Lindemer said.
Indeed, the Federal Energy Information Administration, an agency within the Energy Department that tracks prices and supplies, has forecast that this summer gasoline should cost a penny to 2 cents a gallon less than it did last summer, even though consumption is expected to rise by about 1.8 percent, to a record 342 million gallons a day. Gasoline now costs about 8 cents less than last Memorial Day weekend, said Jay Hakes, head of the agency.
The only exception to the trend, he said, is California, where prices are 14 cents a gallon above the national average because the state requires a special gasoline to reduce pollution.
Thus refiners will be under pressure to keep up. The refining industry, however, has become more nimble in switching its mix of products to meet surges of demand. For example, it reacted quickly last winter to build up heating oil inventories.
"I don't see that the capacity to produce gasoline will be tested," said Edward Murphy, an official with the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group. Mr. Murphy said he would pile his wife and five children in the family van this weekend and head for parts unknown.
Meanwhile, extra capacity is being added. The Tosco Corporation, which kept a large refinery in Trainer, Pa., closed for a year for a $100 million refurbishing, has reopened it. It is producing 150,000 barrels of gasoline a day.
Last spring, the decision by Tosco to close the refinery thrust it into the center of the political storm over surging prices, with some members of Congress calling for investigations into whether the move was deliberately aimed at making gasoline more expensive. The Department of Energy later concluded that the shutdown had not affected prices.
Adjusted for inflation, gasoline prices are about the same as they were in the 1950's, the golden age of gas guzzlers. And indeed, most Americans pay scant attention to the price per gallon anymore.
At the Exxon station in Tenafly, John F. Kober lifted the hood of his 1988 Mercury Cougar as the car was being filled up and pointed with pride to the 305 cubic-inch V8 engine. "I can't worry about whether it's going to be one cent a gallon more driving this," he said.
Mr. Hakes, the head of the Energy Information Administration, is not so blase.
Though he drives a 1990 Mazda that gets more than 30 miles a gallon, he said, he shops around for the cheapest price. Moreover, he added, "as a public official, I worry about the price of gas."

HEADLINE: For a Suspect in an Officer's Killing, a Long Slide Into Ruin

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
He followed his family into the garment trade but left that business of sequins and velvet in a haze of distrust. He followed his childhood friend into cutthroat stock sales, but long days of cold calls only deepened his debt. When Scott E. Schneiderman finally struck out on his own, the police say, it was with a gun in his hand, cocaine in his blood and a desperate plan to rob his father.
But the designs of Mr. Schneiderman failed once again, the authorities say, this time in abrupt violence and death. In the dark of an early morning last week, he was carried out of his father's Manhattan apartment on a stretcher, just moments after worried police officers had rushed a dying colleague from the same building. Now there lingers the mystery of how a mild-mannered stockbroker came to be charged with murdering a police officer. 
 
The Hitchcockian elements to Mr. Schneiderman's story have puzzled investigators and stunned friends and family. Some say that cocaine may have altered his behavior. Others describe his estrangement from his father in proportions of Greek tragedy. But another telling element is emerging: Mr. Schneiderman was struggling financially -- a circumstance made all the more galling, perhaps, by the affluence of his father and longtime friends.
His father owns a Chelsea penthouse and collects expensive cars and watches. His friends live in exclusive, gated communities on Long Island and vacation in the Hamptons. Scott Schneiderman, meanwhile, often worked on weekends, and lived with his wife and daughter in a rented duplex in Bayside, Queens. Surrounded by the wealth of others, he found himself toiling near the bottom of the stockbrokerage world, chasing elusive commissions.
Mr. Schneiderman, 33, spent the second half of 1996 working for a Long Island concern, making cold calls to strangers and selling himself as a reliable investment consultant. He quit that company in December, leaving behind $5,000 in debts and the impression of a man in the wrong business. Then he tried his skills at a Manhattan firm called D. L. Cromwell Investments; in the two months he worked there, he did not collect a penny in salary, and owed more than $4,000 for incidental expenses.
Lloyd M. Beirne, the company's president, scoffed at the contention of prosecutors that Mr. Schneiderman was making $3,000 a week. "I don't think we have anyone here making $12,000 a month," he said. He added that his now-former employee stood to collect his first paycheck on June 15, for an amount less than $500.
Mr. Schneiderman may have seen an end to his financial straits in the large amounts of cash kept in his father's safe, the police say, which would explain why he donned a mask, packed a .25-caliber Beretta, and broke into the penthouse shortly after midnight last Monday. He botched the robbery, they say, then got into a shootout with Officer Anthony Sanchez, 31, the father of a 6-year-old boy. As the officer lay dying in the stairwell, they say, he took the officer's revolver and fled to hide in the basement, where he was soon found.
Mr. Schneiderman's financial condition now figures in matters beyond motive, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and others call for his execution. The Manhattan District Attorney's office is trying to block his request to be represented by the Capital Defender's Office, which would bear the cost of his defense. The question hinges on one's ability to afford adequate representation and, at this stage, prosecutors say that Mr. Schneiderman was making too much money to be eligible.
Mr. Schneiderman had been among society's anonymous majority: law-abiding, well-liked, a good husband and a doting father. Before the shooting, he had joined a neighborhood barbecue; in the days to come, he was to have attended a Yankees game. Now, as an accused killer of a police officer, he finds himself an outcast.
"I'm destroyed that an old friend of mine is in such trouble," said Andrew Greene, who helped to introduce Mr. Schneiderman to the stockbroker's world. "My heart is bleeding for the officer's family and for my friend's wife and daughter. I couldn't even begin to understand what has happened."
Until Monday, Scott Schneiderman's life was more Lomanesque than violent. He is the second of two sons born to Raphael Schneiderman, a garment-industry executive, and his first wife, Ann. The parents divorced in the mid-1970's; the father married Niki Livas, a fashion designer, while Scott Schneiderman continued to live with his mother and brother, Jeff, in Bay Terrace, Queens.
He graduated in 1981 from Bayside High School, where he was known as a quiet, above-average student. After attending the State University of New York at Stony Brook, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from C.W. Post College in 1986, and immediately joined the family business, Zum Zum Fashions.
The company specializes in evening wear, from cocktail dresses to prom gowns. "What sets them apart from the rest of the market is they're always on the cutting edge," said a garment-industry executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "They are first with new fabrics and first with color palettes. And their silhouettes are a little bit more innovative."
The company has earned valuable publicity over the years. In 1996, for example, the winner of the Miss Teen USA pageant won, among other prizes, what was billed as a "wardrobe of exquisite Zum Zum evening gowns, prom and party dresses designed by Niki Livas." And it has received quiet censure; last year, the Government fined the company $50,000 for care labels on garments that led to damage of the material.
At the center of company control is Raphael Schneiderman, a man who, at 59, seems determined to challenge the passage of time. He wears his graying hair in a ponytail, rides motorcycles, almost invariably dresses in black, is again divorced and is now dating a 27-year-old woman. His lawyer describes him as someone who does not often express emotion. Others in the industry describe him as serious, even gruff.
Mr. Schneiderman's older son, Jeff, handles sales and production for the company. His younger son, however, had a more troubled career in the family business. Scott Schneiderman worked for the company for two years, branched out on his own for a year, then returned to the fold in 1990 to manage a company showroom in southern California. But in 1994, his father dismissed him. The police say that the elder Schneiderman suspected his son of stealing. The company's lawyer, Eli Uncyk, said simply: "He was kind of careless. And the decision was made that he shouldn't stay in the business."
Now married to Andrea Silverman and with an infant daughter, Scott Schneiderman found himself with no job and no prospects. But in July 1995, Mr. Greene helped him land a job as a stockbroker with the Lake Success, N.Y., firm that he worked for, Stratton Oakmont Inc. Given that firm's seamy reputation, Mr. Schneiderman received an unfortunate introduction into the world of stocks.
For several years, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers had tried to shut down Stratton Oakmont for questionable and high-pressured sales practices. The company motto, according to Forbes magazine, was to the point: "Never hang up the phone until the customer buys or dies." While profits were high, so too were the Government fines and millions of dollars in arbitration losses to furious customers, for offenses like unauthorized trading and failing to heed orders to sell.
Mr. Schneiderman left Stratton Oakmont in July, just as the firm was imploding. In the coming months, the N.A.S.D. would expel the firm from the securities industry and levy a $10 million fine against four of its officers, including Mr. Greene, on charges of defrauding an investor. Stratton Oakmont no longer exists.
Despite his experience at the bucket shop known as Stratton Oakmont, Mr. Schneiderman followed Mr. Greene moved down the road in Lake Success to another investment firm, J. B. Sutton Inc. A company official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, described Mr. Schneiderman as so laid back and mild-mannered "that he was almost like a guy in slow motion." The official added: "He did not fit your stereotypical stockbroker profile. He never made a lot of money in this business. This was not his calling in life."
When Mr. Schneiderman left J. B. Sutton in December, he owed the firm more than $5,000 that has not been repaid. But he never shared his financial problems with his wife, associates say. And while he struggled to keep everything together -- with a leased Jeep and a rented apartment -- he is believed by the police to have developed a habit for cocaine.
Two months ago, Mr. Schneiderman tried once more to be a successful stockbroker. He joined D.L. Cromwell, a Florida-based firm that had just opened an office in Manhattan's financial district. But it was not until mid-April that his stockbroker's registration was renewed, allowing him to solicit business.
Mr. Schneiderman would arrive at work at 8:30 in the morning, an hour before the stock market opened, and stay until 8 P.M., well after the market close. He would sit at a desk in a room where shouting is not uncommon and make pleading calls to strangers, all the while monitoring the market as reflected by the green and red lights flashing on his computer monitor. He was working on commission, not salary, and was indebted to the company for the $4,000 it paid to cover his registration fees.
In recent weeks, there had been talk of Mr. Schneiderman relocating to the Boca Raton office one day, and working as a manager for the firm. Mr. Beirne, the firm's president, said that after learning that Mr. Schneiderman's father was a garment-industry executive, the new employee's colleagues all had the same reaction, "All that business is going to get thrown his way." That changed, he said, "when everyone learned that he didn't get along with his dad."
Late last Sunday night, when other stockbrokers were poring over Barron's and preparing themselves for the Monday opening of the market, Mr. Schneiderman left Bayside in his leased Jeep. In addition to a gun, a ski mask and duct tape, he took some cocaine, the police say, some of which he used. Then, they say, he committed an armed robbery against his father, and killed a police officer coming to his father's aid.
No one in the Schneiderman family would comment on their relative, who is being kept on a suicide watch in jail. But his father attended the wake of Officer Sanchez on Long Island last week and told his widow that he would pay the college tuition of the Sanchez boy.

HEADLINE: Report Oversells Immigration's Meager Benefits

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Anyone who reads beyond the first two paragraphs of "Academy's Report Says Immigration Benefits the U.S." (front page, May 18) has to wonder, What benefits? 
 The alleged benefit appears to be a $10 billion annual increase in gross national product in a $7 trillion economy. That is a one-seventh of 1 percent increase. The cost of that minimal boost is massive population growth, loss of wages among less-skilled Americans, an increase in the high school dropout rate, exacerbation of the wealth gap and substantial tax burdens for state and local governments. Is it really worth it?
The other alleged benefit, according to the academy, is that immigrants will pay for the retirement of baby boomers. Low-wage immigrants, who are heavily dependent on social services, will finance the retirement of affluent retirees?
The academy overlooks another obvious fact: Immigrants get old, too. Within a few years of the baby boomers' retirement, we'll have to figure out how to pay for Social Security for a lot of elderly immigrants.
A better headline for this article might have been "Academy's Report Says Immigration Benefits Some in the U.S., at Great Expense to Most."

HEADLINE: Report Oversells Immigration's Meager Benefits;
Help Workers Compete

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your May 18 front-page article on the National Academy of Sciences immigration report, James P. Smith, who led the study, is quoted as saying that though native-born Americans without a high school education have seen their wages fall slightly, the vast majority of Americans are enjoying a healthier economy. The 1990 Census found that 44 million Americans (about 25 percent of the adult population at that time) did not have a high school degree. 
 Mr. Smith may be right about the vast majority, but a very significant portion of our adult population has seen wages decline over 15 years.
The solution is not controls on immigration but opportunities for adults to improve basic skills, pass the high school equivalency exam and enter skill training or community college. Unfortunately, all of the Federal, state, local and private money available for these programs is less than $1 billion per year, or $23 per person without a high school degree. If we add to the 44 million those Americans with a high school degree but literacy skills below a ninth-grade level, the per-person expenditure drops to less than $15.
We are becoming a country of two populations -- one with the education to compete in the global market for good wages and benefits, and the other whose education leaves them competing against recent immigrants and workers in low-wage countries. This is unacceptable to decent people and dangerous for our national future.
We cannot increase wages with tax cuts that produce more low-wage jobs, but we can do it with investments in the education of both our native-born and immigrant work force.

HEADLINE: Esther Goldfrank, 100, Dies; Studied Pueblos in Southwest

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Esther Goldfrank, an accidental anthropologist who did pioneering research among the Pueblo Indians of the Southwest in the 1920's and churned out papers on the experience for the next half-century, died on April 23 at a nursing home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 100.
As a Barnard economics major whose sole exposure to anthropology had been an introductory course during her senior year, Miss Goldfrank, a Manhattan native whose maiden name was Schiff, would hardly seem to have had the credentials to go sashaying off to New Mexico at the age of 24 as a front-line scientific investigator. 
 But she had received a B in the course, and apparently had made an impression on the professor. A year after her graduation in 1918, she was holding down a stifling job on Wall Street when she got a note asking if she would like to be his secretary.
Within months, she was in the field with the man she and a generation of other young female protegees called Papa Franz and the world knew as Franz Boas, the German-born social scientist widely recognized as the father of American anthropology and the mentor of such giants as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict.
For all his stature, Boas was a figure of some controversy within the anthropology community.
Among other things, he played down the fledgling field's emphasis on biology and concentrated on studying the cultural variations of disparate societies, each of which, he maintained, was as valid and valuable as any other.
Although he had laid the foundations for cultural anthropology through his work with Eskimos in the 1880's and later with the Kwakiutl and other Indians of the Pacific Northwest, Boas was persuaded to turn his attention to the Southwest in the early 1920's by his patron, the redoubtable Elsie Clews Parsons, the wealthy, Barnard-trained social worker who had become a force in anthropology after becoming enchanted with the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico.
It was she who financed the Boas expeditions and paid Miss Goldfrank's salary, but Miss Goldfrank did not remain a secretary long. Almost immediately she expanded her duties to include interviewing Pueblo residents and painstakingly recording the meticulous observations of behavior that was the hallmark of the celebrated Boas methodology.
Miss Goldfrank concentrated initially on kinship, the mundane study of things like what one calls one's mother and who is considered a brother, which was the anthropological rage of the day.
She inadvertently broadened the scope of her scholarship and enriched the field of anthropology when she met a woman at a well and was invited to her home in the Cochiti Pueblo.
The woman was Carolyn Quintana, the daughter of a legendary Conchiti storyteller, and Miss Goldfrank was so enthralled with her detailed and vivid descriptions of the minutiae of Conchiti culture that she moved into the Pueblo and began taking notes.
Among the results were a stream of papers, including a 1927 monograph, "The Social and Ceremonial Organization of Conchiti."
Miss Goldfrank did most of her field work from 1920 to 1922, the year she married Walter S. Goldfrank, a Manhattan businessman and widower with three young sons. Except for a brief return visit to New Mexico in 1924, partly to alleviate postpartum depression after the birth of a daughter, Miss Goldfrank spent most of the next two decades as a homemaker and mother in White Plains, although an unusually prolific one who kept the typewriter clacking.
After the death of her husband in 1935, Miss Goldfrank moved back to Manhattan and made one more important field trip, this this time to Alberta, Canada, which led to other papers, including a 1945 monograph, "Changing Configurations in the Social Organization of a Blackfoot Tribe During the Reserve Period."
By then her 1940 marriage to Karl A. Wittfogel, a social scientist and former Communist, had altered the focus of her scholarship. Mr. Wittfogel had worked in China in developing his celebrated theory that the construction and control of irrigation canals had concentrated the power of ruling elites and spawned despotism, and Miss Goldfrank joined the staff of his short-lived China project at Columbia and applied his theories in her own continuing writings on Indians.
Miss Goldfrank published her memoirs privately in 1978. She titled the book "Notes on an Undirected Life."
Miss Goldfrank, whose second husband died in 1988, is survived by a daughter, Susan Lenhoff of Israel; a stepson, Thomas Goldfrank of Mamaroneck; 6 step-grandchildren, and 12 step-great-grandchildren.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1997, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Esther Goldfrank, an anthropologist who studied the Pueblo Indians, included an incorrect reference to the publication of her memoirs, "Notes on an Undirected Life," in 1978. They were published by the Queens College Press; they were not published privately.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
A Roundabout Tour of Southwest Glories

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
AROUND the turn of the century, when few people visited or even knew about remote natural wonders in the southwest like Zion Canyon, regional boosters came up with a slogan to attract tourists: "See Europe if you will but see America first."
In early April, I took them up on the idea by driving from Phoenix to Los Angeles, normally a straight shot of 369 miles on Interstate 10, taking about six hours. But I made it in eight days and 1,670 miles -- striking north from Phoenix to Flagstaff; circling east into the Navajo and Hopi reservations; cutting across the Arizona Strip (the isolated area north of the Grand Canyon, to Utah), and then wandering west over the deserts of Nevada and California. Most of the way I stayed on secondary highways so thronged by astonishing sights that to call them scenic is to drastically understate. 
 Generally, I had warm days and frosty nights and the great, uplifted area around the Grand Canyon, known as the Colorado Plateau, to myself. I got a little lonesome sometimes -- though being alone made the trip seem like a great adventure. And all along the way, I met Europeans -- like a French tour group, full of oo la la's for the Painted Desert, and a lone Italian woman who pulled in next to me at an overlook above Navajo Bridge near Lee's Ferry, Ariz. In evident scenery shock, she got out of her car, took off her sunglasses, and said, "I don't know why anyone goes to Brooklyn and those places."
I could ask myself almost the same question. I'd seen the Grand Canal of China, but why had it taken me so long to visit the deserts and canyons of the American Southwest?
Maybe I'd been waiting for just the right deal, which I found in a See America package, designed to help Avis Rent a Car System reposition a surfeit of automobiles left in Arizona and Florida by one-way renters. The package offers travelers extremely attractive incentives to drive the cars to California or the Pacific Northwest from Arizona, and to the Northeast or Midwest from Florida, with no drop-off charge, unlimited miles, trip protection insurance (including a primary collision damage waiver), eight-day car rental, seven nights' accommodation in chain motels, a customized itinerary, 10-minute long-distance phone card and one-way air fare to or from the departure city.
For instance, if you're in Los Angeles you get air fare to Phoenix so you can drive home; if you start out in Phoenix, you get a return plane ticket from Los Angeles; or if your plans are somewhat more complicated, as mine were, you get a $100 credit toward a flight booked by Preferred Holidays, the travel service handling the See America package.
The basic price from Arizona to California was $299 a person, double occupancy, or $523 for solo travelers like me (though while I was away, rates dropped even lower, and new options were added, like a package for one-way car rental only, at $6.99 a day). When I explained to the agent at Preferred Holidays that I needed a plane ticket from New York to Phoenix, with a return from Los Angeles, she got me a round-trip ticket on USAirways for an amazing $268. With the $100 See America airfare credit, the total package price came to $666.
With so much country to see, I set about plotting the perfect route, using a map and a booklet that Preferred Holidays sent me with state-by-state listings of the Howard Johnson, Days Inn, Ramada, Super 8 and Travelodge motels where I could book rooms. Unfortunately, most of them were in relatively large towns like Flagstaff, Ariz., and St. George, Utah, some distance from a number of the places I wanted to visit -- which is why I had to cross Monument Valley off my list. But I couldn't bear to miss the Anasazi ruins in Canyon de Chelly (pronounced shay), the Colorado River at Lee's Ferry, and all the topographical marvels of the lonely Arizona Strip.
Nor did I simply want to drive by places like these. I needed time to get out of the car, hike, explore and picnic.
To do all this, I booked an extra night at Marble Canyon Lodge near Lee's Ferry, which I paid for apart from the package -- $45 for a small double, with a patio facing the Vermilion Cliffs. The rest of the time, I reserved rooms in participating motels: a Ramada in Flagstaff; a Days Inn in Holbrook, Ariz. (about 130 miles southwest of Canyon de Chelly); two nights in another Days Inn in St. George (45 miles south of Zion National Park); a Howard Johnson's in Las Vegas; Days Suites in Victorville, Calif. (about 175 miles south of Death Valley), and the Ramada Plaza Hotel LAX South in Los Angeles.
"Who ever heard the returning traveler exclaim over one of the great motels of the world he stayed in?" William Least Heat Moon says in "Blue Highways." Still, I found clean, reasonably comfortable rooms in all the chain motels, though the Days Inns were most consistently attractive. And the Ramada in Los Angeles was downright lovely, with a sheltered swimming pool, fountain and patio, and a rack rate of $109 to $139.
Early on, I discovered that each motel voucher was actually worth $42, and that the prices for highway accommodations in the southwest are amazingly low, averaging around $35 a night. A motel I passed in Mesquite, Nev., took the record, though, with a nightly rate of $11.99.
Meals were somewhat more expensive. I ate my share of Big Macs, and found two good steakhouses, Black Bart's in Flagstaff, where I was able to order an excellent burger off the children's menu for $5.25, and the Butterfield Stage Company on old Route 66 in Holbrook, with barbecued chicken and unlimited trips to the salad bar for $9.95.
The very best road food I sampled was a Navajo fry bread taco at the Tuba City Truck Stop Cafe, about an hour south of Lee's Ferry, for $6.20. But my favorite meals were picnic lunches made from provisions I kept in a little cooler I bought before leaving Phoenix (for $14). Cold cuts, cheese, fruit, granola bars and juice were rendered delectable by beautiful scenery.
In the Avis lot at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, I checked to make sure that my economy class Pontiac Sunfire with California plates had a spare tire and manual. I'd planned the trip so that I could visit at least one site every day, without having to drive more than 350 miles between sunrise and sunset. I started right there in Phoenix at the Heard Museum of Native American Art and Culture (admission $6), a graceful Spanish colonial-style building near downtown. Among other things, it has a wonderful collection of kachina dolls (collected by Senator Barry M. Goldwater and the Fred Harvey Company), representing the spirit world of the Hopi and Navajo people.
Then I drove 130 miles north to Flagstaff on I-17 -- surprisingly fast, since that very day, the speed limit had been raised from 65 to 75 miles per hour. Along the way, the elevation rose, too, from about 1,000 feet above sea level in Phoenix to 7,000 feet in chilly Flagstaff, huddled up against the snowcapped San Francisco Mountains. Technically, I was climbing to the Colorado Plateau, and I found it thrilling because there, in the words of John McPhee, lie North America's "geologic operas" -- its Grand, Zion, Bryce, Paria and Marble Canyons, mountains, mesas, and endless rows of cliffs with names like Echo, Grand Wash, and Hurricane.
The rather austere Ramada Limited on Lucky Lane in Flagstaff was so close to I-40 that I fell asleep to the drone of traffic. But I was up with the sun the next morning -- literally, because first thing, I visited the Lowell Observatory atop Mars Hill just west of downtown (admission $3), where I got to look through a special telescope at the sun. It showed up as a calm red disk even though it shines every second as brightly as 4.5 billion 20-megaton hydrogen bombs.
Fortunately, it was still high in the sky when I reached Holbrook, about 90 miles east of Flagstaff via I-40, which parallels old Route 66 and the railroad tracks. So I had plenty of time to buy groceries (for about $17), check into a nice Days Inn, and then head 30 more miles east to the Petrified Forest National Park (admission $10 per car). There, I toured the remains of a swamp that covered the region 225 million years ago, when, scientists say, Arizona was about where Panama is today, and picnicked on a petrified log, shot through with amethyst and jasper. At the north side of the park, there are viewpoints for the Painted Desert -- a region of carbuncled badlands decorated for spring with sprays of evening primrose and snowball sand verbena.
I went to bed at 9 and left Holbrook the next morning at 5, headed about 130 miles to Canyon de Chelly National Monument, a three-branched system of twisting gorges 200 to 1,000 feet high cut by streams that rise in the Chuska Mountains to the northeast. Between 350 and 1300 A.D, the mysterious, height-defying Anasazi people settled into masonry apartments carved into the sides of the red sandstone cliffs, with ladders for access to the canyon lip. Today, the ruins of their pueblos remain, while Navajo farmers raise corn and peaches in the bottomlands, lined by cottonwood trees and patches of quicksand.
I know about the quicksand because I arrived at the canyon visitors center near the town of Chinle just in time to join a group hike led by a Navajo guide named Hank Tsosie ($10), who wore his long lustrous black hair in a ponytail and is a member of the Coyote Pass and Two Rivers Running Together clans. We entered the canyon on the trail to the split-level White House Ruin (occupied from 1040 to 1275), listened intently as Hank told us about the healing properties of snakeweed, and reached canyon bottom as a beautiful Navajo woman was letting her goats out to pasture. Then we rolled up our jeans and doffed hiking boots to walk downstream in the cold river, wading through shallow water and benign quicksand (into which we sometimes sank to our thighs). A beautiful slog, altogether, though longer than I'd planned.
INDEED, it was midafternoon by the time I hit the highway again to drive one of the longer segments of the trip, about 200 miles from Canyon de Chelly across the three great mesas of the Hopi Reservation to Tuba City, which sits astride the Echo Cliffs. There, I turned north on Highway 89 -- the route of Mormon pioneers sent in the late 1800's to colonize a country even more unforgiving than the Great Salt Lake. My breath stuck in my chest when I reached 467-foot Navajo Bridge on Highway 89A, built in 1928 (but superseded by a new bridge just downstream, finished in 1995). Set against the emerald green Colorado River at mile zero of the Grand Canyon, it glints like Navajo silver, crafted on a grand scale.
I had a cozy overnight at the Marble Canyon Lodge, a nice run the next morning to Lee's Ferry, which was one of the principal Colorado River crossings before the construction of the bridge, and then another invigorating drive 200 miles west across the Arizona Strip, passing the northern entrance to the Grand Canyon National Park (still closed for winter at the time of my visit). I saw the woody, snow-patched Kaibab Plateau; Shinarump Cliffs; Mount Trumbull far to the south, and Pipe Springs, where the Colorado Plateau surveyer, John Wesley Powell, stopped. Then just before St. George, Utah, I spied the 2,000- to 3,000-foot walls of Zion Canyon -- only I didn't realize what they were.
I figured it out the next day when I drove to Zion ($10 to enter) from my Days Inn in St. George. There, I asked a ranger at the visitors center just north of Springdale, Utah, how the canyon carved by the North Fork of the Virgin River differs from the Grand. "It's younger," he said.
It's also not as wide, and you can drive along canyon bottom almost to the point where the scary narrows begin. But I hiked up to the lip at 6,508-foot Observation Point, an eight-mile round trip, passing at least 10 varieties of wildflowers.
I visited Zion on a perfectly blue-skied Saturday. Over the next three days, I strolled the Strip in Las Vegas with a nice couple from New Jersey whom I met at the $7.95 buffet in the MGM Grand, where I ate much too much prime rib and stuffed crab; drove hot lonely miles across Death Valley, and then cruised into the smog pocket lodged atop Los Angeles. But nothing topped Zion. I should have stayed there for seven nights. I should have seen Bryce, Cedar Breaks and Capitol Reef.
It is some consolation to tell myself that I did the broad survey version of the American Southwest. Next time, I'll go back and specialize. It's unparalleled country.
 
Bottom line
 
The Basics
Besides the cost of the See America package, I spent $215 on food, admissions and an extra night at Marble Canyon Lodge, and $75 on gas.
Information on the See America package, which lasts until June 30 (travel must begin by June 20), is available from Preferred Holidays, (800) 508-5454. The package from Florida to the Midwest or Northeast costs $300 a person, double occupany, and the package for Arizona departures (with drop-offs in California, Portland, Ore., and Seattle) starts at $250 a person, double occupancy.

HEADLINE: John Sexton Pleads (and Pleads and Pleads) His Case

BYLINE: By James Traub 

 BODY:
People who choose the intellectual life tend to maintain a bemused, even disdainful distance from the hyperbolic enthusiasm and salesmanship that constitute so much of the workaday world. This is one reason that academic institutions have so much trouble finding strong leaders. John Sexton, a theologian and an expert in civil procedure, has been dean of New York University Law School since 1988. It's safe to say that almost all of Sexton's colleagues are grateful that he is able to conduct himself in a way that they themselves would find unthinkable. 
 Earlier this year, I accompanied Sexton to Chicago, wher ehe was to address a lunch for local alumni, applicants who had been admitted to N.Y.U. Law but had not yet decided whether to attend and Federal judges, who had been invited strictly for decoration. The luncheon was held in the Cite restaurant atop the 70story Lake Point Tower, where the decor runs to mirrors, ornate chandeliers, and ceiling-height windows that let in the sunshine dancing off Lake Michigan.
Sexton moved to the lectern. "You've got to remember that this is a family affair," he said. Sexton, who is 54 and married and has two children, tends to use "family" metaphorically to refer tot he sanctified community at N.Y.U. Law School that he is forever marshaling and ministering to. But he also had a real family in mind - Victoria Gouletas, class of '99; her dad, Nicholas, who was the developer of Lake Point Tower and was paying for the event, and a whole tableful of Gouletases.
Earlier that morning, Sexton had asked Nick for a $1.5 million contribution to the law school, demonstrating his love for Nick's natal place by reciting the opening lines of "The Odyssey" in Greek; Gouletas had not been noticeably moved. Now Victoria and her dad were seated at the dais. Sexton, who is metabolically incapable of deliverying a speech from behind a lectern, walked over to Victoria, placed a hand on her head and told a story demonstrating the young woman's public-spiritedness. "If my daughtah Katie grows up like her," he said in his scrupulously preserved Brooklynese, "done deal." Victoria squirmed.
"Secondly," Sexton boomed, "we have a grandmother in the room! And grandmothers are responsible for it all. So we should give a round of applause to Grandma Maria for giving us such a great family." Grandma Maria, the Gouletas matriarch, was dressed in black, her hair pullled back tight. Sexton walked to her table, got down on his knees, but his arms around her neck and gave her a kiss. Maria Gouletas, her eyes shining, tipped up her face to receive it.
It is possible, of course, that a perfect cynic, a Music Man, could get away with this sort of thing. But Sexton is not a cynic. Like all truly great salesmen, he makes you believe his own line because he believes his own line because he believes it, too.
It is possible, of course, that a perfect cynic, a Music Man, could get away with this sort of thing. But Sexton is not a cynic. Like all truly great salesmen, he makes you believe his won line because he believes it, too.
After disentangling himself from Grandma Maria, he told his audience that N.Y.U. was "the finest law school in the world." Even Sexton may not have believed that. He was speaking in what he calls his "aspirational" mode. He also said, "Sixteen senior people who were recognized as the leaders in their field have left Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Stanford and Michigan to come to us since 1990." This is very close to the truth. As for the students, he said: "If you're next to any of them, take their autograph. The only two schools that one the objective criteria were stronger at the median than us were Yale and Stanford." This factoid requires so many footnotes as to be almost meaningless, but there's no question that the law school under Sexton's leadership has markedly improved the quality of its students body.
During Sexton's nine-year tenure, N.Y.U. has gone from being a very good law school to being a premier law school. "There is no school that has made the quantum leap in terms of development across the board that N.Y.U. has," says Arthur Miller, Harvard's legendary professor of civil procedure. "And in terms of the development of a law school, John Sexton is the greatest dean in the United States."
JOHN SEXTON WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY that he is not wholly responsible for N.Y.U.'s rise, though wehter this is genuine modesty or simple caution is impossible to know. N.Y.U. Law School was a humble institution located on two floors of a Greenwich Village office building when Arhtur T. Vanderbilt became dean in 1943. Vanderbilt created a scholarship program to draw bright students from around the country, and between the money that he raised and the real-estate deals that he forged, the law school was able to build Vanderbilt Hall, the brick, would-be-Ivy League structure that sits on Washington Square South and continues to house most of the law school's offices and classrooms.
Vanderbilt also had the inspired idea of buying the Mueller Macaroni Company, which supplied the school with a steady source of income. When the trustees sold the company in 1977, N.Y.U. became of the nation's richest law schools overnight. Norman Redlich, who became dean in 1975, went on a building spree that eventually added two dormitories, a vastly expanded library and a renovated building to house the school's clinical program. By the mid-80's, N.Y.U. was a nationally recognized law school, known for turning out tax lawyers for the big New York firms and dedicated advocates for Legal Aid and the A.C.L.U.
In the great law-school pecking order, though, it fell well below Columbia, its uptown rival, and it was not considered hospitable to the kind of theoretical inquiry then sweeping the lawschool world. "There was a sense that being an intellectual was elitist," says Lawrence Sager, a constitutional-law professor at N.Y.U.
When Redlich announced that he was stepping down, Sexton, then a recently tenured professor, was the candidate of the theoreticians. His academic pedigree was impeccable: Harvard Law, Law Review and clerkships with Appeals Court Judge David Bazelon and Chief Justice Warren Burger. But Sexton was not a prominent scholar, and he was not distinguished only or even primarily by his credentials. He had a priestly way about him, with a hand on the arm and an ear always ready for confession. He loved the law school as if it were the Mother Church. But he was also worldly; he talked like a ward heeler, knew everyone's name and understood the importance of alliances. It was a gift he came by naturally: his grandfather had led the Jefferson Democratic Club in Brooklyn and was Jimmy Walker's Tax Commissioner; his father had been a Brooklyn lawyer, a frequenter of taverns and also a leader of the Jeffersons.
Sexton's skill as a political operator and his extravagant charm made some of his colleagues uneasy. They wondered, as Lawrence Sager says, whether Sexton was truly artless or whether he had in fact constructed an "extraordinarily elaborate public persona." Sager says he's still not sure. And then there was the issue of ambition. "He always struck people as a young man in a hurry," faculty member says.
But there was a good argument to be made that a young man in a hurry was exactly what the law school needed. Sexton and the people around him believed that N.Y.U. Law had to become the kind of school that atttracted talented scholars. When he became dean, Sexton preached fervently about a new kind of law school in which a model of "engagement" would replace the model of "independent contractor." He offered young people the chance to join "the Enterprise" - the term he coined for a community of like-minded souls that at the time existed only in his imagination.
Sexton promised a skeptical junior faculty that he would bring in top "lateral" - scholars who were thinking about leaving other schools. And then he did it. In 1991, Lea Brilmayer, a recognized star in the field of international juris-prudence, left Yale for N.Y.U.; the next year, Richard Stewart, a figure of equal prominence in environmental law and a former professor at Harvard, accepted a position at the law school. In recent years, four major figures have left the University of Chicago for N.Y.U.
One afternoon not long ago, as Sexton was sitting in his office, sketching out his vision for the first few years of the next millennium, a call came in. Sexton said, "No, put it throught." He wanted me to hear this "Is this Al Sykes, N.Y.U. professah?" The faculty had just extended an offer to Sykes, an expert in international law at Chicago. Sexton had a huge grin on his face. "It is part of the dream to have you come here. ... Make a list of anything that's on your mind that I can help with. The way we will work this process is I will ask you to be the recording secretary for our conversations. And at the end, when I'm getting ready to send you a formal appointment letter, I'm going to ask you to give me a memo incorporating what we discussed, in your words, suitable for including in the letter from me to you. Your job is to tell me what will make it work for you, and my job is to make it happen if it is all within my power. We are not in a negotiating situation here. I don't think we've ever disappointed anybody. We love you here."
How can you say no to a man who wants for you only what you want for yourself?
JOHN SEXTON GREW UP IN A MTHIC PLACE and time - the beachfront community of Belle Harbor, on the Brooklyn-Queens broder, in the 1950's. He was raised in the true faith, which is to say that he believed devoutly in the Dodgers, the nuns and the Democratic Party. By age 11, Sexton was the big noise of Belle Harbor, an operator of world-class potential. One day, he recalls, he was playing stoop ball "and Mrs. Janowitz comes down the street pushing a baby carriage with two beach chairs and an umbrella. And I said: 'Mrs. Janowitz, why don't you keep your things in my parents' garage? I'll put them out on the beach in the spot where you like them, and I'll charge you $10 for the chair and $5 for the umbrella.' " Soon he had jurisdiction over 144 chairs and 70 umbrellas. "Then I recruited these two 10-year-olds to carry the stuff out on a stretcher, and I stood there like Rommel. This was 1953. A first-year associate at Cravath was earning $2,500. I cleared $3,000 during the summer."
At Brooklyn Prep, Sexton became a national debate champion, which is to say that he was not only very smart but also ferociously competitive. But rather than continuing with debate when he enrolled at Fordham College, he approached the nuns who ran St. Brendan's, the girls' parochial school in Brooklyn that his younger sister attended, and asked if he could start a debate program there. Sexton himself can't explain this bizarre desision. Perhaps he recognized that he could accomplish greater things as a coach than as a player.
Competing in an almost entirely male world, St. Brendan's won two national championships in Sexton's first five years and was always near the top during his 15 years as coach - despite the fact that he was working with girls who might not have attended college at all were it not for his intervention. Sexton was the Knute Rockne of debate. Despite his competitive zeal, though, St. Brendan's was the forerunner of his communitarian Enterprise. "It was a Communist society," Sexton says. "It was a hundred hours a week during the school year, and it wasn't just debate. We would go to 40 museums a year. We read the great books. And then we traveled for five weeks during the summer." Sexton got the girls scholarships and kept up with them, and even married one of them; the marriage lasted three years and ended in annulment.
While serving as the unpaid coach of the debate team, Sexton graduated from Fordham, wnet on for a doctorate in theology, maintained a full-time job teaching religion at a small Catholic college in Brooklyn and established a lucrative L.S.A.T.-prep course to raise funds for St. Brendan's and other penniless debate teams. He might well have spent his life as the Mr. Chips of Brooklyn, but in 1974 he applied to law school and accepted at Harvard after Laurence Tribe, an old friend from his debating days, intervened. Sexton found that he was very good at the law and that he loved law school. It took him less than a decade to go from Harvard graduated to N.Y.U. dean.
SEXTON IS ONE OF THE FEW LAW-SCHOOL deans who teach first-year classes. He insists that students call him John and makes himself available for ministering 24 hours a day. One of the first times I went to his office I found him sitting with two students, Greg Schmolka and Lainie Batoff. Sexton turned to me and explained, "There's a tradition that every year one couple gets formed in my civil-procedure class who get married." Schmolka and Batoff were tending in that direction. "The funny thing is," Sexton said to Schmolka, "the first semester I had you involved with Kim Gantcher. I mean, you were sitting next to her every day."
"We were friends from high school."
"It was a false signal." Sexton then asked them, as he asks every student, to name one thing they would do to make the school better. They were stuck. Sexton, in turn, lavished praise on them. Schmolka needed some bucking up; he hadn't got a clerkship he had been hoping for in California. Sexton said that it was for the best, because he didn't want the two of them spending the summer on separate coasts. Schmolka and Batoff saw the point. There would be further counseling.
More students came in; everyone agreed that Columbia, unlike N.Y.U., was tense and competitive and not fun. Sexton was spinning around in his chair, his palms under his thighs. His black loafers were going tap, tap, tap. He was feeding on the students, and they on him.
Sexton is the living embodiment of the idea of "engagement." It's his own example that give substance to what might otherwise be a sappy idea. N.Y.U. is well known in the law-school world as a genuinely collegial place, where young faculty members needn't fear being shot down and factionalism is frowned upon. It is also a place where teachers are expected to take their pastorla responsibilities seriously. Frank Upham, one of Sexton's early recruits, says, "I wanted to come to a place where if you kept your door open and talked to students, you weren't considered weak."
At the same time, N.Y.U. seems to be in no danger of becoming too nice for its own good. The big New York firms that are the school's principal end-users aparrently can live with the Enterprise, since the average starting salary for last year's N.Y.U. graduates was $85,000, the highest figure in the country. Indeed, there is an underlying tension at the school between the desire for distinctness and the desire for competitve success. Among the elite law schools, N.Y.U. still has by far the most extensive clinical-law program, which teaches practical legal skills, but Anthony Amsterdam, founder and director of the program, worries that this may be changing as a result of Sexton's having bought into the "star system" that now rules legal education. "N.Y.U. can't be all things to all people," Amsterdam says. "I would look for ways to focus on the traditional strengths of N.Y.U. and attract the kind of student who would come here to learn to be a great litigator."
Sexton sees N.Y.U. in quite different terms. In 1993, he and several colleagues, and then alumni, began developing a Global Law program, which perfectly suits Sexton sense of law's larger purposes as well as his grandiose vision for N.Y.U. "Globalization" was in the air; the new program would confirm N.Y.U.'s status as a leadership school. It would be the first school to move beyond the traditional study of comparative international law to systematically examine transnational legal issues.
The alumni loved the idea. Sexton got a $5 million gift to give a dozen or so full scholarships a year to foreign students who already have law degrees. He was able to attract many of the world's leading English-speaking foreign legal scholars, partly because he was paying them good money to teach a seven-week course before their own semesters started. Things got gidy enough that Sexton seriously contemplated opening an N.Y.U.-supervised law school in Beiging. That didn't happen, but an arrangement with George Soro's Central European University, in Budapest, is looking increasingly likely.
Many faculty members consider "globalization" a meaningless buzzword and chalk up the project to Sextonian empire-building. One detractor at another law school describes the program as "a set of no-compete agreements with various foreign legal academics." Others see it as a masterful act of positioning. Lenoard Strickdean, the University of Arkansas law-school dean who headed the American Bar Association's accreditation team for N.Y.U., has some doubts about the actual depth of the program but says of Sexton, "His seizing the idea, his embellishment of it and his ability to sell it have created an extraordinary kind of meteor of achievement and enthusiasm."
Most deans consider fund-raising a necessary evil; John Sexton, shameless on behalf of his beloved institution, relishes the job. Sexton understood that the only way to finance the ambitious expansion of the faculty he envisioned was to substantially increase the endownment. Soon after he became dean, he convened a 50-member alumni body, brought them to the campus four times a year and ardently preache dthe virtues of the Enterprise. Martin Lipton, the chairman of N.Y.U. Law's board of trustees, says: "We had been trying for years to develop a national alumni network, and we were singularly unsuccessful. Three years after John Sexton became dean, we had a national network."
People who hadn't set foot in the school in 20 years started giving serious money. And Lipton himself made an earnest profession of faith when he announced that his firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz - a bunch of N.Y.U. kids who had made very, very good - was donating $5 million to the school. Sexton is very aspirational on fund-raising. When consultants suggested a $40 million capital campaign, he countered with $75 million. After a series of upward adjustments, the official target is now $175 million, though Sexton is counting on $200 million.
"You talk to John Sexton and you think that almost anything is possible," says Al Engelberg, a patent lawyer who gave $5 million to establish the Center on Innovation in a Global Economy in on Innovation in a Global Economy in 1994. Last year, Sexton solicited a $5 million gift from an anonymous donor to give free tuition to students who choose to go into low-paying fields.
Sexton dreams of creating the first tuition-free law school. The idea is that graduates start paying money into a tution pool once they have started earning the big bucks. Sexton says he needs only $100 million or so to get the idea off the ground; he has already asked the same anonymous donor for a $50 million matching gift. He's sure that whoever eliminates tuition first will transform legal education. And who's to say he's wrong?
Last year, Sexton has a bolt of insight: somebody was going to give a $100 million gift to a law school. That law school had to be N.Y.U. The fact of the gift was almost more important than the use to which it would be put. By the time I met Sexton, he was scaling back, for the moment, to %50 million or even $20 million, which would still constitute the largest gift ever given to a law school. He had romanced a young donor, who was thinking seriously about the 50. He had the 20 virtually in hand, but it wasn't quite ripe for announcement. Another donor was serious at 10. And he had this fantasy about a five-year, $200 million gift from a major philanthropist, though the philanthropist didn't know about it yet. He had the whole thing written out on index cards. He saw an almost harmonic convergence of interests. Wouldn't just a little piece be enough? No way, Sexton said. "It only works if you do the whole thing."
Sexton has never lost his maniacally competitive edge - he has just placed it in the service of increasingly refined causes. When he talks about N.Y.U.'s competitors, the parish-priest manner drops away. Columbia he says, is "yesterday's war." As for Chicago, "We've sucked them dry." When I told Sexton that I would be talking with Columbia's dean, David Leebron, a rival dating back to Harvard days, he had two faculty members do some research, and they came up with a half-dozen cases in which N.Y.U. had beat out Columbia for a prized lateral. Leebron bristled at the list, insisting that his school had taken a serious run at only one of the six. When I brought that back to Sexton, he exploded.
"They would have given a digit for Larry kramer!" he fumed. It is, in fact, widely believed in the law-school world that N.Y.U. has eaten Columbia's lunch on faculty hires. Sexton also insists that N.Y.U. attracts better students than Columbia and that most students who get into both go to N.Y.U. Leebron says it's the other way around. Here the consensus falls slightly on Columbia's side, but the gap, if there is one, is clearly closing.
What makes Secton crazy is that the world hasn't learned what he considers a self-evident truth. In recent years, N.Y.U. has finished sixth in the annual U.S. News and World Report survey of law schools. This year, Sexton was praying for an improvement, but the school came out sixth again. He was crestfallen, but ready with the spin: since Stanford, Chicago and Columbia were tightly bunched just ahead, he explained, a tiny spurt could land N.Y.U. in third place next year. He ascribes N.Y.U.'s ranking this year to "reputational lag."
It might take longer to overcome that lag than Sexton thinks. One highly regarded legal scholar says of Sexton: "He's a great guy, and he's taken N.Y.U. from a scrappy institution to one of the leading players in American legal education. But the main accomplishment of N.Y.U. has been bringing a bunch of people from places like Chicago who want to be in New York for other reasons. The market test is which institution could get a core member of the other institution to move. There's no central player at N.Y.U. who Harvard or Yale would go out to get, whereas N.Y.U. would give an arm or a leg to get the core members of any other institution."
Maybe N.Y.U. isn't quite there yet, but nobody questions where it's heading. Lea Brilmayer, the first big lateral transfer, is probably going back to Yale - a big blow - but Sexton is trying, in his parish-priest mode, to show her that it might be better for her to stay. Al Sykes, of Chicago, is seriously pondering. Steven Holmes, a major figure in international law - with a major connection to George Soros - and William Allen, chancellor of the Delaware Chancery Court and a giant figure in corporate law, are coming next semester. And there is furious action going on beneath the surface. One morning, Sexton met me at the door of his office, giant plastic coffee holder in hand, and announced gleefully, "There's been an implosion at Harvard." The Harvard Law School faculty had failed by one vote to make a tenure offer to Jesse Fried, a young star in corporate law. N.Y.U. was Fried's second choice. And John Coates, another star, who was leaving Wachtell, Lipton, was leaning toward N.Y.U. over Harvard. "In terms of entry-level faculty," Sexton said, "we're now fighting essentially with Harvard for the endgame."
There was a whole play shaping up in corporate law, historically N.Y.U.'s weakest major field. Sexton dropped into his swivel chair, swiveled once or twice and said: "We've got Marcel Kahan. We've got Robert Daines, who I think maybe will grow up to be a Marcel, who we have identified as a numero uno. Maybe we'll get a shot at both Coates and Fried." (John Coates has since accepted an offer from Harvard.) "O.K., so now you go to the senior level. The blue-chippers, the top drawer, are Lucian Bebchuk at Harvard, Reinier Kraakman at Harvard, Henry Hansmann and Roberta Romano at Yale, Mark Roe at Columbia, Ron Gilson at Stanford and Geoff Miller here. So we got Miller, then we got Hansmann and Kraakman visiting this year. Kraakman has already said that he wants to stay another year. Kraakman and Hansmann are best friends." Sexton had also given a full-time job to Kraakman's wife, Catherine Krupnick, an anthropologist.
Sexton was leaning out over his little round table, and he was so excited that he was whispering. His eyes had a mandman glint. "We've gone from a standins stop seven years ago to a point where we're already one of the top two or three. If we get either Coates or Fried, and one, let alone two, of these three, then we're the player." Sexton looked up at me with a huge smile: he was talking numero uno.

WE NOW KNOW
 Rethinking Cold War History.
 By John Lewis Gaddis.
 425 pp. New York:
 Oxford University Press. $30. 
 SINCE the Soviet Union came apart a little over five years ago, historians have awaited the opening of long-sealed archives in Moscow and other capitals of the former East bloc, hoping for new light on old questions. Now, at last, some of the archives have opened a crack, and a handful of hard-working scholars from East and West have started mining them for their historical treasure.
In "We Now Know," John Lewis Gaddis, the respected dean of cold war historians, surveys what these scholars have unearthed and compares their gleanings with some of our earlier suppositions. The key issues that, believe it or not, are still earnestly debated within the scholarly community and on which he seeks enlightenment are these: Who was chiefly to blame for the almost 50-year confrontation between the Soviet Union and the West; and could Americans have done anything to avert it?
Now that he has read some of the documents, Mr. Gaddis's answer is the same one he gave a few years ago in a celebrated article in the journal Foreign Affairs -- the leader solely responsible for unleashing the costliest war in history was Stalin. "Once Stalin wound up at the top in Moscow," Mr. Gaddis writes, "and once it was clear his state would survive the war, then it looks . . . clear that there was going to be a cold war whatever the West did."
To say that the recently released materials do not shake Mr. Gaddis's earlier view of Stalin's responsibility is not to say that he found no surprises. Take the question of the role played by Communist ideology. Mr. Gaddis, like many historians in the West, had come to believe that Marxism-Leninism had declined into little more than the empty armor of legitimacy, an after-the-fact justification for measures actually taken for reasons of Realpolitik. But looking at the new documents, he points to critical junctures when, he says, Communist ideology not only mattered, but actually determined the behavior of East-bloc leaders. He cites as an example Stalin's insistence after World War II that the next war to break out would take place among capitalist countries. Stalin subscribed to Lenin's teaching that capitalist nations were too willing to profit at one another's expense to work together for long. This expectation, Mr. Gaddis says, blinded the Soviet dictator to what was going on under his nose when the rapacious behavior of Soviet troops in Germany and the Communist seizures of power in Eastern Europe caused the Americans and Western Europeans to develop the Marshall Plan and then NATO in a long-lasting coalition directed against him.
Mr. Gaddis points to other instances long after Stalin died in which Marxist-Leninist ideology played a vital role. Late in the 1950's, for example, Nikita Khrushchev and his colleagues almost literally fell in love with Fidel Castro. Mr. Castro's enthusiasm for Marxism-Leninism and his obvious charisma beguiled the Soviet leaders into committing themselves heavily to the Cuban revolution. Such a commitment in the far-off Caribbean at first made little strategic sense and proved outrageously expensive, but Khrushchev and his colleagues hoped Cuba might be the spark that would ignite revolutions all over Latin America. Mr. Gaddis quotes Mr. Castro: "Nikita loved Cuba very much. . . . He had a weakness for Cuba, you might say -- emotionally, and so on -- because he was a man of political conviction, a man with a political doctrine, a political theory. . . . He thought in terms of capitalism versus socialism." Mr. Castro made the aging bureaucrats in the Kremlin feel like youthful revolutionaries again.
Examining the special qualities that each superpower brought to building alliances abroad, Mr. Gaddis contrasts the obstacles that Marxism-Leninism placed in the way of the Communist leaders with the opportunities that democratic practices provided to the West. Unlike the great historian George Kennan, whose presence pervades this book and who had warned early on that democracies were ill-suited to the pursuit of foreign policy, let alone the maintenance of empire, Mr. Gaddis believes that the democratic habits of deal making, compromise and tolerance served the United States well when it came to holding the Western coalition together.
In the end, Mr. Gaddis says, it was nuclear weaponry that imposed its terrible discipline and forced both sides to temper their moral and political absolutes. As President John F. Kennedy understood when he acquiesced to the Berlin wall in the summer of 1961, and as he and Khrushchev learned in some final way during the Cuban missile crisis the following year, the price of possessing the power to destroy civilization was that one dared not use it. Again and again, each time the superpowers confronted one another face to face or through surrogates -- whether in Cuba, Berlin, Korea, Vietnam or Afghanistan -- they accepted humbling constraints and, on occasion, even the appearance of defeat rather than risk global destruction.
Nuclear weapons, Mr. Gaddis believes, had a paradoxical, almost contradictory, impact on Soviet-American relations. On the one hand, he says, they prolonged the cold war. Because the possession of huge nuclear stockpiles, rather than social and economic strength, became the measure of a nation's power, no one noticed that by the early 1960's decay of the Soviet Union was already "virtually complete." The possession of nuclear arms masked its feebleness and, as a result, the cold war lasted longer than it would have had these weapons never existed.
On the other hand, they helped bring the cold war to a peaceful end. Vindicating the famous policy that Mr. Kennan enunciated in 1947, the existence of nuclear weaponry "contained" Soviet expansionism until the country collapsed of its own weight at the end of 1991. The bomb unexpectedly bought time for the policy of containment to complete its work.
For all the authority with which Mr. Gaddis makes his judgments, the timing of his book, and even its title, raises questions. For he has taken unequivocal positions on issues that are still, and with good reason, being hotly debated. Mr. Gaddis says in his preface that he wishes he could say he had slogged dutifully through the "archives in Moscow, Warsaw, Prague, Berlin, Budapest, Beijing, Hanoi and Havana" but that he has had to rely instead on the patience and linguistic skills of the scholars who are publishing their translations and interpretations in the Bulletin of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. If, however, the author had seen the full range of evidence unearthed by some of these scholars, he would very likely have taken more nuanced positions. For instance, he declares here that "Stalin never wanted a separate East German state." Yet documents that have emerged in Moscow and Berlin during the past few years show, to the contrary, that for four years after the end of World War II Stalin was undecided, and kept open the option of a separate East Germany.
Indeed, the fate of postwar Germany, the outbreak of war in Korea and Stalin's relationship with Mao Zedong all shed light not so much on the extent of Stalin's domination as on the manner in which he exercised it. He kept his cards hidden, dropped a tantalizing hint now and then and allowed a situation to ripen until he was ready to clamp on the deadly vise of control. Most historians who have read the newly declassified documents agree with Mr. Gaddis that Stalin's allies were often abject, but they also point to instances where there was more give and take inside the Soviet bureaucracy or between Moscow and its allies than had previously been supposed.
It seems fair to ask whether this book has come out too soon. True, something can be said for an established scholar's making an early attempt at synthesis, at relating what is already known to newly discovered materials. Still, a book that deals mainly with the Stalin and Khrushchev years might have been delayed, since major collections not yet examined by Western historians may be on the point of becoming available and surprises of undeniable magnitude are almost certain to emerge. Alternatively, Mr. Gaddis might have called his book "What I Now Think."

In Pittsburgh, Fall of the Art of Sports

BYLINE: By BILL MODOONO; Bill Modoono was sportswriter for another vanished institution, The Pittsburgh Press.

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
It falls this afternoon at 3:30. Normally, these things take place just after dawn, but there's a service at a nearby church this morning, and, well, this is best done when the fewest people are around. Such is demolition.
The stated reason is safety. When the 24-story building at 500 Wood Street downtown is dynamited into oblivion this afternoon, the fewer people in the vicinity, the less likely anyone is to get hurt. Excluding the city's collective psyche, that is. 
 Granted, the building is being destroyed for an uplifting civic purpose. In its place will come a department store, from the aptly named Lazarus chain. Such commercial ventures -- especially ones like this that are heavily financed by the city itself -- are extremely rare for aging downtowns in the Rust Belt, and Pittsburgh would love to crow about the rebirth this store represents.
That argument will be difficult to make today because when the building falls, a 15-story mural known locally as the city's "sports heroes mural" will go with it. Maybe you've seen it on network sports telecasts from Pittsburgh; producers had an affinity for showing it during lulls in the action.
Not that you could blame them. The mural depicted five of the city's greatest sports stars: the Great One, Roberto Clemente; Le Magnifique, Mario Lemieux; two defensive stalwarts from the Steelers' Super Bowl era, Mean Joe Greene and Jack Lambert, and Bill Mazeroski, shown waving his cap and circling the bases after hitting one of the most famous home runs in World Series history, the one that beat the Yankees in 1960.
You could quibble with the choices -- No Bradshaw? No Stargell? -- but the overall presentation works. This is Pittsburgh sports in a nutshell: some talent, some grit, some downright orneriness and an occasional transcendent moment. That's about right.
When the artist, Judy Penzer of New York, unveiled the work in 1992, she said, "My intention is to capture both the heroic quality of these great athletes and the love and devotion the people of Pittsburgh have for their sports stars."
Unfortunately, the mural didn't last long enough to reach landmark status here. And its passing today pales in comparison with a larger, truer loss -- the death of Penzer, who was one of 230 people who died last summer on TWA Flight 800.
Was it great art? Does it matter? Pittsburgh may not know art (a native son, Andy Warhol, had to go to New York to find fortune), but it knows sports. And while the timing of the demolition is purely the result of economic factors unrelated to sports, you could pardon Pittsburghers for thinking otherwise. In terms of symbolic gestures, this is positively ominous.
The sports scene here has reached a nadir deeper than the hole the demolished building falls into today. At least its past was worthy of murals. Its present is less inspiring; its future, depressing.
You never know where you'll find a sports hero, of course, but suddenly Pittsburgh seems to be the least likely place to look. The city, which Rand McNally in 1985 called America's most livable, has in 1997 become sports' most leave-able. In recent years, Pittsburgh has lost more than its share of mural-worthy luminaries: Manager Jim Leyland and Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla from the Pirates; Steelers All-Pros such as Neil O'Donnell, Chad Brown and Kevin Greene, and Penguins favorites such as Kevin Stevens, Paul Coffey and Ulf Samuelsson.
Last month, two more joined the list. Lemieux, whose career was cut short by a series of ailments including back pain and Hodgkin's disease, retired after 13 seasons. He says he will stay in the city, but his only local action will be on the area's golf courses. And Rod Woodson, a perennial Steelers All-Pro who was named to the N.F.L.'s 75th anniversary team, could not reach a contract agreement with management and will apparently play somewhere else next season. Not even his ownership of a big restaurant here with his name on it, or his plan to live here after retirement, was enough to keep him with the local team.
Sure, change is part of sports, and the economics of free agency send players scurrying from all cities. But here, the goings far outnumber the comings and most likely will for some time. Pittsburgh may not be the Steel City it once was, but it's still proud of its shot-and-a-beer appetites. Modern-day sports, however, has a diminished interest in the shot-and-a-beer crowd.
It doesn't take much imagination to paint grim pictures here. The Penguins face the future minus the superstar who saved the sport in the city. They play their games in the National Hockey League's second-oldest arena. And putting a team on the ice without a reasonable chance of winning a title, and without the most popular player in its history, is a blueprint for box-office disaster.
The Pirates have long been a box-office disaster; the difference now is the team's strategy of unloading all its established players to build an affordable, competitive team from the bottom up. The Pirate management hopes to generate enough enthusiasm to get citizens behind a proposed baseball-only stadium. If not, ownership has an escape clause enabling it to move the franchise. And supporting losers -- even noble, fiscally sound ones -- has never been Pittsburgh's forte.
Even the Steelers, the main source of Western Pennsylvania's self-esteem in sports, have worried the populace in recent years. In each of the last three off seasons, they have lost two or more top players to free agency. Team officials claim to need either a new football-only stadium or an expensive makeover for 27-year-old Three Rivers Stadium to remain competitive in the N.F.L.
The Rooney family -- Art Sr., the late patriarch, was left off the mural, but he already had a statue -- still owns the franchise and would never leave, or at least everyone assumes the franchise would never leave. Similar assumptions were made in neighboring Cleveland. Come to think of it, the end of the fabled Browns-Steelers rivalry was another loss for the city.
Things don't get much better on the amateur level. The once-glorious University of Pittsburgh has not had a winning football season since 1991 and has not been to a bowl game in the 90's. This fall, the Panthers will have their fourth head coach in less than a decade.
Duquesne University has a storied basketball past and a present reality that includes no appearances in the N.C.A.A. tournament for 20 years. Pitt's immediate hoop prospects are brighter, or they were brighter until the promising 7-foot sophomore Mark Blount decided to leave early for the N.B.A.
Even the recent good news carries a negative tone -- Arnold Palmer's recent successful cancer surgery being the best example.
Still, let's not overstate today's event: it's just a mural going down. The city may seem devoid of heroes, but it's not as if it can't have more. You just wonder how heroes will ever find the place.

Broken China

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Last week President Clinton outlined his plans to renew China's most-favored-nation trading privileges. He made the announcement to a group of business leaders at the White House. Here's what the President should have said to them, but didn't.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've asked you here today to be the backdrop for my renewal of China's trade benefits, because I knew you'd be a friendly audience, since many of you do business with China. So let me begin first with a message to all of you: 
 Wake up, you morons! You are so greedy and shortsighted. You profit enormously from your business dealings with China. But you refuse to acknowledge that those dealings take place in an overall framework of U.S.-China relations, and that framework is now eroding. Yet you won't lift a finger to help shore it up. You ostriches make me sick!
Look around you. A year ago key Republicans and Democrats were forging a new bipartisan consensus on China, healing the rift created by Tiananmen. Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Warren Christopher, Sam Nunn, Bill Bradley and I were all giving the same speech about China -- all advocating a nuanced policy of engagement with Beijing that would build bridges where possible, draw red lines where necessary.
Today that consensus has fractured into so many pieces I've lost control of my China policy. My ability to get my way on the biggest issues involving China is now seriously in question.
What happened? Heck, what didn't happen? Our trade deficit with China ballooned to $40 billion, which drove many labor activists to conclude that China's not the Big Red Menace -- it's the Big Wage Menace. They fear that millions of Chinese working for 50 cents an hour are going to take millions of U.S. jobs. (They're actually taking jobs from other low-wage countries like Thailand, not us.) Then the Christian right decided to go on the warpath against China, because of its birth control policies and its crackdown on unregistered evangelical churches. Then you had Congress in a tizzy over China's alleged campaign payoffs and arms sales. The net result is a crumbling foundation for our relations with Beijing.
On top of it all, the old wise men who could validate a policy of engagement with China are ignored by this parochial Congress. Newt may listen to Henry Kissinger, but his troops don't. They don't even listen to Newt. They might listen to you, though. So here's what you're going to do:
(1) You're going to stop with your pious hogwash that everything in China will turn out fine if Congress will just leave you alone to make money there. Yes, commerce with China is a necessary condition for promoting reform there, but it's not sufficient. To be both effective and true to our values, we need to have an active policy of promoting more freedom there. So you're going to lobby your Congressmen and tell them that you understand their concerns about China's behavior, but that everyone just beating their breasts about China won't change anything. Things will only improve if business, human rights and labor activists work together, with China, to insure that as it grows economically, it becomes a more open, pluralistic and law-based society. And the best way to do that is by promoting rule of law in China.
(2) I want the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Commerce to set up a $50 million fund, matched by Congress, that will bring Chinese law students, judges, lawyers, even prosecutors, to the U.S. to complete their legal education and to gain exposure to our legal system, and to support legal education programs in China. The Chinese leaders don't oppose these programs because they know they can't grow their economy without a more rule-of-law-based system. They are just betting that they can institute rule of law in every area except politics. Fine, I'll take that bet.
I know this focus on rule of law won't change the mood in America toward China overnight. Some groups here need a big enemy like China, and Lord knows, China makes it easy for them. But for those who really are interested in making a difference there -- not just in moral preening -- this rule of law approach could be the basis for building a new consensus. It's good for human rights, it's good for business, and it's good for China. Without a new consensus, this relationship is going to go right over a cliff, and it's going to take your business and my foreign policy along with it.

HEADLINE: Samuel Proctor, 75, Dies; Led Abyssinian Baptist Church

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
The Rev. Dr. Samuel DeWitt Proctor, a preacher, educator and former pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, died on Thursday at Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He was 75 and lived in Somerset, N.J.
The cause was a heart attack he suffered on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. His wife, Bessie, said he was stricken while talking with students at Cornell College, in Mount Vernon, Iowa, where he had gone to lecture. 
 In 1972, he succeeded the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the former Congressman, as pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, perhaps the most influential black institution in New York, at 138th Street and Lenox Avenue. Dr. Proctor held that post until 1989, when he was succeeded by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d.
It has been said that Dr. Proctor, a veteran administrator, refocused the church, which had been the base for Mr. Powell's move into politics, on its mission. Dr. Proctor said that during the two decades of his own tenure as pastor, the church's annual operating budget rose to more than $1 million from $146,000. In those years, he maintained a relatively low profile on public issues.
When he retired as pastor, many members said they would miss his low-key approach to problems confronting blacks and what has been called his "quiet activism." Henry Knight, who had been a member of the church for four decades, said, "Dr. Proctor worked a quiet magic."
For his part, Dr. Proctor said at the time that new challenges called for new approaches. "The movement in the 60's," he said, "had so much drama and impetus because the targets were so clear. The pain is still clear but the target is amorphous. How, after all, do you march against sin? We have as much trauma in 1989 trying to define the issues as we did in the 60's trying to muster the courage to fight for those issues."
Born and raised in Norfolk, Va., Dr. Proctor studied at Virginia Union University in Richmond, the University of Pennsylvania, Crozer Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School and received a doctorate in theology in 1950 from Boston University. He was ordained in 1943 and went on to hold various posts in education, including the presidency of Virginia Union University, and administrative posts with the National Council of Churches, the Peace Corps in Nigeria and Washington, and the Office of Economic Opportunity and elsewhere before going to the Abyssinian Baptist Church.
He was a professor of education at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1984 and preached, spoke and taught at numerous sites in recent years. He served on the boards of Middlebury College and other educational institutions. The books he wrote include "How Shall They Hear? Effective Preaching for Vital Faith" (1992, Judson).
The first two grades of a college preparatory school named for Dr. Proctor are to open this fall in Ewing Township, N.J. Eventually the school, financed by tax dollars, is to comprise grades 7 through 12.
Besides his wife of 52 years, the former Bessie Louise Tate, he is survived by his sons, Herbert, of Roselle, N.J., Timothy D. of Durham, N.C., Samuel T. of Detroit and Steven of New Brunswick, N.J.; five grandchildren; a great-grandson; a sister, Harriet Tyler of Philadelphia, and a brother, Dr. Oliver W. Proctor.

HEADLINE: In Afghanistan, a Triumph of Fundamentalism

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

 BODY:
By capturing the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the militant Islamic movement known as the Taliban has virtually completed its goal of reuniting Afghanistan under a single government for the first time in nearly 20 years.
On Saturday, when tanks flying the white flag of the Taliban rolled into Mazar-i-Sharif, only a few isolated pockets of resistance remained in four provinces. It is now probable that the Taliban's strict version of Islamic rule will be imposed on all of Afghanistan's 18 million people. 
 The swift collapse of the Taliban's enemies -- the "Northern Alliance" of relatively moderate Muslim leaders -- represents the culmination of a remarkable rise to power.
In less than three years, the clerics who lead the Taliban have risen from village obscurity in the southwest to absolute power. No Government has had similar authority since 1978, when a Communist revolution sent the country spinning into chaos.
If resistance crumbles in the northeastern provinces of Kunduz, Takhar, Baghlan and Badakhshan, which account for barely 10 percent of the country, Afghans will finally have the peace that many have said for years was all that really mattered. But it will have come at a steep price, especially for Afghan women, who have been subjected to restrictions with few parallels.
Taliban leaders have said for months that they would review bans on women in the workplace and on schooling for girls when the "security situation" improves. But these assurances have been given mainly under Western pressure, and many moderate Afghans say the Taliban's view of women is even less likely to change now.
Even if the Taliban succeed in attracting Western aid -- a doubtful prospect as long as they remain the targets of fierce criticism by human rights groups -- many Afghans who might otherwise have returned home from abroad may resist repatriation. The United Nations estimates that at least three million Afghans live abroad as refugees.
But the Taliban may pose a wider challenge, especially to the Muslim nations of what was Soviet Central Asia. Along with Russia, these nations -- Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -- have been sharply critical of the Taliban, fearing that the movement will export fundamentalism across the Amu-Darya river, Afghanistan's northern border.
Moscow lost no time in issuing a warning after the Taliban victory at Mazar-i-Sharif. A Government statement over the weekend, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, the alliance of former Soviet republics, said that if the border is violated, "the mechanism of the C.I.S. collective security treaty will be immediately activated."
Taliban leaders in Kabul responded with a swift reassurance, saying they would adhere strictly to "a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries."
The United States has a less clearcut view. While deploring the Taliban's policies on women and the adoption of a penal code that provides for the amputation of thieves' hands and the stoning to death of adulterers, the United States has sometimes acted as though a Taliban government might serve its interests.
The Clinton Administration has taken the view that a Taliban victory would end a war that has killed 1.5 million Afghans; would act as a counterweight to Iran, whose Shiite Muslim leadership is fiercely opposed to the Sunni Muslims of the Taliban, and would offer the possibility of new trade routes that could weaken Russian and Iranian influence in the region.
For example, a proposal by the Unocal Corporation of California for a $2.5 billion pipeline that would link the gas fields of Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan has attracted strong support in Washington, though human rights groups are likely to object to the plan.
Unocal is currently involved with the Total group of France in a $1 billion pipeline project in Myanmar, which is a target of United States economic sanctions over that country's suppression of human rights.
The Afghan project, strongly endorsed by the Taliban, is part of a broader concept under which the vast mineral resources of the former Soviet republics would be moved to markets along routes that would offer these countries a new autonomy from Moscow.
But the first issue for Washington will be whether to give diplomatic recognition to the Taliban, which had been in power in Kabul for eight months without being recognized by any government. That isolation ended within hours of the Taliban capture of Mazar-i-Sharif when Pakistan, which has given financial and military backing to the militants, said it was recognizing the Kabul Government.
Over the longer term, historians may examine the role played by outside powers in bringing the Taliban to power.
From the outset, the Afghan war amounted to a contest between two visions for Afghanistan: the modernizing, anti-clerical view of the Communists, and the conservative view of Muslim clerics. Later it developed into a cold-war battleground between the Soviet Union, which sent 110,000 troops to occupy the country, and the United States, which provided Muslim insurgents with billions of dollars of weapons.
In the end, though, it was neither Moscow's nor Washington's clients who triumphed but the Taliban, a force that nobody in Afghanistan had heard of before 1994.
If many in Afghanistan seem to accept this, moderate Afghans say, it is less because they yearn for a life that is rigidly policed from the country's mosques than because two decades of war, by destroying virtually everything associated with modern society, opened the door to men whose prescriptions for the country seem to be drawn from the medieval past.

HEADLINE: Baghdad Journal;
Iraqis Laugh Again and Lather Up

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 25

 BODY:
Sometimes it is the small things that make a difference, and that may be the case in the new nexus between the Government of Iraq, the United Nations and soap.
Until this month, the soap provided to Iraqis as part of a paltry basket of Government rations was universally reviled: colorless, latherless and smelling faintly of the lard from which it was usually made. 
 But, finally, Iraqis have a reason to smile. More than five months after Iraqi oil began to flow again under United Nations supervision, the rations that people received this month were more bountiful than at any time since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Along with flour, rice and beans, the latest baskets included fresh-smelling bars of soap, one reason that some Iraqis are talking about feeling human again.
"Of course it makes a difference," said Haifa Abul Amir, 24, a mother of two who shares a cramped house in the ragged Baghdad suburb of Huriya with her husband and her parents. "That other stuff wasn't fit for any person."
Adopted as a "temporary measure" to ease the hardships caused by United Nations efforts to squeeze the Iraqi Government, the oil-for-food plan that has begun to sweeten life here will expire on June 9, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed.
The United States has said it is not entirely satisfied that all revenues from the $2 billion worth of oil that Iraq was authorized to sell are being used properly. Iraq has complained that the United States has been overzealous, holding up delivery of food and other goods that should have arrived months ago. A report from the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, that is expected to address these issues is expected within days.
But with tons of food, detergents and even medical supplies beginning to enter Iraq, Iraqis who have complained for years of being pawns to bigger rivalries say they have begun to regain a measure of dignity.
"Now when we bake bread we run out to show it off to the neighbors," said Najad Salman, 44, the mother of Ms. Abul Amir. "The flour they gave us before couldn't make a decent loaf, but now we all are better off."
For Iraqis who have suffered through the years of sanctions, weathering illness and malnutrition, the change has been a long time coming.
Although various oil-for-food plans have been proposed by the United Nations for years, the Iraqi Government long rejected them as an infringement of its sovereignty. Even after it shifted course and gave a tentative go-ahead in January 1996, the final details took nearly a year to be resolved.
Iraqi oil did begin to flow again last Dec. 9, an event accompanied by lavish ceremonies and celebratory gunshots in the streets, but it took nearly three months before the first shipment of food -- chick peas, white beans and cooking oil from Turkey -- arrived.
A special United Nations committee in New York has blocked or put on hold nearly half of the contracts for food and other goods that have been submitted under a cumbersome approval process for which the Iraqis blame American interference.
As late as April, so few supplies of food and other goods had arrived in Iraq that the monthly ration provided by the Government to its 22 million citizens remained essentially unchanged. Rations were increased by a few pounds of flour per person only after the Government agreed to draw 40,000 tons of wheat from its own strategic reserves.
But in the last two months a burgeoning flow by land and sea has brought a total of 550,000 tons of food and other goods into Iraq, where they are being distributed by Iraqi officials under United Nations supervision. In the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, which lie outside the control of the Baghdad Government, the distribution is handled by United Nations agencies.
Sugar and tea remain in short supply and the quantities distributed to Iraqis this month remained unchanged. But the supplies of all other goods have been considerably bolstered, increasing the average daily calorie allotment by about 90 percent, to about 2,300 per day.
The package still does not include meat or eggs, and it provides milk only for youngsters less than one year old. As many as one in four Iraqi children still suffer from some form of malnutrition, United Nations officials say, and most Iraqis still find it necessary to buy some goods on the open market, where a dozen eggs can consume about half a government worker's monthly salary.
"It's a drop in the bucket," Iraq's Information Minister, Hamid Yousef Hammadi, said of the help provided by the oil-for-food agreement, although he quickly added, "It's better than nothing."
The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, Steffan de Mistura, declined in an interview to say whether he thought the oil-for-food deal should be extended, but his comments left his sentiments clear.
"The needs of the population are clearly identified, and they are large," he said.
Under the accord, Iraqi is permitted to sell only about one-fifth of the oil that it did before the Persian Gulf war. Of the $2 billion that it was permitted to earn from the sale of oil in the six months that will end on June 9, nearly 30 percent has been set aside to settle the claims of those displaced by the war and to pay for the costs of United Nations operations here.
But still, from those limited oil sales alone, the plan sets aside $805 million for food, $65 million for soap and detergent, $210 million for medicine, and tens of millions more for projects to improve electricity, water, agriculture and education.
Some Western diplomats say they worry that the scheme may simply allow the Government of President Saddam Hussein to divert resources that it once had to spend on food toward darker purposes. They say these could include efforts to rebuild weapons systems that Iraq has been compelled to destroy under the United Nations resolutions that were imposed after the Persian Gulf war.
But people in Baghdad who have begun to taste life's simplest pleasures again would rather talk about how their lot is improving.
"It smells nice, it cleans better, and at least it has a pretty color," said one of several woman who volunteered their praise, unprompted, for the pinkish bars of Jordanian soap passed out at a monthly ration of one and a half per person. "We all still have big problems, but I'm beginning to feel a little better about the little ones."

HEADLINE: Houses of Worship Struggle to Rebuild After Flood

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: GRAND FORKS, N.D., May 25

 BODY:
At the First Presbyterian Church here, last month's flood ruined interior walls and left green and purple song books stuck to ceiling beams in the basement choir room. At St. Mary's Catholic Church and School across the street, the gymnasium, cafeteria and day-care center were destroyed. And at the B'nai Israel Synagogue several blocks away, the furnace and electrical system were wrecked and the four Torahs had to be rescued by the synagogue treasurer riding a Jet Ski.
As these and other places of worship struggle to recover, they face problems common to religious institutions struck by natural disasters. While many churches and the synagogue here seem certain to survive, some churches are likely to close. 
 Unlike families, religious institutions are generally not eligible for Federal grants. Unlike businesses, they cannot borrow against future profits. And with thousands of people giving up on this city and moving elsewhere, religious institutions must find ways to meet even their usual budgets with donations from shrinking congregations.
The mid-April flood of the Red River damaged two-thirds of the homes in this town, which had a population of 50,000, and inflicted particularly heavy damage on places of worship, which are concentrated in older, riverside neighborhoods. The main floor of St. Mary's escaped the flood and has reopened but members of the synagogue had to meet on Friday night at the Grand Forks Air Force Base and First Presbyterian members gathered at the University of North Dakota this morning.
There was a mixture of hope and sorrow during and after services this weekend, as people mourned lost homes and businesses and began to debate whether to repair or replace their churches.
"It has been overwhelming," said Carole Peterson, the spiritual director at First Presbyterian, just before the service began in an auditorium at the student union. "The church is our home and if we can't go home, where do we go?"
Government agencies generally cannot give money to damaged churches, partly because of the constitutional separation of church and state and partly because of a perception that repairing religious institutions is not a priority in disaster relief. Instead, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been providing free furnaces, electrical repairs and other safety-related assistance to families here. The agency's regulations allow assistance to religious organizations that primarily provide nondenominational community services, but this loophole is so narrow that it has seldom been used in recent years.
However, most churches have financial reserves earning interest, which are linked to taxpayer identification numbers. The numbers make them eligible for some of the loans that the Small Business Administration offers to businesses, at low interest rates. "As far as the Government's concerned, it's a business" if a church has a taxpayer identification number, said David L. Talley, a loan officer with the Federal agency.
Churches and other nonprofit institutions can borrow money for up to 30 years at interest rates as low as 4 percent to repair flood damage, he said. However, Congress has never chosen to make churches eligible for the "economic injury" loans that the Small Business Administration also offers to companies, which enable a borrower to make mortgage payments and pay other fixed costs until it can reopen.
Even the repayment of a low-rate loan can be a big financial burden for a religious institution. The United Lutheran Church, a block from St. Mary's, faces a $1 million bill to repair its 900-seat building, including a day-care center that served 200 children. Built in the early 1930's, the church is one of the nation's largest places of worship built in a pure Art Deco style, said the Rev. Timothy G. Johnson, the head pastor at United Lutheran. The church has zigzag, pyramid-style columns, doorways and stained-glass windows.
The church's annual budget is only $550,000. Even that may shrink because as many as 450 of the church's 3,000 members are moving out of town, abandoning damaged homes near the river, Mr. Johnson said. Melvin D. Carsen, the city tax assessor, has estimated that as many as 7,500 people may leave town.
Lutheran Disaster Relief, a national group, is paying the salaries of the church's pastors now, but cannot afford to rebuild the church.
As a result, the church's leaders have begun to talk about whether to merge with a nearby Lutheran church and end a longstanding rivalry. At the very least, United Lutheran would have to rebuild with less expensive materials.
"We will not look the same after this," said Mr. Johnson, who held services today at a funeral home because the church was unusable.
Places of worship here have taken different approaches to the arduous task of removing flood-damaged material from their basement social rooms, kitchens and other areas.
First Presbyterian, for example, which has yet to receive financial assistance from national Presbyterian groups, has been husbanding its meager financial reserves by relying on volunteer labor. Teen-agers wearing surgical masks but no hard hats or safety glasses used thick poles this weekend to tear down damaged fluorescent light fixtures and soggy interior walls, while periodically warning one another to stand clear of debris about to be dislodged from the ceiling. A steady procession of children and adults carried useless furnace parts and planks out of the building and threw them on a debris pile the size of a minivan.
"I tell the kids working for me, this is the only time in your life you can be this destructive and not get in trouble," said Mark Hoffmann, a civil engineer and church member. The church has no estimate yet for the cost of repairs. It may be more practical to build a smaller church farther from the river, the Rev. Gretchen Daneke Graf said.
United Lutheran has borrowed $100,000 from a local bank on generous terms, paying most of it to have a Minneapolis company remove debris from the church site. Volunteers from the congregation have been helping, but only under the supervision of the company, Quantum Fire and Water Restoration. "They have the building, and control access and liability," Mr. Johnson said.
Volunteers have cleared debris from the basement at St. Mary's Church. But the bare floors and walls there still must be cleaned and disinfected, required everywhere because the flood water was mixed with sewage and the rotting carcasses of drowned livestock. And the church still must figure out a way to replace the kitchen equipment and day-care toys, said Sharon A. Wilhelmi, the church's youth director.
Among many places of worship in old neighborhoods close to the river, the B'nai Israel Synagogue, which is so small that it relies on monthly visits by student rabbis from Cincinnati, seems to be recovering quickly. As soon as the water receded from the synagogue, 45 volunteers from Nechama, a Jewish disaster relief group, came here on an overnight bus trip from Minneapolis.
The volunteers removed the mud and ruined equipment from the basement kitchen, furnace room and social hall, while helping congregation members repair their homes. The volunteers also donated $10,000 to the synagogue, said its president, Robin Silverman. For $4,000, a Texas company installed fans and a dehumidifier and pumped chemicals into the walls to reduce the risk of mold.
Donations have poured in from 40 states, allowing the synagogue to offer $3,000 to every family in the congregation that needs it. A synagogue repair fund has already raised $70,000, roughly half the total needed. Mrs. Silverman said she was confident the rest of the money could be raised without a Government loan.
But at least 10 of the 50 or so Jews in Grand Forks are moving to other cities now. "It's going to be a while before we get any new families," Mrs. Silverman said. "We will be a very tiny group for a few years."
Many other places of worship are also likely to be smaller, while struggling with the financial burdens left by the flood. "This tragedy has changed Grand Forks," Mr. Johnson said. "It has changed the way churches will operate and it has changed the people in churches."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK TO SELL MENTAL FACILITIES

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Thirty years after New York State began dismantling its sprawling network of psychiatric hospitals, once the largest in the nation, the Pataki administration plans to sell off all but a tiny fraction of the unused buildings and grounds at 20 centers for the mentally ill and the retarded.
The parcels total almost 6,500 acres, or 10 square miles, including waterfront property on the North Shore of Long Island, 68 acres in the heart of Queens, 3 nine-hole golf courses and 1,000 century-old buildings. 
 The proposed sale -- covering 12 psychiatric centers and 8 developmental centers for the mentally retarded -- would be one of the largest transfers of public land to private hands in recent New York history. The proceeds would be used to help pay off more than $285 million in state bonds on the largely unused acres and their decaying buildings.
Any money left over would go to community programs for the retarded and mentally ill, according to the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency overseeing the bidding, which is to begin in August.
"We're going to look at each bid, each proposal and each facility on a case by case basis," Gov. George E. Pataki said in a recent interview. "We'll try to achieve the highest return for the taxpayers, reduce the bonded indebtedness and put the property back on the tax rolls."
But Mr. Pataki cautioned that the sale might not bring in enough money to pay off the bonds, which require that the properties be sold at full market value if the total debt cannot be paid. That would make it all but impossible, Mr. Pataki said, to accommodate local officials who want to retain some of the land for public use. Their opposition has stymied redevelopment plans in the past, particularly on Long Island.
Officials in Smithtown on Long Island, for example, want to preserve some property at the Kings Park Psychiatric Center for parkland, and those in the Village of Thiells in Rockland County want some of the land at the Letchworth Village complex for the local school district.
But state officials say that a strong real-estate market makes them optimistic about eventually disposing of the land and buildings, which they say cost about $40 million a year in debt service and maintenance.
The state has hired a company to do the marketing and to draft a brochure that dresses up the properties in the language of the local real estate agent, describing them as "generously landscaped" or "close to major highways."
"This is unprecedented, not only in the scale of the sites, but in their diversity," said Graham Roberts, senior vice president of Chesterton Binswanger International, the real estate firm hired by the state to market the properties. "They're all over the state. There's an incredible diversity of redevelopment potential. This is truly one of a kind."
The 20 tracts range from the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, whose 552 acres roll down to a marina on the North Shore of Long Island -- real-estate brokers say it might fetch $250,000 an acre in a booming market -- to the St. Lawrence Psychiatric Center, 436 remote acres on the Canadian border that may draw only a few hundred dollars an acre. Somewhere in between sit the 961-acre Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center in Dover, with a nine-hole golf course, and the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center on 68 acres in Queens Village, Queens.
At Kings Park, the state needs to get an average of $74,275 an acre to cover the $41 million bond on the property. But at the St. Lawrence center, the state would need an average of $49,541 an acre to cover the $21.6 million bond, in an area where land sells for as little as $500 an acre.
Some of the most attractive amenities, like the golf courses and the marina, were built as "work therapy" by patients 50 years ago, when institutionalizing the mentally ill and retarded was the rule and the hospitals' populations teemed.
At its peak in 1955, the network served 93,314 patients, including 19,000 people at Pilgrim State Hospital in western Suffolk County, once the largest psychiatric hospital in the world. But beginning in the 1960's, mental health experts began emphasizing community-based treatment and the use of new drugs that made hospitalization unnecessary for many patients.
State officials in New York and elsewhere closed beds by the thousands, but were slow to finance community programs and specialized housing.
Today, there are only 7,645 beds in the state's psychiatric centers, and the State Office of Mental Health expects to cut the number of beds to 4,900 by the year 2002. A similar trend occurred at the state's developmental centers for the mentally retarded, where the number of patients has fallen to 2,815 from a high of 27,544 in the 1970's.
Of the 20 centers involved in the sale, 3 of the 12 psychiatric centers and all 8 developmental centers are already closed, including the Central Islip and Kings Park hospitals on Long Island. Others, like the Pilgrim complex, will keep some land and a few buildings after most of the property is sold.
The state will continue to run 18 adult psychiatric centers, and to oversee some 2,500 residential and outpatient psychiatric programs for adults and children in the state.
Glenn Liebman, executive director of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New York State, welcomed the closing and sale of the state hospitals, but said that he and other advocates for the retarded and mentally ill would demand that the proceeds go to community mental health programs.
Under a 1993 law, the state is required to finance community mental health programs with the estimated $220 million saved by closing several hospitals over five years. Mr. Liebman said the Pataki administration had already reduced aid to the programs in recent years. The administration has also proposed reducing that money even further to help reduce the debt on the properties before they are sold.
"They're tearing down facilities, but they're not putting in any services on the community side," Mr. Liebman said. "You can't keep deinstitutionalizing people and not provide them with services in the community."
Word of the impending sale was greeted with elation in recent days in Dover and Ogdensburg, rural towns hurt badly by the closing or shrinking of the hospitals, and with trepidation among Long Island's densely populated communities, which have been split between supporters of potential new jobs and tax revenues and opponents of overdevelopment.
In the 1980's, residents of Brentwood angrily denounced the building of a prison at the Pilgrim complex and later persuaded Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to close it. In Dix Hills, the residents successfully fought state plans in 1993 to build a headquarters for Olympus America at the Long Island Developmental Center.
Whatever the outcome of the sale, there is a great public benefit to retiring the debt and putting the land on the tax rolls, state officials said.
But some urban planners and politicians questioned the wisdom of a wholesale sell-off of valuable state assets without an overall economic development plan that designates specific uses for parcels, like parks, schools, affordable housing or, say, a research complex near a university.
"Kings Park, which is on the water and has a co-generation plant and a marina, could be very valuable for some developer," said Assemblyman James F. Brennan of Brooklyn, chairman of the Assembly's committee on mental health. "But something 30 miles north of Utica may not be. Corporate downsizing has left some communities in pretty bad shape. It's questionable who wants to invest at all. So what is the purpose of this?"
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state's Empire State Development Corporation, countered that the properties had been sitting unused for too long. It is time to "get them back on the tax rolls," he said.
"There have been all kinds of studies," Mr. Gargano said, "but it's never produced a sale or a re-use." He declined to estimate how much money the sale would bring.
Mr. Roberts of Chesterton Binswanger said that residential and commercial builders, health care companies and hotel operators would be interested in the properties, not the 1,000 old and vacant buildings. But development of some of the land is restricted by environmental regulations, or in other cases encumbered by asbestos, underground pipes and old building foundations.
"Frankly, I think most of the buildings are going to get knocked down," he said.
Once a property is sold, it reverts to local zoning regulations, and any developer would have to have a fairly good idea of what kind of project would be acceptable to the local community before determining what to pay for the parcel.
State officials are hoping they have built a local consensus on the future use of the properties. Last year, local committees established by the state or town governments held public hearings on development proposals for Kings Park, the Long Island Development Center and the Pilgrim complex, perhaps the most valuable parcel of all because of its location at the intersection of the Long Island Expressway and the Sagtikos Parkway, a commercial and residential hub for Long Island.
The groups ultimately suggested 1,500 new homes, mostly for the elderly, at the Developmental Center; single-family homes and a shopping center at Kings Park and a sports complex, golf course and light industry for parts of the Pilgrim complex.
"The properties could be worth anywhere from $100,000 to $300,000 an acre," said David Pannetta, vice president of Oxford & Simpson, a real estate brokerage in Jericho. "The proper development of these lands will make Long Island a better place."
But civic groups still have an understandable "distrust as to what may happen," said Thomas Isles, planning commissioner for Islip and a member of the Pilgrim task force.
"I'm sure the potential bidders are going to have all kinds of schemes for what they want to do there," added Patrick R. Vecchio, town supervisor for Smithtown, which includes the Kings Park center. "We are not going to permit huge density there."
The heated atmosphere on Long Island is in sharp contrast with the sentiment in Ogdensburg, a town of 13,000 on the St. Lawrence River where the state psychiatric hospital was the largest employer. Opened in 1890, the St. Lawrence State Hospital swelled to a complex of 70 buildings, 2,264 patients and thousands of state jobs with good benefits. Now there are only 129 patients in a handful of buildings and fewer than 500 employees. Unlike the Nassau and Suffolk County residents, the leaders of Ogdensburg courted the building of a state prison on the property to offset the job losses. Richard Lockwood, mayor of Ogdensburg, is willing to consider almost anything.
"I used to say anything short of a radioactive waste dump would be considered," Mr. Lockwood said. "I was being a little facetious but we're anxious to see it developed."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: WHAT IS PLAYING IN THE GLOBAL VILLAGE -- BRITAIN;
A Blue-Collar Mirror

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Americans are bombared with statistics about what's hot and what's not in their culture. So deafening is the noise of American culture that it can be hard to hear what's happening in other cultures. But the differences in cultural tastes can be striking. Although the continuing globalization of mass media tends to favor the glitzy entertainment that Americans produce and enjoy, especially in movies, the Egyptians still prefer more serious television programming, while the people in Hong Kong read much more practical nonfiction books. And local music is preferred almost everywhere. What follows is a sampling of the images, sounds and ideas that are popular overseas and vignettes that try to explain them.
"Eastenders" is the quintessential British soap opera: gritty, realistic and firmly rooted in a working-class neighborhood that is a far cry from the fantastically upscale communities of most American soaps. 
 Set in London's East End, "Eastenders" follows the lives and fortunes of the residents of the fictional Albert Square, who work at low-level jobs in pubs and car-repair shops, grappling with social and financial problems like unemployment, alcoholism and mental illness.
In recent weeks, the show has focused on the marriage of Ricky Butcher and Bianca Jackson, which had been a long time coming. The bride had last-minute doubts, the couple fought and reconciled, and the groom got drunk at his bachelor party and woke up on his wedding day in a farmer's field.
The show, which has an average weekday audience of 20 million (more than a third of Britain's population of 56 million people) has been broadcast since 1985. Three new episodes are shown each week on BBC1, the country's original television station, which still draws the most viewers each day in spite of increasing competition from four other channels and a widening array of cable and satellite stations.
Twelve years is a long run for a British television drama; actors usually move on to other projects quickly. And no matter how popular a program is, there is little economic incentive to keep it on the air because BBC gets taxpayer subsidies; its shows are not advertiser-supported.
But this 30-minute early-evening program has its viewers hooked, and the BBC tries to give them what they want. "Public broadcasting has always dominated the country's output, and it brings with it a strong, rich vein of social realism which the audience is brought in to and responds to," said Jane Harris, the show's producer.

HEADLINE: Many Iranians Hope Mandate Brings Change

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, May 25

 BODY:
As it became clear on Saturday night that Iranians had defied their religious leaders by overwhelmingly electing a new President known for tolerance and moderation, Cyrus Mozaffarian, a jewelry and crafts vendor, had trouble keeping his mind on his work.
Like many Iranians, he was thinking about what the election of Mohammed Khatami will mean. 
 "This was a referendum about freedom," Mr. Mozaffarian said. "The voters were saying that we're tired of people snooping into our private lives. What we do at home is our own business. With Khatami in power, the Government is going to stop telling us what we can read, what we can watch and what we can do. We voted for change, and the Government will have to give it to us."
From behind the counter, Mr. Mozaffarian's young nephew smiled and shook his head in gentle disagreement.
"Khatami is not the boss and never will be," he said. "In this country the President does not decide. Maybe Khatami has certain ideas, but he won't have real power."
The discussion between Mr. Mozaffarian and his nephew mirrored a debate that is under way throughout Iran. Still stunned by what they did at the polls on Friday, many Iranians are realizing that even if this is not the dawn of a new era, it may prove to be the end of an old one. Never before in 18 years of Islamic rule have they so clearly rejected the will of the ruling Shiite Muslim clerics.
Near-final results announced today showed the astonishing dimensions of Mr. Khatami's upset victory. He won 69 percent of the vote, with his principal opponent, Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, taking just 25 percent.
The clerics, or mullahs, who run Iran, including the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made clear that they favored Mr. Nategh-Nouri. Not only did their support fail to propel him to victory, it was also one of the main factors leading people to vote for Mr. Khatami.
"People want to show that this is a grown-up country now and that we can make our own decisions," said a businessman who returned to Teheran in 1992 after spending several years in the United States. "Religion is not the only thing that determines how people vote."
Like many Iranians, the businessman hopes that Mr. Khatami's openness will lead him to consider reshaping the economic system here, which is heavily state-oriented and not always encouraging to private or foreign investors.
With a decisive majority of voters behind him, Mr. Khatami will be able to claim a strong popular mandate when he is inaugurated in August. But in Iran, popular mandates are not as important as they are elsewhere. According to the revolutionary Constitution, God holds ultimate power here, and His will is expressed through the faqih, or supreme leader. Ayatollah Khamenei met with Mr. Khatami today and gave him "appropriate guidelines," the official Iranian press agency reported.
Faced with an intimidating restriction on his power, Mr. Khatami, who is himself a Shiite cleric, will have to move slowly and carefully. He has already made clear that he will press for the legalization of political parties and restrictions on religious vigilantes who raid private homes in search of liquor, video cassettes and other evidence of what they see as Western decadence.
But because some of the ruling mullahs and their powerful allies in Parliament are suspicious of his fidelity to revolutionary principles, he cannot go much further, at least for the time being.
His aides have said, for example, that he will not seek to lift the requirement that Iranian women cover their heads, arms and legs with modest clothing. His liberalism means only that, in the words of one aide, "he won't object if a little bit of hair shows from under the scarf."
One early clue to Mr. Khatami's intentions will come when he announces his Cabinet this summer. Technocrats and liberals have already begun jockeying for posts, but he dares not ignore the religious establishment.
Women were a strong part of Mr. Khatami's electoral coalition, and the country's most prominent female politician, Faezeh Hashemi, a member of Parliament and daughter of the outgoing President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has already demanded a tangible show of gratitude.
She wants Mr. Khatami, for whom she actively campaigned, to appoint a woman to his Cabinet.
Such a move would be difficult for some conservatives to accept, but if a woman with a strong political base like Miss Hashemi is selected, they would find it difficult to object publicly.
As he moves slowly to create a more favorable climate for political and social reform, Mr. Khatami may soon begin to focus on the next parliamentary election, which is three years away. In last year's election, clerics disqualified many candidates whom they considered unacceptably liberal. One of Mr. Khatami's goals will probably be to win a measure of control over the process by which parliamentary candidates are selected.
Economic issues were important in the presidential campaign, with many voters saying they hoped that inflation could be controlled and others, especially young people, concerned that the economy was not expanding fast enough to give them jobs.
Although Iran has economic troubles, aggravated in part by a United States trade embargo, it is not in dire shape. Trade with European, Asian and even Latin American countries is flourishing. Most important, the country continues to produce the full oil quota allocated to it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, assuring the state-owned oil concern of a steady revenue flow.
In foreign affairs, Mr. Khatami may have even less power than he has over domestic policy.
Aides have said that he favors improving relations with nearby countries like Turkey, where the Iranian Ambassador was recently expelled on charges of fomenting fundamentalism, and that he does not approve of meddling in the affairs of other countries.
How sincere he is, and to what extent he can change Iranian behavior abroad, is highly uncertain.
In the past Mr. Khatami has said he favors open debate on all topics, including relations with the West. If he should take the radical step of advocating new overtures to the United States, he would probably have considerable public support, since the population seems remarkably free of anti-American feeling. But Ayatollah Khamenei remains strongly opposed to any such initiative.
The Ayatollah said last week that he opposed "the slightest tolerance of America and of Western countries' interference and cultural onslaught." He said Iran would "stand against America and those who want to impose their will on our nation."
Nonetheless, the election of Mr. Khatami adds a new factor to the political equation here and in the region.
"We welcome this turn of events," David Bar-Illan, an aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, said after the results became clear.

HEADLINE: SECOND SENTENCE -- A special report.;
As AIDS Increases Behind Bars, Costs Dim Promise of New Drugs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Along the grim hallways of prison, AIDS is so familiar inmates give it nicknames -- "the beast," "the monster," "the beetle." Like a second sentence for many convicted drug addicts, AIDS now infects the nation's prisoners at nearly six times the rate of the rest of the population. But efforts to fight the disease behind bars have been hampered by uneven medical care and a short supply of the promising new treatments that are the weapon of choice in the outside world.
Corrections budgets have been overwhelmed by the cost of the new treatments, which have sent the annual expense of treating an H.I.V.-infected patient from about $2,000 to as much as $13,000. As a result, the drugs are not being widely prescribed in some prisons even though doctors acknowledge that it is unethical not to. 
 Many prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, are only now developing guidelines for treating AIDS, or are following old protocols that do not take into account the new drugs, known as protease inhibitors. Now that treating AIDS and H.I.V. is becoming as complex as treating cancer, with drugs and dosages carefully calibrated to each patient's condition, many infected inmates are being treated by primary-care doctors and see a specialist only occasionally, if at all.
The AIDS virus has been caught between opposing forces behind bars. With hundreds of thousands ofdrug addicts locked up in the last decade, prisons have become a repository of infectious disease and present an opportunity for significant public health efforts. But prisons are under severe budget restrictions as their populations have soared and much of the public has come to view any services for prisoners beyond security measures as luxuries -- including medical care.
Health care experts view prisons as a prime place to attack the disease. In addition to helping individual inmates, they hope to change their high-risk behavior and lower the strength of their viruses, thereby reducing the chances that the disease will be transmitted in prison and when they are released.
"These people are part of the community who needs to be treated," said Frederick Altice, the director of the H.I.V. in Prisons program at Yale Medical School. "There has certainly not been a recognition of the magnitude of H.I.V. behind bars in most areas of the country."
No corrections system has felt the impact of the disease more than New York City's Rikers Island jails, where 26 percent of the women and 12 percent of the men are H.I.V.-positive, with about 3,000 inmates at any time requiring some AIDS services. After urging by health care professionals, the Giuliani administration recently approved a plan to start treating H.I.V.-infected inmates with the new drugs on July 1. (Now, only inmates who are on the drugs when they are jailed receive them.) The city expects to spend $5.4 million next year on the drugs, $1 million less than it now spends for all other inmates' medicines.
The New York State prison system, with the highest rate of infection of any system in the country, dramatizes the scale of the problem. In 1996, it housed an estimated 9,500 H.I.V.-positive inmates, or about 1 percent of all AIDS-infected Americans. The cost of AIDS treatment programs in the state prisons has jumped by 50 percent in the last four years, to $45.8 million.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 1994 figures, the latest available, showed 5.2 AIDS cases for each 1,000 inmates, as compared with 0.9 cases for each 1,000 adults outside prison. But the C.D.C. said the numbers "probably were underestimated" since they did not include all jails. In addition, there is no uniform nationwide system of testing.
The available numbers show the rate of infection falling in New York State prisons and growing slowly, if at all, in other state systems, mirroring the national trend. But the total number of infected inmates is growing because prison population growth is so explosive.
"It comes with the life style," said Orlando Pontoja, 29, who is H.I.V.-positive and recently was released from prison in New York State after serving his second term for drug possession. "It's the way most criminals live, with drugs and hanging out and unprotected sex. It all comes together."
That way of life continues to some extent in prison, and officials in some places have tried to guard against the spread of H.I.V. Anne S. DeGroot, an AIDS doctor at Brown University who has written about H.I.V. in prison, reported last year that two states, Mississippi and Vermont, gave condoms to prisoners, as do jails in four cities: New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington. She reported that at a jail in Houston, bleach was available to inmates with instructions on how to clean needles.
Prisons are particularly well-suited for the use of protease inhibitors in combination with other drugs, the "cocktail" that has been shown to reduce viral activity in some patients dramatically. The treatment relies on identifying the virus early and on following a strict regimen of medication to guard against breeding a strain of the disease that is impervious to treatment -- a system that is easier to carry out in prison because the patients are under regular observation.
But the H.I.V.-positive population in prison is largely anonymous and therefore untreated. Just 14 states have mandatory testing, and many inmates refuse voluntary testing because they fear their illness will become known. In New York State, the estimate of 9,500 infected inmates is based on what are known as "blinded" blood tests. As of last years, officials knew the identity of about 3,200 of those inmates, according to corrections department documents. In California, where officials estimate that 4,000 inmates are now H.I.V.-positive, the identities of about 1,200 are known, officials there said.
"You have a lot of people who know they're positive who are in denial," said Sheila Morris, a prisoner in Washington, D.C., who is H.I.V.-positive. "I am surprised by people who are sick and won't admit it. They're more willing to admit they're drug addicts or murderers or pedophiles than admit they're sick and get care for it."
Ronald Bogard, a former general counsel of the New York City Health Department who has become a national spokesman on AIDS in prisons, said there had been little effort to determine the extent of the problem. "Not only do we not know, we don't really care, because of the people that are involved and the money that is involved," Mr. Bogard said. "Now the stakes have gone way up because of protease inhibitors."
Prison officials say they have been increasing medical training and other programs to address the AIDS problem for several years, and they recognize that the new drugs can both help inmates and cut hospital costs.
John Miles, a special assistant for corrections and substance abuse at the C.D.C., said corrections officials across the nation were increasingly embracing the notion of early detection of H.I.V. and effective treatment, but that financing remained their main problem.
"This is not just a hidden population," he said. "This is an invisible population. The public doesn't like to spend the money."

State Policies
The Rules Vary From Site to Site
The quality of treatment varies from prison to prison and state to state, often depending on whether court actions have forced improved medical care. In California, many H.I.V.-positive male inmates are treated at a hospital whose operation is subject to a 1990 Federal court consent decree. But a pending lawsuit says female inmates are receiving inadequate care, because of a shortage of specialists, among other problems.
In that case, Maxine Liggins, an AIDS doctor who worked at a women's prison, said in a December 1996 deposition that her supervisor at the prison, who was also a doctor, told her that "the patients were going to die, and therefore she didn't understand why people kept involving themselves in their care."
Nadim Khoury, a doctor and deputy director of health care services for the California state prisons, declined to comment on the lawsuit. But he said that uniform H.I.V. care was assured by systemwide guidelines and training sessions for doctors. He said the department expected to spend about $2.4 million on protease inhibitors this year.
Faced with the steep cost of the new drugs, many prison systems are moving haltingly to begin using them.
In Louisiana, where about 450 of the state's 27,000 inmates are H.I.V.-positive, no inmates receive the new drugs unless they are using them when they enter the system. Michael Hegmann, the medical director at Louisiana's Elaine Hunt Correctional Center, said providing the new drugs was "an ethical thing" but he said the state could not afford to give them to inmates not already taking them. Corrections officials are seeking $2 million for next year to pay for the drugs.
Even more troublesome to some doctors who have cared for inmates is the question of whether prison medical personnel can handle the increasingly complicated treatment of AIDS.
"Prison doctors around the country are not trained AIDS specialists," said Dr. Altice, of Yale Medical School, who treats inmates in Connecticut's prison. "We used to say that AIDS treatment is primary care. This is no longer true. We would no more have the average primary care provider deliver chemotherapy to cancer patients, than we would have the same people provide complex H.I.V. treatment."
Victoria Sharp, the director of the AIDS Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan who has treated both inmates and convicts paroled from prison, said she often saw patients treated by prison doctors who were on "very odd combinations" of drugs. She said the drugs were "very inappropriate. The result is they've been getting sub-optimal care."

In New York
A Case of Care Under Challenge
Joseph Cavese's life was defined by needles and guns. The syringes gave him AIDS. The guns got him prison terms for robbery.
Imprisoned and debilitated, Mr. Cavese experienced the vagaries of AIDS care in prison. As new treatments have begun to move the illness from a fatal affliction to chronic disease, the level of care has taken on greater importance.
With the old drugs, "you're talking about improving quality of life for two or three years," said Christopher Fletcher, the medical director of the Corrections Corporation of America, the private prisons company. "It's a lot different if you're talking about improving quantity of life for decades."
At Attica Correctional Facility, Mr. Cavese was cared for by Dr. Robert Takos, who said in a January 1995 deposition that he had little training in treating H.I.V., according to court records in a lawsuit brought by infected inmates against New York State corrections officials.
Dr. Takos, who was trained as an anesthesiologist, pleaded guilty to heroin possession in Mississippi in 1984, and as a result his license to practice medicine in New York was revoked, according to New York State Department of Education records. Dr. Takos acknowledged the addiction, and his New York license was reinstated in 1991 after a panel of doctors found him "truly remorseful, successfully rehabilitated and more than adequately re-educated," the records show. He began working at Attica in 1994.
 Mr. Cavese, one of the prisoners suing the state, said Dr. Takos told him that his condition was stable. When Mr. Cavese consulted with an infectious-disease specialist in November through a television hookup, the doctor prescribed protease inhibitors, but it took until the end of December for the prison staff to deliver the drugs to Mr. Cavese, his lawyers said. Dr. Takos did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Mr. Cavese's health continued to fail, and in March he was moved to a prison infirmary near Utica to serve out a sentence for attempted burglary. A doctor there was less optimistic than Dr. Takos: He immediately told Mr. Cavese, 41, he was nearing death and asked him to sign a "Do Not Resuscitate" form, giving doctors the power to let him die if he slipped into a coma.
Mr. Cavese, who began shooting drugs at age 14 and was diagnosed with H.I.V. in 1985, said in a recent telephone interview that he received good care over the years at other state prisons, but at Attica, "medical treatment there was horrible."
Jack Beck, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who is representing prisoners in their lawsuit against the state prison system, said care in the system was very uneven.
"Some people are getting protease inhibitors and seeing infectious disease specialists," he said. "There are other people who get horrendous care. There is no consistency."
Inmates and their advocates say that care is considered good at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a women's prison, and at the Greenhaven Correctional Facility. Medical care at both has been the subject of court action.
There, specialists regularly see patients and review their records, doctors familiar with those prisons said.
Prison officials defended AIDS care in the system, saying that 1,600 inmates were now on protease inhibitors and that prison doctors have received AIDS training "for the past several years" from specialists who traveled around the state and through educational programs broadcast by satellite.
They said the best indicator of the quality of care was the decline in AIDS-related deaths among inmates from a high of 258 in 1995 to 181 last year.
Catherine M. Abate, the State Senator who is the former city corrections commissioner, said "there needs to be standard care" in the system. "People are living longer, but that means the care and treatment must respond to that," she said.
The advent of protease inhibitors has also increased the importance of identifying infected inmates. The State Department of Health recently began a $5 million program to bring counselors to each of the state's prisons to educate inmates about AIDS prevention and increase voluntary testing. This effort augments AIDS support groups run by inmates.
"The message is with new treatment available people should know their status so they can get early intervention," Gus Birkhead, the director of the state's AIDS Institute, said. "Prior to that time people could have asked, 'Why should I know that I have a fatal disease for which I have no treatment?' "

The Treatment
Administering Protease Inhibitors
 Introducing protease inhibitors to inmates is fraught with complications. Given the risk of interrupting treatment, prison officials have to insure that prisoners adhere to their strict treatment schedules while incarcerated and also after they are released. This is a particular problem in jails, such as on Rikers Island, where the average stay is 46 days.
"My concern is people will be discharged, they won't have a place to go and we will be breeding a resistant strain of the disease," said Audrey Compton, the acting executive director of correctional health services for the Health and Hospitals Corporation in New York City.
For months, city health officials have been working to establish a network of health care providers in the city so that inmates leaving jail can be linked with a place to go to continue their treatment. Dr. Compton said the model for the network was similar to the city's approach to treating tuberculosis cases in the jails.
Making sure inmates get uniform care is a problem not only when they are released, but also when they move from one prison to another.
Two months ago, when the Corrections Corporation of America took over operation of the Central Treatment Facility prison in Washington, company officials wanted to increase the use of protease inhibitors, but found that Washington's prison system did not have uniform AIDS treatment guidelines. Company officials were concerned that as they started inmates on the treatments, they would be interrupted when inmates were transferred to another prison in the system.
Dr. Fletcher, the company's medical director, said he began working with corrections officials on establishing standardized care throughout the Washington system. Concerns have also been raised, because inmates going to the medical dispensary three times a day to receive treatments could pose a security risk, or, if they were given a supply of medicine to take on their own, the pills could end up in the prison's underground economy.
So prison staff members are dispatched every few hours, said the prison's warden, Lonnie M. Moore, "to give them their medicine and watch them take it."

The Law
Influencing AIDS Treatment
Treating inmates for AIDS is not just a matter of medical ethics or efficient medical care. Lawsuits around the country arguing that the denial of adequate care constituted "cruel and unusual punishment" have improved AIDS treatment.
In Connecticut, where about 6 percent of the state's 15,000 inmates are H.I.V.-positive, care has been governed by a court-approved consent decree since 1989, officials there said. Infected inmates have regular access to infectious disease specialists, some of whom work for the prison system. There is a strict program for H.I.V. risk-reduction education, and prison officials are required to make monthly reports to the state court on their AIDS care program.
After a Federal lawsuit over AIDS care in Georgia, the state instituted a system of monitoring AIDS cases, put uniform-treatment guidelines in place and made protease inhibitors available to all H.I.V.-positive inmates.
"A sick person on the street can go to an emergency room," said Maddie LaMarre, the clinical services coordinator for the Georgia prison system. "But these people can't because they're under lock and key, so that puts a big responsibility on the person holding the key."

As sentencing laws have put more drug users behind bars, many states are now dealing with large numbers of prisoners who have AIDS or are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. New treatments are reducing the number dying from the disease, but they are also driving up costs for the states. Graph tracks the number of AIDS deaths among New York inmates and the number of AIDS deaths per 1,000 state inmates, from 1981 through 1996. Graph also tracks New York spending on inmate AIDS programs, from 1992 through 1996. (Sources: New York State Department of Corrections; U.S. Department of Justice)(pg. 28)

HEADLINE: In '97, Commencement Topics Come From Within

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Tim Russert, managing editor of the NBC News program "Meet the Press," who will give five college commencement addresses this year, says he likes to tell students at the small Jesuit schools where he prefers to speak that their education will allow them to compete successfully with even graduates of Ivy League schools.
"Then," he said, "I tell them, 'I have one piece of anecdotal evidence to support that -- me!' " 
 He then begins the story of his life, about growing up poor, becoming the first in his family to go to college -- at John Carroll College in University Heights, Ohio -- and how he still strives to achieve "a life of personal success and service to others."
In mining his own life for speech material, Mr. Russert is not alone. It is as though commencement speakers feel increasingly compelled to validate their observations with personal tales of poverty, physical suffering or triumph over adversity.
The confessional style may have been inspired by speeches in other settings, like when Vice President Al Gore recounted at the Democratic National Convention last August his sister's death from lung cancer.
"Talking about personal tragedies is definitely a trend -- look at all the books about that on the best-seller list," said Grada Fischer, president of the Fischer-Ross Group, a New York lecture agency that handles commencement speakers.
"Dealing with our emotions -- and with such things as wellness -- is a big part of our culture today," she said. "That's what people want to hear about, and speakers know that's the way to create an impact."
Speaking at Barnard College last week, Anna Quindlen, the author and former columnist for The New York Times, spoke at length about how, during her sophomore year at Barnard, she cared for her mother, who was dying of ovarian cancer.
As a result, Ms. Quindlen said, she learned that when a life is not as threatened as her mother's had been, "life is glorious, and you had no business taking it for granted."
And Carole Simpson, an ABC network television correspondent, publicly castigated herself when she told students at Howard University in Washington: "Don't wait, as I did until I was over 50, to realize that the most important things on earth to me are not ABC News, or my lovely home or my celebrity. It is my husband of 30 years, Jim, and my two children, Adam and Mallika."
L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who usually delivers the school's commencement address himself, leaves aside his own life story but does talk about the struggles of several members of the graduating class.
"I don't give their names when I tell about them," he said, "but the students quickly realize who I'm talking about, and you get bubbles of recognition first in one part of the audience and then bubbles somewhere else when I'm talking about another student."
Mr. Oliva explained that he adopted this approach after recently going to great trouble to find a commencement speaker who, it turned out, was willing to speak only about "matters like the European Common Market which had no relation to the lives of the students."
There are, of course, many who still devote their remarks to issues, policies and problems.
George Rupp, the president of Columbia University, said he was so moved by President Clinton's "summit on volunteerism" that he threw away his prepared text and spoke instead about "the need to revitalize our common life as a necessary part of individualism."
David M. Lee, a University of Connecticut alumnus who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1996, told students at his alma mater about the discovery of superfluid helium a quarter of a century ago, and, drawing upon that experience, urged his listeners "to take advantage of unexpected developments."
And, not surprisingly, President Clinton's speech at Morgan State University, a historically black school in Baltimore, sounded much like a state of the union address as he ticked off items on his agenda, from maintaining a strong economy to developing an AIDS vaccine.
A former President, Jimmy Carter, also delivered a standard commencement speech at Duke University on May 18, drawn there by the fact that his grandson Jason Carter was in the graduating class.
But not every public official felt so constrained. In her address at Boston College last Monday, Attorney General Janet Reno dealt briskly with threats to law and order like the rash of arsons at black churches and illegal immigration. And then she said, "When I was 8 years old, we lived in a little wooden house. . . ." You knew what was coming.
Ms. Reno told how, when her family outgrew their first house, her mother set about constructing a larger one. Because her father worked long hours at his job, it was her mother who dug the foundation, poured the concrete floor and installed the electrical wiring and plumbing. The house withstood Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The lesson, Ms. Reno said, is, "Build your life the right way, and don't be intimidated by the complexity."
One of the more powerful speeches this year -- it drew gasps and brought tears to the eyes of those in the audience -- was delivered at Ithaca College by Dot Richardson, the Olympic softball medalist, who is also an orthopedic surgeon.
Ms. Richardson began by telling how she overcame the prejudice against female athletes, and then described how her crowning moment at the Atlanta Olympics -- which she said was foreshadowed in a dream -- unfolded when she dived for a ball, did a somersault, sprang up and threw out the runner at first base.
She next told how -- before accepting an invitation to the White House -- she brought her gold medal to the children's hospital in Los Angeles with which she is affiliated.
"I wanted to make sure every one of those kids got to wear that medal," Ms. Richardson said.
After chatting with a young girl in the intensive care unit who had undergone brain surgery four days earlier, she said, she noticed that the girl's mother and sister and several nurses standing nearby were crying.
"What did I do wrong?" she said she asked a nurse.
"Dot, you don't understand," came the reply. "This girl has not spoken a single word since her surgery."
The message? "People, there will be moments in our lives when we will be given the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others."

HEADLINE: Playing Loose With History

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel, a visiting professor of international affairs at George Washington University, is the author of "Temptations of a Superpower."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Fifty years ago the Mar shall Plan united but also divided -- Europe. In editorials and commencement addresses we celebrate it today as an unparalleled act of enlightened generosity.
That it was. Through an infusion of American money much of Western Europe was restored to prosperity and democracy. 
 But it is wrong for Clinton Administration officials and their supporters to extol the Marshall Plan as a model for an expanded NATO, as they are now doing. We forget that the earlier creation, as the price of its success, helped sunder the strained links between the two parts of the continent, Eastern and Western Europe. Given a similar effort to unite more of Europe today, the United States may actually be sowing the seeds for another partition between Russia and the West -- only this time the division will be wholly unnecessary.
In 1947, when American officials put together the economic recovery program for a war-devastated Europe, they faced a terrible dilemma. What to do about Russia? To bring what was then called the Soviet Union into the Marshall Plan would greatly complicate the efforts to revive capitalist economies in Europe, provide markets for American exporters and construct a trans-Atlantic free trade system.
Furthermore, the United States Congress, warned a few months earlier by the Truman Administration of a Communist threat to Greece and Turkey, would almost certainly refuse to provide billions of dollars for a program from which Moscow would benefit. Yet to exclude the Soviet Union blatantly, to create two rigidly opposed economic and hence political systems in Europe, would be to reinforce the very "iron curtain" that officials had inveighed against.
George Kennan, the official in charge of formulating the Marshall Plan, argued that the Russians had to be invited to participate. If they were not, the United States would be blamed for seeking to divide Europe. He cleverly resolved the problem by leaving the door open to the Kremlin, but imposing such rigid economic conditions that Stalin would likely turn down the offer for fear of weakening Russia's hold over its satellites.
As Mr. Kennan later wrote, Russia and the East European states would "either exclude themselves by unwillingness to accept the proposed conditions, or agree to abandon the exclusive orientation of their economies." Charles Bohlen, then serving as assistant to Secretary of State George Marshall, later confirmed that the plan was framed in such a way as to "make it quite impossible for the Soviet Union to accept."
Ultimately, that is what happened. The Russians stalked out of the planning talks and took the Eastern European states with them. Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's Foreign Minister, declared that the Marshall Plan would "divide Europe into two groups of states . . . creating new difficulties in relations with them."
Within months Stalin clamped down on Hungary, imposed a Communist regime on Czechoslovakia, and tried, through a blockade of West Berlin, to pressure the Western allies to give up their plans to create a West German state from their zones of occupation. Soon thereafter came the two rival military alliances, first NATO, then the Warsaw Pact.
The cold war was on in earnest. Europe was divided in two and would remain that way for 40 years. It was the Soviet Union that put up the barricades and that bears the greatest responsibility. But their actions, though brutal, were not irrational.
As George Kennan himself later wrote, the coup in Czechoslovakia and the pressures on Berlin "were defensive reactions on the Soviet side to the initial success of the Marshall Plan" and the decision to set up an independent state in Western Germany.
Is there a lesson in this story for today? Soviet Russia, consumed by dogma and ruled by a paranoid dictator, bears little in common with the democratizing, free-market Russia of today. Except for one thing: Both are Russian. Both share a history of authoritarianism, of heroic repulsions of invasions from abroad, of attraction to and fear of the West, and of a determination to be a power in the world commensurate with its cultural greatness.
Russia also, indeed eternally, is both a part, and not a part, of Europe. American policy makers, in an effort to expand economic institutions and cold-war alliances, declare that the United States is a "European power." But this is more true of Russia, and efforts to deny this fact will inevitably have unhappy consequences, both for the Russians and for the Europeans.
 That is why the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan should be not only a cause for self-congratulation, but also as a cautionary tale. The plan succeeded in its ambitions, and the price was high. Officials at the time knew what the price was and were willing to pay it. Soviet Russia was our foe, and we were locked in a struggle for the control of Europe.
Today Russia is our friend, or so we say. For the moment it is very weak politically and economically. It poses no serious threat to anyone -- not even to separatist groups on its own territory, as the failed effort to subdue the Chechen rebels revealed.
Yet it is at this moment that United States officials have pushed to expand NATO, the cold-war military alliance intended to hold back an invading Red Army. They describe this expansion as uniting Europe. And they imply that this is only the first step of an expansion that will ultimately include states that just a few years ago were part of the Soviet Union.
The push to expand NATO has been driven not by any hostile behavior by Russia. Rather, it stems from the Administration's desire to take the initiative on foreign policy rather than merely react to crises; to please certain domestic ethnic groups, and to maintain a dominant American role in Europe's military future. But the result may stimulate hostile Russian responses. This would be particularly likely if the accommodationist Yeltsin Government is succeeded by a more nationalistic and self-confident one.
Although the Russians have recently been granted a seat in the balcony through the proposed NATO-Russia council, this is far less than equal treatment. What is needed today is not an expanded alliance to contain Russia, but a sincere effort to incorporate it as a full and equal member into a wider European security network. There was some effort to do so under the now-abandoned Partnership for Peace. This should either be revived, or the plan for NATO expansion taken to its logical conclusion with the incorporation of Russia. To rule this out is to reinforce the belief in Moscow that NATO is being expanded as an anti-Russian alliance.
Instead of intoning the Marshall Plan as a slogan, the Administration should draw a lesson from it. Living in a time of danger, the architects of the Marshall Plan were prepared to pay its costs because they believed that they had no other choice.
Today's NATO expanders in Washington are driven not by fear, but by a combination of ambition and opportunism. They want to build an enduring structure, in emulation of their illustrious forebears, and to leave a legacy that will outshine that of their intellectual predecessors. But the legacy they leave could be far different from the one they imagine. Their predecessors opened up a door that Stalinist Russia refused to enter. Today's leaders are locking a door that democratic Russia is knocking on, hoping for admission.

HEADLINE: Price Tags Help Save Louisiana's Coast

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Valuing natural services, as described in "How Much Is Nature Worth?" (Science Times, May 20), is especially timely in Louisiana, where we are battling the ongoing loss of our coastal ecosystem.
Dr. Robert Costanza and Dr. Stephen Farber, two authors of the new study on the worth of global ecosystem services, have helped Louisiana begin to quantify the tremendous value that our state's coastal wetlands have for the entire nation. 
 Water purification values of at least $100 billion, hurricane and storm protection values in the billions, and the most productive fishery in the lower 48 states are economic benefits that flow directly from our coastal marshes.
These endangered natural values supplement over $100 billion in human infrastructure for commerce, mineral extraction and navigation, which are also being put at greater risk by the decline of the marshes.
The dollar amounts are only one benefit we receive from natural services, but they help us make the case for reversing the decline of estuaries, wetlands and other irreplaceable ecosystems in the name of the public good.

HEADLINE: Wary Hong Kong Collectors Send Art Abroad for Safety

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Hong Kong's impending change from British to Chinese Communist rule has led to an exodus of Chinese art, with residents sending their collections overseas out of fear that China may prevent the export of items deemed to be cultural patrimony.
Some dealers estimate the value of this precious cargo at more than $1 billion, making it a migration of artworks that rivals the Japanese purchases of Western paintings in the 1980's. 
 China assumes control of Hong Kong on July 1. In contrast to Hong Kong, which has virtually no rules impeding the export of art and antiques, China has regulations governing any work of art over 50 years old. Since questions about future art export policies were first raised, China has given only general assurances that Hong Kong's commercial laws will not change in the next 50 years unless the territory itself changes them. Even when pressed, officials will say nothing specific about art.
Many collectors, accustomed to buying and selling works on the free market, have therefore been seeking safe harbor for their Chinese ceramic, porcelain, bronze, jade, wood and painted works. "I've been meeting with a lot of insurance agents to appraise items that are to be shipped abroad," said Glenn Vessa of Honeychurch Antiques in Hong Kong.
Such treasures are headed to the United States, Canada, Britain, Singapore and elsewhere. Some have been placed in museums in Denver, Washington, Phoenix and other cities, occasionally as gifts but usually on long-term loan. Others are disappearing into warehouses or into the second homes that some Hong Kong residents bought overseas as possible refuges. A few have been put up for sale.
China's takeover of Hong Kong is causing other ripples in the art world, too. For a start, it has helped fuel the recent boom in Chinese art.
"The political events are certainly drawing an enormous amount of attention to China and to Chinese art and culture," said James B. Godfrey, director of Chinese art and Asian business development at Sotheby's, the international auction house. "And that," he said, "has helped generate excitement and tension in the Asian art market," attracting new buyers and pushing up prices.
Prices would climb higher still if China does limit exports from Hong Kong and Chinese artworks thus become more scarce abroad. And Hong Kong's vibrant art trade would suffer as business shifted to dealers and auction rooms in Taiwan and especially in New York City, which is already capturing an increasing share of the Chinese art market.
Smuggling of art from the Chinese mainland, a chronic occurrence that is unlikely to cease, is also expected to change. Despite the strict rules, China thrives as the source for artworks new to the market. The border authorities often look the other way as smugglers move them overland to Hong Kong and then to markets around the world. Perhaps paradoxically, smuggling through Hong Kong will be more difficult once it is part of China.
"There's a big temptation for people to move from China to Hong Kong, so the border will be reinforced" for traffic of both people and restricted goods, said Alice Lam, co-chairman of Sotheby's Asia, based in Hong Kong. Smugglers would be forced to find new channels via plane or boat.
As a result, "the market for very old Chinese art, for archeological works of art, will be very, very gravely affected," said Michael Guidhaus, a longtime dealer in Chinese art in London. "It will be possible for the Chinese to smuggle out to other places like Taiwan or Macao. But it's much more difficult and it's further away, and it will be more expensive for that reason. That will put enormous upward pressure on the works that are already out."

At First a Trickle, Now a Scramble
Art began trickling out of Hong Kong -- legally, if surreptitiously -- soon after Britain agreed to withdraw, in 1984. Some wealthy Hong Kong residents established dual citizenship, buying second homes abroad and furnishing them with their art and antiques. But many more, wanting to enjoy their possessions, procrastinated, thus setting up the last-minute scramble.
"Naturally, many put it off," said James J. Lally, who owns an Asian art gallery on East 57th Street in Manhattan. "There's been more activity in the last year."
No one knows how much more, though. Collectors are silent on their activity, afraid of attracting attention or disapproval of Chinese officials, whose vague statements that nothing will change have not assuaged their anxiety.
"The Chinese authorities say this is an overreaction, that the restrictions apply only to China and not to Hong Kong," said Philip Ng, managing director of Christie's Asia, based in Singapore. "But if you had millions of dollars in antiques, you'd rather play it safe, wouldn't you?"
To some Hong Kong Chinese, there is no debate. Art collecting is a family tradition, and many remember the Communists' rise to power nearly 50 years ago. "A lot of these families were in Shanghai in 1949 when the Chinese Communists said, nothing will happen, everything will be fine," Mr. Lally said. "And then the Communist regime confiscated their art. The Shanghai museum's best pieces are all from those private collections."
Times have changed on the mainland. Some economic freedoms have been granted. But civil and political rights have not followed. "The question is," said Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research, "will holders of great and important art be allowed to treat it as personal property or not?"
Anyone in China, resident or visitor, can buy antiques and artworks there. Taking them out is another matter. China has a patchwork of laws governing the export of art and antiques: the stringency of the restrictions depends on how old an artwork is, whether it is a ceramic or a painting or in another medium, the kind of wood that furniture is made of and whether something is deemed "best of type."
In general, experts said, anything 150 years or older will run up against a restriction, and some items made as recently as 50 years ago may, too. "They search at the border," Ms. Lam said. "Pieces that are allowed to leave China have a red seal."
But the laws are not always enforced, said Khalil Rizk, the owner of the Chinese Porcelain Company on Park Avenue. Gaining export approval is sometimes unpredictable. Mr. Godfrey of Sotheby's said, "Regulations don't seem to be enforced in any consistent manner."
And various smugglers have forged ties to officials who will allow some important pieces out, said dealers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Lately, some dealers said, China has cracked down on some illicit art trade. "Mainland China is getting very tough," Mr. Guidhaus said. "They are executing smugglers." Other dealers said they believed that the border was as leaky as ever.
Officials in the Cultural Relics Bureau in Beijing "do not have nearly as much clout as the people who are profiting from this illegal trade," said Mr. Vessa of Honeychurch Antiques.
When it comes to Hong Kong, Chinese authorities may also be torn. They would like to leave Hong Kong's thriving art business alone, but they also fear losing more of their patrimony and may want to control corruption.
"It's possible they'll disregard what they've said" about allowing Hong Kong to set its own rules, Mr. Ng said. "Hong Kong is part of China, and the Chinese can do what they want."

Safekeeping of Art Preferred to Selling
So, for now, can Hong Kong residents. Only a few seem to have reacted to the potential threat of restrictions by selling their art. "It's not turning up on the market in quantities," Mr. Rizk said. "There are no shops with millions of Tang horses, because these people are not in need."
One who did sell is T. T. Tsui, a philanthropist. In November in Hong Kong and in March in New York, Mr. Tsui put his collection of pottery, bronzes and furniture on the block at Christie's. He raised nearly $16.3 million.
Many more people, Mr. Rizk said, "are sending things out for safekeeping." Second homes in such places as Vancouver, British Columbia, are the repository of choice. Families who lack safe-harbor homes are sending their art into secure, climate-controlled warehouses in Toronto, New York, London and Geneva.
"We are getting some of it," confirmed Thomas A. Pelham, a vice president of Fortress at Judson Art Warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, where 1,000 square feet of storage space rents for $2,600 a month. "It started back in 1991 and 1992, when all of a sudden we were doing more business from Asia."
It has since accelerated. Mr. Pelham will not say how much art he holds for Hong Kong residents. But he estimated that while in 1987 less than 10 percent of his Asian business involved private clients in Hong Kong, that number had climbed to 90 percent by the end of 1996. "It's still coming this year," he added.
Several museums have also become the lucky recipients of Hong Kong collections, usually on three- to five-year loans with provisions for renewal. The Denver Art Museum has three such collections: 30 pieces of Ming furniture owned by Dr. S. Y. Yip; 175 jade carvings and ornaments ranging from the 14th to the 19th centuries owned by Dr. and Mrs. Henry Wong, and more than 1,000 pieces, mostly Neolithic pots, owned by Warren and Shirley King.
Dr. Yip sent 20 more items from his furniture collection to the Phoenix Art Museum and 15 pieces of small furniture to the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, which is putting them on show beginning on June 22.
The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the new Asian Civilization Museum in Singapore are also exhibiting art sent for safekeeping from Hong Kong, various art experts said.
The owners are said to be cagey about relating the loans to the transfer of power. "If you call them, they'll say they lent it because they feel generous," said Mr. Ng, who has had extensive conversations with many Hong Kong collectors. Privately, he added, they are likely to be more truthful.
If museums are the short-term beneficiaries of the uncertainty in Hong Kong, the territory's dealers may be the long-term losers. "The Hong Kong market is in confusion," said Mr. Lally, the Menhattan gallery owner .
Many dealers say there is gloom among along Hong Kong's famed Hollywood Road, the city's antiques row. "If the Chinese impose export restrictions, that will virtually eliminate the art trade in Hong Kong," Mr. Godfrey of Sotheby's said.
Many Hong Kong dealers have been very cautious about buying works for inventory. "They don't want to hold stock there," Mr. Lally said. Mr. Vessa said that some had closed down and moved abroad. "If you walk along Hollywood Road, you'll see a lot of shops that are newly vacant," he said. Some have shipped their inventory abroad, often to Taiwan, and stand ready to relocate if the Hong Kong government does change the rules.
Mr. Ng of Christie's predicted that the Hong Kong dealers who make a living selling smuggled goods would go underground.

Increasing Interest Shown by Collectors
Interest in collecting Asian art is meanwhile growing. Dealers and auctioneers alike say the times are comparable to the art boom's peak in the late 1980's. Prices are equally high or better, and there are even more buyers, in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia -- , including Hong Kong residents and the new rich in mainland China. "If anything, because of the uncertainties they are continuing to be strong and active buyers," Mr. Godfrey said. "There's a concern that things won't be available on the market."
This spring, both Sotheby's and Christie's had record or near-record sales in New York, with strong interest in all categories from snuffboxes to pottery to furniture. Auctions have been brisk in Hong Kong, too. Christie's described one recent sale there as a "frenzy of activity not seen since the market's height more than seven years ago."
But dealers and collectors say New York has now become the place to buy the best Chinese art. Hong Kong remains strong in Ming and Qing Imperial porcelains. But for furniture, ceramics, bronzes, archeological material and most other categories -- the fastest-growing markets -- New York has the edge, many dealers said. London, once the center of the Chinese art market, has faded.
With more and more Asians willing to travel to sales or use the telephone to buy, the auctioneers and dealers expect New York's share of the market to grow. And any restrictive moves in Hong Kong would hasten that trend.
Some Hong Kong residents are putting on a brave face. "No one is saying they will bring these restrictions into Hong Kong," Ms. Lam said. They can only wait and see what happens after the Chinese flag is raised at midnight on July 1.

HEADLINE: Job Market Picking Up For Summer

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Job seekers will find improved opportunities this summer as employers look to add workers in an increasingly tight labor market, according to a new survey.
The study, by Manpower Inc., the nation's largest temporary staffing company, says 30 percent of 16,000 companies surveyed plan to expand their work forces in the July-August period. 
 Only 5 percent said they expected to cut employment, while 65 percent either plan no changes or do not know, the survey said.
At this time last year, 27 percent said they planned increases and 7 percent planned reductions. Manpower said the responses in its latest survey were the most optimistic since 1988.
"The need for workers is so widespread that there seems to be carry-over demand caused by the inability of companies to find the people they needed in earlier quarters," said Manpower's chief executive, Mitchell S. Fromstein.
The nation's unemployment rate hit a 23-year low of 4.9 percent in April.
Manpower said the strongest region for hiring this summer will be the Midwest, where 33 percent of employers plan to expand their staffs. That compared with 31 percent in the West, 28 percent in the South and 27 percent in the Northeast.
By industry, construction companies were the most eager to add workers, with 40 percent planning additions heading into the typically busy summer season.
The weakest industry by far was mining, with only 12 percent predicting new hiring.
Manpower's survey was based on telephone interviews with management personnel in 487 American cities. The company said the figures have a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.

HEADLINE: $25 Million Plea For Palestinians

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 26

 BODY:
The main United Nations agency aiding 3.3 million Palestinians is "technically bankrupt" at a time when social and economic stability are vital to Middle East peace prospects, its director said today.
Peter Hansen, head of the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, called urgently for $25 million to meet the agency's $312 million budget this year. 
 Mr. Hansen said the income of the 1.3 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip had fallen by 40 percent since the peace effort began four years ago, mainly because of Israeli border closures, which prevent Palestinians from working in Israel.
"That means that since the peace process started, the Palestinians have been losing 10 percent in their living standard every year," he said. "People are poorer than they were before. They are in need of more services." He spoke after a fund-raising tour in the Persian Gulf states and Southeast Asia.
Major donors, including the largest, the United States, whose share is $70 million, have paid. But the agency is seeking new donors to keep pace with a refugee population that expands by 5 percent a year, Mr. Hansen said.
The agency provides education, health care and social services to 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. About one-third live in 59 camps.

HEADLINE: European Left Takes Heart From France

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, May 26

 BODY:
Gains by the French left in first-round parliamentary elections heartened Socialists in other parts of Europe today, offering a portent of the way Europeans will define their future in the face of a global economy dominated by the American market ethic.
From Bonn to Rome and Vienna, leftist parties portrayed the advances by Lionel Jospin's Socialist Party as a sign that European voters, as they confront the rigors of planned monetary union in 1999, would side with an economic vision of softer options based on the elusive twinning of jobs and social welfare. 
 The French result "shows that economic and financial policies, which raise unemployment through restrictive budgets and social spending cuts, are condemned to failure," said Oskar Lafontaine, the head of Germany's Social Democrats, who are to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in national elections late next year.
The outcome of the French vote is critical for Germany, Europe's troubled economic powerhouse, which sees the impetus for monetary union as driven by an axis between Paris and Bonn. The union is the centerpiece of Mr. Kohl's European vision.
The Germans do not expect French Socialists to renege on the commitment to monetary union made by the former President, Francois Mitterrand. But the party has set conditions for supporting the concept. German officials are concerned that a Socialist Government in Paris might strain the alliance by pressing demands unpalatable to German voters, who are troubled by the thought of losing their cherished mark to a softer European currency.
Chancellor Kohl displayed a characteristic caution about the first-round French results, saying that "one must let the results of the first round of the French elections take effect and wait for the second round."
Preparations for the new currency, the euro, have already led to budget cuts as governments try to get their books in order so that they qualify for inclusion.
That has raised a prospect of unfamiliar hardship in countries, particularly France and Germany, where unemployment is nearly at record levels and unions are gearing to confront Government plans to cut social provisions that are seen as a birthright, including generous sick pay and pensions.
The French vote is going to be taken as a signal of whether Europe's future lies in steeling for the global dictates of a market-driven order, or in trying to salvage the costly benefits that have taken root in Europe since the World War II. In other words: does Europe follow the prescriptions of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980's, or those of the debilitated continental left in the post-Iron- Curtain 1990's?
"The French result is even more significant than the already important victory of Tony Blair in England," said Armando Cossutta, head of Italy's hard-left Communist Refoundation Party.
"The left in France is campaigning on a much more advanced program, centered on a reduction in working hours and defense of the welfare state."
Against that, Jose Maria Robles Fraga of the governing Popular Party in Spain said that "anyone who wants the future of Europe entrusted to a coalition of Socialists and Communists has not understood anything that has happened since the fall of the Berlin wall."
Beyond the immediate responses, there was a more direct message for Germany.
A French Socialist victory following Mr. Blair's landslide in Britain would place an awkward question mark over the future of Europe's conservatives at the moment that Chancellor Kohl's center-right Christian Democrats are contemplating their electoral prospects next year.
The sense that countries as important as France and Britain were seething with a desire for change would sit uneasily on Mr. Kohl's 14-year-old administration, which many Germans see as paralyzed in its efforts to reform financial and economic policy to meet changing European and world conditions.
The unease would not be limited to the Christian Democrats. Germany's opposition Social Democrats are riven by disputes over what change should mean, and who should be its champion in the national elections: Mr. Lafontaine or his more popular rival, Gerhard Schroder.

HEADLINE: Immigrants and the Economy

 BODY:
The presence of immigrants in the work force is raising the living standards of most Americans by a small amount. That reassuring conclusion comes from a panel of scholars convened by the National Research Council. But job competition from immigrants depresses the wages of some low-paid native workers by a small amount, and immigrants impose sizable, though remediable, burdens on taxpayers in heavily hit states. These findings should calm most anxieties over immigration while pointing Congress to some sensible reforms.
The panel estimates that the yearly influx of about one million immigrants adds up to $10 billion of total economic output, more than the immigrants collect in wages. But $10 billion is a tiny part of a $7 trillion economy, and the estimate is best interpreted as evidence that immigrants do not harm native workers. The panel also estimated that immigrant workers pay more in Federal taxes than they collect in government services. 
 But immigrants, especially those who are poor and have children, do put a substantial burden on some states, like California, and some cities, like New York, because of their numbers. The panel estimates that an immigrant family in California collects about $3,000 more in public services, including school, than it pays in taxes. Native households in California therefore pay about $1,000 a year in taxes, on average, to provide services to immigrants. An obvious solution would be for Washington to compensate heavily burdened states.
The most troubling, though unsurprising, finding of the report was the burden on low-paid native workers. As the immigrant pool has switched to the relatively poor countries of Latin America from the relatively rich countries of Europe, the supply of low-wage workers has risen. The panel estimates that competition has driven down the wages of native high school dropouts by about 5 percent since 1980, less than many scholars had thought. Most black Americans, the panel finds, have escaped much harm because they do not generally live in pockets of heavy immigration.
As birth rates continue their steady decline, immigrants are expected to account for most of the nation's population rise over the next five decades. Indeed, young immigrant workers will help provide the tax revenues with which state and Federal governments will support the burgeoning ranks of retirees. But Congress need not stand aloof as steady immigration strains local government and harms low-paid native workers. Congress could give preference to immigrants who are highly educated or otherwise highly skilled because they would demand fewer social services and pay high taxes, thereby relieving the strain on local governments, yet not threaten unskilled workers.
The panel did not make policy recommendations. But its careful analysis suggests how Congress could tailor the composition of immigrants to minimize the strain on taxpayers and the burdens on poor native workers.

HEADLINE: France's Mercurial Politics

 BODY:
There is no mistaking the rebuff French voters gave the conservative Government of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe Sunday in the first round of parliamentary elections. The opposition leftist coalition won 43 percent of the vote to the Government parties' 37 percent, with 15 percent going to the far-right, anti-immigrant National Front. Mr. Chirac's own job was not at stake. But the enormous conservative parliamentary majority elected four years ago has melted away. It is now a toss-up whether a conservative successor to Mr. Juppe, who resigned yesterday, or the leftists under the Socialist Party leader, Lionel Jospin, will win next week's decisive second round.
These results express discontent with the status quo, but no strong endorsement for any party's political prescriptions. The French are rightly worried about their country's prolonged economic stagnation and chronic double-digit unemployment. They are uncomfortable with the right's proposed response, which consists mainly of expanded privatization and painful reductions in the welfare state to meet the deficit targets set for Europe's planned single currency, the euro. But they are also dubious about the left's glib-sounding promise of painless government-spurred recovery. They reasonably fear that Socialist proposals for deficit spending, work-sharing formulas and large-scale job creation could frighten investors, re-ignite inflation and jeopardize France's eligibility for the new currency. 
 Whichever side wins a majority next week is thus likely to face a version of the same dilemma that has undone French governments of left and right for more than a decade. Francois Mitterrand carried the left to power in 1981 with a program of nationalization and government spending, only to find investors ditching the weakened French franc for German marks and other more reliable currencies. Mr. Mitterrand soon reverted to fiscal austerity. That restored confidence in the franc but undermined support for his Socialist Party, leading to two periods of divided government with Mr. Mitterrand as President and conservative majorities in Parliament.
Two years ago Mr. Chirac won the presidency for the right by promising to reduce unemployment without further austerity. But he too was forced into a quick reversal by the need to meet deficit targets for the single currency. The conservatives have been in trouble ever since.
France wants an economically and politically united Europe because history has taught it to fear an unfettered Germany. Germany no longer looms as a potential military threat. But France fears that without closely linking its economy and currency to Germany's, it could easily be relegated to Europe's second economic tier. France also sees a strong, economically unified Europe as a way to defend its cultural traditions against the threat of globalization, a threat many in France seem to reflexively identify with the United States.
But meeting the deficit targets for the single currency requires cutting popular government-paid benefits like early retirement, social security and free health care. That seems to many an unacceptably high price. When public-sector workers strike to defend their benefits, they generally win broad popular support.
Outsiders can feel some sympathy for this French dilemma. But as long as France remains unwilling to reconsider either its plans for ever tighter European financial integration or its unwillingness to reduce costly welfare benefits, it will remain volatile.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Will Denounce Trade Policy Toward China

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 26

 BODY:
Breaking with the Clinton Administration again, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, plans to denounce normal trade relations with China on Tuesday, asserting that such terms would help China's leaders and "contribute to their tyranny and reinforce their contempt for America's resolve."
Calling current policy in Beijing "free-market Stalinism," Mr. Gephardt, in a speech to be delivered at the Detroit Economic Club, said that efforts to advance democracy through trade were futile. 
 "Economic growth for the elite will not lead to basic human rights for billions," he said, bluntly contradicting President Clinton's contention last Monday that trade ties are "the best way to bring China into the family of nations and to secure our interests and our ideals." Mr. Clinton elaborated, saying, "We hope that it will come to respect human rights more and the rule of law more."
Last week Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, condemned the budget deal Mr. Clinton struck with Congressional Republicans as lacking "fairness."
That position was widely cited as just another move in preparing to run for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000 against Vice President Gore. But Mr. Gephardt said then, "That decision hasn't been made and won't be made for some time."
The Detroit speech, a copy of which was made available to The New York Times, is sure to renew that speculation, though his aides contended today that it was consistent with his vote against renewing normal trade status for China last June. But last June, the House approved renewal, 286 to 141, Mr. Clinton was running for re-election, and Mr. Gephardt did not embarrass him by making a speech on the issue. Now Mr. Clinton is not running and Mr. Gephardt may be.
On the budget, only a third of the House Democrats joined Mr. Gephardt in voting against the measure. Some who were dubious voted for it anyway, knowing they faced certain defeat and future television advertisements against them saying they opposed a balanced budget.
Mr. Gephardt may have more influence on the issue of renewing normal trade relations, known as "most favored nation" status, however, because the odds are uncertain and the political risks slight.
In the House, Mr. Gephardt joins an ideologically scattered coalition ranging from diehard socially conservative Republicans to labor union Democrats who already have high hopes of winning a vote to reject Mr. Clinton's decision. But they frankly concede they have little hope of winning in the Senate and none of overriding a veto by the President.
The House is likely to vote on extending China's trading status in late June or in July.
In the speech, Mr. Gephardt touched on a variety of complaints against the Chinese leadership. He criticized the United States' trade deficit of nearly $40 billion last year, calling it evidence that trade policy had been an economic failure. "We can't compete with slave labor," he said, referring to China's use of prisoners to make exportable goods.
And Mr. Gephardt, who focused on the trade issue while losing his party's Presidential nomination in 1988 to Michael S. Dukakis, used some of his strongest language to denounce China's role in the world, especially in the sale of cruise missiles and poison-gas equipment to Iran.
"Today's China,' he said, "is not content to keep its reign of terror inside its own borders. It blows its storm of calamity into the world's other outlaw nations."
But the bulk of his speech focused on human rights. With an eye toward the businessmen who usually dominate the Detroit Economic Club audience, he warned, "Human rights is, at its heart, about the rule of law. A government that can arbitrarily violate the liberty of its people cannot be trusted to abide by the rules of contract or the rights of companies."
Pushing his argument, he added, "Those who would drench Tiananmen Square with blood do not blanch at shredding a commercial or international obligation.
"For years," he said, "the business community has argued that its participation in the economy -- simply being there -- would yield results. So far, no real progress has been made. We now hear the same arguments for constructive engagement with China that we heard about South Africa. But nothing fundamental changed in South Africa until sanctions came."
"Constructive engagement," he said, "too often becomes convenient engagement."
He said that sanctions against South Africa and trade restrictions on the Soviet Union had helped end tyranny in those countries, and last year's Helms-Burton Law, with its penalties for countries that trade with Cuba, was intended to end dictatorship in this hemisphere.
Following those examples, he said, "The United States has no business playing 'business as usual' with a Chinese tyranny that persecutes Christian and Muslim leaders and leaders from many other faiths, precludes tens of millions from practicing their religion." He attacked China for its policy of "forced abortion" and for imprisoning Wei Jingsheng, an advocate of democracy.
"For brave men and women in China," he said, "freedom is more than fine words and easy rhetoric; for it they have sacrificed their personal liberty -- and too often, even their lives. Don't tell them that human rights are a Western idea, a European idea, and that no Asians need apply. Don't excuse tyranny by insulting its victims."
The only Chinese who profited from trade with the United States, he said, "were corrupt bureaucrats and brutal generals." He added, "Our current relationship, in effect, sanctions their repression."
"Tyrants cannot rule forever," he concluded, "and when the Chinese are freed from oppression they will ask: 'Where was the United States during our time of darkness? Did America stand with us or did she look the other way?' "
