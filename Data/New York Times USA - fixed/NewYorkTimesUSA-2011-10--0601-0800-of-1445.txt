HEADLINE: With Three 9s, Cain Refigured Math for Taxes

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
It was a strategy session at 28,000 feet. Herman Cain, the Republican presidential candidate, and his advisers were on a campaign flight this summer between Atlanta and New Hampshire, tossing around policy ideas.
Mr. Cain, a former pizza chain chief executive, wanted a proposal to jolt the economy and give his candidacy some definition. ''I said, 'The first fundamental, guys, is we have to throw out the tax code,' '' Mr. Cain said Wednesday in an interview.
''How do we come up with a bolder plan?'' he pressed two of his close advisers. 
From that exchange emerged the plan that Mr. Cain calls 9-9-9: a flat 9 percent individual income tax rate, a 9 percent corporate tax rate and a 9 percent national sales tax.
He has uttered the triple digits repeatedly, metronome-like, in speeches and debates, until they have acquired the catchy power of a brand.
Although Mr. Cain's rivals have tried to use the plan's simplicity against him -- responding that it sounds like the price of a pie with pepperoni, for example -- he has stuck to his message.
Now both he and his proposal are getting intensive new scrutiny as Republicans continue to flirt with their candidates less than three months before casting the first votes of the primary season. He continues to surge in national polls.
A poll released Wednesday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Cain was effectively tied with Mitt Romney; on Tuesday night, Mr. Cain and his tax plan were at the center of the candidates' debate.
But although the specifics of the 9-9-9 plan were developed only in the last few months, it is only the latest incarnation of two ideas popular among some supply-side conservatives for decades.
Mr. Cain was a co-chairman in 1996 of the presidential campaign of Steve Forbes, who advocated a flat tax -- a single rate on income for all payers. Mr. Cain later supported a ''fair tax,'' one that would replace all other taxes with a national sales tax.
The 9-9-9 plan combines elements of both ideas. But it is little more than a sketch of what would be a radical and complex overhaul of the tax system. In developing it, Mr. Cain relied heavily on Rich Lowrie, whom he calls his lead economist. Mr. Lowrie is an investment adviser at a Wells Fargo office in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Although he is an unpaid member of an advisory board of the American Conservative Union, he has never worked for a policy research group or an academic institution, or made a name through economic analysis.
In an interview, Mr. Lowrie said he had a bachelor of science degree in accountancy from Case Western Reserve University. On his Facebook page, he describes his political views as ''free markets.'' Mr. Lowrie said he had been inspired by two well-known proponents of supply-side thinking: Arthur Laffer, often considered the father of the concept that lower tax rates help pay for themselves by generating additional economic growth, and Jude Wanniski, who promoted the idea among politicians. Mr. Lowrie became involved with the Ohio chapter of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative organization supported by the billionaire Koch brothers.
The plan could have major economic and political challenges: It might result in a substantial revenue loss for the government and shift the tax burden toward lower- and middle-income people.
In an interview, Mr. Cain, a math major in college, said he had asked Mr. Lowrie to do a ''regression analysis'' that would allow the government to eliminate all existing taxes, including those on capital gains and estates, and collect the same revenue from just three streams. ''The number came up to be 9 percent,'' Mr. Cain said. ''And that's how we came up with 9-9-9.''
Mr. Lowrie, who met Mr. Cain at a conference sponsored by the conservative Club for Growth, dismissed the notion that his own understanding of economics was limited by lack of a Ph.D. ''I don't list myself as an economist,'' he said. ''I have an accounting degree, and I'm an investment adviser. I've never hung out in a faculty lounge.''
A former staff member for Mr. Cain in Iowa described his and Mr. Lowrie's relationship as ''buddy-buddy,'' adding, ''They were just like two executives palling around together.''
Their plan has drawn fire from both right and left. Conservatives are wary of a national sales tax, concerned that it would create another, easily increased method of taxation. Among the critics are The Wall Street Journal editorial page and Bruce Bartlett, an official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, who contributes to the Economix blog for The New York Times.
Critics, especially liberals, say the plan offers a huge tax break for the wealthy while imposing a steep, regressive new sales tax on the middle-class and working poor, with everyday items like milk and bread being subject to a 9 percent tax. In Tuesday's debate, defending his own 59-point economic plan, Mr. Romney took aim at Mr. Cain's: ''Simple answers are always very helpful, but oftentimes inadequate.''
Mr. Cain said an independent analyst had examined the plan and found that it would raise the same revenue as the existing tax structure. The analyst, Gary Robbins, a consultant in Arlington, Va., said the Cain plan was ''revenue neutral.'' That is, if it had been in place in 2008, the last year taxes were not affected by the recession, it would have raised $2.3 trillion in revenue, the amount the federal government collected from all sources other than excise taxes.
''It's not the plan I particularly would do, but it's a sound plan,'' said Mr. Robbins, who worked for Mr. Forbes's campaigns and recalled that his flat tax was ''designed on my dining room table.''
Actually, Mr. Robbins's math determined that the across-the-board rates necessary to raise the same money as existing federal taxes should be 9.1 percent.
Somehow, 9.1-9.1-9.1 does not trip off the tongue.

HEADLINE: Shares Are Bolstered by News From Europe

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday, after a new plan was unveiled to recapitalize European banks and a deal was struck in Slovakia that is expected to permit the creation of a larger, more powerful euro zone bailout fund.
Some traders say that the market is gaining momentum from its recent gains and have begun pointing to signs that the market's extreme volatility may be giving way to a calmer period. But with all eyes on Europe, even optimists acknowledge the fragility of the recent confidence. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 102.55 points, or 0.9 percent, at 11,518.85. It spent much of the day in positive territory for the year before giving up some of its gains in the last hour.
The index was positive for most of the year before plunging in early August. Since then, stock prices have experienced a series of wrenching ups and downs, closing in positive territory for the year only once.
The index closed on Wednesday 0.5 percent below its level at the beginning of 2011.
The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index, seen as a more complete barometer of the overall market, was up 11.71 points, or 1 percent, at 1,207.25. It remains down more than 3 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index rose 21.70 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,604.73.
Banks continued to make particularly strong gains. Citigroup gained 4.9 percent, while Wells Fargo's shares were up 3.5 percent.
The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, proposed that Europe's biggest banks be required to temporarily bolster their protection against losses, as part of a broader plan to restore confidence in the European financial system. He also called on the 17 European Union members that use the euro to maximize the capacity of their bailout fund, a clear hint that he favors leveraging the fund to increase its power.
Slovakia is expected to approve changes to the rescue fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, on Thursday or Friday.
Lawmakers there initially rejected the bill shortly after markets in the United States closed on Tuesday. The vote led to the collapse of the country's coalition government, but the parties in the departing government reached an accord with the main opposition party to permit the bill to pass in exchange for early elections.
The other 16 E.U. members that use the euro have approved the measure, which requires unanimous support.
Analysts said recent turmoil in the markets had effectively forced European leaders to show real progress in addressing problems related to sovereign debt.
''The market has screamed loud enough to make the European authorities stand up and listen,'' said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company.
Some traders also pointed to the falling level of the VIX, which measures volatility, as a sign that markets could be stabilizing. The VIX, popularly known as the fear index, ended at 31.26, its lowest level since mid-September. In addition to positive signs in Europe, the markets were adjusting to a slightly brighter picture of the domestic economy, said Michael Church, president of Addison Capital. A recent spate of economic data has eased fears among economists that a recession is imminent.
''At some point you had to question that thesis, especially when it had become exceptionally popular,'' Mr. Church said.
The minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released on Wednesday. They showed that two members had favored more aggressive action to stimulate the economy, essentially putting fears of a further slowdown ahead of inflation concerns.
European markets closed higher Wednesday. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index was up 2.43 percent; the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.85 percent; and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 2.2 percent.
The euro, which has been gaining against the dollar for over a week, rose 1.1 percent to $1.3677.
Yields on United States Treasuries also continue to rise. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note was 2.21 percent, up from 2.16 late Tuesday.
Online Correction: October 12, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously reported the yield on the 30-year bond -- rather than the 10-year note -- as 2.214 percent.

HEADLINE: Europe Tells Its Banks To Raise New Capital

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE; Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- European banks need to raise more capital to protect themselves against losses on sovereign debt or politicians will do it for them, the European Union said on Wednesday.
Under proposals outlined by the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, banks would be required to temporarily bolster their protection against losses as part of a plan to restore waning confidence.
Mr. Barroso also called on the 17 European Union members that use the euro to maximize the capacity of their 440 billion euro ($600 billion) bailout fund -- a clear hint that he favors leveraging the rescue fund to increase its firepower to as much as 2 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion). 
Leveraging the fund was advocated by the United States treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to ensure that troubled European countries had access to affordable financing as they tried to reduce their debt.
The Treasury Department pressed that point on Wednesday during a briefing ahead of a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of 20 on Friday and Saturday in Paris, which Mr. Geithner will attend.
Europe needs ''a firewall that has the resources and capacity'' to ensure that the crisis that started in Greece does not spread to bigger countries, Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said at the briefing. The euro zone is entering a critical countdown, with investors in financial markets expecting European officials at a summit meeting on Oct. 23 and leaders of the Group of 20 at on Nov. 3 to endorse plans to resolve the region's debt crisis.
On Wednesday, Slovakia reversed course and struck a political deal that should ensure approval of the bailout fund, the 17th and last vote required. European officials, who had been watching closely, greeted the breakthrough with a mixture of relief and frustration and were able to turn their attention to the banks.
Extra capital for European banks should be raised first from the private sector, then from national governments, according to the proposal. Only when those avenues have been exhausted should a euro zone bailout fund be tapped, it said.
Banks should not be allowed to pay dividends or bonuses until they have raised the additional capital, according to the proposal.
The plan put forward Wednesday did not put a figure on the capital reserves that would be required. That omission contrasted with the more specific plans circulating in France and among European banking regulators for a minimum capital reserve of 9 percent of assets.
Internally, the European commissioner responsible for financial services, Michel Barnier, argued that the new floor for capital should be set by the European Banking Authority, not the commission, said one European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the government discussions.
On Tuesday, Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told the French National Assembly that several leading French banks that were deeply exposed to the sovereign debt of Greece and other Southern European countries -- like BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale -- would move to increase their capital reserves, initially by using their own revenue or through the financial markets. Money from the government would be drawn upon only as ''a last resort,'' he said, according to Reuters.
Mr. Juppe said the move, which was agreed upon with Germany during talks Sunday, meant that the banks' best buffer against losses, known as core Tier 1 capital, would increase to 9 percent or more by 2013, from 7 percent now.
The European Banking Authority has also suggested a 9 percent floor, according to European Union officials. The agency declined to comment on the figure Wednesday.
The document released Wednesday by the European Commission called for ''a temporary significantly higher capital ratio of highest-quality capital after accounting for exposure'' to sovereign debt in systemically important banks.
One European official said that the recapitalization proposal essentially meant that banks were likely to have to meet the requirements laid down under the so-called Basel III international standards for banks more quickly than first expected, although temporarily. Instead of reaching the specified level of capital by 2019, these goals will have to be reached ''within months,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Ms. Brainard of the United States Treasury Department said that while Europe had finally come around to the idea that its banks need more capital in case the crisis worsened, ''it's still one piece of several actions that need to happen as part of a comprehensive plan'' to prevent contagion from a Greek default or worse.
After Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, the United States took swift action to ensure its banks had a strong cushion of capital, a move that Ms. Brainard said restored confidence and helped the banks turn around relatively quickly.
''At the time, it was seen as a risky endeavor, but it turned out to be just the medicine the market needed,'' she said. ''The same logic lies behind Europe's efforts.''
On Wednesday, Mr. Barroso argued for the quick release of 8 billion euros in loans to Greece from international lenders, without which the government in Athens could default within weeks.
With the euro zone's temporary bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, set to gain new powers to help recapitalize banks, the issue of whether to use it has divided France and Germany. Mr. Barroso called for the early introduction -- next year if possible -- of the permanent euro zone bailout fund that is to replace the facility in 2013.
France fears that it could lose its triple-A credit rating if it has to inject billions of euros in taxpayer money into its banks. That would be a huge political setback for President Nicolas Sarkozy, who faces a re-election campaign next year.
But Berlin is reluctant to use European funds to recapitalize banks that compete with its own financial institutions.

HEADLINE: No Jobs Bill, and No Ideas: Republicans are good at shooting down useful economic plans, but have none of their own

 BODY:
It was all predicted, but the unanimous decision by Senate Republicans on Tuesday to filibuster and thus kill President Obama's jobs bill was still a breathtaking act of economic vandalism. There are 14 million people out of work, wages are falling, poverty is rising, and a second recession may be blowing in, but not a single Republican would even allow debate on a sound plan to cut middle-class taxes and increase public-works spending. 
The bill the Republicans shot down is not a panacea, but independent economists say it would have a significant and swift effect on the current stagnation. Macroeconomic Advisers, whose forecasts are often used by the Federal Reserve, said it could raise economic growth by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.3 million jobs in 2012. Moody's Analytics estimated new growth at 2 percentage points and 1.9 million jobs. Those economists say that Republican ideas for increasing growth would have no measurable effects in the next year.
The Republicans offer no actual economic plans, only tired slogans about cutting regulations and spending, and ending health care reform. The party seems content to run out the clock on Mr. Obama's term while doing very little. On Tuesday, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, accused Republicans of trying to ''suffocate the economy'' in hopes that the pain would work to their political advantage. They are doing little to refute that charge.
Their lack of serious ideas was on full display in both the Senate and the presidential debate on Tuesday night in New Hampshire. The debate was ostensibly about the economy, but when the freshest and most-talked-about idea is Herman Cain's ridiculous ''9-9-9'' tax plan, it is clear that the economy they were debating is not the one Americans are forced to live in. Mr. Cain -- whose rise in the polls says everything you need to know about the amateur-hour decline of his party -- wants to replace all federal taxes with a 9 percent levy on corporate income, personal income and sales. As Bruce Bartlett, an economist who has worked in Republican administrations, recently wrote in The Times, it is a formula designed to cut taxes for the rich and increase them for the poor, raising the deficit and doing nothing for growth.
The other candidates were no less vacuous. Mitt Romney offered an ash heap of used ideas, saying he would push a balanced-budget amendment, cut back on regulations, and go chest to chest with China on trade. Rick Perry, when he could be stirred to speak, vowed to somehow put 1.2 million people to work in the energy industry, as if the whole country were Texas and drills could pop up on every block.
Republican candidates fear the Tea Party too much to acknowledge that economists are solidly behind government intervention to awaken growth. The jobs bill rejected by Republican leaders will now be reintroduced piece by piece, and Republicans are not likely to go along with much more than an extension of the payroll tax cut (which is opposed by Mr. Romney). But at least the record is increasingly clear who is advocating real ideas and who is selling an empty vessel.

HEADLINE: How to Stop the Drop in Home Values

BYLINE: By MARTIN S. FELDSTEIN. 
Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard, was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984 under President Ronald Reagan.

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
HOMES are the primary form of wealth for most Americans. Since the housing bubble burst in 2006, the wealth of American homeowners has fallen by some $9 trillion, or nearly 40 percent. In the 12 months ending in June, house values fell by more than $1 trillion, or 8 percent. That sharp fall in wealth means less consumer spending, leading to less business production and fewer jobs.
But for political reasons, both the Obama administration and Republican leaders in Congress have resisted the only real solution: permanently reducing the mortgage debt hanging over America. The resistance is understandable. Voters don't want their tax dollars used to help some homeowners who could afford to pay their mortgages but choose not to because they can default instead, and simply walk away. And voters don't want to provide any more help to the banks that made loans that have gone sour. 
But failure to act means that further declines in home prices will continue, preventing the rise in consumer spending needed for recovery. As costly as it will be to permanently write down mortgages, it will be even costlier to do nothing and run the risk of another recession.
House prices are falling because millions of homeowners are defaulting on their mortgages, and the sale of their foreclosed properties is driving down the prices of all homes. Nearly 15 million homeowners owe more than their homes are worth; in this group, about half the mortgages exceed the home value by more than 30 percent.
Most residential mortgages are effectively nonrecourse loans, meaning creditors can eventually take the house if the homeowner defaults, but cannot take other assets or earnings. Individuals with substantial excess mortgage debt therefore have a strong incentive to stop paying; they can often stay in their homes for a year or more before the property is foreclosed and they are forced to move.
The overhang of mortgage debt prevents homeowners from moving to areas where there are better job prospects and from using home equity to finance small business start-ups and expansions. And because their current mortgages exceed the value of their homes, they cannot free up cash by refinancing at low interest rates.
The Obama administration has tried a variety of programs to reduce monthly interest payments. Those programs failed because they didn't address the real problem: the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home.
To halt the fall in house prices, the government should reduce mortgage principal when it exceeds 110 percent of the home value. About 11 million of the nearly 15 million homes that are ''underwater'' are in this category. If everyone eligible participated, the one-time cost would be under $350 billion. Here's how such a policy might work:
If the bank or other mortgage holder agrees, the value of the mortgage would be reduced to 110 percent of the home value, with the government absorbing half of the cost of the reduction and the bank absorbing the other half. For the millions of underwater mortgages that are held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government would just be paying itself. And in exchange for this reduction in principal, the borrower would have to accept that the new mortgage had full recourse -- in other words, the government could go after the borrower's other assets if he defaulted on the home. This would all be voluntary.
This plan is fair because both borrowers and creditors would make sacrifices. The bank would accept the cost of the principal write-down because the resulting loan -- with its lower loan-to-value ratio and its full recourse feature -- would be much less likely to result in default. The borrowers would accept full recourse to get the mortgage reduction.
Without a program to stop mortgage defaults, there is no way to know how much further house prices might fall. Although house prices in some areas are already very low, potential buyers continue to wait because they anticipate even lower prices in the future.
Before the housing bubble burst in 2006, the level of house prices had risen nearly 60 percent above the long-term price path. So there is no knowing how far prices may fall below the long-term path before they begin to recover.
I cannot agree with those who say we should just let house prices continue to fall until they stop by themselves. Although some forest fires are allowed to burn out naturally, no one lets those fires continue to burn when they threaten residential neighborhoods. The fall in house prices is not just a decline in wealth but a decline that depresses consumer spending, making the economy weaker and the loss of jobs much greater. We all have a stake in preventing that.

HEADLINE: The Charges Against Iran: An alleged murder-for-hire plot is only the latest outrage from Tehran

 BODY:
Charges that Iranian officials ordered the assassination of Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States are chilling and bizarre. If true -- and American officials insist they have strong evidence -- this is only the latest reminder of why the United States and its allies must use all possible diplomatic and economic pressures to isolate Tehran and block its nuclear ambitions. 
American credibility following the war in Iraq is fragile, and Washington will have to fully disclose the evidence -- and be very careful not to oversell it.
While Tehran fiercely denied the allegations, it has a long history of assassinations and terrorist attacks and a particular animosity for its Saudi rivals. The Quds Force, the branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps that the Justice Department said was behind the conspiracy, is believed to have been responsible for the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia in 1996, in which 19 American servicemen died.
This plot appears extraordinarily brazen -- the first major Iranian attack on American soil -- and almost laughably sloppy.
The Quds Force usually does such work through organized proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas and Iraq's Mahdi Army. The Justice Department charges that this time it used an Iranian-American car salesman, Mansour J. Arbabsiar, who then tried to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir. (Officials said the Iranians had also discussed contracting out attacks on the Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington and in Buenos Aires.) As it turned out, thankfully, the member of Los Zetas whom Mr. Arbabsiar allegedly contacted was an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration.
All of this raises a large number of questions, starting with who in Iran is behind the plot and why they would try something so reckless and do it so clumsily. American officials say they are certain of the role of several Quds officers and that they cannot imagine anything this ambitious going forward without the direction of the chief of the Quds Force, Qassim Suleimani. As President Obama moves forward, he and his aides will have to figure out how high the responsibility goes.
It is a relief that Mr. Obama will be the one to weigh the evidence and make the decisions, not his predecessor. He has proved his mettle with the raids that killed Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders. But steely restraint and a dispassionate, effective response are needed. Not another shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later war.
The administration has begun sharing information with allies and pressing them to impose additional sanctions on Iran and particularly on organizations and businesses run by the Revolutionary Guards. The administration should also use this moment to press hard for a new round of sanctions at the United Nations.
Five years after the Security Council ordered it to halt, Iran is still enriching uranium and clearly betting that the world will forget or acquiesce. This regime must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.

HEADLINE: A Smart Immigration Move at Rikers

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg speaks often about the need for smart and humane immigration reform. He has now rightly thrown his support behind a City Council bill that would place sensible limits on how far New York City goes to help the federal government detain and deport illegal immigrants who pose no threat to the community. 
The bill, sponsored by Speaker Christine Quinn, involves immigrants jailed at Rikers Island. Officials there, as in most of the country, routinely send lists of foreign-born inmates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency, known as ICE, checks its databases for immigration violators and sends back requests that certain inmates be held until taken into federal custody. The city usually obliges, though no law or agreement requires it to.
The agency issued so-called detainers on 3,506 Rikers inmates in 2009. But were they all dangerous criminals? The City Council found that while about 22 percent of the detainers were placed on inmates with felony records, more than half involved inmates with no prior convictions.
Under Ms. Quinn's bill, the city would still allow ICE into its jails and would keep firm hold on criminals who threatened public safety. But it would end the voluntary practice of handing over inmates who clearly do not belong in ICE's dragnet. That is, those who are about to be released because charges have been dropped, who have no prior convictions or outstanding warrants, who have not been previously ordered deported, and who do not appear on watch lists of gang members and terrorists.
It is a sensible approach, nothing like the thoughtless harshness we see in Alabama and Arizona, where radical laws have enabled indiscriminate roundups, without regard to the devastating harm to families, citizen children or the economy. With deportations at record highs under President Obama -- partly because of the outsourcing of immigration enforcement to local police agencies -- discretion and compassion are needed more than ever. His administration recently declared that it would focus on deporting dangerous criminals, not harmless workers. With this bill, New York would help make sure those good intentions stick. The Council should swiftly pass this bill.

HEADLINE: The Gift Of Glib

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Right now you're probably asking yourself, how did Rick Perry do in the big Republican debate in New Hampshire this week?
He did great! It turns out that Governor Perry has a big energy plan, known as ''The Plan I'm Going to Be Laying Out.'' When he does, it's going to be the answer to almost everything. We know that because no matter what Perry was asked, he talked about the plan. Which will involve ''the American entrepreneurship that's out there.'' And a whole lot more. When he's ready to tell you.
For the rest of the time, Perry pretty much sat there like a large boulder with good hair, while the remaining members of the gang attacked Herman Cain, the former fast-food chain president turned Republican front-runner, about his economic plan. 
This is what we've come to. A presidential debate about the 9-9-9 plan.
9-9-9 is the sine qua non of the Cain candidacy. It would scrap the tax code and give us 9 percent corporate, income and national sales taxes. He mentions it every 10 seconds. (Opening statement, he got it in by 5.)
I have never heard anybody discussing the 9-9-9 plan in the real world, but obviously I hang out in the wrong places. The organizers and the candidates felt the need to really get into this, and, as a result, Tuesday night in New Hampshire will go down in history as the 9-9-9 plan debate. (Here is how presidential primary debates go down in history. The tapes are stored in a moisture-proof vault in a civil defense cave in Indiana. If the world as we know it should come to an end, the surviving members of our species will be able to relive these deeply American contests and pass their knowledge on to their children. Soon, they will go forth and repopulate a world in which all the boys sit around looking smug like Newt Gingrich and all the girls sound like Michele Bachmann. That is what they mean by ''the living will envy the dead.'')
Among the elite cadre of Americans who have been thinking about 9-9-9, a good number have determined that it won't raise enough revenue. ''The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect,'' announced Cain firmly. I do admire the way he does this. If I could convey that tone, I would win every argument in my family just by saying ''The problem with that analysis is that it is incorrect.'' And there would never again be a discussion of renting a limo for a family viewing of all the Cincinnati Christmas lights.
Also, Michele Bachmann pointed out that 999 turned upside down is 666, which would make Cain's tax policy the mark of the devil. Cain seemed to find that amusing, but he looked a little peeved when Jon Huntsman suggested 999 might be the price of a box of pizza.
That, people, was the sum and substance of the wit and humor of the New Hampshire Republican debate. Jon Huntsman also tried to make a joke about gas, but we are not going there.
Cain, in an attempt to pull down his competition, asked if Romney could name all 59 points in his 160-page economic plan.
Now I strongly suspect that Mitt could name all 59 points. I bet he repeats them at night to put himself to sleep. (''lower marginal tax rates ... more free trade agreements ... mmmmzzzzzzz.'') But he didn't fall into that trap. He whipped out the seven pillars of Romneyism, which support the 59 points and can, therefore, be packed into one 30-second response. If you ignore Charlie Rose yelling in the background.
The guy has pillars for his points. No wonder he's winning.
There were other high points -- Gingrich accused Romney of starting class warfare by advocating an end to the capital gains tax only for investors making under $200,000 a year. He also said Barney Frank and Chris Dodd should be thrown in jail for their bill to reform Wall Street financial practices. Herman Cain said Alan Greenspan was the best Fed chairman in recent history. Michele Bachmann gave the fact-checkers another great night of error-correcting. It was the usual good time for all, except you do kind of wonder what the heck gives this particular crowd of people the right to be the nation's official presidential contenders. What do they have in common? Intelligence? Appropriate experience? A large base of followers? Not so much.
What have they got? They've all got glib.
Except one. It's enough to make you feel sorry for Rick Perry. If he wasn't Rick Perry.
As things stand, the Perry camp is apparently planning to keep their guy in the background during debates and hit Romney over the head with mean commercials. That shouldn't be too hard. Maybe they'll include the day Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the car roof.

HEADLINE: Can Tax Cuts Pay for Themselves?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The Congressional supercommittee dealing with the budget deficit is contemplating the notion that tax cuts will provoke growth and more revenue -- and that is a dangerous approach, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Can tax cuts "pay for themselves," inducing so much additional economic growth that government revenue actually increases, rather than decreases? The evidence clearly says no.
Nevertheless, a version of this idea, under the guise of "dynamic scoring," has apparently surfaced in the supercommittee charged with deficit reduction -- the joint Congressional committee with 12 members. Dynamic scoring sounds technical or perhaps even scientific, but here the argument means simply that any pro-growth effect of tax cuts should be stressed when assessing potential policy changes (e.g., reforming the tax code). For anyone seriously concerned with fiscal responsibility, this is a dangerous notion.
Economists disagree about almost everything, of course, and the effect of tax cuts is no exception. One reasonable way to assess the evidence is to begin with the highest plausible effects, then see what happens if some of the more extreme assumptions are relaxed (this is a nice way of saying that we don't believe everything the authors are trying to tell us).
I would start with a study by Gregory Mankiw, former chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers - and therefore presumably on the tax-cutting side of American politics - and Matthew Weinzierl (published in The Journal of Public Economics in 2006 and, unfortunately, available only to subscribers) that shows the economic growth caused by a tax cut can offset, at best, a portion of the revenues lost by that tax cut.

Specifically, Professors. Mankiw and Weinzierl calculated that 32.4 percent of the "static" or direct revenue loss of a capital-gains tax cut and 14.7 percent of the static revenue loss of a labor tax cut could be offset in present-value terms by additional growth, ignoring short-term Keynesian effects (i.e., any immediate stimulus provided to the economy).
Now 32.4 percent is a lot, but it is far less than 100 percent. And a critical assumption for Professors Mankiw and Weinzierl is that government spending falls to keep the budget in balance. In their framework that's a good thing -- as they are effectively assuming away the consequences of any productive effects of government spending (e.g., what if less spending on schools means less education and this hurts "human capital" and therefore productivity down the road?).
Sticking for a moment with just with their view of the world, if instead the tax cuts are financed by additional debt, as was our collective experience during the 2000s, the ultimate effect of those cuts can be to lower economic growth in the long term, depending on whether the larger debt eventually leads to lower government transfers, lower government consumption, higher taxes on capital or higher taxes on labor. (Eric M. Leeper and Shu-Chun Susan Yang discuss this in "Dynamic Scoring: Alternative Financing Schemes," also in The Journal of Public Economics, in 2008.)
More broadly, in 2005, the Congressional Budget Office, then headed by a Republican appointee, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated that the economic effects of a 10 percent cut in income taxes would offset from 1 to 22 percent of the revenue loss in the first five years; in the following five years, the economic effects might offset up to 32 percent of the revenue loss, but might also add 5 percent to the revenue loss.
This is an entirely reasonable assessment -- the budget office exists to provide balanced analysis for the budget process. The bottom line is that betting that tax cuts will pay for themselves is a high-risk strategy and not a good idea at our current levels of government debt relative to gross domestic product. We do not have a large margin for error. (Disclosure: I'm on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the the budget office, but I didn't have anything to do with that study.)
Of course, economic studies do not necessarily have a direct effect on political discourse. For example, President George W. Bush asserted in 2007, "It is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues." But this is nothing more than an assertion. Growth during the 2001-7 expansion was only 2.7 percent compared, for example, with 3.7 percent during the 1990s expansion (when tax rates were higher).
And much of the growth during the Bush period turned out to be illusory; it was based on our corporate and national accounting system, which measures profits (an important part of G.D.P.) but not on a risk-adjusted basis. When the risks materialized in the financial crisis of 2008-9, we lost so much output that G.D.P. per capita in real terms today is only at about the level of 2005.
To assess growth properly, you should look "over the cycle," meaning roughly 10 years for the modern American economy. It is hard to argue that the last decade was any kind of growth success. Of course, other things happened during the 2000s, including further financial sector deregulation not directly related to the tax cuts.
That's why we have the economic analysis, particularly by the budget office, to disentangle what tax cuts can really do. If the supercommittee buys into dynamic scoring for tax cuts, at best this would be wishful thinking. At worst, it would represent yet another round of fiscal irresponsibility at the top of American politics.
And if people are seriously considering altering the rules under which the the budget office operates, they should stop and think again. Changing the score-keeping guidelines at this stage would amount to undermining the credibility of the office, one of the few remaining impartial and well-informed observers of the nation's economy.
Perhaps this strategy might yield some short-term political gains, but the damage to our creditworthiness would be immense, and the consequences would be felt sooner rather than later.
The nightmare downward spiral and fiscal implosion in the euro zone began with a few countries cheating on their numbers -- first to get into the currency union and then to avoid various forms of official criticism. We do not want to start down the same path.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Protests Inspire London Offshoot

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Mirroring protests in New York's financial district and elsewhere in the United States, a group of activists said they would gather in front of the London Stock Exchange on Saturday to highlight "social and economic injustice." 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Occupy Wall Street protests are spreading to London. 
A group of activists said they expected several thousand people to gather in front of the London Stock Exchange on Saturday. Mirroring protests in New York's financial district and elsewhere in the United States, the London activists said the planned event, called OccupyLSX, "aims to highlight the social and economic injustice in the U.K. and beyond."
"More than a million people have lost their jobs and tens of thousands of homes have been repossessed, while small businesses are struggling to survive," Laura Taylor, a supporter of OccupyLSX, said on the group's Web site. "Yet bankers continue to make billions in profit and pay themselves enormous bonuses."
 The organizers, which include UK Uncut, a campaign against Britain's austerity measures, said they expected about 4,000 protesters to assemble at noon on the square in front of the London Stock Exchange in the financial district. A Facebook page dedicated to the protest has more than 12,000 fans and almost 3,000 people follow OccupyLSX on Twitter.
"As protests on Wall Street capture the imagination of the world, with people taking to the streets to hold the global financial system to task, a diverse group of Londoners is coming together to launch a peaceful occupation," the group said on its Web site.

HEADLINE: Seeing Things | 'California Design, 1930-1965'

BYLINE: BROOKE HODGE


HIGHLIGHT: An exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art takes visitors on a journey through California in all its midcentury glory. 

 BODY:
"California Design, 1930-1965: Living In A Modern Way," at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art through March 25, 2012, is a must-see. Even though the Golden State played a key role in shaping our material culture, the exhibition is, somewhat surprisingly, the first major museum survey of California design. Organized by Wendy Kaplan and Bobbye Tigerman of LACMA's department of decorative arts and design, this sprawling show features more than 350 objects, including furniture, fashion, film, graphic and industrial design, ceramics, jewelry and architectural drawings and photography.
A masterly exhibition design by the Los Angeles studio Hodgetts + Fung takes visitors on a journey through California in all its midcentury glory. Curvy white display platforms populated with examples of furnishings and objects (by designers both known and less so) snake through the elegant Renzo Piano-designed Resnick Pavilion gallery space, punctuated by vignettes that highlight particular aspects of California living as well as the state's rich design history.
Modern design flourished in California in the postwar years, and the state staked its claim as the world center for design innovation during the period covered by the exhibition, which as Kaplan explains, "demonstrates how the California of our collective imagination - a democratic utopia where an amazing climate promoted an informal indoor/outdoor lifestyle - was translated into a material culture that defined an era." Greta Magnusson Grossman, the Austrian designer who immigrated to Los Angeles, declared in 1951 that California design "is not a superimposed style, but an answer to present conditions. ... It has developed out of our own preference for living in a modern way." The exhibition's four sections - Shaping, Making, Living and Selling - show the ways in which Modernism developed and flourished in California. While many of the seeds of midcentury California Modernism were sown in the years immediately preceding World War II, it was after 1945 that the new aesthetic, rooted in experimentation, optimism and the embrace of new technology, truly blossomed. Designers like Charles and Ray Eames applied innovative wartime materials and production methods to peacetime use, working with molded plywood, fiberglass, wire mesh and synthetic resins. Artists working in traditional craft media, like the potter Edith Heath and the furniture designer Sam Maloof, experimented with novel methods of production to make their work more accessible to the new middle classes who were flocking to the state in droves, lured by its booming postwar economy.
A full-scale re-creation of a section of the Eameses' Case Study House #8 - their own house in Pacific Palisades - is a showstopper. The Eames Foundation lent hundreds of objects to the exhibition, which gives visitors a rare up-close look into the couple's airy, open living room. Furnishings of their own design and the eclectic items they collected are displayed just as they were during the Eameses' lifetimes, providing an extraordinary window into the legendary duo's world.
From fashion and film title designs to aerodynamic automobile design, California's innovators had an impact on every aspect of life in the Golden State and beyond. "My parents owned these!" was a comment I heard more than a few times as I made my way through the exhibition. What was most surprising to me, however, was that the majority of designs on view are just as fresh today as they were more than 50 years ago, and that they continue to inspire the way we live in California. If you don't have a chance to see this remarkable exhibition, the accompanying catalog is certain to be an indispensable resource for design enthusiasts for years to come.

HEADLINE: Avoiding the Growth Trap

BYLINE: JAY GOLTZ


HIGHLIGHT: I have learned one important lesson of entrepreneurship: just because you can doesn't mean you should. 

 BODY:
I was fascinated by the recent case study in The Times about a Seattle-based retailer that decided to open a location on the other side of the country. The piece hit home with me because we've often had similar conversations here.
My home furnishing store, Jayson Home, has gotten a lot of attention for its mix of merchandise and the way it is displayed. While the business was certainly affected by the economy and the housing crisis, its sales have been growing for the last few years. We are about to unleash a new Web site, and we are always getting flattering reviews in home decor magazines and on blogs. It is very tempting to think about opening another location, and we have crunched the numbers. But I have resisted, because I have a very different view and understanding of growth than I used to.
When I started my business, I was determined to grow as fast as I could. And I did. The business doubled for a few years, and then continued to grow at double-digit rates. It was quite exhilarating, and exhausting. The words growing and business are often said together like soup and sandwich. Why would you want one without the other? Whether it is to fulfill a dream, to get wealthy, or to create opportunity for your staff, it seems like the natural and ambitious thing to do. These days, it might even be the thing to do since a growing business will create much-needed jobs. And it makes sense -- until it doesn't make sense. 
It really comes down to priorities. Do you want to take outside capital and the "partners" that come with it? Do you want to take on more risk? More employees? More travel? More stress? More potential aggravation? I've learned over the years that growth is a complicated animal. Many entrepreneurs just keep entrepreneuring without considering the consequences. It's hard to turn it off. I know, I am one of those entrepreneurs. And while I can't say that I have turned it off, I have turned it down. I think things through now. I have some rules of engagement. Maybe I have actually grown up! Probably not. But I have learned one important lesson of entrepreneurship: Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The most important word in business just might be no.
I regularly get calls from real estate agents who think they have the perfect location for another location for my home store. No. I regularly get approached by investment bankers who either say they have a buyer (probably fictional) or that they want to invest in my business. No. I get solicitations to buy other businesses. No. (All right, ). It gets back to my rules of engagement. I don't want to answer to anyone except my customers, my employees and my family. No investors. No landlords. I don't want to be forced to travel more. And, finally, I have figured out that I need more money less than I need more aggravation, which, happily, is at an all-time low.
I have also figured out that business is not just about growth. For one thing, it is also about making a profit, which many companies seem to forget as they grow themselves out of business. Business is also about understanding the reality that bad things happen: recessions, lawsuits, uncollected receivables, new competitors, and assorted calamities like fire, flood and other biblical afflictions. Choosing to over-expand instead of being prepared for this kind of stuff can put the company in jeopardy. It happens all of the time -- especially in an economy like we have now.
Sometimes, slowing down the growth is the safer and more responsible thing to do. But that can be boring -- and that can be a problem, not just for me but for some of my staff. Terms like economies of scale and synergy get thrown around like catnip to the entrepreneurial cat: More buying power! No more advertising needed! No additional buyers! All resulting in a larger marginal profit!
But I respond with my own terms: More travel! An expensive new lease! More money to lose if the economy tanks again! And last but not least, the most important word in business: I need to know why exactly I should take the risk. For the money? Maybe yes, maybe no. It's important to remember that we just might money. For ego? That's always a bad reason. How many entrepreneurs have become financially successful at the cost of their health, family or sanity?
It comes down to not only figuring out what your priorities are but also to recognizing your limitations. is a word that an entrepreneur in the chase is loath to accept. But we all have limitations, which does not mean you can't be wealthy, happy and wise. So will we expand? Will we take on some new challenges? Maybe. Probably. But I won't even think about it until: I have the money to burn. And I have the right people in place to handle the additional responsibilities.
These days, I look before I leap. It is a new concept for me.

HEADLINE: Venture Capitalists Debate Start-Up Environment

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: A Wall Street Journal article has ignited a heated debate on Twitter about a dearth of funds for start-ups, with several venture capitalists quick to disagree with the characterization of a "cash crunch." 

 BODY:
Is Silicon Valley facing a cash crunch?
Venture capitalists are weighing in on the latest assessment of the start-up environment. A Wall Street Journal article said capital was drying up for the earliest-stage start-ups, leading to a major drop in valuations and leading some start-ups to scramble for bridge financing.
"As the number of tiny Web companies riding the frenzy has mushroomed, some in recent weeks have found it tough to procure new funding," the newspaper reported.
The article ignited a fierce debate on Twitter, with several venture capitalists quick to disagree with the characterization of a "cash crunch." Chris Sacca, founder of the venture firm Lowercase Capital, said "valuations are still high." Although he said individual investors might be pulling back, "S.V. grade start-ups are still getting deals done at crazy prices."
Another venture investor, Mark Suster, said the crunch was "coming," but he had not seen it yet, "#JustOneDataPoint," he noted.
Naval Ravikant, the founder of AngelList, a marketplace that connects founders and investors, defended his comments. He admitted that "top tier deals" were hot, but said he saw the "bottom falling out" on lower-end deals. "Make your own sub-prime analogy," he added.
"Early stages of decline, IMHO. Asks high, bid low, median deal not clearing as fast," he sent in another Tweet.
"The last batch of startups we funded are just finishing raising money now and I haven't seen any signs of valuations decreasing," Paul Graham, the founder of start-up incubator Y-Combinator told DealBook in an e-mail. "It's possible YC is somehow insulating startups we fund from a general downward trend."
The crux of all the Tweet-slinging was the question of whether all the economic woes -- the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, high unemployment, etc. -- was starting to put a major squeeze on the venture industry. Market volatility has put a damper on initial public offerings, which tend to sneeze at the first sign of shakiness in stocks.
But the effect seems more uneven in Silicon Valley's investment world, which is a mosaic of large venture capital firms, major angel investors and what the Fortune reporter Dan Primack calls "angel tourists," individual investors who dabble in technology investing but are highly vulnerable to market dips. With markets still jittery, many of these "angel tourists" may hit the pause button for now, which could narrow the pool of capital available for the youngest start-ups.
But beyond the fickle economic winds, there is a larger issue. What will happen to the hundreds of start-ups that managed to get funding over the last two years, buoyed by the euphoria for the Web and the avalanche of new investors. As Fred Wilson, partner at Union Square Ventures, noted on his blog, "I'm waiting for the guy who sits at the front desk in our building to pass me a business plan on my way into the office."
The challenge here extends beyond the immediate, macrofinancial woes.
Of the hundreds of new start-ups, only a fraction will be winners, given the market's natural churn. The best ideas will win follow-on rounds of funding-- certainly many continue to do so at lofty valuations-- and the rest will inevitably struggle.
As DealBook's Kevin Roose reported in "Some Tech Start-Ups Struggle in Rising Tide of Fund-Raising," this problem is compounded by a tightening in the expansion rounds, a trend that has been apparent for some time. Though there is still a significant pool of capital at the seed stage (even with the fickleness of "tourist angels") and at the very senior rounds (when companies seem almost-home-runs), many venture capitalists say there is notably less money available in the middle, typically the second or third fund-raising rounds.
Further exacerbating this issue is another trend in the venture capital industry. While the biggest firms have raised billions from limited partners this year, many venture capital firms have struggled to raise money for several quarters.
"L.P.'s (that's what we call our investors) are all chasing that top 10 percent to 20 percent, and that leaves 80 percent to 90 percent of the V.C. firms struggling to raise money," writes Mr. Wilson. He noted, however, that emerging managers were finding capital.
"I'd rather be a new firm raising a first fund," he said, "than a mediocre firm raising fund five right now."
As more start-ups reach the hill, many venture capitalists see more pain on the horizon.
But as another venture capitalist, Bryce Roberts, explained in a recent blog post, that is not exactly a bad thing.
"Somewhere in this rush to seed 10s of thousands of companies, it seems the purpose of a seed round has gotten lost," he said. "The intent of seeding something isn't simply to get it going -- most of the companies we see seeking seed funding have something demonstrable. Nor is seed funding simply done because it's the cool thing to do these days -- the cool factor wears off quickly once the sleeves get rolled up. No, seed funding is a different kind of animal. Seed funding is for validating and derisking, not scaling."
He added: "The pig is passing through the python -- the pig is growing by the day and the python is shrinking. Follow-on capital will become less and less available over the coming quarters so validate, derisk and plan accordingly."

HEADLINE: Report Highlights Gap in Student Spending by Public and Private Colleges

BYLINE: REBECCA R. RUIZ


HIGHLIGHT: A recently released report highlights the spending patterns of public and private colleges and universities over the last decade. 

 BODY:
The Delta Project, an independent research organization focused on college affordability, released a report last month that charts trends in university spending from 1999 to 2009.
The report, which was noted this week in a Web posting by Michael Kirst of Stanford University, emphasizes that the institutions of higher education that enroll the most students tend to spend the least on their students' schooling. The report cites community colleges as evidence of that point:
In 2009, community colleges educated over 6.5 million students - the single biggest sector nationwide, serving over a third of all students - yet spent about $10,000 per student annually, an amount less than any other type of college or university.
Private research institutions, while typically charging higher tuition rates than other types of colleges, spend, far and away, the most money on their students' education, the report concludes.
In its report, the Delta Project stresses that the disparity between what a private college and a public community college spend on their students has increased significantly in recent years: "Over the past decade, higher education in the United States has grown increasingly stratified," the report's authors write.

Meanwhile, as readers of The Choice are well aware, tuition at all types of institutions has increased in recent years. The Delta Project reports that the rates of tuition increase over the last decade have far outpaced the rates of inflation, per capita personal income and most major commodities.
Public colleges in particular have raised their tuition sharply since the early 2000s, the report notes, due to "sharp declines in state appropriations following the 2001 recession and the failure of appropriations to return to prerecession levels."
But the percentage increase - as opposed to the raw dollar increase - in public college tuition can be deceiving:
While tuitions in the public sector rose at a higher percentage rate than those in the private sector, the actual dollar increases for public colleges and universities were much lower. For example, the sticker price for public research universities rose 56 percent between 1999 and 2009, amounting to an average increase of $2,486. During the same time period, tuition at private research universities "only" rose 32 percent, but this equaled an average increase of $7,380. A similar pattern holds for public and private master's institutions.
The greatest expense for any college, the report notes, is employee compensation, which accounts for 60 percent to 70 percent of all higher education spending.
In response to the scale of that expense, all types of colleges have boosted their use of part-time faculty or graduate assistant instructors over the last decade.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street's 'Political Disobedience'

BYLINE: BERNARD E. HARCOURT


HIGHLIGHT: The Wall Street protests represent a refusal to engage the worn-out ideologies rooted in the Cold War. 

 BODY:
Our language has not yet caught up with the political phenomenon that is emerging in Zuccotti Park and spreading across the nation, though it is clear that a political paradigm shift is taking place before our very eyes. It's time to begin to name and in naming, to better understand this moment. So let me propose some words: "political disobedience."
Occupy Wall Street is best understood, I would suggest, as a new form of what could be called "political disobedience," as opposed to civil disobedience, that fundamentally rejects the political and ideological landscape that we inherited from the Cold War.
Civil disobedience accepted the legitimacy of political institutions, but resisted the moral authority of resulting laws. Political disobedience, by contrast, resists the very way in which we are governed: it resists the structure of partisan politics, the demand for policy reforms, the call for party identification, and the very ideologies that dominated the post-War period.
Occupy Wall Street, which identifies itself as a "leaderless resistance movement with people of many political persuasions," is politically disobedient precisely in refusing to articulate policy demands or to embrace old ideologies. Those who incessantly want to impose demands on the movement may show good will and generosity, but fail to understand that the resistance movement is precisely about disobeying that kind of political maneuver. Similarly, those who want to push an ideology onto these new forms of political disobedience, like Slavoj Zizek or Raymond Lotta, are missing the point of the resistance.
When Zizek complained last August, writing about the European protesters in the London Review of Books, that we've entered a "post-ideological era" where "opposition to the system can no longer articulate itself in the form of a realistic alternative, or even as a utopian project, but can only take the shape of a meaningless outburst," he failed to understand that these movements are precisely about resisting the old ideologies. It's not that they couldn't articulate them; it's that they are them - they are being politically disobedient.
And when Zizek now declares at Zuccotti Park "that our basic message is 'We are allowed to think about alternatives' . . . What social organization can replace capitalism?" - again, he is missing a central axis of this new form of political resistance.
One way to understand the emerging disobedience is to see it as a refusal to engage these sorts of worn-out ideologies rooted in the Cold War. The key point here is that the Cold War's ideological divide - with the Chicago Boys at one end and the Maoists at the other - merely served as a weapon in this country for the financial and political elite: the ploy, in the United States, was to demonize the chimera of a controlled economy (that of the former Soviet Union or China, for example) in order to prop up the illusion of a free market and to legitimize the fantasy of less regulation - of what was euphemistically called "deregulation." By reinvigorating the myth of free markets, the financial and political architects of our economy over the past three plus decades - both Republicans and Democrats - were able to disguise massive redistribution toward the richest by claiming they were simply "deregulating" when all along they were actually reregulating to the benefit of their largest campaign donors.
This ideological fog blinded the American people to the pervasive regulatory mechanisms that are necessary to organize a colossal late-modern economy and that necessarily distribute wealth throughout society - and in this country, that quietly redistributed massive amounts of wealth to the richest 1 percent. Many of the voices at Occupy Wall Street accuse political ideology on both sides, on the side of free markets but also on the side of big government, for serving the few at the expense of the other 99 percent - for paving the way to an entrenched permissive regulatory system that "privatizes gains and socializes losses."
The central point, of course, is that it takes both a big government and the illusion of free markets to achieve such massive redistribution. If you take a look at the tattered posters at Zuccotti Park, you'll see that many are intensely anti-government and just as many stridently oppose big government.
Occupy Wall Street is surely right in holding the old ideologies to account. The truth is, as I've argued in a book, "The Illusion of Free Markets," and recently in Harper's magazine, there never have been and never will be free markets. All markets are man-made, constructed, regulated and administered by often-complex mechanisms that necessarily distribute wealth - that distribute wealth - in large and small ways. Tax incentives for domestic oil production and lower capital gains rates are obvious illustrations. But there are all kinds of more minute rules and regulations surrounding our wheat pits, stock markets and economic exchanges that have significant wealth effects: limits on retail buyers flipping shares after an I.P.O., rulings allowing exchanges to cut communication to non-member dealers, fixed prices in extended after-hour trading, even the advent of options markets. The mere existence of a privately chartered organization like the Chicago Board of Trade, which required the state of Illinois to criminalize and forcibly shut down competing bucket shops, has huge redistributional wealth effects on farmers and consumers - and, of course, bankers, brokers and dealers.
The semantic games - the talk of deregulation rather than reregulation - would have been entertaining had it not been for their devastating effects. As the sociologist Douglas Massey minutely documents in "Categorically Unequal," after decades of improvement, the income gap between the richest and poorest in this country has dramatically widened since the 1970s, resulting in what social scientists now refer to as U-curve of increasing inequality. Recent reports from the Census Bureau confirm this, with new evidence last month that "the number of Americans living below the official poverty line, 46.2 million people, was the highest number in the 52 years the bureau has been publishing figures on it." Today, 27 percent of African-Americans and 26 percent of Hispanics in this country - more than 1 in 4 - live in poverty; and 1 in 9 African-American men between the ages of 20 and 34 are incarcerated.
It's these outcomes that have pushed so many in New York City and across the nation to this new form of political disobedience. It's a new type of resistance to politics - to making policy demands, to playing the political games, to partisan politics, to old-fashioned ideology. It bears a similarity to what Michel Foucault referred to as "critique:" resistance to being governed "in this manner," or what he dubbed "voluntary insubordination" or, better yet, as a word play on the famous expression of Etienne de la Boetie, "voluntary unservitude."
If this concept of "political disobedience" is accurate and resonates, then Occupy Wall Street will continue to resist making a handful of policy demands because it would have little effect on the constant regulations that redistribute wealth to the top. The movement will also continue to resist Cold War ideologies from Friedrich Hayek to Maoism - as well as their pale imitations and sequels, from the Chicago School 2.0 to Alain Badiou and Zizek's attempt to shoehorn all political resistance into a "communist hypothesis."
On this account, the fundamental choice is no longer the ideological one we were indoctrinated to believe - between free markets and controlled economies - but rather a continuous choice between and how they distribute wealth in society. There is, in the end, no "realistic alternative," nor any "utopian project" that can avoid the pervasive regulatory mechanisms that are necessary to organize a complex late-modern economy - and that's the point. The vast and distributive regulatory framework will neither disappear with deregulation, nor with the withering of a socialist state. What is required is constant vigilance of all the micro and macro rules that permeate our markets, our contracts, our tax codes, our banking regulations, our property laws - in sum, all the ordinary, often mundane, but frequently invisible forms of laws and regulations that are required to organize and maintain a colossal economy in the 21st-century and that constantly distribute wealth and resources.
In the end, if the concept of "political disobedience" accurately captures this new political paradigm, then the resistance movement needs to occupy Zuccotti Park because levels of social inequality and the number of children in poverty are intolerable. Or, to put it another way, the movement needs to resist partisan politics and worn-out ideologies because the outcomes have become simply unacceptable. The Volcker rule, debt relief for working Americans, a tax on the wealthy - those might help, but they represent no more than a few drops in the bucket of regulations that distribute and redistribute wealth and resources in this country every minute of every day. Ultimately, what matters to the politically disobedient is the kind of society we live in, not a handful of policy demands.

HEADLINE: Rent vs. Buy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: For the first time in 30 years, the median monthly mortgage payment is about the same as the median rental payment. 

 BODY:
For years my colleague David Leonhardt has been helping people calculate whether it makes more sense to rent or buy a home,based on the relative costs of each decision. This week, the economists at Capital Economics noticed an interesting phenomenon related to this tradeoff. For the first time in three decades, the median monthly mortgage payment is about the same as the median rental payment:
Of course, this chart is a little bit misleading because it excludes many of the upfront expenses of buying a home, like a down payment and closing costs. Perhaps more important, not everyone has the option to buy.
Credit conditions are still significantly tighter than they were a few years ago, despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to loosen credit markets. Many lenders now require a credit score of 700 as opposed to 650, the previous standard. Capital Economics estimates that that requirement alone has shut 13 million households out of the mortgage market.

HEADLINE: 9 Are Arrested at Protest at Foreclosure Auction

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Instead of offering bids on distressed properties, about a dozen demonstrators sang gospel-style songs against the foreclosure process. Then came the handcuffs. 

 BODY:
It was just after 3 p.m. Thursday in a second-floor courtroom in Brooklyn when an auctioneer announced to a crowd of about 60 people that she would begin selling foreclosed properties.
"Stand up and state your name and your bid in a loud and clear voice," she instructed those in the gallery, then offered a property on Fulton Street that was being foreclosed upon by a company called Instant Capital.
A moment later, several voices sounded. But they were not making bids. They belonged to about a dozen men and women who had entered the courtroom with the goal of obstructing the auction. 
In unison, they sang a gospel-style song:
By the end of the demonstration, nine of them were led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. 
The interruption in business as usual at the State Supreme Court building on Adams Street was staged by Organizing for Occupation, a coalition of housing advocacy groups that recently helped halt the eviction of an 82-year-old woman in Bedford-Stuyvesant in a foreclosure proceeding that the woman and her supporters said resulted unjustly from a subprime loan. 
The group, whose ranks on Thursday included some protesters moonlighting from Occupy Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, said in a statement that it was protesting "a system designed to benefit financial lending institutions at the expense of homeowners and low-income communities." It has demanded an end to foreclosure proceedings until the State Legislature passes laws that better protect homeowners.
As the protesters continued singing, court officers and court employees conferred. After about 10 minutes of being serenaded a lieutenant announced: "You are disrupting a court proceeding. If you don't stop now you will be removed from the courtroom."
The singers stood and began clapping as they continued to harmonize. The auctioneer sat with her hands folded beneath her chin and watched the singers. Some in the gallery left the courtroom; others entered to see what was going on.
Just before 3:30, court officers announced that anyone who did not clear the courtroom would be arrested. Most of the crowd got up and departed, but about 10 singers remained. A moment later, they emerged from the courtroom into a corridor, cuffed, escorted by court officers and still singing.
Arlene Hackel, a spokeswoman for the state's Office of Court Administration, said that nine people were arrested and given summonses for disorderly conduct.
Outside the courthouse, close to 100 supporters waited for news of those who had been arrested.
Inside, spectators and would-be bidders sat on wooden benches in a hallway as they waited for the auction to resume. Among them was Michael Nicholas, 50, from Ridgewood, Queens, who said that he had been attending foreclosure auctions in Brooklyn for a decade but had never before witnessed a choir take over the courtroom.
"I was expecting the auction to begin," he said. "Then instead I got the chorus line."

HEADLINE: From Canada to Meetup.com, the Journey of a Protest Meme

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Sparked by a Canadian magazine, the many iterations of the Occupy movement have found cohesion online. 

 BODY:
It began with an e-mail on July 13.
That's when Adbusters, the anticorporate magazine based in Vancouver, British Columbia, sent a "tactical briefing" to an e-mail list of roughly 90,000 supporters calling for the occupation of Wall Street, employing the Twitter hashtag #occupywallstreet and setting the date for the first protesters to set up camp in downtown Manhattan.
"We sparked it," Kalle Lasn, 69, the editor in chief of Adbusters, said in a phone interview on Thursday. But, he added, "what they've done up until now -- with a leaderless movement that is all-inclusive -- that's given them a kind of mystique that has launched a national conversation."
The text of that initial call can still be found on the magazine's Web site, which has been filled with photos and videos from protests large and small this month. Mr. Lasn said the magazine's circulation, now roughly 100,000, had grown in the weeks since protesters first took over Zuccotti Park on the Adbusters-selected date of Sept. 17.
"We started planning for it and our art department came up with the poster of the ballerina posing on top of the bull," he said, a reference to a pull-out poster published in the September/October issue of the magazine, which hit newsstands in the United States in mid-July. 
Two days after the start of the Occupy Wall Street protests and thousands of miles away in Nebraska, the movement began to gain online cohesion independent of the magazine.
A 25-year-old artist and designer in Nebraska, foiled in her attempt to travel to New York and take part in the protest, created a simple digital hub for the proliferating Facebook and Twitter accounts calling for the occupation of central squares in other cities. 
"Wow, it would be really great if there was a Web site that collected information about all of these," the designer, Ella, said she recalled thinking. (She asked to be referred to only by her first name to minimize the harassment she receives via e-mail.) 
She and her fiance threw together a page in "a few hours" and called it Occupy Together. Employing a simple design from the blogging service WordPress and the Gotham Bold font -- most famously used by President Obama during his 2008 campaign -- the design appears to have been emulated by others attempting to organize in dozens of cities, including Portland, Ore.; Boston; and Seattle. That was the point, she said.
"We don't even lay claim to it -- we feel like we're all just part of this bigger thing," said Ella, who is currently unemployed. "I've been directly affected, and I have a daughter who is 8." 
The site is operated by a team of six volunteers -- four in Nebraska, one in California and another in New Jersey -- and has attempted to amass updated information on every city with a protest. Ella said they had been in frequent contact with protesters in Wall Street, but their task from the beginning was to create a reliable, verified directory of all the other protests nationwide.
It soon proved overwhelming -- "they just keep popping up" -- and Ella said she reached out to Micha White, a senior Adbusters editor based in Berkeley, Calif., for help. 
At roughly the same time, Scott Heiferman, the founder of Meetup, also approached the magazine. "Personally, I have some connection to those guys," he said. "They made an introduction to Occupy Together."
The site then began using Meetup as a way for those interested in emulating the protests on Wall Street to find each other in more places. 
Ella said she faced some resistance from online organizers because many did not want to sign up for and use another service in addition to the usual catalog of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, blogging and live-streaming sites, and because the information on individual events would no longer be verified. Even so, there are currently more than 1,400 cities listed. "They're using it as a means to test the waters to see who else is interested in their area," she said.
Mr. Heiferman commended their efforts. "It's the fastest-growing thing we've seen on Meetup," he said. Though Mr. Heiferman has given small donations to a fund for the protesters' newspaper, The Occupied Wall Street Journal, he is quick to draw a line between his personal activities and the company he runs.
Mr. Heiferman said that although he had a personal interest in Occupy Together, Meetup was a politically neutral tool. "We believe that whenever people are organizing and getting together, that's a good thing," he said. "I met with Glenn Beck last year." 
An article in Reuters on Thursday looked into financial supporters for the protest movement, finding what it said was a loose connection between Adbusters and the Tides Center, a group supported by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros: 
Disclosure documents also show Tides, which declined comment, gave Adbusters grants of $185,000 from 2001-2010, including nearly $26,000 between 2007-2009.
Aides to Soros say any connection is tenuous and that Soros has never heard of Adbusters. Soros himself declined comment.
Mr. Lasn, the Adbusters editor, denied receiving any money from Mr. Soros. 
"We do have a relation with Tides -- it's just a conduit" for money from small donors, he said. "There has been no direct funding from George Soros or anybody like that." 
The magazine continues to be active in the Occupy movement and has suggested the date of Oct. 29 for a major event. "That would be a good moment to have the first demand coming out of this movement," he said. "This is what we're trying to trigger now. A global Tahrir movement."

HEADLINE: Debating a Labor Contract on Facebook

BYLINE: NICK BUNKLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Auto workers at Ford are discussing the merits of a proposed settlement not only at union halls and factories, but also on Facebook. 

 BODY:
DETROIT - As Ford's 41,000 hourly workers weigh the merits of their proposed four-year contract in plants and union halls across the United States this week, their debates have spilled onto Facebook, providing a glimpse into which issues are influencing their votes most.
For the first time, the United Automobile Workers union has been using social media to communicate with its members during the contract talks in Detroit, and the most intense back-and-forth has occurred in the last few days, as ratification voting got under way at Ford.
Some bemoaned the lack of a wage increase while Ford's two top executives got bonuses totaling about $100 million. Others criticized the continuation of a two-tier wage scale.
Even those who said they supported the deal acknowledged being unhappy with many portions of it. Some suggested the deal would be much better received if it covered just two years instead of four, so the terms could be revisited sooner.

One of the union staff members who administer the "U.A.W. Ford Department" page and worked closely with the bargaining team during talks, conceded that the agreement was less than ideal but argued that circumstances did not allow for anything better.
"In 2015 we will do better," the post said. "This is not the last agreement we will ever settle and hopefully our economy, our image, and our ability to bargain with a bigger stick will be better in the future. But this is not the time to wage this war."
As it became apparent that more workers were voting "no," talk turned to the possibility of a strike as soon as next week.
A man who identified himself as working in the body shop of Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, said the mood had become "somber and quiet" there.
A few workers noted that Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, was an executive at Boeing during a 69-day strike in 1995, saying that the deal that workers at that company eventually approved was worse than the one they rejected to begin the walkout.
A Ford worker in Louisville expressed concern that any gains made by a strike against Ford would be overshadowed by wages lost while on the picket lines. The U.A.W. pays its members $200 a week for strike duty, roughly one-fifth of full wages.
The U.A.W. had posted updates to Facebook on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings indicating that early voting was around 50-50.

HEADLINE: Oct. 13, 1943 | Italy Switches Sides in World War II

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Oct. 13, 1943, one month after Italy surrendered to Allied forces, it declared war on Nazi Germany, its onetime Axis powers partner. 

 BODY:
On Oct. 13, 1943, one month after Italy surrendered to Allied forces, it declared war on Nazi Germany, its onetime Axis powers partner.
Italy was led into the war by Benito Mussolini, the fascist prime minister who had formed an alliance with Nazi Germany in 1936. In the summer of 1943, as Allied forces landed in Sicily, public support for the war and for Mussolini diminished. Mussolini was ousted on July 25 and his replacement, Gen. Pietro Badoglio, sought peace with the Allies, and reached an armistice on Sept. 3.
Germany, which had troops stationed throughout Italy, proceeded with an occupation of the country, and seized strongholds from a disorganized Italian military. In the Oct. 14 New York Times, the correspondent Milton Bracker noted that the Allied leadership believed that the Italian military would be of use in driving out the Germans: "Italian hatred of the Germans unquestionably grew as the fighting spirit waned, and episodes between German and Italian soldiers and civilians before and after the armistice have shown pretty clearly a complete and incontrovertible end of all sympathy between the former Axis partners. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to take advantage of the Italians' willingness, even eagerness, to pin their hopes of a better role in the peace settlement to the status of co-belligerency now."
Allied forces advanced slowly and arduously north through the Italian peninsula before finally defeating Nazi forces in May 1945. Mussolini, who was rescued by the Nazis from an Italian prison and made the leader of a puppet state, the Italian Social Republic, in parts of Italy not occupied by Allied forces, was captured and executed by members of the Italian Partisan Resistance.

With the passing of time and the creation of modern political and economic alliances like the Group of 8, the wartime and postwar tensions between the former Allied and Axis powers of the World War II might now be considered a distant memory.

HEADLINE: The Next Boom in Mobile Devices Is the Car

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: Expect to see new services and devices in cars and an explosion of business models that will go with the connected cars. 

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Cars, one of the great mobile devices to begin with, are about to get connected to the Internet like never before. It will change not just how we drive, but the economics of the car business.
 "Five percent of cars are connected today," said Glenn Lurie, president of AT&T's Emerging Devices business. He was speaking of new vehicles, not all cars on the road. "Three to five years from now, 100 percent will be connected. You'll see diagnostics, calls when the airbag goes off, real-time traffic reports, entertainment in the back seat."
Mr. Lurie was at CTIA, a wireless industry gathering in San Diego. On Tuesday, General Motors's Cadillac unit showed off a luxury car platform, called Cue, which will appear in three car models in 2012. In addition to the safety monitoring features, the version shown in the Cadillac XTS featured an 8-inch touch screen that displayed maps, climate controls, weather and text messaging, among other things. It was possible to plug a smartphone in the car in order to have the messages read aloud. 
Ford has shown a similar entertainment system, as well as monitoring and information systems for its electric cars, so drivers can find the nearest charging station. AT&T works with Ford, as well as BMW and Nissan, and talks with lots of other manufacturers. 
What he sees as much as anything is an explosion of business models that will go with the connected cars. Should the devices cost more up front, or be discounted in exchange for service plans, the way cellphones are? How about engine diagnostics that tell you when to bring the car in, and can even schedule a visit during a down time for the service center, fetching a better price? Should phones and cars work together, through AT&T, to make real-time maps of traffic conditions?
"We have 100 million probes out there" in the form of consumers using mobile phones on the network, Mr. Lurie said. "There will be all kinds of models - put it in the price, give it away for the first year, sell it by the month." The effect on the car business, he said, will be "a watershed." 
Cars are not the only vehicles getting connected. AT&T's business solutions group has worked with manufacturers of tractors to enable wireless monitoring of engine data, and with crane makers, to measure use and inform people when goods are loaded. Sometimes the company makes money by shipping the data, sometimes it works as a consultant, figuring out what part of the business should get networked.
Many of these projects have been multimillion-dollar ventures, years in the planning. Mr. Lurie thinks that the next step may be more grassroots, as smaller companies figure out how to repurpose existing devices, like the iPod, to work in new environments.
"What will be more innovative than people realize is the accessories business," he said. "What kind of cradle does the device fit into in the home, or the office or the car?" The tablet may spend part of its day as a picture frame on an office desk, he said, and later be hooked into the screens of an online multiplayer game. "Apple and Samsung will do things," he said, "but so will innovative third parties."

HEADLINE: Is the Herman Cain Surge for Real?

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain's sudden rise in popularity has people wondering how seriously to take his chances in the presidential race. 

 BODY:
The question that everyone is asking about Herman Cain right now is very simple: Is his surge in the presidential race for real?
Mr. Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, does not follow any of the traditional rules of presidential politics. He has no political experience. His campaign has raised almost no money and as a result has virtually no staff or infrastructure. There is no likelihood of a big television campaign since there is no money to pay for one. And Mr. Cain appears to make few of the tactical calculations that drive most presidential campaigns.
Next week, he is campaigning in Tennessee - where Republican primary voters are not due to vote until well into 2012. 
And yet, Mr. Cain has been surging in the polls - not just among the conservative faithful who attend political conferences, but also among regular Republican voters who get called by pollsters.
Polls can be fleeting things and they capture only a moment in time, as the once-high ratings of Donald Trump, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have shown. But the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Mr. Cain atop the field, effectively tied with the veteran front-runner, Mitt Romney, and ahead of the newcomer, Mr. Perry. 
"You know you must be doing something right when you get a lot or arrows in your back," Mr. Cain said Wednesday during a speech to New Hampshire lawmakers. "But this is the first time that arrows have felt really, really good."
Mr. Cain's supporters will no doubt point to the poll (and others which have recently shown Mr. Cain doing well in Iowa and New Hampshire) as evidence that the former pizza king should be treated like a top-tier candidate.
And he has offered a concrete economic plan - his now famous "9-9-9" plan to establish a new system of flat taxes - that has the political advantage of being simple to describe and understand.
There are potential pitfalls to the "9-9-9" proposal. For one, many conservatives are wary of a new, national sales tax, fearing that it will be abused by politicians in Washington. But the simplicity of the plan makes it easy to describe, especially in contrast to Mr. Romney's 59-point treatise. 
The result is likely to be a renewed interest in Mr. Cain's background and his proposals as news organizations and Mr. Cain's rivals try to understand what makes him tick. A story in Thursday's New York Times looks at the economist who helped Mr. Cain develop his economic plan.
That attention is not without its downsides, as Mr. Cain is already discovering.
He seemed particularly grumpy at Tuesday night's debate in New Hampshire as his rivals and the moderators repeatedly criticized his tax plan, questioning its fairness and effectiveness. After Jon Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, joked that the plan sounded like the price of a pizza, the audience laughed. Mr. Cain did not.
There are real questions about how - and whether - Mr. Cain can translate his newfound popularity into votes when the caucuses and primaries arrive.
Mr. Cain's rivals in Iowa say there is little evidence of even a nascent campaign there.
When Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, ran in 2007, his campaign operated on a shoestring, too. But he did spend a lot of time campaigning in the state, and he had an informal network of churches and homeschooling advocates working furiously for him as the caucus approached. Advisers to other Republicans in Iowa say they see no evidence of that for Mr. Cain, who has spent most of October on a book tour and is not scheduled to return to the state until the middle of November.
Like Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Cain appears to have little campaign infrastructure outside of Iowa. He did open an office in South Carolina this month, but with little money raised so far, he has not yet built an army of supporters in other states.
For months, Mr. Cain appeared content to participate in the Republican nomination contest with little pressure. He showed up at debates or events on the trail, said what he thought, and let the chips fall where they might.
Now, Mr. Cain will face scrutiny in a way that he has not so far. How he responds may help determine whether his campaign for the nomination becomes more real over the coming weeks.
In the meantime, an indication of how serious his campaign may be came from a completely unserious source.
On his "Late Show" on CBS, David Letterman made Mr. Cain the subject of his famous "Top Ten" list. Among the list's little known facts about Mr. Cain was No. 9: "Wants to add the inventor of the calzone to Mount Rushmore." And No. 1: "Chris Christie wants to be his running mate, just for the free pizza."
Political infrastructure aside, that may be the best evidence yet that Mr. Cain has arrived.

HEADLINE: Galleon Chief Sentenced to 11-Year Term in Insider Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The sentence handed down on Raj Rajaratnam, the former chief of the Galleon Group hedge fund, continues a trend of ever-stiffer penalties against white-collar criminals. 

 BODY:
9:14 p.m. | Updated 
The fallen hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam received the longest prison sentence ever for insider trading on Thursday, capping an aggressive government campaign that has ensnared dozens and may help deter the illegal use of confidential information on Wall Street.
Judge Richard J. Holwell of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced Mr. Rajaratnam, 54, the former head of the Galleon Group hedge fund, to 11 years in prison. A jury convicted Mr. Rajaratnam of securities fraud and conspiracy in May after a two-month trial.
"Insider trading is an assault on the free markets," said Judge Holwell, who also imposed a $10 million fine and ordered Mr. Rajaratnam to forfeit $53.8 million in ill-gotten profits. "His crimes reflect a virus in our business culture that needs to be eradicated."
The sentence was a watershed moment in a two-year push by federal prosecutors. Over that period, Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has brought charges against 54 people with insider trading crimes. Of those, 50 have been either pleaded guilty or have been convicted at trial. Three others' situations are pending, and the fourth is a fugitive.
Yet the crackdown on insider trading - a crime whose victims are not always apparent - has come at a time when many Americans have questioned why authorities have not pursued charges against bank executives over their role in the financial crisis, which still weighs on the economy.
With Mr. Rajaratnam, the government was willing to use novel ideas and hardball tactics to bring a case. For the first time in an insider trading investigation, the government used wiretaps to record traders' telephone conversations. Federal agents pressured traders to wear hidden microphones and record their calls to build their cases.
It remains to be seen whether the use of wiretaps and the stiff penalties will have a chilling effect on insider trading, but most legal experts say they will.
"No matter the crime, if the rewards are great enough, people will ignore the risk of getting caught," said Jonathan B. New, a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. "For people who think that insider trading isn't a serious crime or that the rewards outweigh the risks, these heavy sentences do send a powerful message to the contrary."
Still, at 11 years, the sentence lacks the symbolic heft of the 19 to 24 years prosecutors sought. Mr. Rajaratnam deserved an outsize penalty, said the federal prosecutor Reed Brodsky at Thursday's hearing, because his crimes were "brazen, pervasive and egregious," and, "There is no one who is Mr. Rajaratnam's equal in terms of the breadth and scope of his insider trading crimes."
Prosecutors accused Mr. Rajaratnam of using a corrupt network of well-placed tipsters - including former executives of Intel, I.B.M. and the consulting firm McKinsey & Company - to illicitly gain about $72 million through his stock trading.
Mr. Rajaratnam stood stone-faced as Judge Holwell read his sentence in a packed courtroom. Mr. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan native, who has not spoken publicly since his arrest in October 2009 and declined to testify at his trial, did not speak at the sentencing.
In imposing his sentence, Judge Holwell cited a number of mitigating factors. He said Mr. Rajaratnam's "good works figure into the equation," citing his financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Sept. 11 attacks.
The judge also disclosed that Mr. Rajaratnam had advanced diabetes that was leading to kidney failure, and said prison "is a more intense experience for people with serious health conditions."
Nevertheless, Mr. Rajaratnam's sentence continues a trend of ever-stiffer penalties against white-collar criminals. Legal experts say the increased prison terms are in part a result of federal sentencing guidelines passed in 1987 that link the length of a sentence to the dollar amount involved in the fraud. Historically, judges showed leniency when penalizing corporate criminals because they were not seen as a threat to society and perhaps because they empathized with people who often came from similar backgrounds as themselves. But gone, for the most part, are the days of slap-on-the-wrist sentences and "country club" prisons where white-collar defendants served short stints in relatively comfortable quarters.
Corporate wrongdoers have received record-length sentences in recent years. Bernard L. Madoff is serving 150 years for cheating investors in an epic Ponzi scheme. Lee B. Farkas, a former mortgage company executive, received 30 years for his role in a billion-dollar bank fraud scheme.
On the insider trading front, judges' penalties have also been severe. Zvi Goffer, a former trader at Galleon, received a 10-year prison term, matching the longest previous sentence for insider trading. The average sentence of the 13 other defendants connected to Mr. Rajaratnam's case has been about three years.
Legal experts say that because prison terms across all federal crimes have substantially increased over the last two decades, it stands to reason that the length of sentences for executives on Wall Street and in corporate America would also grow.
"Often the question is raised, 'Why shouldn't crime in the suites be punished as severely as crimes on the streets?' " said Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University. "While that sounds like a sound bite, it's an important question."
It is a question that played a crucial role in the debate over the appropriate prison term for Mr. Rajaratnam.
John Dowd, Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer, asked the judge to impose a sentence closer to six to eight years, noting that a stiffer penalty for Mr. Rajaratnam would be on a par with average sentences for violent crimes like kidnapping and sexual abuse.
Advocates of more lenient insider trading sentences also say the crime does not have any real identifiable victims, while other white-collar crimes like Ponzi schemes or corporate accounting frauds destroy lives and livelihoods.
When federal agents arrested Mr. Rajaratnam almost exactly two years ago, his case brought to mind the insider trading scandals of the 1980s. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, brought charges against Ivan Boesky and Michael R. Milken, two of the leading financiers of that era.
Mr. Rajaratnam represented a new breed of Wall Street power player: the hedge fund tycoon. Over the last decade, these money managers became among the most powerful players in global finance. As their influence and wealth grew - in 2009, Mr. Rajaratnam had a net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine - they attracted attention from regulators.
The government placed Mr. Rajaratnam at the center of what it billed as the largest hedge fund insider trading case ever brought. Prosecutors played at trial scores of phone conversations in which Mr. Rajaratnam exchanged illegal stock tips about companies like Goldman Sachs and Google with corporate insiders and fellow traders.
Those recorded calls are expected to be the focus of Mr. Rajaratnam's appeal, which will argue that the judge's decision to admit them as evidence was unauthorized by Congress and unconstitutional. Legal experts say the odds of a reversal are low because appeals courts show great deference to the trial court judge on this issue.
Mr. Rajaratnam must report within 45 days to the Bureau of Prisons, which will assign him to a facility. The judge said he would recommend that Mr. Rajaratnam serve his time at the federal medical center in Butner, N.C., part of the same complex where Mr. Madoff is incarcerated.
Despite the Justice Department's focus, insider trading has been something of a sideshow to the larger problems related to the global financial crisis. Insider trading at hedge funds - and the notion that the stock market is a rigged game - does not rate on the list of grievances from the anti-Wall Street protests spreading across the country.
"Unless people can identify lost money as a result of insider trading, or have had their savings stolen by Madoff, they don't view their own economic difficulties as being caused by a few bad apples," said Mr. Berman, the Ohio State law professor. "They see the problems with our economy and financial markets as far more systemic than that."

HEADLINE: Cold Pizza from Herm Cain

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan is a truly terrible idea. 

 BODY:
By almost any measure - social, political, economic, logical - Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan is nuts, nuts, nuts. Go ahead and jack up the price of nearly everything that moves in the United States with a 9 percent national sales tax on all new purchases and services. Talk about instant branding: every time you buy something, you'll be hit with the Herm Cain tax at the checkout line. 
And this is just the start. The nearly 50 million filers whose main federal tax is now a payroll deduction and not an income tax would see their overall bill from the government increase by nearly 100 percent. This conclusion comes from the economists and fact-checkers who have actually looked at the napkin sketch of a plan Cain got from some accountant friend of his in Cleveland. 
In essence, Cain is proposing the largest shift in tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class in the nation's history. Oh, and he apparently would scrap the two great government programs that keep millions clinging to fragile middle-class status - Social Security and Medicare - because he wants to eliminate the payroll taxes that now pay for those insurers of dignity.

We are forced to seriously consider this bizarro-world, reverse-Robin-Hood scheme, one that would junk the entire federal tax code for a 9 percent flat rate on corporate earnings, personal income and retail sales, because of the astonishing news that Republicans have elevated Cain to the top of their field in three polls released over the last 48 hours. 
Not to worry: fruit flies on a bad apple have a longer life than does a front-runner among Republican presidential candidates. Cain's reign will be short because his central plan is pure craziness, even for Republicans. 
Let's say you buy a new car or a week's worth of groceries, or pay $2,000 for your kid's dental work. Cain would add 9 percent to the price of those transactions - on top of the 9 percent in sales taxes people already pay in some states, like Washington, where I live. And if you're lower middle class, there would be no income tax offset - but an increase! 
That's the Cain platform: raise the price of everything in the worse economic crisis since the Great Depression.
So how did Cain float to the top, at least for a week? He's a motivational speaker, and a good one. He's glib, optimistic, likeable, and has a great personal story. But he has zero governing experience. And his business forte was running a national food chain, Godfather's, when they made truly awful-tasting pizzas. (I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on their post-Cain pizzas.)
Cain tops the polls because almost three-quarters of Republican primary voters cannot come around to their likely nominee, Mitt Romney. And the rest of the field lose voters every time they open their mouths. 
In Tuesday's debate, Newt Gingrich showed why he is a prevaricator with preternatural talent, finding new and creative ways to revive old and discredited lies. He trotted out the 2009 "lie of the year" winner by Politifact.com - that death panels would decide who gets to live under the new health care law.
He also called for jailing the congressional architects of a new law to curb the kind of uncontrolled manipulations by bankers and Wall Street traders that brought down the global economy. You heard that right: he doesn't want the people who dreamed up all those explosive credit default swaps and derivative trades to go to jail; he wants to incarcerate the reformers. 
Cain's ideas are actually worse: he would give Wall Street speculators more money. Under his plan, a billionaire now paying only 15 percent federal taxes on investment income - a lower rate, as Warren Buffett notes, than his secretary pays - would get a 40 percent reduction. 
Last month's frontrunner, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, offered up fresh material for the all-hat-no-cattle label he seems determined to wear. To his prior proclamations that evolution is "a theory that's out there," and global warming is a hoax, this dream candidate of Rush Limbaugh put the American Revolution in the 16th century. Amazing, the things Thomas Jefferson could do in his 235th year. 
Oh, but there were some critics of Cain-o-nomics. Michele Bachmann noted that the 9-9-9 design, turned upside down, was a Satanic 6-6-6. 
The power of his plan, Cain replies to all criticism, is its simplicity. "I can explain it in a minute!" he says. But someone who has taken more than a minute with 9-9-9 - Bruce Bartlett, the former economic adviser to Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush - has called it "insane." Read his examination in his Times blog here. 
Cain is unelectable, and his plan is toxic. This gets Republicans back to the one person they cannot yet get their arms around: Willard Mitt Romney, an unflappable technocrat with a Harvard M.B.A. who passed a bold socialist health care plan that is a model for the nation, and once professed that he would be stronger on gay rights than Teddy Kennedy. Bring on the general election.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:

        
The Obama administration isfacing a wave of skepticism about what it said was solid evidence of a sloppily arranged Iranian plot to murder Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States as Tehran officials on Wednesday furiously denied the government's involvement, Eric Schmitt and Scott Shane report. One of the suspects, an Iranian-American businessman from Texas, "appears to have been more a stumbling opportunist than a calculating terrorist," write Bobby Worth and Laura Tillman.
        
Administration officials say that the Obama administration plans to stick with its policy of pressure on the Iranian government, a response that appears at odds with its harsh calls for Iran to be held accountable, Mark Landler and Helene Cooper write.
        
The state visit of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea will highlightthe unusual rapport between Mr. Lee and President Obama, reports Mr. Landler. The president and first lady host a state dinner tonight with Mr. Lee and his wife, Kim Yoon-ok.
        
On the eve of the South Korean president's address to a joint session of Congress, the House and Senate on Wednesday passed long-awaited trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that experts say will have a negligible impact on the economy but will bolster relations with strategic allies, Jennifer Steinhauer and Binyamin Appelbaum report.
        
The strategy used to create new ads for Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a Democrat, could drastically change how lawmakers interact with the outside groups that campaign for them during the 2012 elections, when 33 Senate seats and all 435 House spots will be up for grabs, as Republican groups ask the Federal Election Committee to rule on the tactics, Eric Lichtblau writes.
        
Minutes from a recent Federal Reserve meeting show policymakers are increasingly at odds over how to help strengthen the economy without taking too much risk, Mr. Appelbaum reports.
        
Trip Gabriel and Susan Saulny look at how Herman Cain's triple-nine tax plan has invigorated his presidential campaign as the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows him leading the Republican field.
        
Monica Davey reports that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab admitted in court on Wednesday that he tried to blow up a plane bound for Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009 and pleaded guilty to all eight federal charges against him. Proponents of trying terror cases in civil courts say the surprising turn of events proves that approach is better than using military tribunals.
Happening in Washington:

        
At 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and the Census Bureau will deliver data on international trade for August. At 10, Freddie Mac releases weekly mortgage rates.
        
Obama administration officials will testify at 10 a.m. before the Senate Banking Committee on using economic sanctions to address threats from Iran.
        
Also at 10, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, discuss the future of national defense at a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Profit Falls 4%, to $4.26 Billion

BYLINE: ERIC DASH


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase kicked off the banking industry's earnings season, reporting that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter as a result of lingering mortgage troubles and weak investment banking results. 

 BODY:
8:57 p.m. | Updated 
Despite a paper gain that helped lift earnings by nearly $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase & Company reported on Thursday that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter amid lingering mortgage troubles and weak investment banking results.
Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States.
The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts' consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60.
Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. 
"It hasn't really strengthened, but the recovery is still here," Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday.
In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter.
The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter.
That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit.
Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank's results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth.
One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan's investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank's employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 - an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions.
As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses.
The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company.
Investors are so concerned about the banks' prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits.
What's more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies.
The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan's investment bank's results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank's large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets.
Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September.
Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. "We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails," he said.
Chase Home Lending, the bank's mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon.
"We don't expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers," Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. "It's hard not to be cautious."
On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion.
The bank's other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase's large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations.
JPMorgan's asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.

HEADLINE: Winners of Oprah Winfrey's 'Ultimate Favorite Things' Meet Their Beetles

BYLINE: PHIL PATTON


HIGHLIGHT: The cars were collected by 21 people who attended a taping last November of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," where the host gave the Beetles away. 

 BODY:
On Thursday morning, 21 people assembled in Orland Park, Ill., a southwest suburb of Chicago, to receive the keys to their 2012 Volkswagen Beetles. The cars were among 276 promised last November as surprise gifts to attendees at a special "Ultimate Favorite Things" studio taping of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," now discontinued.
Ms. Winfrey did not attend Thursday's event, but Jonathan Browning, the chief executive of Volkswagen of America, was on hand to reprise many of the talking points that brand executives have used to describe the redesigned Beetle, which is positioned as more masculine than its predecessor.
Though the crowd on Thursday, and indeed, the audience at last November's taping, was mostly women, Volkswagen's publicity staff offered a male attendee for an interview.
Leonardo Gilbert, 52, is the pastor of the "Sheldon Heights Church of Christ in Chicago. How did he regard the new car?
"As a blessing," he said via telephone. "It is going to be a blessing in this economy. I will use it as a second car, for errands and things."
Blessing or not, Mr. Gilbert initially had misgivings about his good fortune. The studio audience was privy only to a view of the new car's silhouette at the taping, and present in the studio was the car's more rounded predecessor, the New Beetle. Mr. Gilbert could not see himself in that car, he said, and was not sure about the new one until he picked a color -- silver.
"A lot of the ladies have red. I can't do red. Silver, O.K.," he said. Audience members were given a choice of Reflex Silver, Denim Blue, Saturn Yellow and Tornado Red.
"At first I was nervous," Mr. Gilbert added. "I wasn't sure this was a car a pastor could drive around the South Side of Chicago in, you know? I thought I might have to give it away. Well, I gave it to me."
The car's macho redesign ultimately pleased Mr. Gilbert. "Once I sat in it, it has a different feel about it," he said. "There is a certain manliness to it. The shape is straightened out. It is definitely wider, less of a bubble than it used to be."
"Oprah" producers and Volkswagen took care to shoulder the tax liability for the new cars, having learned from an earlier "Favorite Things" giveaway, where recipients of a new Pontiac G6 sedan were hit with tax bills of roughly $7,000 apiece.
Thursday's event took place as Beetles, now referred to simply as "all-new," rather than New, in VW's advertising, arrived at dealerships across the country.

HEADLINE: Militants Aided By Iran Fired At G.I.'s in Iraq, Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Militants trained and financed by Iran's Quds Force attacked United States forces in Iraq on Wednesday, American officials said, continuing a role they have played in recent years in a proxy war between the United States and Iran.
The attack came a day after the Obama administration announced that it had foiled an alleged plot by the Iranian group to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States and to bomb Saudi and Israeli embassies. 
The militants fired rockets at American forces at Contingency Operating Station Garry Owen in the southern province of Maysan, which borders Iran. The military said three soldiers were wounded in the assault at the station, which has been hit by rockets repeatedly this year as militants have increased attacks. The military provided few other details of the attack.
The Quds Force, little known in the United States until the assassination plot was revealed, is all too familiar to the military, American military officials here say.
The Shiite militias aligned with the group have killed many Iraqi civilians and security forces this year. And they have also proved to be the United States' most lethal enemy in Iraq since the American ''surge'' diminished the capacity of Sunni militants.
The Shiite militias -- which often employ rocket attacks and roadside bombings -- were responsible for the deaths of 13 of the 15 soldiers killed in June, the most deadly month for the United States in Iraq in the past three years. They are also responsible for a quarter of the assassinations of Iraqi government and military officials this year, according to American officials.
The Quds Force has one goal, according to the officials and analysts: weakening Iraq so it is even more dependent on Iran. Among the first steps in that process, they say, is severing the United States' relationship with the Iraqi government and keeping Iraq isolated from its neighbors.
''Anything they can do to cause separation between us and Iraq helps achieve their greater aims,'' said Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the United States military's spokesman in Iraq. ''Anything they can do to cause dissent or attack our forces and cause us to leave.''
Over the summer, these militias increased their operations as the United States and the Iraqi government began discussing whether to keep American troops after the end of the year. The discussions have not been completed.
The attacks dropped off after the Shiite-led Iraqi government cracked down on the militias under American pressure.
The Quds Force hopes that the Iranians will have an even freer hand to influence economic and political matters in Iraq and create a model similar to that of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-financed organization in Lebanon, United States military officials and analysts said.
''The Quds Force is the Iranian government's arm that deals directly with Iraq,'' said Kenneth M. Pollack, an expert on national security issues at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''Since 2006, all of Iran's relations and operations in Iraq have been in the Quds Force's portfolio.''
The Iranian ambassador to Iraq is a Quds Force officer, as was his predecessor. And this year, Quds Force officers have operated in Iraq, according to American officials, although few have been arrested or killed.
According to a senior American official, one of the top Quds Force officials the United States named in the latest assassination plot, Abdul Reza Shahlai, ''has a notorious past as one of the central architects of Iran's strategy in Iraq.'' (Some specialists on Iran have been skeptical of the administration's assertions on the planned attack, saying it seemed unlikely that Iran would back a brazen murder and bombing on American soil.)
The senior official said Mr. Shahlai was involved in plotting several attacks linked to the militant groups, including one tied to the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose party controls many seats in Iraq's Parliament.
To generate money to finance the militias, the Quds Force has many businesses in Iraq, including restaurants, hotels and construction companies.
Training by the Quds Force typically occurs in Iran, where officers offer intelligence support and pass orders to the leaders of the militias, many of whom live in Iran, American officials said.

HEADLINE: 11 Years in Jail For Fund Chief In Stock Deals

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN; William Alden contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9:14 p.m. Updated
The fallen hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam received the longest prison sentence ever for insider trading on Thursday, capping an aggressive government campaign that has ensnared dozens and may help deter the illegal use of confidential information on Wall Street.
Judge Richard J. Holwell of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced Mr. Rajaratnam, 54, the former head of the Galleon Group hedge fund, to 11 years in prison. A jury convicted Mr. Rajaratnam of securities fraud and conspiracy in May after a two-month trial.
''Insider trading is an assault on the free markets,'' said Judge Holwell, who also imposed a $10 million fine and ordered Mr. Rajaratnam to forfeit $53.8 million in ill-gotten profits. ''His crimes reflect a virus in our business culture that needs to be eradicated.''
The sentence was a watershed moment in a two-year push by federal prosecutors. Over that period, Preet S. Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has brought charges against 54 people with insider trading crimes. Of those, 50 have been either pleaded guilty or have been convicted at trial. Three others' situations are pending, and the fourth is a fugitive. 
Yet the crackdown on insider trading - a crime whose victims are not always apparent - has come at a time when many Americans have questioned why authorities have not pursued charges against bank executives over their role in the financial crisis, which still weighs on the economy.
With Mr. Rajaratnam, the government was willing to use novel ideas and hardball tactics to bring a case. For the first time in an insider trading investigation, the government used wiretaps to record traders' telephone conversations. Federal agents pressured traders to wear hidden microphones and record their calls to build their cases.
It remains to be seen whether the use of wiretaps and the stiff penalties will have a chilling effect on insider trading, but most legal experts say they will.
''No matter the crime, if the rewards are great enough, people will ignore the risk of getting caught,'' said Jonathan B. New, a criminal defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. ''For people who think that insider trading isn't a serious crime or that the rewards outweigh the risks, these heavy sentences do send a powerful message to the contrary.''
Still, at 11 years, the sentence lacks the symbolic heft of the 19 to 24 years prosecutors sought. Mr. Rajaratnam deserved an outsize penalty, said the federal prosecutor Reed Brodsky at Thursday's hearing, because his crimes were ''brazen, pervasive and egregious,'' and, ''There is no one who is Mr. Rajaratnam's equal in terms of the breadth and scope of his insider trading crimes.''
Prosecutors accused Mr. Rajaratnam of using a corrupt network of well-placed tipsters - including former executives of Intel, I.B.M. and the consulting firm McKinsey & Company - to illicitly gain about $72 million through his stock trading.
Mr. Rajaratnam stood stone-faced as Judge Holwell read his sentence in a packed courtroom. Mr. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan native, who has not spoken publicly since his arrest in October 2009 and declined to testify at his trial, did not speak at the sentencing.
In imposing his sentence, Judge Holwell cited a number of mitigating factors. He said Mr. Rajaratnam's ''good works figure into the equation,'' citing his financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka and the Sept. 11 attacks.
The judge also disclosed that Mr. Rajaratnam had advanced diabetes that was leading to kidney failure, and said prison ''is a more intense experience for people with serious health conditions.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Rajaratnam's sentence continues a trend of ever-stiffer penalties against white-collar criminals. Legal experts say the increased prison terms are in part a result of federal sentencing guidelines passed in 1987 that link the length of a sentence to the dollar amount involved in the fraud. Historically, judges showed leniency when penalizing corporate criminals because they were not seen as a threat to society and perhaps because they empathized with people who often came from similar backgrounds as themselves. But gone, for the most part, are the days of slap-on-the-wrist sentences and ''country club'' prisons where white-collar defendants served short stints in relatively comfortable quarters.
Corporate wrongdoers have received record-length sentences in recent years. Bernard L. Madoff is serving 150 years for cheating investors in an epic Ponzi scheme. Lee B. Farkas, a former mortgage company executive, received 30 years for his role in a billion-dollar bank fraud scheme.
On the insider trading front, judges' penalties have also been severe. Zvi Goffer, a former trader at Galleon, received a 10-year prison term, matching the longest previous sentence for insider trading. The average sentence of the 13 other defendants connected to Mr. Rajaratnam's case has been about three years.
Legal experts say that because prison terms across all federal crimes have substantially increased over the last two decades, it stands to reason that the length of sentences for executives on Wall Street and in corporate America would also grow.
''Often the question is raised, 'Why shouldn't crime in the suites be punished as severely as crimes on the streets?' '' said Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University. ''While that sounds like a sound bite, it's an important question.''
It is a question that played a crucial role in the debate over the appropriate prison term for Mr. Rajaratnam.
John Dowd, Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer, asked the judge to impose a sentence closer to six to eight years, noting that a stiffer penalty for Mr. Rajaratnam would be on a par with average sentences for violent crimes like kidnapping and sexual abuse.
Advocates of more lenient insider trading sentences also say the crime does not have any real identifiable victims, while other white-collar crimes like Ponzi schemes or corporate accounting frauds destroy lives and livelihoods.
When federal agents arrested Mr. Rajaratnam almost exactly two years ago, his case brought to mind the insider trading scandals of the 1980s. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, brought charges against Ivan Boesky and Michael R. Milken, two of the leading financiers of that era.
Mr. Rajaratnam represented a new breed of Wall Street power player: the hedge fund tycoon. Over the last decade, these money managers became among the most powerful players in global finance. As their influence and wealth grew - in 2009, Mr. Rajaratnam had a net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine - they attracted attention from regulators.
The government placed Mr. Rajaratnam at the center of what it billed as the largest hedge fund insider trading case ever brought. Prosecutors played at trial scores of phone conversations in which Mr. Rajaratnam exchanged illegal stock tips about companies like Goldman Sachs and Google with corporate insiders and fellow traders.
Those recorded calls are expected to be the focus of Mr. Rajaratnam's appeal, which will argue that the judge's decision to admit them as evidence was unauthorized by Congress and unconstitutional. Legal experts say the odds of a reversal are low because appeals courts show great deference to the trial court judge on this issue.
Mr. Rajaratnam must report within 45 days to the Bureau of Prisons, which will assign him to a facility. The judge said he would recommend that Mr. Rajaratnam serve his time at the federal medical center in Butner, N.C., part of the same complex where Mr. Madoff is incarcerated.
Despite the Justice Department's focus, insider trading has been something of a sideshow to the larger problems related to the global financial crisis. Insider trading at hedge funds - and the notion that the stock market is a rigged game - does not rate on the list of grievances from the anti-Wall Street protests spreading across the country.
''Unless people can identify lost money as a result of insider trading, or have had their savings stolen by Madoff, they don't view their own economic difficulties as being caused by a few bad apples,'' said Mr. Berman, the Ohio State law professor. ''They see the problems with our economy and financial markets as far more systemic than that.''
William Alden contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Iran Scoffs at U.S. Account of Alleged Assassination Plot

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Reporting was contributed by Artin Afkhami from Boston and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

 BODY:
The government of Iran on Thursday escalated its rebuttal of American criminal charges that it was behind a murder conspiracy in Washington, calling the claims that Iranian agents had plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador with the help of a Mexican drug gang so ludicrous that even politicians and press in the United States were expressing skepticism about such a scheme.
The latest rejoinder added to the response of Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his subordinates, who said on Wednesday that the suspected plot was concocted in Washington to distract Americans from their own traumatic economic problems, highlighted by the Occupy Wall Street movement. 
At the same time, however, Saudi Arabia, which is deeply suspicious of Iran, suggested that it accepted the American accusations as fact, and Britain said it was taking the accusations seriously. The Saudi foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal, told reporters at a news conference in Vienna that ''this dastardly act reflects the policies of Iran.'' The Saudi government has not yet decided whether to withdraw its ambassador from Tehran in protest, he said.
In London, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, told the House of Commons that the suspected plot ''would appear to constitute a major escalation in Iran's sponsorship of terrorism outside its borders,'' British news agencies reported. He added that the British government was ''in close touch with the U.S. authorities and will work to agree an international response, along with the U.S., the rest of the E.U. and Saudi Arabia.''
On Wednesday, France, which has taken a hard line toward Iran and its nuclear program, also appeared to accept the American accusations without a hint of skepticism. ''France considers this an extremely serious issue and a scandalous violation of international law,'' said the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bernard Valero. He said France was in close contact with Washington on the matter, and as for Iran, ''we expect the planners and those responsible to explain themselves.''
The foreign policy chief of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, was more cautious in her appraisal of the charges pending more information about the evidence. Nonetheless, Ms. Ashton said she viewed the charges ''with grave concern.''
The charges, announced in Washington on Tuesday by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., asserted that officials in the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had conspired to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States by hiring assassins from a Mexican drug cartel for $1.5 million. The main suspects were identified as Mansour J. Arbabsiar, a naturalized American citizen of Iranian descent from Corpus Christi, Tex., who has been taken into custody, and Gholam Shakuri, described by the Justice Department as a member of the Quds Force, who is at large and believed to be in Iran.
Mr. Holder said American investigators believed that high-level officials in the Iranian government ''were responsible for this plot.''
President Obama, making his first public comments on the accusations Thursday, did not go quite as far. But at a news conference with the visiting president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, in Washington, Mr. Obama said in response to a question about Iran: ''We believe that even if at the highest levels there was not detailed operational knowledge, there has to be accountability.''
On Wednesday, Obama administration officials sought to counter skepticism from outside experts on Iran and from some foreign leaders about the logic of such a plot, arguing that evidence such as bank transfers and intercepted telephone calls substantiated it. Some Iran experts nonetheless said it made little sense that the Quds Force, a highly skilled organization, would plot an attack in such a risky and amateurish way.
Seizing on this theme, Iran's state-run media was dominated on Thursday by rejections of the American charges. Press TV, an English-language news web site controlled by the Iranian government, quoted the foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, calling the charges part of a ''new propaganda campaign.'' The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Ali Ahani, the deputy foreign minister, saying that ''the absurd and conspiratorial scenario was made so immaturely that even political circles and media of the U.S. and its allies were suspicious about it.''
He called the charges an attempt to ''weaken Iran's increasingly strengthening position in the region.''
On Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry of Iran complained angrily to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which has monitored United States interests in Iran since diplomatic relations were severed in 1980 . The ministry said it summoned the Swiss ambassador to convey its outrage over the American charges in person and to warn ''against the repetition of such politically motivated allegations.''
Ayatollah Khamenei predicted what he called the demise of American capitalism and corporate favoritism. Press TV quoted the ayatollah saying in a speech that ''the corrupted capitalist system shows no mercy to any nation, including the American people.''
The ayatollah also commended the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, Washington and other American cities, calling them a consequence of ''the prevalence of top-level corruption, poverty and social inequality in America.''

HEADLINE: As Online Courses Grow, So Does Financial Aid Fraud

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While serving nine months in a South Carolina prison on forgery charges, Michelle N. Owens capitalized on the explosion in online higher education to tap into a new -- and highly lucrative -- way to profit from fake documents.
Using information she gathered as she handled paperwork in the prison's education department, Ms. Owens filed applications for admission and financial aid to Webster University's distance-learning programs on behalf of 23 unknowing inmates. The applicants were admitted and granted the $467,500 in requested aid, including $124,821 for books, transportation and living expenses -- though of course their room and board was already provided by the state. The aid was sent in the form of debit cards to the residential South Carolina address Ms. Owens supplied.
An alert employee at Webster in St. Louis, which has campuses overseas and on dozens of United States military bases, eventually noticed an unusual number of applicants from the same address in Florence, S.C. Ms. Owens, 36, who continued to make fraudulent applications to Webster for more than a year after she was released from Leath Correctional Institution in 2008, was sentenced on Sept. 29 to 51 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $128,852 in restitution. 
She is one of 215 participants in 42 financial aid fraud rings who have been convicted since 2005 and ordered to pay $7.5 million in restitution and fines, according to a new report by the Department of Education's Office of the Inspector General. But those numbers do not reflect the scale of the fraud rings, the report said, since often the ringleaders are the only ones prosecuted.
With the huge expansion of online college courses, financial aid scams have become a serious problem: as of Aug. 1, the inspector general had opened 100 investigations into distance-education fraud involving thousands of suspects; such crimes now make up about 17 percent of the agency's open cases, and investigators are working on 49 new complaints, scrambling to keep up. ''Because of the sheer volume of referrals, finite resources and other external limitations,'' the report said, ''we cannot investigate all of the referrals we receive concerning distance-education fraud rings.''
The rings generally seek federal aid for ''straw students'' who have no intention of pursuing an education -- or, as in Ms. Owens's scheme, are unaware of the application. The aid is sent to the college, which takes the portion covering the initial tuition and fees, and then ''refunds'' the excess to the student to cover other expenses like books, transportation and room and board.
Some rings involve vast cadres of foot soldiers, many of them lacking a high school diploma, recruited with the understanding that they will keep a portion of the aid money and kick back the rest to the ringleader.
Until 2005, colleges could not participate in federal aid programs if more than half their students were enrolled in what were then known as ''correspondence'' or ''telecommunications'' courses. For online courses -- but not correspondence courses -- the 50 percent rule was eliminated in 2005.
By now, the vast majority of colleges and universities offer online courses, and some huge commercial institutions have hundreds of thousands of online students. Amid tough economic times, an increasing number of these students are actually what are known as ''Pell-runners'' -- people who disappear as soon as they receive the proceeds of their Pell grants or student loans.
Kathleen S. Tighe, the inspector general, suggested that colleges clamp down on identity verification, and that Congress and the Education Department rethink whether online students, mostly working adults, should be eligible for the same federal aid to cover living expenses as students who attend on-campus programs.
''Without that money there would be significantly less incentive for this particular scam,'' Ms. Tighe noted. ''We'll do the best we can with our resources to investigate the allegations we receive, but there are actions that can be taken to help reduce the appeal of this quick-cash-for-little-effort scam.''
Community colleges have been especially vulnerable to fraud rings, because of their open enrollment and low tuition, which leaves room for substantial excess aid. At Rio Salado College, an online community college in Arizona, 64 people were convicted in a $538,000 scheme that unraveled after an employee in Rio Salado's financial aid office noticed similar handwriting on several applications. The ringleader, Trenda Halton, a student who pleaded guilty last year, worked with several accomplices who recruited ''straw students'' to apply for Pell grants and loans. Ms. Halton signed into their online classes to meet Rio Salado's attendance requirements, then took a cut of $500 to $1,000 once the aid money came through.
(Rio Salado has a business relationship with The New York Times Company to offer courses through the company's online education program.)
Pursuing so many people in an individual ring is rare, though.
''It is unlikely that such a robust effort to prosecute all participants in such a large investigation will be repeated in the future,'' said the inspector general's report. In a similar case two years ago, American River College, a community college in Sacramento, found dozens of people with the same address enrolled in the same courses, all of them then withdrawing or failing. The ringleader pleaded guilty to fraudulently applying for federal financial aid for more than 60 people, and, in May, was sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison, and ordered to pay $234,515.
The biggest fraud, along with the most significant efforts to combat it, seems to have occurred at Axia College, a two-year program of the University of Phoenix, the nation's largest for-profit institution. Officials there have identified -- and referred to the inspector general -- some 750 rings involving 15,000 people.
Axia, which enrolls about 150,000 students, and the University of Phoenix's parent company, the Apollo Group, have four employees working full time to identify fraud and expose Pell-runners. ''We have been able to construct a pretty thick net that is very difficult for these criminals to penetrate,'' said James Berg, the Apollo Group's chief ethics and compliance officer.
Apollo monitors and records the vast majority of calls from potential students, he said, and has what he called an ''intense identity verification process'' if any red flags are raised. The company is also on the lookout for multiple applications from the same computer network address, often a tip-off to a fraud ring.
Last year, Apollo introduced a required three-week orientation in hopes of weeding out students likely to drop out. Axia's new enrollment has since dropped by about half; Mr. Berg said the orientation had also cut down sharply on fraud.
''Fraud ringleaders, operating on behalf of several students, have to maintain the appearance that they're all participating in orientation, and that's just too much work for the ringleader,'' Mr. Berg said. ''We've heard back from ringleaders that the University of Phoenix is making it too difficult for us. And since the beginning of 2011, on a monthly basis, we have seen a decrease in the number of fraud rings we are flagging. I think with all the cases we've referred to law enforcement, word has gotten out that this is not a smart thing to try here.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Data Highlight Weakness in Global Economy

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN. 
Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The weakness in the global economy was underscored by reports published Thursday about the balance of trade in the United States and China.
The United States trade deficit was essentially unchanged in August at $45.6 billion, its lowest level since April and $100 million narrower than a year earlier. Exports and imports both slipped by $100 million, to $177.6 billion and $233.2 billion, respectively.
The trade deficit was slightly narrower than analysts' expectations. The level for July was revised downward from $44.8 billion. 
A narrower trade deficit could lead to a slightly higher level for the gross domestic product, said Clark Yingst, the chief market analyst for the investment firm Joseph Gunnar, ''but not exactly for the reasons that we'd like.'' Slipping imports are a bad sign for the United States economy, since it shows weakness in consumer demand.
''In an ideal world we would like to see exports and imports growing at relatively strong rates, but with exports growing even faster than imports,'' said Mr. Yingst.
Economists have also expressed concern that Europe's slowing economy is leading to a reduction in demand for American exports. Alcoa, the aluminum producer, said its lower profit, reported earlier this week, was a result in part to weak demand there.
The American trade deficit with China grew to $29 billion, its largest level ever, at a time when American officials have focused on the role of China's government in the global economy. On Tuesday, the United States Senate passed a bill that would impose tariffs on certain Chinese goods if the Treasury Department determined that China was undervaluing its currency to its advantage.
But trade data from China for September showed that the country's trade surplus narrowed to $14.5 billion in September, from $17.8 billion in August. The slimmer surplus was unlikely to defuse fully the criticism of American lawmakers, who argue that Beijing is keeping its currency unfairly low against the dollar.
The report from China also showed that its booming pace of export growth had begun to ease, as the global upheaval and a gradual rise in the value of the renminbi took their toll. Economists are concerned that the American economy could be further damaged if this trend continues, especially if European demand remains weak. John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, said that Chinese officials faced a balancing act, as they weighed the dangers of inflation against concerns that tighter monetary policy in China could put further strain on a weakened economies in the United States and Europe.
''China doesn't want to see Europe collapse,'' he said. ''They're kind of walking a tightrope here.''
There were some bright spots in other data released Thursday, however.
First-time jobless claims in the United States remained essentially unchanged this week, at 404,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average, seen as a better barometer of the labor market, was down for the third consecutive week, to 408,000.
Rates for 30-year mortgages increased, after dipping below 4 percent for the first time on record, according to a survey by Freddie Mac. The rate rose to 4.12 percent this week, up from 3.94 percent the week before. In a statement, Frank E. Nothaft, the vice president and chief economist of Freddie Mac, attributed the gain to last week's employment report, which was better than expected. Economists also pointed to the stock market, which has been gaining in recent days.
Low mortgage rates have not been enough to lift the anemic housing market, however, because many potential consumers cannot qualify for loans and many others do not feel comfortable making large financial commitments in such a weak labor market, said Patrick Newmark, United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
''The demand out there isn't very strong,'' he said. ''People aren't applying.''The International Monetary Fund also warned Thursday that Asia could suffer ''clear'' financial and economic spillovers from continued problems elsewhere. The fund forecast relatively robust growth of 6.3 percent for the region this year and 6.7 percent in 2012 on average, slightly below a previous forecast of 6.8 percent for 2011 and 6.9 percent for 2012 made in April.
The fund's worries were tempered by a degree of confidence about Asian domestic demand cushioning the region from global upheaval.
''Domestic demand is still resilient, and it should continue to sustain activity across the region,'' the I.M.F. said.

Beijing Dance Theater (Wednesday and Thursday, through Oct. 22) It's the first visit to the United States for this Chinese company, founded in 2008 by the choreographer Wang Yuanyuan and the visual artists Han Jiang and Tan Shaoyuan. Since then the company has established a reputation for fusing traditional elements of Chinese culture with ballet. Apparently that's not hard enough; in ''Haze,'' set to Gorecki's Symphony No. 3 and electronic music by Biosphere, Ms. Wang takes on recent economic and environmental crises too. Part of the Next Wave Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $50. (Roslyn Sulcas) 
- Nora Chipaumire and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar (Friday and Saturday) A new work, ''visible,'' is the outcome of a collaboration between Nora Chipaumire and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, the artistic director of Urban Bush Women. Presented by Harlem Stage, it addresses ideas about dominance and submission, migration and immigration, personal and social histories. Collaborations are always uncertain affairs, but both of these women are fascinating, intelligent dance makers; it's worth the trip to discover what they have brought about together. At 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 281-9240, harlemstage.org; $35. (Sulcas)
Dance Gallery Festival (Friday and Saturday) Presented by Von Ussar Danceworks, the fifth edition of this mini-festival offers new work from emerging and well-known choreographers, including Camille A. Brown, CorbinDances, Rick McCulough, Jeremy McQueen, NobleMotion Dance, Somebodies Dance Theater, Mojca Ussar and Von Ussar Danceworks. At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $15. (Sulcas)
Maura Nguyen Donohue / Vanessa Anspaugh (Friday and Saturday) This shared program offers Maura Nguyen Donohue's ''I'm not coming back,'' an exploration, according to Danspace's Web site, of ''changing states and physical decay,'' somehow involving Little Red Riding Hood. Vanessa Anspaugh presents ''We Are Weather,'' which, says the Web site, ''exposes the terror and the pleasure of transcending our own subjectivity.'' Promises, promises. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Sulcas)
DraftWork (Saturday) This free series of works in progress offers choreographers, chosen by Ishmael Houston-Jones, a chance to show new work during the course of its development. This week's participants are Deborah Gladstein, collaborating with the bassist Garth Stevenson, and Molly Heller, who explores notions of the self. The performances are followed by a discussion with the choreographers, moderated by the always thought-provoking Mr. Houston-Jones. At 3 p.m., Danspace Project, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; free. (Sulcas)
- Colin Dunne (Wednesday and Thursday, through Oct. 22) Mr. Dunne had international fame as an Irish step dancer and the lead in ''Riverdance'' during the late 1990s. Since then he has reinvented himself as a choreographer working in a contemporary setting, and his new ''Out of Time'' pays homage to his dance past while attempting to move into new artistic terrain. Can a traditional form find a contemporary context? It's a question that bedevils all dance governed by specific, historically shaped techniques (ballet and flamenco among them). Perhaps Mr. Dunne will make it happen. At 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org; $25. (Sulcas)
- Eiko & Koma (Friday and Saturday, and Monday through Thursday, through Oct. 30) The Japanese artists Eiko and Koma have lived and performed in the United States for more than 40 years, and they are celebrating those decades with the Retrospective Project, which has taken performances and exhibitions all over the country since 2009. ''Residue,'' an installation and collection at the New York Library for the Performing Arts, offers videos of their performances, costumes, sets and materials, as well as a tea-house structure made from canvas, feathers, sweet rice and sea salt -- elements used in the brilliant ''Naked,'' performed this year at the Baryshnikov Arts Center. If you have never seen the strange, fascinating work of Eiko & Koma, in which life moves both glacially and with the urgent power of nature, the exhibition offers a glimpse of their magic. If you are already a fan, you'll be happily reminded why. Friday, Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m. and Monday and Thursday from noon to 8 p.m., New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (917) 275-6975, nypl.org/lpa; free. (Sulcas)
- Suzanne Farrell Ballet (Wednesday and Thursday, through Oct. 23) For all those suffering from New York City Ballet withdrawal, there's a fresh influx of mouth-watering Balanchine works from this company, led by the great ballerina Suzanne Farrell and often cited as an exemplary avatar of Balanchinian choreography and style. This program features a rarity, Balanchine's 1947 ''Haieff Divertimento,'' as well as ''Meditation'' (a pas de deux created in 1963 for Ms. Farrell and Jacques d'Amboise); the pas de deux from the ''Diamonds'' section of ''Jewels''; and the magnificent ''Agon.'' Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Sulcas)
- Liz Gering (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Gering has a talent for engendering strange, dreamlike worlds, and a new work is always a pleasurable prospect. ''She Dreams in Code'' is set to an electronic score by Michael J. Schumacher and offers six dancers in what the press materials describe as ''a rigorous field of motion'': a good description of Ms. Gering's textured physicality. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, bacnyc.org; $20. (Sulcas)
Naomi Goldberg Haas / Dances for a Variable Population (Friday and Saturday) Work created for outdoor performances comes indoors in Ms. Haas's ''Out to In,'' performed alongside ''Short Bits'' to a collage from Radiolab WNYC. Ms. Haas's penchant for title transparency extends to her company's name: the troupe uses performers whose ages range from 22 to 81. At 7:30 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $20, or $15 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
- Houston Ballet (Friday through Sunday) New York is too rarely visited by the excellent ballet companies now installed all over the United States. (Money, money, money.) So this weeklong season from Houston Ballet is a great chance to see this much-praised company, even if the triple bill it brings is less than thrilling. On the program is a new work from the indefatigable Finnish choreographer Jorma Elo; Christopher Bruce's cutesy ''Hush''; and, most interesting, Jiri Kylian's 1989 ''Falling Angels,'' a minimalist study for eight women set to ceremonial Ghanaian music and part of Steve Reich's ''Drumming.'' Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $75. (Sulcas)
Joanna Kotze / Benn Rasmussen (Friday through Sunday) The striking dancer Joanna Kotze offers a nicely succinct synopsis of her piece ''Between You and Me'': ''Two dancers, a contained space, a stationary audience.'' (Press agents, take note.) Benn Rasmussen is almost as terse about his ''Black Ground,'' which, the press material says, ''unravels through a series of tense events.'' Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 625-8369, dnadance.org; $17, or $12 in advance; $14 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
- Faustin Linyekula (Friday and Saturday) The history and politics of Congo, where Mr. Linyekula grew up, are major themes in this choreographer's work, and his rambunctious, rambling pieces are inventive, energetic explorations of how individuals cope -- and do more than cope -- with impossible circumstances. In ''more more more ... future,'' Mr. Linyekula, himself a terrific mover, performs with two dancers to poems by Antoine Vumilia Muhindo and music by the guitarist Flamme Kapaya and his five-member band. ''More more'' is part of the French Institute Alliance Francaise's Crossing the Line festival; bravo to it for bringing these artists to New York. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $15, or $12 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
- Rachid Ouramdane (Friday and Saturday) The French Institute Alliance Francaise's Crossing the Line festival presents a recent piece by the French-Algerian choreographer Rachid Ouramdane, who plumbs the darker sides of human experience with remarkable subtlety and allusiveness. ''World Fair'' -- a collaboration with the musician Jean-Baptiste Julien -- has as its subject the relationships between politics and the body, ideology and behavior. Don't be put off by the conceptual tone; Mr. Ouramdane is a poet of the theater. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15 to $30. (Sulcas)
Symphony for the Dance Floor (Friday and Saturday) A new multidisciplinary work by the composer Daniel Bernard Roumain that incorporates a mix of hip-hop, classical and pop with dance (the choreography is by Millicent Johnnie), photography and video (by Jonathan Mannion) and an actor-rapper M.C. (Lord Jamar), this could be an ambitious mess, or perhaps a lot of fun. Part of the Next Wave Festival. Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 7:30 and 10 p.m., Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $35. (Sulcas)
- Wave Rising (Thursday through Nov. 6) Young Soon Kim, the indomitably energetic artistic director of the White Wave arts center in Brooklyn, founded the Wave Rising Series in 2006 as a way to offer a stage to emerging groups and individuals. The tightly packed programs can feel a little bewildering, but there are gems to discover there, including little-seen ensembles from other parts of the world. Program A, on Thursday, features the Danielle Russo Dance Company, Nellie Rainwater, Claudia Anata Hubiak and, from Israel, Rachel Erdos. And there is much, much more: 24 companies over the three-week run of the series. At 7:30 p.m., John Ryan Theater at White Wave, 25 Jay Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 855-8822, whitewavedance.com; $20, with series packages available. (Sulcas)

HEADLINE: Democrats Had Big Lead In Spending, If Not at Polls

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Democrats poured $1.5 million into their failed attempt to retain the Congressional seat last held by Anthony D. Weiner, vastly outspending the Republican candidate, Bob Turner, who ultimately prevailed in New York's Ninth District. 
The Democratic candidate, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, spent $859,000 on the race, according to a campaign finance filing on Thursday. National groups chipped in more than $675,000, mostly to pay for television advertising in an effort to salvage Mr. Weprin's flagging campaign in the final days before the Sept. 13 special election.
That amounted to more than double the spending by Mr. Turner, a retired cable television executive, and outside groups that backed him in the race. Mr. Turner spent $464,000, according to a campaign finance filing on Thursday, and national groups funneled more than $100,000 into the contest on his behalf.
The spending gap is not a surprise: several weeks before the election, Mr. Weprin had raised more than twice what Mr. Turner had received. He benefited from the fund-raising muscle of the Democratic Party in Queens and Brooklyn, parts of which make up the Ninth District, an area that has long elected Democrats.
But the wide gulf in expenditures, as evidenced by the new campaign finance filings, offer a painful reminder to Democrats of the significant resources that were consumed by a race that at first was not expected to be competitive. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent more than $500,000 to support Mr. Weprin, and the House Majority PAC, a group seeking to put Democrats back in control of the House, spent more than $160,000.
With his victory, Mr. Turner, who framed his candidacy as a means for voters to express their frustration with President Obama and his handling of the economy and the Middle East peace process, became an immediate national hero to Republicans.
Mr. Weprin, by contrast, struggled to overcome an association with an unpopular president and a perception that he represented the status quo. Despite the Democratic Party's large enrollment advantage in the Ninth District, Mr. Turner drew 52 percent of the vote, compared with 47 percent for Mr. Weprin.

HEADLINE: Occupy San Francisco Is Nothing Like the Old Days

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI; Steve Fainaru contributed reporting.. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Call it occupation envy.
The first wave of Occupy San Francisco protesters made their way down to the financial district a month ago to take a stand against what they perceived to be a financial system run amok.
Given the city's reputation for countercultural leadership, it would seem natural that San Francisco, where protests started on Sept. 17, the same day as the flagship Occupy Wall Street in New York, would emerge as a leading voice in this growing movement.
After all, this is the region that gave the world the Summer of Love and the free speech movement, helped ignite the gay rights movement, and contributed mightily to the Vietnam War and gulf war protests. 
But even the protesters themselves at Occupy San Francisco, as it is often called, acknowledge the turnout as surprisingly small.
''I think it's going to need some fine-tuning for San Francisco,'' said Daniel Raskin, 68, a retired preschool teacher, speaking from the encampment on Market Street, outside the Federal Reserve building, on Wednesday.
The sidewalk protest has grown from a handful of people to as many as 100 nighttime denizens in recent days, but unlike the protest in New York, where a few thousand are estimated to be participating, Occupy San Francisco has no permanent location -- and lacking a camping permit, the group has been forced to move frequently.
Occupy San Francisco, like the other occupation protests around the county, is purposely ad hoc, with volunteer participants creating working groups as they see fit and convening daily to make decisions by consensus at a general assembly. A core group camps at the site at night, with others joining the protest in rallies, marches and other events.
Similar protests, like Occupy Los Angeles and Occupy Boston, regularly draw upward of 200 campers. Famous people from Kanye West to Joseph Stiglitz have made appearances in New York. But besides Naomi Klein, the Canadian economist, who was at Occupy San Francisco on Wednesday, boldface names have been sparse here.
Even local politicians seem to be keeping Occupy San Francisco at arm's length. Mayor Ed Lee issued a tepid statement of support, but the only frequent visitor has been John Avalos, a supervisor who is running for mayor.
The underwhelming response here has startled many, who point to the area's storied past.
''You have all manner of social movements here,'' said Richard DeLeon, professor emeritus at San Francisco State University and author of ''Left Coast City: Progressive Politics in San Francisco 1975-1991.''
Mr. DeLeon ticked off a list that included the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike (a local union protest that sparked national reforms); the Beats of the 1950s (''the foundation for the hippie countercultural movement''); local wars over the Manhattanization of San Francisco, starting in the late '70s; the antinuclear and antigentrification actions of the '80s. '90s and beyond; and the environmental movement. ''It's a caldron,'' he said.
So why is Occupy San Francisco, at least so far, not on that list?
Many point to the city's shifting demographics. The population is older now, and the city is expensive.
Chris Carlsson, a local historian, a biking activist and the editor of the anthology ''Ten Years That Shook the City,'' said San Francisco had a less radical climate than in the past.
''The obvious main reason is that you can't afford to live here unless you're working like a maniac,'' Mr. Carlsson said. ''Most people who move to change the world are moving to Oakland, or not the Bay Area at all.''
The rise of social media is another new factor in this movement. Occupy San Francisco's Facebook page has around 7,700 fans, and there are at least three Twitter feeds, with a combined 9,500 or so followers -- far greater numbers than the 700 or so who have shown up for the largest marches downtown.
According to Rachel Silver of Movements.org, a New York nonprofit, social media discussion may have partly replaced physical activism. ''Some people might say, 'Oh I've educated myself online; I'm watching a livestream -- I don't need to go down there,' '' she said.
For Cleve Jones, a longtime local activist who supports the protest, Occupy San Francisco's problem is not a matter of shifting demographics or social media as much as failed outreach. ''The folks down there don't really have the experience and are not really aware of the traditions of protest in this town,'' he said, adding that being new to activism was not ''necessarily a bad thing,'' a view shared by many of the protesters.
There are signs that the current situation may change. Supporters point to Occupy San Francisco's steady growth; the bank protest on Wednesday, during which 11 people were arrested, brought a reported 30 different groups totaling around 500 people together in solidarity.
Mr. Jones remains hopeful. ''This is the first populist uprising since the '30s,'' he said. ''I think S.F. should be leading the protest, not lagging behind.''

HEADLINE: Strong Ad Revenue Lifts Google's Profit 26%

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Google showed on Thursday that it was making money from people searching online with their mobile devices, providing evidence that it could follow users wherever they searched the Web.
Google, which presented quarterly earnings that easily surpassed analysts' expectations, reported that revenue climbed 33 percent and net income rose 26 percent. Although it does not typically break out revenue from different types of ads, it said mobile was on track to generate more than $2.5 billion in revenue in the coming year and grew 2.5 times in the last year.
''When I look back over the last quarter, the word that springs to mind is 'gangbusters,' '' Larry Page, Google's chief executive, said in a call with analysts after the earnings were announced. ''It's not bad for a 13-year-old,'' he said, referring to Google's age. 
''We are also seeing a huge positive revenue impact of mobile,'' he said.
Google, which makes the Android mobile operating system and offers mobile search, apps and ads, has nearly 100 percent market share in mobile search and is investing heavily in mobile. But until now, it offered little detail on how much mobile ads and Android, which it gives handset manufacturers free, contribute to revenue.
The announcement should appease those analysts concerned about whether Google's search business would keep up its steady rate of impressive growth. More searches are being done on mobile phones, where people are less likely to click on ads and the ads tend to cost less, and advertisers are spending more money on display and social ads instead of search ads. Almost all of Google's revenue comes from advertising and the vast majority from search advertising.
''The quantification of mobile revenues gives us an indication that Android is cementing Google's position in mobile advertising,'' said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''Google's ability to diversify away from the parts of its businesses that are maturing is impressive.''
Last week, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Google stock from buy to hold, citing concerns about a slowdown in search. ''The paid search industry is maturing and slowing down, without a doubt,'' said Roger Barnette, president of IgnitionOne, which provides digital marketing data. ''Advertisers have other options that they haven't had before.''
Nikesh Arora, Google's chief business officer, said that its desktop business maintained momentum and that Google.com grew faster than a year ago. Google's financial report also showed that desktop search advertising continued to chug along.
That provided some comfort to shareholders and analysts who have been spooked by Google's charging ahead with aggressive hiring, new businesses and high-priced acquisitions, like its $12.5 billion bid for Motorola Mobility. On Thursday, Google said it hired 2,585 people in the third quarter, up from 1,526 new people in the same quarter a year ago, bringing its total to 31,353. The third quarter was its second-highest quarter ever for hiring recent college graduates.
''I don't love a lot of the things that Google's doing, but their core business is a powerhouse,'' said Colin W. Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. ''When they bust out revenues above expectations, all the sins are forgiven.''
Such worries about expenses -- along with concerns about continuing antitrust investigations, competition from Facebook and deteriorating economic conditions -- have caused Google's share price to drop 8 percent this year. But in after-hours trading, shareholders responded favorably to the earnings report, as shares rose 6 percent. Google also highlighted the growth of several of its newer businesses. Google+, its social network and Facebook competitor, has 40 million users who have uploaded 3.4 billion photos, Mr. Page said, and Google plans to begin incorporating it into other Google products. Chrome, its browser, has 200 million users, and people have activated 190 million Android phones.
Google so far seems to be mostly sheltered from the slumping economy, which has hurt other Web sites and publications that rely on advertising. Still, Mr. Barnette said, if the economy continues to suffer advertisers could cut back or move in greater numbers to new kinds of ads. ''Growth going forward will more closely mimic the overall economic industry and ad budgets in general,'' he said.
Clicks on ads on Google and other Web sites increased 28 percent over the same quarter last year and 13 percent over the second quarter this year, Google said. The amount Google was paid for clicks increased 5 percent over last year, but decreased 5 percent over the second quarter of this year.
An increase in paid clicks often corresponds with a decrease in the amount paid for those clicks, said Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president for advertising at Google. The increase in mobile searching could also have caused a decrease in the cost per click, because mobile ads tend to cost less than desktop ones. Mr. Gillis said consumers spent more time comparing prices and made purchases less often.
Google has seen some softness in ad sales in Western Europe because of its economic struggles, Mr. Arora said. The North America business has been stable, and business in Australia, India and Brazil has been growing rapidly, he said.
Google reported net income for the period ending Sept. 30 of $2.73 billion, or $8.33 a share, up from $2.17 billion, or $6.72 a share, a year ago. Excluding the cost of stock options and the related tax benefits, Google's third-quarter profit was $9.72 a share. Analysts had expected $8.74 a share.
The company said revenue was $9.72 billion, up from $7.29 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue, which excludes payments to ad partners, was $7.51 billion, up from $5.48 billion, above analysts' expectations of $7.2 billion.

HEADLINE: As Demand for Electricity Increases, China Sticks With Nuclear Power

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
BEIJING
Meltdowns of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan last March have put a chill on much of the world's nuclear power industry -- but not in China.
The German Parliament voted this summer to close the country's remaining nuclear power plants by 2022, while the Swiss Parliament voted this summer to phase nuclear power out by 2034. Economic stagnation in the United States and most other industrialized economies since 2008 has produced stagnant electricity demand, further sapping interest in nuclear power.
In Japan itself, the government has put on hold its plans to build further nuclear power plants, and the government faces a political battle to continue operating existing reactors. Emerging economies like Brazil and particularly India are still planning nuclear reactors. But the Indian leaders introduced legislation on Sept. 7 that is supposed to increase the independence of nuclear regulators from the industry, though critics are skeptical.
That leaves China poised to build more nuclear reactors in the coming years than the rest of the world combined. But questions abound whether China will be a savior for the international nuclear power industry, or a ferocious competitor that could create even greater challenges for nuclear power companies in the West. 
Chinese regulators performed a four-month review of safety at all existing nuclear reactors and reactors under construction after the Fukushima meltdowns and declared them safe. Safety reviews continue at reactors where construction had not yet started at the time of the Fukushima accident.
Jiang Kejun, a director of the Energy Research Institute at the National Development and Reform Commission, the top Chinese economic planning agency, said that the government was sticking to its target of 50 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2015, compared to just 10.8 gigawatts at the end of last year.
Mr. Jiang said in an interview that nuclear power construction targets for 2020 had not yet been set and might end up slightly lower than they would have been without the meltdowns in Fukushima. But he and other Chinese officials say that China's rapidly rising electricity consumption makes nuclear power essential. They even try to portray the Fukushima incidents as salutary for the nuclear power industry, a view seldom heard elsewhere.
''Globally, I think Fukushima could be a good thing for nuclear power,'' Mr. Jiang said. ''We can learn a lot from that. We can't be smug or too clever.''
China allowed existing reactors to continue operating during the safety review from March to July and allowed construction to continue at reactors where it had already begun. Chinese regulators have also encouraged electric utilities to continue planning future nuclear power plants.
But one category of reactor has been delayed by the Fukushima incident. At reactors that had been approved before the Fukushima accident but where construction had not yet begun, the government still has not allowed construction to start while continuing to study whether further safety improvements can be made, said Xu Yuanhui, one of China's top nuclear engineers for the past half century.
The delay applies to several conventional nuclear reactors plus Beijing's project to build two reactors in northeastern China, using a new generation of technology known as a pebble-bed design. Critics and advocates describe it as safer than current reactors, though its cost-effectiveness unclear.
The two reactors in Shidao, in Shandong Province in northeast China, were approved days before the Fukushima nuclear accident began with an earthquake and tsunami March 11. But the 50-month timetable for building them cannot start until the government lifts its hold on construction.
''By the end of this year, maybe we'll have some information from the government side,'' Dr. Xu said.
Nuclear power represented only 1.1 percent of China's electricity generation capacity at the end of last year. With wind turbines and coal-fired power plants being installed at rates that far surpass those in any other country, nuclear power is on track to account for no more than 4 percent of electricity capacity by 2015.
A big part of the appeal of nuclear energy for Chinese officials is that it supplies baseload power, meaning it is available 24 hours a day and seven days a week to meet needs. China passed the United States last year as the world's largest installer of wind turbines, but wind still accounts for only 3.2 percent of China's installed electricity generation capacity and less than 2 percent of electricity generated.
Coal remains by far the dominant source of electricity in China, producing three-quarters of the country's electricity. Nuclear power mainly displaces coal as a source of baseload power. That has also made it popular with Chinese officials, as they have set increasingly ambitious targets to slow the country's rapid rise in emissions of global warming gases, in which the country already leads the world.
Until reliable, large-scale storage of electricity is perfected for renewable energy sources like the wind and sun, ''they've got to continue using nuclear as a fundamental part of their fuel mix,'' said James A. Maguire, the regional managing director for Asian infrastructure at Aon Risk Solutions, a risk management and insurance broker.
Coal is the most polluting major source of electricity in terms of emissions of climate-changing gases, while nuclear power is one of the cleanest. Coal mining accidents also kill more than 2,000 people a year in China, and large areas of the countryside in northern China have been heavily polluted.
China is paying particular attention to nuclear safety issues, however, because it has some of the world's most densely populated rural areas. If a nuclear accident rendered even a small area around a power plant uninhabitable, many would need to be resettled.
China now has an unusually varied fleet of nuclear reactors, using French, American, Russian and homegrown technology. While awarding contracts to a wide range of multinational nuclear power plant contractors, it has required that they provide documentation on exactly how to build the reactors.
That will give China the ability to export reactors in a few years, in competition with industrialized nations, nuclear power industry experts warned. Demand outside China could revive if memories of the Fukushima accident fade or if worries about global warming become more pressing.
China is not only acquiring technology. It is also creating economies of scale by building dozens of reactors at the same time. As a population equal to New York City's moves into China's cities each year demanding air-conditioners and other electricity-guzzling conveniences, consumption is likely to continue growing by double digits.
''It's the largest migration in history, so they need to build a lot of infrastructure,'' said Dennis Bracy, the chief executive of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, a bilateral discussion group formed by the Chinese government with prominent Americans from previous Republican and Democratic administrations. ''I believe they will stay with nuclear as part of the portfolio.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Following Banks, Shares Close Down on Wall Street

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday, weighed down by bank stocks after JPMorgan Chase reported that a slowdown in investment banking had hurt its results in the third quarter.
Trade figures from the world's two biggest economies, the United States and China, also stoked concerns over the economic outlook, ending a rally in European stocks as well.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 40.72 points, or 0.35 percent, at 11,478.13. JPMorgan fell 4.8 percent. Other banks also fell. Citigroup dropped 5.3 percent, Morgan Stanley 4.4 percent and Bank of America 5.5 percent. 
JPMorgan is the first big American bank to announce quarterly results. Next week Wells Fargo & Company, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley will report. JPMorgan is considered one of the industry's leaders, so its results do not bode well for other financial companies, said Jason Lilly, a portfolio manager at Rockland Trust Investment Management Group.
An afternoon rally in technology stocks trimmed some of Wall Street's losses. Yahoo rose 1 percent as investors speculated the company might be bought. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite rose 15.5 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,620.
''There's a mounting interest in Yahoo and that has filtered out into tech stocks,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial.
The S.& P. 500 index fell 3.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,203.66. Financial stocks fell 2.4 percent, the most of the 10 company groups that make up the index.
Investors were also disappointed by a report that China's trade surplus narrowed for a second month in September. That suggests the Chinese economy is slowing more than previously thought, which could hurt demand for exports from the United States.
The United States trade deficit was essentially unchanged in August at $45.6 billion, with exports and imports both slipping. Lower imports are a bad sign for the United States economy, since it shows weakness in demand.
Before Thursday, stocks had soared for a week on signs that Europe was starting to get a handle on its financial crisis. The Dow had rallied 8.1 percent since last Tuesday, when it hit its lowest point of the year. The S.& P. Poor's 500-index rose even more in that time, 9.8 percent. That was the biggest seven-day jump for the S.& P. since March 2009, when the market hit 12-year lows.
The sharp highs and lows are typical of the volatility that has plagued markets since August, when investors began reacting to fears that indebted economies in Europe would collapse and the United States would slide back into recession. Many analysts say they think the market is in for more big swings until a resolution to Europe's debt is reached.
''Europe will definitely contribute to more volatility. That story isn't done,'' said Mr. Lilly.
In corporate news, the BlackBerry maker Research in Motion fell 1.13 percent after a three-day outage that cut off service to users across the world. The company said it fixed the problem, which resulted from a breakdown in its European infrastructure.
The Blackstone Group lost 5.4 percent after a Citi Investment Research analyst dropped the private equity firm from a list of favorite stocks, saying the firm would not be able to make strong real estate investments for some time because of the weak economy.
Netflix rose 3 percent after the company secured a deal with Warner Brothers Television Group and CBS to stream programs from the CW television network.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 16/32. The yield fell to 2.18 percent, from 2.21 percent late Wednesday.
In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 0.7 percent, while Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were both 1.3 percent lower.
Oil prices meanwhile tracked European equities lower -- benchmark oil was down $1.33 to $84.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Lower Medicaid Dispensing Fees May Pressure Pharmacies

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CARDONA. 
ccardona@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In Rio Grande City, Rene Martinez's Starr Pharmacy has one line for Medicaid patients and another for non-Medicaid patients. On some days, most of his clients can be found waiting on the Medicaid line, a testament to the importance of that federal-state health insurance program in this poor city along the Texas-Mexico border -- and to Mr. Martinez's bottom line.
His store is one of a number of independent pharmacies in Texas that may have to lay off workers and cut services like free delivery to homebound patients because of looming lower dispensing fees. Beginning in March, a new managed-care plan goes into effect that reduces the amount pharmacies receive for filling Medicaid prescriptions. 
The plan, approved by the Legislature earlier this year, is expected to save the state $100 million over the next two years.
Switching to managed Medicaid means pharmacy benefit managers will offer contracts to pharmacies with a lower dispensing fee that will replace the current $6.50 fee per prescription. Dispensing fees make up about 10 percent of the total reimbursement pharmacies receive from Medicaid, depending on the cost of the medication.
''There are little things we do, like staff the pharmacy with two pharmacists at all times, that I don't think I will be able to afford to do anymore,'' said Mr. Martinez, who opened Starr Pharmacy in 2010. About 95 percent of his clients are on Medicaid, the joint state-federal insurance program for the disabled and poor children.
With the addition of managed care for pharmacies, Texas will fall below the national average for Medicaid dispensing fees, which hovers around $4.40, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. One pharmacy benefit manager, the Wisconsin-based Navitus Health Solutions, has announced it will offer a dispensing fee of $1.35, an 80 percent cut.
''I think pharmacies have the same concerns with managed care that doctors do,'' said Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for Texas' Health and Human Services Commission. ''But just as people will still have access to doctors, they will still see pharmacists.''
The dispute has sparked a lawsuit against the commission over the way the new managed-care plan was created.
Thomas M. Suehs, the head of the commission, said in a statement that the new fees would bring Medicaid in line with other insurers, like private insurance, which have a dispensing fee of $1.35 to $2 per prescription.
But Ray Perryman, a Texas economist, said the plan could cost the state economy $3.1 billion in lost jobs and reduced business to pharmacies. Mr. Perryman said it could also force the closing of 770 Texas pharmacies, mostly independent establishments and small chains.
Tammy Gray, a spokeswoman for Pharmacy Choice and Action Now, said ordering medications from suppliers would be harder for pharmacies, which will be working with less money.
Ms. Gray, who owns a pharmacy, said she also believes that pharmacy benefit managers will charge the state more for reimbursement claims than if the state were managing its own Medicaid program.
Pharmacy benefit managers and their lobbying have ''highly influenced'' the state, Ms. Gray said. ''They're convincing the state it will save them money,'' she said. ''How can you save money when you put a middleman in the middle?''
Ms. Goodman said that if pharmacy benefit managers set the rate too low, they will lose the contract. But some pharmacists say they had no choice but to accept the lower rates.
Mr. Martinez said he would hate to turn away patients because he would not take a specific pharmacy benefit manager. ''I feel like we're forced to sign these reimbursement rates to continue to fill prescriptions and stay in business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Privately Owned Park, Open to the Public, May Make Its Own Rules

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Zuccotti Park, the half-acre plaza in Lower Manhattan now synonymous with Occupy Wall Street, exists in a strange category of New York parkland, identified by a seeming oxymoron: a privately owned public space.
The park was established in a wave of development that spurred corporate plazas after changes were made to the city's zoning laws in the early 1960s. The laws generally give real estate developers zoning concessions in exchange for public space. There are now at least 520 such parks, arcades and plazas in New York City, both indoors and out, providing a total of 3.5 million square feet of space.
Zuccotti is unusual in that it does not adjoin the 54-story office tower, 1 Liberty Plaza, that spawned it. Rather, it is bounded on all four sides by streets: Broadway, Trinity Place, and Cedar and Liberty Streets. 
And while the developer did not win the right to build a larger structure in exchange for the park, it was given leeway on certain height and setback restrictions, according to Jerold S. Kayden, a lawyer and professor of urban planning and design at Harvard University.
Perhaps most important, from the perspective of a long-term protest like Occupy Wall Street, Zuccotti Park -- unlike city-owned parks -- is open 24 hours a day. Private parks and plazas that were developed under the original zoning rules governing them are generally open around the clock, while those created under more recent rules may close from dusk to dawn. About half of the privately owned plazas are required to be open 24 hours a day, according to the Department of City Planning.
By contrast, the city's parks all have curfews: the latest is 1 a.m.; a number close much earlier. All playgrounds close at dusk, and some parks in Queens have curfews as early as 9 p.m. So an encampment like the one at Zuccotti Park would be impossible in a city park, where structures like tents are prohibited without a permit.
''The city had a policy for encouraging commercial developers to create open space in exchange for more height,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. ''But until now, no one has thought about the issue of what the rules are. This has highlighted one of the gaps in New York's planning system.''
Even those privately owned public spaces that do not have curfews may still impose ''reasonable'' rules regarding behavior, however.
Brookfield Office Properties, the owner of Zuccotti Park, recently posted new rules against camping, lying on the ground or benches, and using sleeping bags, but up until now those rules have not been enforced.
Enforcement would fall to the building's management company, Professor Kayden said, but if park users refuse to comply, the management may call on the Police Department for help, as it has in an effort to clean out the park.
No doubt, one reason Zuccotti proved attractive to the protesters was its location in the heart of the financial district. It is also one of the largest private parks in the city, featuring low stone benches, large beds of ornamental grasses and a dense canopy of trees.
But the overall effect in Zuccotti and most other private plazas is more sleek than sylvan. ''There's not a blade of grass,'' said Melissa Coley, a spokeswoman for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the building and the park.
Over the years, private parks and plazas -- some with dramatic waterfalls -- have won mixed reviews.
''Many are of marginal quality, which is another way of saying they're lousy,'' said Professor Kayden, who studied the public spaces for his book ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience.''
''Zuccotti,'' he said, ''falls in the middle.''

ICAHN'S STAKE The activist investor Carl C. Icahn, below, disclosed on Thursday that he had built up a 9.8 percent stake in Navistar International, a maker of trucks and buses. In a securities filing, Mr. Icahn said he had already held discussions with management, including about potentially adding members to the board. Mr. Icahn did not say anything more about his intentions. His playbook has ranged from pushing a company to explore a potential sale to making his own takeover bid, though with the hope that someone else will come in with a higher price.

HEADLINE: Looking to Save Money, More Places Decide to Stop Fluoridating the Water

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- A growing number of communities are choosing to stop adding fluoride to their water systems, even though the federal government and federal health officials maintain their full support for a measure they say provides a 25 percent reduction in tooth decay nationwide.
Last week, Pinellas County, on Florida's west coast, voted to stop adding fluoride to its public water supply after starting the program seven years ago. The county joins about 200 jurisdictions from Georgia to Alaska that have chosen to end the practice in the last four years, motivated both by tight budgets and by skepticism about its benefits.
Eleven small cities or towns have opted out of fluoridating their water this year, including Fairbanks, Alaska, which acted after much deliberation and a comprehensive evaluation by a panel of scientists, doctors and dentists. The panel concluded that in Fairbanks, which has relatively high concentrations of naturally occurring fluoride, the extra dose no longer provided the help it once did and may, in fact, be harmful.
It is a view that also was shared by four out of seven commissioners in Pinellas County who first raised the proposal as a cost cutting measure. 
''I'm in opposition to putting a medical treatment into the public drinking water supply without a vote of the people who drink that water,'' said Norm Roche, a newly elected Republican county commissioner who spent 10 years doing policy research for the county Water Department and who led the turnaround effort. ''We had a dozen to 15 doctors, dentists, dental hygienists and chemists here who want us to continue this practice but who could not agree themselves on how best to use fluoride.''
Some 700,000 people -- 75 percent of the county -- will be affected by the vote. The rest receive water from a different source.
But the United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the communities that stop adding fluoride to the water supply are misguided. The government continues to recommend the practice, which began in the 1940s and has had its share of recent successes, including San Diego's move to fluoridate water this year after a long delay. Some 72 percent of the population in the country drinks water with added fluoride.
Keeping fluoride in water is especially important today because many people cannot afford dental care, public officials say.
''We have had big wins and significant losses,'' Dr. William Bailey, chief dental officer for the Public Health Service and acting director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of oral health, said about the skirmishes over fluoridation. ''Fluoridation helps people of all ages and income groups. And it helps people who can't get in to receive care.''
The movement to stop fluoridating water has gained traction, in large part, because the government has recently cautioned the public about excessive fluoride. A report released late last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked fluoride to an increase among children in dental fluorosis, which causes white or yellow spots on teeth. About 40 percent of children ages 12 to 15 had dental fluorosis, mostly very mild or mild cases, from 1999 to 2004. That percentage was 22.6 in a 1986-87 study.
Fluorosis is mostly a cosmetic problem that can sometimes be bleached away. But critics argue that spotted teeth are a warning that other bones in the body may be absorbing too much fluoride. Excessive fluoride can lead to increases in bone fractures in adults as well as pain and tenderness.
''Teeth are the window to the bones,'' said Paul Connett, a retired professor of environmental chemistry and the director of the Fluoride Action Network, which advocates an end to fluoridated water.
Experts say that one possible factor in this increase may be that fluoridated water is consumed in vegetables and fruit, and juice and other beverages as well as tap water. And the consumption of beverages continues to increase.
In January, the federal Department of Health and Human Services recommended reducing the fluoride put into the water supply to 0.7 milligrams per liter of water. The longtime standard had ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 milligrams per liter. At the lowest level, the risk of fluorosis is decreased, the government says.
The government also informed parents of infants who exclusively use infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water that their children face an increased risk of fluorosis and suggested they use low-fluoride water, like distilled water, some of the time. ''It was a trigger,'' said Mr. Connett. ''People who had heard there is nothing wrong with fluoridation all of the sudden are hearing that kids are getting too much fluoride.''
Money worries and a growing distrust of government have also helped invigorate the movement. With the recession squeezing budgets and the cost of fluoride increasing (some fluoride is imported), communities have been more willing to take a look at the issue.
For decades, the issue of fluoridated water remained on the fringes. The John Birch Society took up the cause, seeing fluoride as a communist plot to poison the nation. References to Nazis using fluoride to pacify prisoners in concentration camps -- a claim that was never proved -- circulate even today. At least one person at the Pinellas County meeting made reference to both the Soviets and the Nazis.
But as more places, like Fairbanks and parts of Canada, take up the issue in a more measured way, it is shifting away from conspiracy and toward the mainstream.
The conclusion among these communities is that with fluoride now so widely available in toothpaste and mouthwash, there is less need to add it to water, which already has naturally occurring fluoride. Putting it in tap water, they say, is an imprecise way of distributing fluoride; how much fluoride a person gets depends on body weight and water consumed.
Doctors, scientists and dentists, including Dr. Bailey of the Public Health Service, mostly agree that fluoride works best when applied topically, directly to the teeth, as happens with brushing.
''The fact that no one really knows what dosage a given person receives from fluoridated water makes the subject of benefits and harms very difficult to quantify,'' said Rainer Newberry, a professor of geochemistry at University of Alaska, Fairbanks, who sat on the committee that studied the issue prior to the June vote in Fairbanks. ''And this presumably explains the number of studies with diverging conclusions.''
But Kenneth T. Welch, a Pinellas County commissioner who voted to continue adding fluoride to the water, said he was stunned by the commission's decision, saying it was pushed by Tea Party supporters. He called for another vote on Tuesday but the outcome was the same. Fluoridation will end in the affected areas of the county by Dec. 31. The county expects to save $205,000 annually from halting fluoride use.
''Political rhetoric won out over science and the best advice of our medical and dental community,'' Mr. Welch said.

HEADLINE: Inflation in China Eases, but Food Prices Up Sharply

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Inflation slowed slightly for consumers last month in China and slowed a little more at factories, as stringent controls on bank lending and a gradually strengthening currency began to tame strongly rising prices, data released by the Chinese government on Friday showed. 
But consumer prices still rose rapidly for the most politically significant category, food, with prices up 13.4 percent last month from a year earlier, the same as in August, although down from a peak of 14.8 percent in July.
Over all, consumer prices were up 6.1 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with increases of 6.2 percent for August and a peak of 6.5 percent in July. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao conceded in early summer that China would not meet its goal of keeping consumer inflation below 4 percent this year.
But producer prices, measured at the factory gate, showed a more pronounced pull back last month, which could be a sign of moderating inflation in the months to come. Producer prices were up 6.5 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with 7.3 percent in August and a peak of 7.5 percent in July.
China has allowed its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate slightly more quickly this autumn as a way to make imports cheaper and control inflation, although most economists still say the currency is undervalued and the Senate approved legislation this week to make it easier for companies to obtain tariffs on Chinese imports that may benefit from China's daily intervention in currency markets to hold down the value of the renminbi. Slowing inflation together with weakening overseas demand has prompted some economists to warn that China may now put the brakes on renminbi appreciation, which could aggravate tensions with the United States.

Of the estimated 40,000 residents on Pine Ridge's 2.2 million acres, 47 percent live below the federal poverty level, and 65 to 80 percent of adults are thought to be unemployed. This episode is the latest installment in Ms. Sawyer's ongoing report about people living on the margins of society in the United States. 
8:30 A.M. (HBO) SOMETHING THE LORD MADE (2004) In this adaptation of a true story, Alan Rickman plays Dr. Alfred Blalock, who pioneered open-heart surgery. Mos Def, at left below with Mr. Rickman, is Vivien Thomas, a janitor who became Dr. Blalock's technician. As a black man in the Depression-era South, he had his medical insights go largely uncredited.

What they don't count on is being pursued by thugs with guns (Jimmi Simpson and Common) after being mistaken for the blackmailers (James Franco and Mila Kunis) whose reservation they stole. Mark Wahlberg plays a former client, a sort of special-ops expert with stellar pecs and a knowledge of Hebrew, to whom Claire turns for help. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott said the film ''is superior to most recent movies of its kind, the marital action comedy. This is not saying much.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Senate Approves Casino Measure

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Senate passed a bill on Thursday that would legalize casino gambling, paving the way for three resort-style casinos and one slots parlor in the state. 
Past attempts to legalize casino gambling failed, but the idea gained popularity recently as the recession tempered the state's economic growth.
The Senate bill passed 24 to 14 after days of debate. Last month, the state's House passed a bill allowing the same number of gambling establishments. Some differences remain, but they are expected to be resolved in a conference committee of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, and Gov. Deval Patrick has indicated he will sign the final legislation.
Last year, a gambling measure failed when Mr. Patrick and the House speaker, Robert A. DeLeo, disagreed on the number of slots parlors. The new legislation emerged after months of closed-door negotiations involving Mr. Patrick, Mr. DeLeo and Senate President Therese Murray.
Scott Harshbarger, a former state attorney general who is now president of the anticasino group Citizens for a Stronger Massachusetts, criticized what he said was too much secrecy.
''This was just a classic, Massachusetts, behind-closed-doors power play by the special interests and lobbyists and casino owners,'' Mr. Harshbarger said. ''Only the public interest lost.''
Supporters promote casino gambling as a major job creator, saying it will drive industry growth in construction, service and tourism.
''It has potential to bring home $1.2 billion that's being spent by Massachusetts residents in neighboring states' casinos,'' said Senator Stanley C. Rosenberg, a Democratic supporter, ''and, at the same time, create more than 10,000 jobs and provides hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.''
But opponents say gambling is a false carrot that increases crime and encourages addiction.
''It is tantamount to a tax on the poor; though we do have a grave budget that we need to cover, covering it on the backs of poor and working-class families is not the right thing to do,'' said State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, a Democrat who represents parts of Boston.
Nearby states that have legalized gambling are watching the development in Massachusetts warily. Connecticut has two resort-style casinos that could lose business to Massachusetts casinos. Rhode Island has expressed concerns that its two slots parlors could also suffer; a study by the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, found Massachusetts residents made up 56 percent of visitors to the Rhode Island establishments in 2010.

HEADLINE: Why Republicans Killed the Jobs Bill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''No Jobs Bill, and No Ideas'' (editorial, Oct. 13):
There are two clear reasons Senate Republicans filibustered the president's jobs bill: just 10 Republican senators are up for re-election in 2012, and the only goal Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, and his cronies have for 2012 is the defeat of President Obama, and too bad about the 14 million unemployed and countless millions of underemployed and those who have simply given up any hope of getting a job.
Truth be told, there are more than 20 million people who will continue suffering because of the Republican failure to pass the American Jobs Act. 
Creating well-paying jobs is the only way to save the American economy. By creating 200,000 to 300,000 new jobs every month, we would increase the tax base and not even have to think about raising taxes on anyone in America.
People with jobs would be able to keep their homes, send their children to college, and once again buy goods and services. That would create more profits for American companies, adding revenues to the tax base and lowering the deficit.
What Senate Republicans have done is shameful, disgraceful and a major blow to the economic health of our nation.
HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN New York, Oct. 13, 2011
The writer is senior director of an executive recruiting firm.
To the Editor:
I doubt that lawmakers will seriously consider any meaningful action to ameliorate unemployment before the 2012 elections. From press releases and podiums, rhetoric will be abundant but solutions scarce.
Obviously, Republicans have a strategic interest in prolonging a dismal economic environment through next year. Democrats justifiably bemoan the opposition's intransigence. But the health care debate, the deficit and assorted other dramas have distracted their attention, setting up an election-year scenario where voters, many of whom are unemployed, barely employed or fearful of losing their jobs, will not consider the various legislative achievements of the Democrats and the Obama administration.
While Republicans haven't offered a viable alternative to President Obama's jobs bill, they have managed to seed doubts about not only its efficacy but also its timing, asserting that it is a disingenuous and desperate campaign ploy.
While it may be impossible to transmit the nuance of the economic debate to an anxious electorate at this late date, Democrats need to unequivocally and forcefully call the Republicans' bluff.
WAYNE TRUJILLO Denver, Oct. 13, 2011
To the Editor:
By voting to defeat President Obama's jobs bill, Senate Republicans seeking re-election in 2012 deserve to lose their seats. Their negative vote shows zero sensitivity and compassion for millions of unemployed Americans.
During the last three years, the Republican Party has become the party of negativity. Its leaders are banking on the electorate's swallowing hook, line and sinker the oft-repeated party line: ''Obama must be a one-term president.''
If Republicans discount what the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators are saying, the G.O.P. will lose big in 2012. Voters all over America are much smarter than Republicans give them credit for.
The vast number of voters struggling to make ends meet in today's faltering economy want to know what new ideas Republicans have for creating jobs. Tax cuts for the rich and trickle-down economics just don't work for an overwhelming majority of hurting citizens.

HEADLINE: Earnings Decline by 4% For JPMorgan Chase

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
8:57 p.m. Updated
Despite a paper gain that helped lift earnings by nearly $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase & Company reported on Thursday that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter amid lingering mortgage troubles and weak investment banking results.
Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. 
The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts' consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60.
Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing.
''It hasn't really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,'' Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday.
In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter.
The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter.
That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit.
Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank's results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth.
One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan's investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank's employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 - an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions.
As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses.
The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company.
Investors are so concerned about the banks' prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits.
What's more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies.
The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan's investment bank's results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank's large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets.
Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September.
Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. ''We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,'' he said.
Chase Home Lending, the bank's mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon.
''We don't expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,'' Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. ''It's hard not to be cautious.''
On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion.
The bank's other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase's large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations.
JPMorgan's asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Unemployed Don't Care Whether It's Structural or Cyclical

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
As Rahm Emanuel unveiled his first budget Wednesday morning, Deborah Benford stood at 43rd Street and Cottage Grove Avenue and personified the economic context in which the mayor operates.
She was outside the Martin Luther King Community Center, an austere outpost of the Chicago Department of Social Services. There are chairs in the waiting room, but you can't sit on them because they have become a hangout for drug dealers seeking haven from the police. 
Ms. Benford, who is college-educated but currently unemployed after leaving her job as a care manager at a homeless shelter, waited outside on the crisp, clear morning. It was a day after President Obama's proposed jobs bill went down the tubes in the Senate, prompting her provocative analogy.
''It reminds me of Council Wars,'' she said, alluding to the mid-1980s standoff between Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, and the white Council majority.
That nationally watched contretemps, which inspired The Wall Street Journal to call the city Beirut by the Lake, was about a political faction obsessed with not letting ''a man do what needed to be done,'' she recalled accurately.
Now, in her mind, Mr. Obama is hamstrung by opponents ''risking people's lives to make a political point.''
Ms. Benford, 52, is a divorced mother of two college-educated professional sons and has a master's degree in social work and student loan debts of $80,000. She left a $36,000-a-year job at a shelter for women and children two years ago to deal with an aunt suffering from Alzheimer's. She made less than $5,000 doing census work but has found nothing since.
''I'm not collecting welfare or food stamps,'' she said, explaining how she moved in with the aunt and relies financially on her brothers and sisters.
She shows up regularly at the center, each week told that there's nothing available and to bring more documentation. On this day, she has a copy of her bachelor's degree from Quincy University. She needs to bring a birth certificate next week.
Old-fashioned government jobs programs are tough to sell these days because the benefits seem slower and more indirect than politicians like. They were easier under machine politics, when spoils went to bosses who dispensed them for practical and political gain.
As a younger generation protests Wall Street influence, the poor I've met don't have any basic problem with capitalism; they simply want a piece of it. To that extent, they're linked to the Tea Party and Occupy movements -- frustrated and with no convincing solutions.
After leaving the center, I drove two miles to a different universe in the same ward, the University of Chicago's graduate business school. It's in a dazzling and light-drenched cubist building, where tomorrow's star entrepreneurs and corporate chiefs chat in its sleek lobby.
There I met a friend, Austan Goolsbee, a hotshot young economist delighted to be back from the mess of Washington after loyal service to President Obama, including a job as chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.
He has returned to an environ where clashing views are aggressively expounded but respectfully tolerated -- and where brainy souls scratch their heads about our persisting economic travail.
There is continuing debate as to whether our problem is structural or cyclical. There is no consensus.
Some argue that it will take 7 to 10 years to come back after the financial crisis, while others believe we endured a real estate bubble aggravated by international events and will return to normalcy sooner. One Goolsbee colleague contends that ours is a debt saga, finding a link between high consumer debt and areas of high unemployment.
Mr. Goolsbee doesn't think that the unemployed like Ms. Benford, who are skilled and educated, are unemployable and victims of structural changes. He supports a mix of tax incentives for businesses and substantial government infrastructure investments.
For sure, some elements defy previous conventional wisdom. Many in his realm assumed deregulating financial institutions would have a more positive effect and expected a big recession to inspire a strong, fairly expeditious comeback.
Not so. For him and others, a debate on, say, ''how the credit channels work and why we're not generating more jobs more quickly are some of the most important, toughest issues economists are grappling with.''
In their different silos, bright people do what they can. Mr. Goolsbee dissects, the Missile leads, and a dignified Ms. Benford mostly stands.

WASHINGTON -- Leading members of Congress joined the defense secretary and the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Thursday in arguing against any additional cuts in military spending as a special committee seeks to find more than a trillion dollars in new savings in the overall budget.
The Pentagon is already struggling to meet an order to cut more than $450 billion over the next decade, but a number of budget analysts and advocates for social programs say the military may have to give up even more. 
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta has said the current budget cuts, while manageable, will be difficult to carry out.
But he has warned of the ''catastrophic'' effects if the special budget committee fails to find at least $1.2 trillion in additional spending cuts by late November. In case of such a stalemate, a system called sequestration kicks in, which would automatically slash an estimated additional $600 billion from the Pentagon. If that occurs, Mr. Panetta said Thursday, ''it'll truly devastate our national defense.''
Some experts predict that a middle ground may emerge: The budget panel may find nearly all the required savings, and to avoid the pain of sequestration, the Defense Department will be ordered to find additional savings -- but less than $600 billion.
According to Mr. Panetta, even that would be unacceptable, and he said Thursday that President Obama agreed with him.
During a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Panetta was asked by Representative William M. Thornberry, Republican of Texas, whether he believed that no further cuts in the military budget should be made beyond those already enacted.
''Correct,'' Mr. Panetta replied.
When asked whether Mr. Obama shared that view, the defense secretary stated, ''He does.''
Whether politics -- and the desire to avoid sequestration -- will allow the Pentagon to avoid any additional budget cuts remains an unknown, but one that has planners across the military deeply worried.
Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, assured Congress that he remained ''fully committed to reducing costs without compromising our nation's security needs.''
But he warned that ''these choices need to be deliberate and precise.''
''Indiscriminate cuts,'' General Dempsey said, ''would cause self-inflicted and potentially irrevocable wounds to our national security.''
Their assessment was endorsed by senior House members, starting with Representative Howard P. McKeon, the California Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
''Too many appear to believe that we can maintain a solid defense that is driven by budget choices, not strategic ones,'' Mr. McKeon said. ''Defense has contributed more than half of the deficit reduction measures taken to date. There are some in government who want to use the military to pay for the rest, to protect the sacred cow that is entitlement spending. Not only should that be a nonstarter from a national security and economic perspective, but it should also be a nonstarter from a moral perspective.''
The committee's ranking Democrat, Representative Adam Smith of Washington, released a letter calling on the special budget committee ''to avoid cuts to the national defense accounts beyond the reductions already applied.''
''Further reductions could undermine national security,'' Mr. Smith wrote. He advocated that the committee include significant revenue increases -- taxes -- as part of its plan to reduce the deficit.
In the Senate, a leading Republican, John McCain of Arizona, said Thursday that he would champion an effort to prevent any further cuts in military spending, even if the special budget committee fails to find the trillion-dollars-plus in savings required for a deal.
Mr. McCain said that if the so-called super committee failed to reach a deal to reduce the deficit, he would ''be among the first on the floor to nullify that provision'' calling for sequestration. ''It's something we passed,'' he said. ''We can reverse it.''
The House hearing was disrupted to an unusual degree in its opening minutes by protesters giving voice not only to antiwar sentiments but also to opposition to military spending, which has almost doubled since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

HEADLINE: Some Cows Still Sacred Under Mayor's Budget

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS; Hunter Clauss contributed reporting.. 
dmihalopoulos@chicagonews coop.org

 BODY:
After Mayor Rahm Emanuel released his first annual budget this week, many City Hall observers, as well as the mayor, spoke of how the new administration was putting Chicago's political sacred cows to the sword.
Certainly, Mr. Emanuel's 2012 financial plan represents a marked departure from many of the policies that were immutable during the 22-year tenure of Mayor Richard M. Daley. But some sacred cows remain untouchable, for now.
Under Mr. Daley, the budgets of the Police and Fire Departments swelled. Three-person crews whisked away whatever trash was left at the curb, at great cost. And legions of blue-collar city workers could look forward to annual pay raises and good benefits. 
Spending perennially outstripped revenues, even before the recession aggravated the problem and made it obvious ''that Chicagoans have more government than they can afford,'' according to budget documents released by the Emanuel administration on Wednesday.
Mr. Emanuel has begun to bring the size of city government in line with its means. He proposes a decrease in day-to-day spending of 5.4 percent next year, to about $3.1 billion annually.
Reversing longstanding fifth-floor dogma, Mr. Emanuel acknowledged that the Police Department's ranks were not going to be as vast as had been promised, and he called for a more cost-effective approach to garbage pickup. The mayor also identified 500 employees who would be laid off, and he factored in a far bigger cushion for cost overruns than Mr. Daley had budgeted in recent years. Where Mr. Daley drained reserve funds to balance the books, Mr. Emanuel said he intended instead to add to those rainy-day accounts next year.
Yet some of City Hall's greatest fiscal challenges will be allowed to fester at least a little longer.
''Mayor Emanuel's proposal dramatically reduces the structural deficit, but it does not fully bring the city's finances out of the woods,'' said Laurence Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a nonpartisan watchdog group.
Mr. Emanuel told aldermen that he had not yet attacked the largest issue affecting the city's bottom line: the underfinanced employee pension system. ''As tough as this budget is, it only addresses part of our deficit problem,'' he said. ''Our pension obligations are clearly unsustainable.''
The city will spend more than $475 million on pension contributions in 2012, budget documents show. That is what the city will be required to do by statute, but the Emanuel administration will not immediately accomplish any more than Mr. Daley in denting Chicago's unfinanced pension liabilities.
On paper, personnel costs would decline because Mr. Emanuel wants to erase more than 2,000 unfilled jobs, including 1,252 police vacancies. But for more than 90 percent of the remaining employees, union contracts signed by Mr. Daley dictate that the city must increase wages. The Police and Fire Departments together account for most of the payroll.
''For decades, our public safety functions were walled off from budget cuts or other changes that would have made them more effective,'' Mr. Emanuel said.
The Police Department would face cuts under Mr. Emanuel's plan. The Fire Department would lose only 49 of its more than 5,100 budgeted positions, and its budget would rise 8.2 percent, to more than $550 million.
Efforts to make more significant trims to personnel costs will have to wait until the union contracts for firefighters and other employees are renegotiated. The police and firefighters' contracts expire on June 30.
There were recent signs of the sort of labor-management cooperation that Mr. Emanuel said he wanted. ''But I don't think that means we're going to give them bonbons across the bargaining table, and I don't think that they expect that,'' said Alderman Patrick O'Connor, of the 40th Ward, who was appointed by Mr. Emanuel to lead the City Council committee that will oversee employee compensation deals. ''We're still going to be working on trying to get lean labor agreements.''
Because personnel costs make up the vast majority of the core budget, what happens behind closed doors in the contract negotiations could factor as heavily on the bottom line as the coming Council debate over the sacred cows Emanuel is trying to slay.

HEADLINE: It's Expensive and Classy, But It's No Longer a Boat

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
FROM tailfin Cadillacs to the Hummers of the S.U.V. heyday, the principles of auto luxury have been passed down like slab-sided commandments: bigger, stronger, faster.
But with new environmental regulations staring them in the face, luxury carmakers are trying on a new set of values -- smaller, humbler and more fuel-efficient -- that might shock a large-barge traditionalist.
Downsizing is the rage among luxury cars, from slimmed-down bodies to smaller four-cylinder engines and hybrid or electric power. 
Land Rover's striking, $44,000 Range Rover Evoque crossover is the lightest, most fuel-efficient Rover in history. Powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder rather than a beefy V-8, the Evoque earns a federal highway rating of 28 m.p.g.
Lexus bills its CT 200h as the world's first compact luxury hybrid hatchback. BMW plans to begin leasing small numbers of its Active E, an all-electric version of its perky 1 Series coupe, in urban markets. Small sedans, crossovers or hatchbacks are in the works from Cadillac, Mercedes, Lincoln, Porsche and more.
Even an imposing sport sedan, the exotically styled Fisker Karma, goes for a tiny game-changer under the hood: A two-liter G.M. four-cylinder mated to a plug-in hybrid system, good for 403 total horsepower.
In some ways, industry downsizing is a do-it-or-else proposition. A federal target of 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025, along with anticipated carbon dioxide emissions rules in Europe, have even deluxe brands scrambling to increase fuel efficiency.
But a question remains: Shy of $6-a-gallon gasoline, are enough Americans willing to spend big bucks on a little car?
Smaller luxury cars, many powered by frugal diesels, have proliferated in Europe. But Americans have rarely seen the point of buying less car, especially when a roomier version can be had for roughly the same price.
''We're still a bit in the experiment stage,'' said Jeff Schuster, director of forecasting for J. D. Power & Associates.
The list of America's most notorious luxury failures is littered with small, entry-priced models. Lower the bar too far in styling, features or power, and American critics and buyers quickly sniff out a designer impostor.
In the '80s, Cadillac dressed up a rattletrap Chevrolet Cavalier and called it the Cimarron. Consumers weren't fooled.
Cadillac will look to correct that mistake with the ATS sedan, a taut-bodied BMW 3 Series fighter that goes on sale next year. Caddy is also developing a compact plug-in hybrid based on the Chevrolet Volt's system.
As with the Cimarron, a cut-rate luxury car can tarnish the image of an entire brand. That's what happened when Jaguar -- desperate for its own entry-level rival to the BMW 3 Series -- disguised a Ford Mondeo sedan with leather and a feline ''leaper'' badge and tried to pass off the shoddy result as the 2001 X-Type. The Jag later joined the Cimarron on a Time magazine list of the 50 worst cars of all time.
Yet automakers and analysts say that much has changed. Soaring fuel prices and concerns over climate change have even wealthy customers checking their wallets or questioning consumption.
Mr. Schuster notes that, in contrast to the social climbers of yesteryear -- conspicuously rebadged versions of mainstream models -- new versions tend to be sophisticated, stand-alone designs. The success of BMW's Mini has also helped make the market safe for premium small cars, for both automakers and buyers.
For Mercedes, the German automaker has long restricted its affordable, front-drive A-Class hatchback and B-Class minivan to foreign markets, suspecting that Americans would reject these practical-yet-frumpy machines.
But Mercedes has radically revamped these small cars with Americans in mind. At New York's auto show in April, Mercedes showed a stunning A-Class concept, which along with a more-stylish B-Class, is being readied for America in 2013. Small four-cylinder turbo engines will power those models, which analysts expect will start around $30,000, and Mercedes plans hybrid or electric variants.
''If you're half-hearted about downsizing, people perceive that model as being less,'' said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes. ''But these cars will be every inch a Mercedes.''
For leading luxury brands, entry-priced sedans or crossovers at roughly $30,000 to $50,000 -- including the 3 Series, Audi Q5 and Mercedes C-Class -- have become crucial drivers of sales and profits. But as these cars have grown larger and costlier, automakers see a fertile niche just below and a chance to capture younger buyers, perhaps for life.
As Mercedes developed its premium small-car strategy, the automaker identified a mass of buyers from Generation X and Y entering peak earning years of roughly age 40 to 54, even as baby boomers eased into retirement.
''This is a different buyer group than what we've dealt with for decades, with different ideas on what and how they want to drive,'' Ms. Boland said.
The numbers appear promising. J. D. Power projects sales of small premium cars to reach 450,000 by 2015, from just 100,000 in 2005. Pint-size models would account for nearly one in five luxury sales, up from one in 20 in 2005.
Perhaps no car symbolizes the changing order like the Aston Martin Cygnet. The British ultraluxury brand, famed for six-figure Grand Touring cars, has given the Toyota iQ, a tiny city car in the vein of the Smart, an opulent makeover. The resulting Cygnet, powered by a mere 1.3-liter engine, is on sale in Europe for about $48,000. Aston may consider bringing the microcar to big-city markets here in coming years.
Since the negative fallout over the X-Type, Jaguar has never again tried a compact model. But Ian Callum, Jaguar's influential chief designer, has acknowledged the lineup's glaring lack of a small sedan or crossover and suggests those holes may soon be filled.

HEADLINE: Offshore Oil Helps Brazil Lead Boom

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Of all those who might smile at Brazil's unfolding oil boom, Walter Link could rank near the top. A U.S. oilman here at a time of nationalist fervor, he was the former chief geologist for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey whom Brazil hired to find its oil reserves.
The year was 1954. Petrobras, the newly created national oil company, put the blunt, Indiana-born Link to work creating Brazil's oil exploration sector. Six long years ensued before he issued his polemical ''Link Report,'' describing tepid results. For Brazil to meet its oil needs, he recommended going offshore or abroad.
Petrobras grew at its own impressive pace for decades, mixing progress with setbacks as Brazil struggled with drawn-out dependence on foreign oil. But Petrobras's huge offshore oil discoveries in recent years now enable its leaders to contend that it could surpass Exxon Mobil -- called Standard Oil in Walter Link's day -- as the world's largest publicly-traded oil company. 
''Petrobras is engaged in by far the biggest industrial undertaking in Brazil's history,'' said Norman Gall, director of the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics in Sao Paulo.
Mr. Gall said Petrobras's annual spending, estimated at more than $45 billion through 2020, might surpass NASA's budget in the 1960s -- when it was preparing to send a man to the moon.
Brazil, which is maintaining investments to increase oil production even as turmoil hits financial markets in Brazil and around the world, is leading a shift in Latin America's oil industry with the potential to alter the geopolitics of energy.
By the 2020s, if the stars align in Brazil's favor, the country could emerge as the fourth-largest oil producer after Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States.
Brazil's rise as an oil power is part of a broader expansion of the Western Hemisphere's energy output, especially in the United States and Canada. But it also offers a vivid example of the reordering of Latin America's energy hierarchy in which traditional energy exporters like Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia are seeing their sway eclipsed by nations with big discoveries.
Emerging exploration technologies like those capable of tapping rock formations by combining horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing explain some of the focus on the region's potential to produce new oil kings.
In May, for instance, Argentina announced its biggest oil discovery since the 1980s in a sprawling Patagonian shale deposit, luring new interest from foreign companies like Apache Corporation and Exxon Mobil.
Argentina ranked third in the world, after China and the United States, in shale gas reserves with about 22 trillion cubic meters, or 774 trillion cubic feet, according to a report released in April by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Neighboring Paraguay and Uruguay, both marginal energy players, also boast enviable shale reserves, as do swaths of southern Brazil. Mexico, a traditional oil powerhouse where nationalist policies have kept large output increases in check, has huge shale gas reserves ranked fourth in the world.
Beyond the focus on shale, energy strategists say Latin America's profile is set to rise as the global economy relies more on a range of energy sources, like sugarcane ethanol and the lithium found in the vast salt flats high in the Andes. New discoveries in recent months also underscore the potential to open new oil frontiers.
For instance, Tullow Oil, the British oil company that made a huge 2007 discovery off the coast of Ghana, said in September that it had found oil off French Guiana's coast, in a basin that may be geologically similar to West Africa.
Elsewhere in South America, the exodus of Venezuelan petroleum engineers after President Hugo Chavez purged Venezuela's oil industry of dissident employees is lifting the fortunes of neighboring Colombia, where output has roughly doubled in five years to almost one million barrels a day.
If Colombia improves security conditions further, officials see production climbing to 1.7 million barrels by 2020. In Brazil alone, output may increase from just above two million barrels a day to more than five million by 2020, about the equivalent of adding another Kuwait to world oil production.
The region's oil boom is notable not just for rising producers but also because energy-rich countries in Venezuela's ideological sphere of influence, which have asserted greater state control of natural resources, are largely being excluded from the output gains.
''We're coming to the end of the cycle of leftist ideology-driven politics in Latin America, which were a reaction to the free-market ideas fashionable in the '90s,'' said Roger Tissot, an independent energy consultant. ''More centrist positions are starting to prevail.''
Perhaps no country in the region better illustrates its potential -- and its capacity to fall short -- than Venezuela, which surpassed Saudi Arabia this year as the nation with the largest oil reserves, at 1.19 trillion barrels.
Pointing to the influence that Venezuela might possibly wield in global markets, the U.S. Geological Survey said that just one of its hydrocarbon assets, the heavy oil found in an area called the Orinoco Belt, called the Faja in Venezuela, is the largest oil accumulation it ever assessed.
But that geological good fortune arguably has not translated into broader energy clout for Venezuela. The country's regional influence has waned in recent years as its national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, has struggled to raise output while focusing on other objectives like subsidized food distribution.
Venezuelan energy laws remain more welcoming to foreigners than those in Saudi Arabia or Mexico. But oil executives contend that a range of factors limit the advance of projects, including the difficulty in attaining financing in a country prone to nationalization and ceding control to Petroleos de Venezuela.
''The oil is there, but the conditions, both financial and physical, are so far from ready for prime time that getting foreigners to risk money in the Faja is one tough slog,'' said Francisco Toro, founder of the Venezuelan political blog Caracas Chronicles.
While Venezuela and Brazil maintain warm ties with one another, and have even explored collaborating on a refinery project in northeastern Brazil, one country's loss is effectively another's gain in regional political heft.
Brazil's new naval buildup, for instance, would give its military a heavier presence from its deepwater oil fields into South Atlantic sea lanes.
Other countries in the region, notably Colombia, have taken note of Brazil's experience in the 1990s of exposing Petrobras to market forces by issuing shares that now trade in Sao Paulo and New York, while still maintaining state control.
Of course, big challenges still await Brazil's energy industry. The devilish complexity of producing oil from its ''pre-salt'' discoveries off the coasts of the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, located in water 3,000 meters, or 9,800 feet, deep and beneath about 4,000 meters of salt, sand and rock, have some investors questioning whether Petrobras is overextending itself.
Just one discovery made in 2007, called Tupi at the time and now renamed Lula, may hold as much as eight billion barrels of oil and natural gas, making it a contender for second-largest field discovered in the past two decades, behind Kazakhstan's Kashagan Field.
The logistics of the new offshore fields, located so far into the Atlantic that Petrobras needs entire platforms midway to the coast where workers can sojourn between land and sea, are not the only challenges.
Bitter talks between Brasilia and regional officials over royalties could delay development of new fields, and portend protracted revenue disputes. Middle East oil remains cheaper to produce, while cost overruns here could limit the ability to meet output targets.
Energy historians also warn that the bounty off Brazil's coast could become a resource curse when big inflows from oil exports start streaming in.
Brazilian leaders, guiding a highly diversified economy, seem aware of the risks. They have taken the important step of creating a sovereign wealth fund to invest some revenues.
The prophetic Venezuelan oil minister, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, who helped create OPEC five decades ago, understood an oil bonanza's hazards. He disparaged his country's triumphalism and spending sprees and what he called ''economic indigestion,'' when officials focused on megaprojects and neglected essentials like education.
''A wave of money,'' Mr. Perez Alfonzo warned in the 1970s when Venezuela's prospects seemed as promising as Brazil's today, ''can destroy as well as create.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Squeezed Out in India, Students Turn to U.S.

BYLINE: By NIDA NAJAR

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Moulshri Mohan was an excellent student at one of the top private high schools in New Delhi. When she applied to colleges, she received scholarship offers of $20,000 from Dartmouth and $15,000 from Smith. Her pile of acceptance letters would have made any ambitious teenager smile: Cornell, Bryn Mawr, Duke, Wesleyan, Barnard and the University of Virginia.
But because of her 93.5 percent cumulative score on her final high school examinations, which are the sole criteria for admission to most colleges here, Ms. Mohan was rejected by the top colleges at Delhi University, better known as D.U., her family's first choice and one of India's top schools.
''Daughter now enrolled at Dartmouth!'' her mother, Madhavi Chandra, wrote, updating her Facebook page. ''Strange swings this admission season has shown us. Can't get into DU, can make it to the Ivies.'' 
Ms. Mohan, 18, is now one of a surging number of Indian students attending American colleges and universities, as competition in India has grown formidable, even for the best students. With about half of India's 1.2 billion people under the age of 25, and with the ranks of the middle class swelling, the country's handful of highly selective universities are overwhelmed.
This summer, Delhi University issued cutoff scores at its top colleges that reached a near-impossible 100 percent in some cases. The Indian Institutes of Technology, which are spread across the country, have an acceptance rate of less than 2 percent -- and that is only from a pool of roughly 500,000 who qualify to take the entrance exam, a feat that requires two years of specialized coaching after school.
''The problem is clear,'' said Kapil Sibal, the government minister overseeing education in India, who studied law at Harvard. ''There is a demand and supply issue. You don't have enough quality institutions, and there are enough quality young people who want to go to only quality institutions.''
American universities and colleges have been more than happy to pick up the slack. Faced with shrinking returns from endowment funds, a decline in the number of high school graduates in the United States and growing economic hardship among American families, they have stepped up their efforts to woo Indian students thousands of miles away.
Representatives from many of the Ivy League institutions have begun making trips to India to recruit students and explore partnerships with Indian schools. Some have set up offices in India, partly aimed at attracting a wider base of students. The State Department held a United States-India higher education summit meeting on Thursday at Georgetown University to promote the partnership between the countries.
Indians are now the second-largest foreign student population in America, after the Chinese, with almost 105,000 students in the United States in the 2009-10 academic year, the last for which comprehensive figures were available. Student visa applications from India increased 20 percent in the past year, according to the American Embassy here.
Although a majority of Indian students in the United States are graduate students, undergraduate enrollment has grown by more than 20 percent in the past few years. And while wealthy Indian families have been sending their children to the best American schools for years, the idea is beginning to spread to middle-class families, for whom Delhi University has historically been the best option.
American universities have now become ''safety schools'' for increasingly stressed and traumatized Indian students and parents, who complain that one fateful event -- the final high school examination -- can make or break a teenager's future career.
This admissions season, students exchanged exam horror stories. One knew a boy who was sick with typhoid but could not reschedule. ''I know a girl who saw the physics paper and she fainted,'' said Nikita Sachdeva, her eyes widening.
Ms. Sachdeva, 19, graduated from Delhi Public School in 2010, with a 94.5 percent exam score, one point shy of the cutoff to study economics at St. Stephen's, one of the top colleges at Delhi University. She decided to take a year off and work as an intern at a nonprofit group affiliated with the World Health Organization, while applying to American universities.
But for some students, it is not merely the competition that drives them to apply to study in the United States. It is also the greater intellectual freedom of an American liberal arts education.
India's educational system is rigid, locking students into an area of study and affording them little opportunity to take courses outside their major beyond the 11th grade.
Only a few courses of study are considered lucrative career paths. Economics, commerce, engineering and medicine have a certain cachet, while English, history and languages are less well regarded. Often students who cannot afford to study abroad end up in less competitive courses, with a contraction of career possibilities.
''If somebody majors in English here, it's like, 'O.K., she'll get married,' '' said Ms. Sachdeva, who is attending the University of Chicago this fall and is planning to major in economics with a minor in creative writing.
Other students, finding entrance to their dream school in India impossible, have made similar choices. Siddhant Puri had wanted to study computer engineering at one of the Indian Institutes of Technology since he was a child. But after a month of coaching in the 11th grade, he decided it was not for him. Instead, he became the vice president of his high school class and played soccer, and he now plans to study German literature and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.
Such students have provided a welcome and much needed boon to American universities.
''We're accepting an increasing number of students, and they're excellent,'' said Matthew Gutmann, the vice president for international affairs at Brown University, which plans to open an office in New Delhi partly dedicated to recruiting students. Undergraduate applications from India have grown from 86 in 2008 to more than 300 for this academic year at Brown.
''India's a really big country; it therefore has a really big middle class,'' said Allan Goodman, the president of the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit organization based in New York. ''They value education so much so they have been saving for education, and they're willing to invest in education. And our prices are very high.''
The financial strain is considerable. Some middle-class salaries in India are below the poverty line in the West. The difference in tuition between top American and Indian universities is staggering. Tuition at Dartmouth is $41,736 a year, not including room and board, while most of the colleges of Delhi University cost about $150 to $500 per year.
The emotional sacrifice of letting a teenager travel across an ocean is no less acute for some parents. Dr. Chandra spent the days before her daughter's departure in a near panic. But she has accepted the idea that there is no college in India quite suitable for a young woman like her daughter, who wants to study psychology and who spent the past few months putting the finishing touches on a documentary she is making -- on the short shrift the humanities receive in the Indian educational system.
''In the end, I'm glad it happened,'' Dr. Chandra said. ''She's been an excellent student, and she's not used to settling for second best.''

HEADLINE: The Thing Itself

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Ground zero in Lower Manhattan is a mass grave. So when it came time to rebuild the World Trade Center, the whole enterprise was enshrouded with passion and symbolism. The developers wanted a project that would proudly assert the American spirit. They wanted to send a message that the terrorist damage would not last. They wanted it to commemorate the tragedy and celebrate the revival. Everything, therefore, had to be big: the country's tallest building, the most expensive commuter rail station, the costliest memorial.
Born in grief and passion, the whole enterprise was soon plagued by furious discord. Personalities clashed. Practicalities were ignored. Building budgets didn't mesh with the deadlines. There were arguments about the memorial and the proper definition of the word ''patriot.'' There was a lot of planning but not much execution. Symbolism eclipsed reality. 
During his brief tenure, Gov. David Paterson hired Chris Ward, formerly Mayor Michael Bloomberg's environmental protection commissioner, to take over the Port Authority and rescue the shambolic ground zero project. Ward quickly understood his mission: to take a sacred cause and turn it into a building project. That is to say, to demystify it, to see it as it really is and not through the gauze of everybody's emotions surrounding 9/11.
Ward set prosaic priorities -- what would be built first, which parts of the project could wait. He cut costs by doing things like putting columns in the design of the transportation hall. He changed the name of Freedom Tower to One World Trade Center. He divided the construction deals into manageable chunks.
Ward gave me a tour of the site this week, and what I liked best was that it wasn't all that moving. It was mostly about infrastructure, not pathos. Ward spoke as much about the internal guts of the project as the outer meaning. He praised the memorial fountains, which occupy the land of the original towers, for their dignity and restraint. They don't tell future generations what to think.
It's still an enormous project, but Ward distinguishes between ''myopic monumentalism'' and monumental projects done right. Myopic projects are designed in a rush. They are simple and brutal and single-purposed. They lack the cross tensions and quiet paradoxes that accrete on a project when it evolves patiently and over time. Robert Moses's dream of building an expressway through the heart of Manhattan was myopic monumentalism. Frederick Law Olmsted's Central Park, with its complex blend of neighborhoods, was not.
Ward (who is inexplicably being replaced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo) rescued the ground zero project by disenchanting it, by seeing it as it is, not through shrouds of symbols -- by attending closely to all the practical complexity. American politics in general could use that sort of disenchantment.
Many issues that were once concrete and practical are distorted because they have become symbolic and spiritual. Tax policy isn't just about how to raise revenue anymore. Liberals see it as a way to punish the greedy and redress the iniquities of capitalism. Conservatives see tax increases as an assault on the enterprising class perpetrated by arrogant central planners. A tax rate could be seen as just a number signifying an expense, but now it's a marker in a culture war.
Gun policy isn't about what specific weaponry should be in private hands. It's seen as an assault on or defense of the whole rural lifestyle, so to compromise on any front is to court dishonor.
President Obama's Green Tech initiative has become a policy disaster -- not only at Solyndra but at one program after another -- because its champions ignored basic practical considerations. They were befogged by their own visions of purity and virtue.
Maybe it's part of living in a postmaterialist economy, but nearly every practical question becomes a values question. You get politicians and commentators whose views are entirely predictable because they don't care about the specifics of any particular issue. They just care about the status war against their social enemies and the way each issue functions as a symbol in that great fight.
It would be nice if there were more leaders like Ward inclined to disenchant problems and stare directly at specific contexts. Sometimes circumstances compel you to raise taxes, sometimes circumstances allow you to cut them. Sometimes government can promote innovation; in most cases it can't.
Walker Percy once wrote, ''God writes straight with crooked lines.'' Translated into policy terms, that means it takes a lot of little zigs and zags over the terrain to get where you want to go. Mayors, governors and local officials do this all the time as they respond practically to circumstances. At the national level anybody who tries to zig and zag gets regarded as weak and traitorous by the economic values groups. There are rewards for those who fight over symbols, few for those who see the thing itself.

HEADLINE: Still Flooring It After All These Years

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
YEARS before he won 15 national championships as a driver and became such a wizard with engines that a sheik from Qatar hired him to work on his own dragsters, Frank Manzo was a 16-year-old who liked to hang out at the Sunoco gas station in Matawan, N.J., his hometown.
Manzo remembers wandering down to the station with his buddies to gaze at one of the first Chevrolet Camaros made. Next thing he knew, he was going to the drag races at Raceway Park, not far away in Englishtown, and later he began racing there on the weekends. 
Manzo just turned 59 -- and is still racing on the weekends, mostly for the pursuit of pure speed. He participates, with distinction and in relative anonymity, in the National Hot Rod Association's top alcohol funny car division on the lower levels of the sport.
''I just love to race,'' Manzo said in a recent interview in his team's trailer at an event in Mohnton, Pa. ''I don't need the attention.''
Although Manzo won his first national event 31 years ago, made the list as one of the N.H.R.A.'s top 50 drivers for its 50th anniversary in 2001 and has won nearly 100 national events, he said his family's business was his first priority until about two years ago.
''Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I had my hands full with the construction business,'' he said. ''I didn't have much time to think about my racecar. When I got to the track Friday, or when I got to the shop at night, my mind would be so much clearer. I was so much fresher in my racecar.''
Even as his opponents, like Joe Amato, climbed the ladder of the sport, drag racing remained a pleasant three-day-a-week hobby for Manzo, a getaway from his sewer construction business. But he said jobs began drying up in the latest economic downturn. Then Sheik Khalid bin Hamad al-Thani called.
Besides building a racetrack in Qatar and financing a multicar N.H.R.A. team, Al-Anabi Racing, the sheik races cars, too, and he needed a top-of-the-line crew chief. Manzo has been around the sport for a long time and is highly respected by his peers.
''They said, 'Look, the guy you really want is Frank Manzo, but you're not going to get Frank, because Frank's got a business. He likes what he's doing,' '' Manzo said. ''And it was true. I liked my situation.''
In late 2009, about a year after the sheik contacted him, Manzo reconsidered. He was in his late 50s, and he was tired. The sheik was offering to sponsor Manzo's funny car, and Manzo thought it would be nice to spend winters in balmy, sunny Qatar instead of New Jersey.
Manzo stepped away from the construction business and took the full-time job, in which he also spent time in Indianapolis. The sheik won his division in the Arabian Drag Racing League in 2010. Manzo returned to the United States and won his fifth consecutive national top alcohol funny car title, and his 12th since 1997.
He has not slowed down much, winning the 2011 title on Oct. 3. He set a national division record in March at an event in Gainesville, Fla., by covering a quarter-mile in 5.432 seconds, then broke it while clinching the championship in Mohnton with a 5.411-second run, reaching 264 m.p.h. He has a crew of four, but he still makes the adjustments on his racecar as needed.
''I still enjoy driving the racecar,'' he said. ''It's a nice place to be. When I lower down the body, there are no cellphones. I don't even have a radio in my car. I don't want anybody talking to me. It's my place.''
Unlike a top fuel car, which is long and thin and what most people think of as a ''dragster,'' a funny car has a body that looks like an exaggerated version of a passenger car. The top alcohol class cars run on methanol instead of nitromethane.
Elite funny-car drivers like John Force participate in the N.H.R.A.'s Full Throttle Drag Racing Series and get most of the acclaim, and the money. Their pits at an event look like the midway at a county fair, with fans wandering past to peek at crews working on cars.
Manzo drives in the N.H.R.A.'s Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series, whose trailers are assigned to the lesser-trafficked outer reaches of a drag strip. His methanol-fueled car travels about 60 miles an hour slower than Force's nitromethane-fueled car.
Manzo is among a group of participants called sportsmen, not professionals, and they rarely receive recognition on nationally televised drag-racing shows. A national championship in Manzo's classification pays out $37,500. Force, in contrast, competes for a title that pays $500,000.
Manzo says he likes it where he is. The Full Throttle drivers compete in about 25 events a year; Manzo drives in 16 events, and he says nine of them are within a five-hour drive of his house in Morganville, N.J. His wife, Michele, usually accompanies him to the races.
The inside of his team's trailer, which has a place to sleep and a kitchenette, is her domain. Manzo looked around and said with a smile, ''When we get greasy, we're not allowed in here too much.''
Had he taken a path more like the 62-year-old Force, who has won 15 top-level national funny-car championships, Manzo would have needed to spend more time on the administrative side of the sport, spending time with corporate sponsors and working with bigger crews.
Now, he gets what he wants out of drag racing: a chance to floor it, and if his car does not go fast enough, a chance to fix what he thinks is wrong. That is what hooked him on drag racing, not the trophies or the money.
''Even if I don't win,'' he said, ''you're not going to see me throwing my helmet down.''

HEADLINE: Resistance From Union In Ford Vote

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Voting by Ford's unionized workers on a new contract has been unexpectedly negative, signaling a rejection of its hold-the-line pay provisions and raising at least the possibility that Detroit's fragile labor peace could be disrupted by a strike.
With voting completed Thursday at plants that account for roughly 20 percent of Ford's 41,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union, the four-year tentative contract had been rejected by about 55 percent, the union said on a Facebook page dedicated to its negotiations with the company. 
In the last couple of days, 63 percent of workers at two big assembly plants in Michigan and Illinois voted against the deal even though it promised larger bonuses and more new jobs than contracts negotiated with General Motors and Chrysler.
Workers have indicated that they are most upset that the contract keeps wages frozen for those on the traditional pay scale, particularly in light of bonuses given to top Ford executives as the company, the country's second-largest automaker, has rebounded from the recession. Many are also upset that people hired in the last few years will continue to be paid much lower wages, though the second-tier pay scale was increased by several dollars an hour in the new contract.
''I'm fairly confident that Ford can afford to pay us more,'' said Gary Walkowicz, an opponent of the deal who works at a Ford plant near the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. ''We'll be talking about more than 10 years without a raise by the end of this contract.''
The surprising early showing against the contract prompted the U.A.W. to alert union locals to begin preparations for a strike as soon as next week if the tentative agreement failed to pass. Voting will continue through Tuesday.
''This will be our next course of action if the tentative national agreement is rejected,'' Keith W. Brown, president of U.A.W. Local 245 in Dearborn wrote in a blog posted Thursday.
Mr. Brown, who represents workers in Ford's research and engineering departments, added that he was ''still hopeful that we will not need to strike.''
Some workers opposing the deal say union leaders are merely raising the possibility of a strike to scare more of its members into ratifying the deal.
And some labor experts said the big payouts to Ford's senior management -- its executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., and chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, each received $26 million in compensation last year -- might be stirring up a protest vote at the first plants to cast ballots. Postings on the union's Facebook pages have criticized the paychecks of ''greedy'' executives and empathized with the protests on Wall Street about compensation in the financial services industry.
''There's no question the executive salaries played into this,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''It sets the wrong tone and invites comparison to the issues on Wall Street.''
The U.A.W.'s president, Bob King, and his aides were pushing hard for workers in other large plants to support the contract and counteract the negative vote received thus far.
In previous contracts, union members have occasionally rejected agreements early in the process, only to have the last voting factories support the deal overwhelmingly. A big swing factor could be the voting that concludes this weekend at Local 600 in Michigan, which represents about 6,000 workers at Ford's Rouge assembly complex.
''The early votes tend to reflect anger over what's not in the contract,'' said Mr. Shaiken. ''The later votes tend to reflect a more realistic view that this is the agreement they are going to get.''
Ford is the only American auto company that the U.A.W. can strike during this round of contract talks, but both the company and the union have indicated little interest in a showdown. Beyond a strike, if the ratification should fall short, the two sides could hold further talks, or Ford could impose a lockout on the union workers.
A Facebook post by the union warned that the company could hire nonunion replacements, but a subsequent post backed away from that claim. If Ford workers reject the deal, the union is prepared to give the company a three-day notice of its intention to strike, according to a post attributed to Jimmy Settles, the U.A.W.'s chief negotiator with Ford.
''The company is not obligated to continue bargaining,'' the post said. ''Their position is that they negotiated in good faith and presented an agreement which is more than competitive.''
The union agreed to ''no strike'' concessions at G.M. and Chrysler as part of the Obama administration's financial bailout of the two companies in 2009.
G.M. workers have already ratified their new contract, and voting at Chrysler, which reached a tentative deal Wednesday, will occur within the next two weeks.
Ford has offered $6,000 bonuses to its workers to sign the contract, compared with $5,000 at G.M. and $3,500 at Chrysler. In addition, Ford agreed to give workers a portion of their 2011 profit-sharing checks -- about $3,750 -- in November rather than making them wait until next year.
The plants in Wayne, Mich., and Chicago that rejected the deal are in line to get third shifts, adding hundreds of jobs. However, some of the workers at those plants expressed concern in Internet postings that the added jobs would reduce their overtime and that workers with higher seniority would transfer in from other plants, making their job less secure in the event of a future downturn.
Ford earned $6.6 billion in 2010 and $4.9 billion in the first half of this year. But all three Detroit carmakers have said they need to hold the line on labor costs during the negotiations to protect their still-tenuous recoveries. Analysts say Ford's deal provides considerable savings to compensate for the bonuses and other costlier provisions; the credit ratings firms Standard & Poor's and Moody's are each reviewing Ford for possible upgrades if the contract is approved.

HEADLINE: Newest Small Cars Trade on Both Looks and Personality

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
THE Kia Soul has become a star on YouTube: in a television advertisement, the small, angular Soul is driven by hip-hop hamsters through a world of dull cardboard box cars. The Soul stands out as the only cool one -- a trucklike car with a pugnacious appearance whose offbeat, almost cartoonish character appeals to young drivers.
The Soul wears the so-called tiger mouth grille that the former Audi design chief Peter Schreyer made into the signature Kia face. But its personality is very different from other Kias, with their flowing lines. The Soul's rear cargo area is like a backpack, said Tom Kearns, Kia's American design studio chief. With its upright, square hatch and devil's-horn taillights, it suggests youthful mischief. 
Designers are increasingly turning out small cars with quirky characters to woo young drivers. This year's quirkiest new vehicle may be the Nissan Juke crossover, whose hood-mounted headlights and haunchlike rear fenders make it resemble an aggressive bullfrog.
''It was inspired by rally cars,'' said the Juke's chief designer, Alfonso Albaisa.
The body lends a sense of ruggedness and security. The Juke appears to have two sets of headlights, which is as disconcerting as two sets of eyes in a cartoon character. This, Mr. Albaisa said, echoes the look of rally cars with extra headlights. ''Young buyers know rally cars from television and video games,'' he said.
The Juke also has a high beltline; full rear fenders, or hips; and a high stance. The Juke's lower front fascia, a row of air intakes, is sculptured to look tough, suggesting a huge set of brass knuckles.
Such strikingly individualized small cars contrast with the reliable but unadventurous economy models of the past, like the Toyota Corolla, a world sales leader for generations. Now Scion offers the tiny but friendly iQ, and Chevrolet is rolling out the Sonic (whose name even sounds like a video game character). Ford has replaced its bland small cars of the past with the Fiesta and Focus: sportier, more sculptured models introduced in Europe, where small cars are given more design attention.
''Personality is becoming a factor in differentiation and marketing,'' said Joel Piaskowski, Ford's design director for North America. He is known for his work at Hyundai and then Mercedes-Benz before he joined Ford last year.
''Small cars have to have character,'' he said. ''For years, there were lots of small cars that were bland, but people bought them because they were reliable, got you from Point A to Point B and retained resale value. But people have moved away from that.
''The price of entry to the market is good design as well as quality,'' Mr. Piaskowski said.
Beyond that, he says, vehicles with personality are more likely to succeed. ''People want something with more character that reflects their own personality and lifestyle.''
Economic constraints and the demographics of an urbanizing population are increasing the popularity of smaller models and the need for manufacturers to sell more of them. Some industry analysts say they believe that many buyers today are buying models one size smaller than in boom times -- a compact instead of a standard sedan, or a subcompact instead of a compact.
Ford, for instance, expects small cars to make up 55 percent of its sales by 2020. Manufacturers must sell more small cars to meet higher fleet economy regulations. (From 2012 to 2016, average mileage benchmarks are set to rise from 33.8 miles per gallon to 39.5 m.p.g.)
But the carmakers also want to sell those smaller cars at higher prices, so they are making them more attractive. ''Premium small'' cars, as the auto executives call them, offer more features and better materials.
Designers of models like the Mini Cooper and the Volkswagen Beetle have channeled the personalities of predecessor vehicles to attract current drivers. The Mini's appeal has been kept alive with the introduction of new models and a constant variety of graphic and interior option packages that let buyers customize the cars. Other makers are following that strategy.
For Volkswagen's newest version of the Beetle, by contrast, abundant pop personality has been tempered with practicality. The bulbous New Beetle has been flattened and lengthened. The old car was a model of the collective memory of the original. As in memory, the good things were exaggerated, the bad things omitted. Now, the trunk has grown and the rear seat passengers have more room.
Fiat, returning to America as an owner of Chrysler, designed its 500 coupe and convertible to stir memories also -- but less specific ones, of Italian culture, Vespas, Olivettis and Audrey Hepburn. Roberto Giolito, designer of the concept that became the new 500, said that he sought to render the essence, not details, of the classic 500. ''It had a double bubble body shape,'' he said. ''We took that theme.'' The result is as personable as Luigi, the 500 in the Pixar film ''Cars.''
Fiat is calling its dealerships ''studios'' and has equipped them with espresso machines. In case anyone doubts that its car is a fashion item, Fiat offers a Gucci edition, with green/red/green stripe and Gucci-patterned seat upholstery. Will Prada, Versace or Missoni versions follow?
The Scion iQ, Toyota's smallest car, is about the size of a Smart Fortwo but fits four people -- just barely. It is arriving in the United States this fall. Like the Smart, which starred in films from Woody Allen's ''Scoop'' to ''The Da Vinci Code,'' the car looks cuter observed in action than when being driven.
But the iQ has a rich twin. The Aston Martin Cygnet is a $:31,000 ($48,000) version of the iQ, done up with a wood and leather interior worthy of an Aston Martin Volante. At roughly three times the price of the iQ, it is not yet set for United States import but is being offered as what the company has described as a dinghy to match the yachts of Aston Martin sports cars. (Cygnet means baby swan, of course.) The pair play a sort of prince and pauper twist on the petite personality story.

HEADLINE: Used-Car Dealers Have a Deal for You. No Kidding.

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
DURING a recent promotion, an auto dealer in Louisville, Ky., sent fliers to a select list of used-car owners and wooed them to his lot with balloons, refreshments and a free toolkit. Salesmen from as far away as Texas were on hand to escort customers to a packed office.
The hard sell was on. This time, though, it was the customers who were in control. The dealer was looking to buy highly sought-after, low-mileage vehicles on the spot. Appraisals were done in 15 minutes, and customers were handed purchase vouchers, good for seven days with no strings attached. 
And so it goes in the topsy-turvy used-car market, where supplies remain tight because of the aftereffects of the recession and the slowdown of production in Japan, pushing values higher.
''Dealers really do need your car,'' said Philip Reed, senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, the automotive research site.
In particular, gas-efficient smaller cars are in demand, but so are a number of other models, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, which tracks wholesale transactions of vehicles two to five years old.
For example, the association found that compact cars in this age range sold for an average of $10,489 in August, compared with $8,798 the previous August. Midsize cars, meanwhile, sold for an average $12,529 in August, compared with $11,003 in 2010. And midsize luxury cars sold for an average $25,426, compared with $22,881 a year earlier.
''All the key segments included in this data are dramatically outperforming recent trends,'' said Jonathan Banks, senior director editorial and data serves for NADA Used Car Guides.
This trend, auto specialists say, is winding down, and consumers should not try to time the market anyway. ''Usually, people sell in conjunction with a purchase,'' said Chip Perry, chief executive of AutoTrader.com. ''Most people don't play cars like they do stocks.''
Those who may want to take advantage of higher values now, said Mr. Reed of Edmunds, include families that are downsizing, owners whose cars are no longer under warranty or who want newer technology and safety features, as well as people coming off leases.
Oren Weintraub, president of Authority Auto, a national consulting service, said he took advantage of the bump-up in car values to help clients exit leases with thousands of dollars in equity. Recently, for example, he said a client's 2008 lease on a Toyota Highlander Hybrid was almost up. When the client had the car serviced, a salesman approached with the offer of a new Highlander and a lower payment.
The salesman made no mention that the vehicle had increased in value, Mr. Weintraub said. Authority Auto arranged a deal for a third party to buy the Highlander out of the lease, netting his client a $4,600 profit. There was a $7,500 cost swing between what the dealer offered and what Authority Auto was able to achieve. Mr. Weintraub said he put the client into a new Highlander lease at a lower monthly cost. ''Look how much money was left on the table,'' Mr. Weintraub said. ''It goes to show why we think buyers need representation.''
Authority Auto clients pay a flat fee for its primary concierge service, which locates cars to buy or lease. It does not accept money from dealers or their representatives, Mr. Weintraub said, so that it can provide an impartial service. The fee is based on the retail price of the car and averages $790, he said. The company also offers to improve a deal clients have researched and splits the difference of what it saves.
When it comes to research, car buyers and sellers have long visited sites like Edmunds.com, AutoTrader.com, Kelley Blue Book (kbb.com) and Cars.com. They can also go to dealers for written quotes, to the used-car superstore CarMax (carmax.com) and to AutoNationDirect.com, the online arm of the big auto dealer chain AutoNation, Mr. Reed pointed out.
What's more, there are new options. TrueCar.com, an automotive pricing site, recently introduced ClearBook.com for used-car valuations. For customers looking to sell, it presents three prices: the expected trade-in price, private-party sales price and a recommended list or asking price. ''Prices are as high as they will get in terms of relative value,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst for TrueCar.com.
AutoTrader.com has a year-old tool that provides customers an instant trade-in offer. Used-car owners key in information about the car and the site generates the offer. The customer can take the offer to a participating dealer or buying center to collect the money based on an inspection. ''Use it as a starting point for the price of your trade-in,'' the site says, ''or walk away with cash.''
Mr. Perry said the tool has generated about 140,000 offers a month and provides a necessary backstop for its customers. ''The reason we did it,'' he said, ''is we see the trade-in and sale of a used car as one of the major pain points for owners who have difficulty in obtaining transparency on value of their car and the lack of alternative offers when they want to sell.''
To avoid the headache in the future, Mr. Reed of Edmunds said in a recent report, new-car buyers can seek manufacturers like Hyundai and Subaru, which offer a guaranteed trade-in price. ''The buyers can, in a sense, see into the future and know what their new car will be worth as a trade-in,'' he said.

HEADLINE: What Compromise?

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
THE formula for better fuel economy in cars has long been a simple equation: the smaller the vehicle, the farther it goes on a gallon of gas.
Fuel-conscious consumers have been forced to make trade-offs. More size and interior room translated into heavier vehicles and larger engines and increasingly expensive trips to the pump. Saving on gasoline meant choosing narrower, shorter and less powerful vehicles, whether it was a compact pickup truck or a little sedan with a token back seat and minimal creature comforts.
But a quiet revolution has been taking place in the design studios and engineering centers of the world's major automakers, one that is allowing drivers to select vehicles in virtually every market segment without compromising on fuel economy.
It's all happening under the hood, where improvements in engine technology are turning gas-guzzlers into relative fuel-sippers, yet still delivering the horsepower, acceleration and utility that American consumers crave. 
Government mileage regulations will force automakers to produce fleets that average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly double the current standard.
And while that target seems lofty, the car companies are steadily inching toward the goal by improving the mileage achieved by traditional gas engines as well as introducing more hybrid and electric models.
''The average car in 2025 will get the kind of mileage that today's Toyota Prius hybrid gets, but we're not talking about some futuristic technology,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington organization that promotes efforts to mitigate global warming. ''Most of the changes will be invisible to the consumers and achieved with better engines, transmissions and aerodynamics.''
The American auto industry has endured a rough ride in recent years. The economic crisis in 2008 pushed the Detroit automakers to the brink of insolvency. Sales withered, and the car companies were forced to slash unsustainable costs and payrolls. General Motors and Chrysler were forced to seek government aid and go through bankruptcy to survive.
But Detroit emerged from the recession leaner, more competitive and intensely focused on delivering cars and trucks that are fun to drive and practical to own, but also cheaper to fill up, with gas prices that have hovered around $4 a gallon.
Consumers are discovering cars that meet their needs without busting their budgets on fuel. Bradley Herring, an engineer from Dubuque, Iowa, was recently in the market for a roomy, family-size sedan with the fuel economy of a compact car.
He found exactly what he wanted in, of all places, a Buick showroom. The G.M. brand has historically offered larger vehicles with cushy rides and mediocre fuel economy. But by choosing a Buick LaCrosse with a small, four-cylinder engine equipped with a direct-injection system, Mr. Herring got the space and comfort of a bigger car with a combined city and highway mileage of nearly 25 miles per gallon.
''I didn't have to downsize to a compact car to get decent mileage,'' he said. ''I'm saving about $15 a week on gas with a full-size sedan that runs on regular gas. It's not going to make or break me, but every little bit helps.''
Direct-injection technology pushes fuel into the combustion chambers of a traditional engine to create more horsepower at greater efficiency, resulting in better fuel economy and lower emissions. While hardly an automotive breakthrough, the system allows consumers like Mr. Herring to enjoy improved mileage without compromising on size.
''Buying a compact car would have been a big step down from the sedans I'm used to,'' he said. ''Now I'm able to get pretty good mileage and still have the space I need.''
Fuel economy is among the chief considerations for consumers looking for a new vehicle, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com.
''It's one of the most important factors that people consider when buying a new car,'' said Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds. ''But they want to make as few trade-offs as possible, whether it's the size of the vehicle or the price.''
SEVERAL new models entering the market will broaden the choices for drivers weary of rising fuel costs. Toyota is expanding its Prius hybrid line with a wider, more spacious version, and introducing a new generation of its top-selling Camry sedan. General Motors is rolling out an American-made subcompact, the Chevrolet Sonic, that it hopes will captivate younger buyers with a sticker price under $15,000. Hyundai has a sporty, compact car, the Veloster, on tap that will get nearly 40 miles to the gallon.
But it's not just small and midsize cars that are grabbing the interest of mileage-sensitive consumers. G.M., for example, is marketing a new electronic system, called eAssist, that improves the fuel economy of its larger sedans. The Ford Motor Company has won raves for its EcoBoost technology, which employs direct injection and turbocharging to improve fuel efficiency in a variety of vehicles.
Ford executives have been pleasantly surprised at the success of the EcoBoost version of its F-Series full-size pickup, the best-selling vehicle in America. ''The company felt we could change minds about V-6s in trucks if we delivered fuel economy without sacrificing performance,'' said a Ford spokesman, Said Deep.
Still, skeptics wondered whether truck buyers would choose a pickup with a six-cylinder engine rather than the traditional V-8. But the F-Series equipped with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine now accounts for about 40 percent of Ford's F-Series sales, proving that even stalwart pickup owners will downsize their engines to shave fuel costs.
One such convert is Thomas Beattie of Chandler, Ariz., who bought an F-150 with an EcoBoost V-6 engine last May. Mr. Beattie wanted a rugged truck that could go off-road on camping trips with his 5-year-old daughter, but burn less fuel on long drives.
The EcoBoost engine improves fuel economy by about 10 percent over the conventional V-8. Mr. Beattie proudly compared the mileage of his metallic-blue F-150 to that of older-model large sport utility vehicles like the Chevrolet Suburban.
''All those Suburbans are getting between 10 and 13 miles to a gallon,'' he said. ''But I can set my cruise control to 70 miles an hour and get between 20 and 28 miles per gallon on the highway in my pickup.''
The recent increase in future fuel-economy standards is setting the stage for the next leap forward in pickups -- a hybrid truck. Ford and Toyota recently announced plans to jointly develop a hybrid gas-electric system for trucks and large S.U.V.'s.
Hybrids will be an integral part of the industry's plan to meet the stringent new fuel-economy regulations. Only a small percentage of drivers have embraced hybrid technology, but attitudes are changing as carmakers install hybrid systems in a wider variety of models.
''The hybrid is slowly becoming a mainstream technology,'' said Mr. Becker of Safe Climate Campaign. ''I suspect there are some people who will never be comfortable with them, but their numbers are growing fewer and fewer.''
Mr. Becker also estimated that all-electric vehicles would compose about 5 percent of new-vehicle sales by 2025. ''The automakers are going to need that number to reach the overall fleet average,'' he said.
The market for electric cars remains questionable. Nissan's electric Leaf has gotten off to a slower-than-expected start since being introduced last year, although its debut was hampered somewhat by problems related to the tsunami in Japan. G.M. has taken a deliberately patient approach in its rollout of the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid electric sedan that runs primarily on battery power but has a small gasoline engine so it can recharge on the fly.
THE Volt gets the equivalent of 93 miles per gallon in fully electric mode, but at a price of more than $40,000. Even with a $7,500 federal tax credit, the car is pushing the limits of consumer acceptance because of its high cost.
''There is clearly a curve on which consumers are willing to pay for better fuel efficiency,'' said Mr. Anwyl. ''At some point, the improvements in technology cost more than people are able to justify.''
When gas was cheap, many consumers didn't blink at paying extra for bigger engines and larger vehicles. Now the situation has reversed. With fuel costs rising, will drivers pay more for an electric vehicle if their gasoline bill shrinks as a result?
''Prices are going to go up as the auto companies adopt more and more technology to meet the fuel-economy regulations,'' said Mr. Anwyl. ''But how much more will the cars of 2025 cost? Anyone who claims to know is really just guessing.''
The good news is that the Detroit automakers -- and the industry in general -- are in far better shape financially than during the economic crisis of a few years ago. The companies have more money to spend on improving engines and adding hybrids and electric models, and their engineers and researchers have been given the power to pursue more advanced technology projects.
Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both Chrysler and its owner, Fiat, has endorsed the new fuel-economy standards as the challenge the industry needs to accelerate its efforts.
''It will be a huge boost to this industry,'' Mr. Marchionne said in a speech at an industry conference in August. ''Our powertrain engineers are an incredible pool of talent, and now we can let them do their jobs to the best of their ability.''
The 2025 target of 54.5 miles per gallon is somewhat misleading. Typically, the mileage estimate included on a car's sales sticker is about 20 percent less than its actual fuel efficiency. The Environmental Protection Agency takes real-world driving conditions into consideration when it assigns a fuel-economy number to a particular model. ''That 54 miles per gallon will be more like 40 miles to the gallon on average,'' said Mr. Becker.
Opinions vary on how much additional cost will be borne by the consumer to achieve the federal targets. ''We have a hard time believing that the typical new-car customer will be happy about spending $2,000 more for his or her new car than they otherwise would for fuel-economy benefits,'' said Jack Nerad, a market analyst for the auto-buying guide Kelley Blue Book.
The Obama administration said that whatever the additional costs, Americans would save as much as $8,000 in fuel costs over the life of a 54.5-m.p.g. vehicle. Beyond that, the administration contends that the program will reduce domestic oil consumption by more than two million barrels a day. ''This agreement on fuel standards represents the single most important step we have taken as a nation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,'' President Obama said in announcing the new standards in July.
AUTOMAKERS have expressed confidence that they can achieve incremental goals en route to hitting the final target. Some of the improvement will come from the mix of products -- more cars and fewer large S.U.V.'s. However, the bigger challenge will be lowering costs of electric and hybrid models enough to make them more attractive to consumers. Auto executives say they are already preparing long-range product plans that will help them reach the new federal standards by 2025.
''Knowing what's going to happen long term allows us to invest in technology,'' said Susan Cischke, the chief environmental and safety officer at Ford.
Educating consumers about their options in the marketplace is critical as well. Ford, G.M. and foreign carmakers like Honda, Nissan and Hyundai have been aggressively advertising the fuel-economy performances of their best-mileage vehicles. Environmentalists view the competition for bragging rights on fuel efficiency as a positive, if unexpected, development.
''Some of these companies have fought higher fuel standards for years,'' Mr. Becker said. ''It's gratifying to see the same companies now competing to achieve the highest fuel economy.''
While consumers appreciate the fuel savings from their high-mileage vehicles, many also derive some satisfaction from knowing their cars are more environmentally friendly. ''I'm a little more environmentally conscious than I used to be,'' said Mr. Herring, the new owner of the Buick LaCrosse. ''I don't know how the auto companies will reach these new fuel requirements, but I'm definitely in favor of them.''
For the average car buyer, there has never been a better time to shop for a fuel-efficient model. There are more vehicles on the road that get 30 miles per gallon in highway driving than before. Besides the wider selection, consumers do not have to scrimp on size or features to trade up to a model with exemplary fuel economy.
Michael Polk scoured the ranks of new foreign and domestic cars in his search to replace his decade-old Volkswagen Jetta. Mr. Polk, a 43-year-old software developer from Baldwin, Md., needed a family sedan that got excellent mileage on his daily commute (almost 80 miles round trip), but had the latest gadgets.
''I was torn between getting a four-cylinder for best fuel economy and a V-6 sports version of a family sedan,'' Mr. Polk said. ''Buying a V-6 did not feel economically prudent, not to mention environmentally irresponsible.''
He settled on a Kia Optima EX Turbo, a midsize sedan with a direct-injection, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine that puts out 274 horsepower and still gets about 26 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving.
''It's larger, more powerful and probably gets five miles per gallon better mileage than my old car,'' he said. ''That's a pretty big deal to me.''
But he got more than he bargained for when he discovered the benefits of the Optima's tiny digital display, which showed him exactly what his mileage was as he was driving.
''I'm watching this little gauge and trying to maximize my fuel economy by how I drove,'' he said. ''It absolutely blew me away that if I drove carefully, I was able to get 36 miles per gallon.''
He tries not to spend too much time on the road watching his mileage gauge. But Mr. Polk can't help but calculate how much gas he is saving by simply modifying his driving style to take full advantage of his new car's smaller, more fuel-efficient engine.
For Mr. Polk, calculating mileage and saving on gas is as exhilarating as seeing how fast his car can accelerate from a stoplight.
''I was very excited with my new car, and on the first day I drove it like a teenager,'' he said. ''Then I found out that I spent more time checking my m.p.g. readouts and driving to increase my fuel economy than I was taking advantage of my car's sporty capabilities.''
What impressed him was he could have both experiences in the same midsize family car. ''With the aggressive new federal fuel-economy targets, I felt like fun in cars might be a thing of the past,'' he said. ''This gives me hope that we might be able to have our cake and still be able to eat some of it too.''

HEADLINE: Egypt's Failing Army: The military rulers are contributing to the country's growing instability

 BODY:
The Egyptian Army played a pivotal role during the demonstrations that ousted President Hosni Mubarak when it refused to fire on peaceful protesters. The military was widely seen as respected, competent and able to oversee a peaceful transition to democracy. 
Eight months later, that reputation is in tatters. The army is increasingly at odds with the people and contributing to instability. Many Egyptians now understandably fear that the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took over when Mr. Mubarak was pushed out, will do anything to retain power and keep ordinary citizens from exercising their political rights.
The killing of two dozen unarmed Coptic Christian protesters by security forces on Sunday has created a crisis point for the military rulers. On Wednesday, as outrage at home and abroad mounted, two generals held a news conference and offered a weak and unacceptable explanation. They said 300 soldiers with no live ammunition faced a large and threatening crowd of 6,000, demonstrating against a recent attack on a church in southern Egypt. The generals said a few in the crowd were armed with swords, stones and Molotov cocktails. They did not admit that some of the dead were crushed by military vehicles and they denied that shots were fired by soldiers. Witnesses and autopsies confirmed that several protesters died of bullet wounds.
The military council needs to begin an independent investigation of the incident. The probe must be transparent and anyone responsible for the deaths must be brought to justice. The army also needs to train its forces in nonviolent crowd control.
The army's failure to calm sectarianism and spell out clearly when it will cede power to an elected civilian government has eroded its legitimacy. The Egyptian economy is paralyzed and the people are demoralized by the lack of jobs, poverty and corruption. That is a recipe for upheaval.
The Obama administration has expressed concern about the weekend violence but needs to push the army harder to answer to all Egyptians. The case for American assistance to Egypt -- $1.3 billion in annual direct aid -- will be harder to make with Congress if another repressive regime steals the hard-won chance for democracy.

HEADLINE: Rabbit-Hole Economics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Reading the transcript of Tuesday's Republican debate on the economy is, for anyone who has actually been following economic events these past few years, like falling down a rabbit hole. Suddenly, you find yourself in a fantasy world where nothing looks or behaves the way it does in real life.
And since economic policy has to deal with the world we live in, not the fantasy world of the G.O.P.'s imagination, the prospect that one of these people may well be our next president is, frankly, terrifying. 
In the real world, recent events were a devastating refutation of the free-market orthodoxy that has ruled American politics these past three decades. Above all, the long crusade against financial regulation, the successful effort to unravel the prudential rules established after the Great Depression on the grounds that they were unnecessary, ended up demonstrating -- at immense cost to the nation -- that those rules were necessary, after all.
But down the rabbit hole, none of that happened. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because of runaway private lenders like Countrywide Financial. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because Wall Street pretended that slicing, dicing and rearranging bad loans could somehow create AAA assets -- and private rating agencies played along. We didn't find ourselves in a crisis because ''shadow banks'' like Lehman Brothers exploited gaps in financial regulation to create bank-type threats to the financial system without being subject to bank-type limits on risk-taking.
No, in the universe of the Republican Party we found ourselves in a crisis because Representative Barney Frank forced helpless bankers to lend money to the undeserving poor.
O.K., I'm exaggerating a bit -- but not much. Mr. Frank's name did come up repeatedly as a villain in the crisis, and not just in the context of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, which Republicans want to repeal. You have to marvel at his alleged influence given the fact that he's a Democrat and the vast bulk of the bad loans now afflicting our economy were made while George W. Bush was president and Republicans controlled the House with an iron grip. But he's their preferred villain all the same.
The demonization of Mr. Frank aside, it's now obviously orthodoxy on the Republican side that government caused the whole problem. So what you need to know is that this orthodoxy has hardened even as the supposed evidence for government as a major villain in the crisis has been discredited. The fact is that government rules didn't force banks to make bad loans, and that government-sponsored lenders, while they behaved badly in many ways, accounted for few of the truly high-risk loans that fueled the housing bubble.
But that's history. What do the Republicans want to do now? In particular, what do they want to do about unemployment?
Well, they want to fire Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- not for doing too little, which is a case one can make, but for doing too much. So they're obviously not proposing any job-creation action via monetary policy.
Incidentally, during Tuesday's debate, Mitt Romney named Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw as one of his advisers. How many Republicans know that Mr. Mankiw at least used to advocate -- correctly, in my view -- deliberate inflation by the Fed to solve our economic woes?
So, no monetary relief. What else? Well, the Cheshire Cat-like Rick Perry -- he seems to be fading out, bit by bit, until only the hair remains -- claimed, implausibly, that he could create 1.2 million jobs in the energy sector. Mr. Romney, meanwhile, called for permanent tax cuts -- basically, let's replay the Bush years! And Herman Cain? Oh, never mind.
By the way, has anyone else noticed the disappearance of budget deficits as a major concern for Republicans once they start talking about tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy?
It's all pretty funny. But it's also, as I said, terrifying.
The Great Recession should have been a huge wake-up call. Nothing like this was supposed to be possible in the modern world. Everyone, and I mean everyone, should be engaged in serious soul-searching, asking how much of what he or she thought was true actually isn't.
But the G.O.P. has responded to the crisis not by rethinking its dogma but by adopting an even cruder version of that dogma, becoming a caricature of itself. During the debate, the hosts played a clip of Ronald Reagan calling for increased revenue; today, no politician hoping to get anywhere in Reagan's party would dare say such a thing.
It's a terrible thing when an individual loses his or her grip on reality. But it's much worse when the same thing happens to a whole political party, one that already has the power to block anything the president proposes -- and which may soon control the whole government.

HEADLINE: In Auto State, Obama Looks for Bailout Mileage

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MONICA DAVEY; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- President Obama arrives here on Friday on another visit to Michigan, seeking not only the electoral votes that are essential to his re-election effort, but a platform for a far bigger message.
He has returned again and again, nine times since taking office, to argue that his decision to bail out two of the Big Three automakers helped workers here and across the industrial Midwest. He has offered up a rebuttal to criticism about the value of government intervention.
The president's path to a second term is built around winning a wide swath of states, including many with close ties to the auto industry. They are home to some of his biggest political and substantive challenges, including a depressed economy, a disenchanted middle class and a disdain for government highlighted by the Tea Party movement.
A handful of states he carried in 2008 could slip away, but Democrats believe Mr. Obama cannot lose Michigan, fearing that other states will be even harder to hold. Shifting demographics and deep economic burdens have snapped the Democratic Party's recent hold on the state and given Republicans confidence that Michigan is again one of the country's most fiercely competitive battlegrounds. 
Mitt Romney, who was born in Michigan and chose the birthplace of the American automobile to announce his presidential bid at the Henry Ford Museum four years ago, has denounced the rescue of the industry. He repeated his position at a Republican presidential debate this week, declaring: ''Should they have used the funds to bail out General Motors and Chrysler? No, that was the wrong source for that funding.''
But more than two years after the White House offered a government lifeline to help the industry survive the recession and a credit crunch, the General Motors assembly plant here has roared to life, producing the only subcompact car made on American soil, the Chevrolet Sonic.
On Friday, Mr. Obama will tour a downsized version of the plant in Lake Orion, which President Ronald Reagan came to dedicate in 1984. Reagan won the White House with the help of middle-class Democrats in the suburbs of Detroit, including Oakland County, whose mix of independent voters and upper-income residents makes it a bellwether for Mr. Obama.
Monica Shepard, who has worked at General Motors for three decades as an electrician, remembers the day that Mr. Reagan visited. She conceded that Mr. Obama may not be as popular, but she said many people here were grateful, even if the restructuring created a two-tiered system under which nonunion workers are paid a fraction of previous wages.
''Every small businessman that I know, they're all glad the president bailed out General Motors because without that, the whole area would be obliterated,'' said Ms. Shepard, 54, as she left her afternoon shift the other day. ''I voted for him to do a job and I would like to see him follow through.''
As the presidential race intensifies, Michigan will become more than a trove of 16 electoral votes. It will be a virtual laboratory for some of the most central themes of the campaign in a state that embodies the changing face of the nation's economy.
If Republicans carry the state for the first time since 1988 in a presidential race -- an outcome that advisers to Mr. Obama strongly dismiss -- he will probably face a similar erosion of support across Ohio, Pennsylvania and other Rust Belt states. But even if Mr. Obama wins the state, where independent voters and some Republicans may be inclined to support him because of jobs created by the slow revival of the auto industry, the bailout argument could carry significant weight elsewhere.
''I don't see how you win the White House without Michigan,'' said Stan Greenberg, a Democrat, who has been conducting polls and studying Michigan politics since 1982. ''I do not assume that Michigan will fall back into being a blue state. It will be on the edge.''
The president's argument -- and early signs of a potential revival of support -- will be tested here in Oakland County, a Republican stronghold that Mr. Reagan carried by 22 points in 1980. It steadily gravitated toward the Democratic Party, with George W. Bush narrowly losing in 2000 and 2004. Mr. Obama won the county by 15 points four years ago, but the Republican candidate for governor, Rick Snyder, carried it last year by more than 20 points.
''The whole wave he rode in on isn't here anymore,'' said Dennis Pittman, the executive director of the Oakland County Republican Party, speaking about Mr. Obama. ''He's in trouble here.''
A majority of voters across Michigan have a negative assessment of Mr. Obama's performance. Only 38 percent gave him a positive rating, while 61 percent rated him negatively, according to a statewide poll conducted Oct. 1 through Oct. 4 by Epic-MRA. Still, 46 percent of Michigan voters have a favorable opinion of Mr. Obama, the poll found, compared with 47 percent who have an unfavorable view.
The unemployment rate in Michigan climbed higher after Mr. Obama took office, surpassing 14 percent. But after the bailout of the auto industry, it began dropping gradually. In August, it was 11.2 percent, still above the national average of 9.1 percent.
Former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat whose term expired last year, said Michigan -- before and after federal government intervention -- should be viewed as a test for confronting the nation's economic woes. By her account, she initially attacked the problem with cuts in spending, in state workers and in the size of government, all seen as antidotes to the nation's troubles.
''It was only that active government that started to see us trending in the right direction rather than continuing that downward spiral,'' she said in a recent interview.
Governor Snyder, who was elected in a Republican wave that also helped the party win several statewide offices, a majority on the state Supreme Court, control of the state House and a bigger majority in the state Senate, said the economy of Michigan had shown modest signs of rebounding. ''The whole feeling and atmosphere is improved,'' he said, but declined to say who should receive credit.
Yet the stark population changes have injected uncertainty into campaign.
Michigan was the only state in the country to lose population in the last 10 years. Predictable pockets of Democratic strength are less reliable. Detroit, the state's largest city with a majority black population, lost a quarter of its residents, with more than 200,000 people leaving.
Several demographers who analyzed the census said Democrats had reason for concern, but added that some shifts could also harm Republicans. Over all, fewer blacks now live in Michigan. Among the other groups shrinking in numbers are whites, blue-collar residents and younger people.
''It's true that there aren't as many base voters to work with,'' said Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist in Michigan, who has advised state and presidential campaigns. ''But the independent voter pool is big enough and there are many friendly voters within it who are up for grabs.''
The White House is aware of its challenges. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has visited six times, including two stops this week. And for months now, the re-election campaign has been reactivating its old network. The other night, Barbara Williamson, a retired teacher, made calls in her living room. A large plate of cookies sat untouched, with only one other volunteer on hand.
''It's going to be a very close election,'' she said. ''Republicans want him to be a one-termer.''

HEADLINE: America the Overcommitted

BYLINE: By JEREMI SURI. 
Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, is the author of ''Liberty's Surest Guardian: American Nation-Building from the Founders to , Obama.''

 BODY:
Austin, Tex.
AMERICAN foreign policy today is reactive, unfocused and ineffective. The Obama administration is concentrating almost entirely on preventing bad situations from getting worse. This is true in Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea and Iran. The Arab-Israeli peace process is dead, and the White House is struggling to salvage some remaining hope. Europe is teetering on the edge of financial collapse, and America can only encourage its allies to buy more time on depleting credit.
We are trying to accomplish too many things in too many places at a time when American foreign policy is stymied by some of the worst partisan divisions in the country's history. Consequently, we are not doing anything very well. 
The solution is simple: set clear priorities and reduce other commitments. The Obama administration should set three international goals that it is capable of achieving: maintain the credibility of the dollar as the de facto reserve currency of the world; halt the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons; and maintain peaceful relations with China. This is not a recipe for isolation, but for targeted internationalism; it is the only viable path to restoring lost leadership.
The United States has good reasons to care about other issues -- from nation-building and human rights to climate change and energy security -- but severe economic constraints and bitter partisanship make success on those issues unlikely. What is required right now is a disciplined return to basics.
The credibility of the dollar is indispensible to American power. People on all continents use dollars for pricing, savings and investments. The United States gets access to nearly unlimited capital, at very low cost, because of this phenomenon. It can print new dollars that foreigners will take at consistent value in return for resources and products we want.
The dollar's global status grew from Washington's historical record of keeping its debt under control, investing in growth, encouraging free trade, and paying all of its obligations. The recent recession and debt crisis have shaken these assumptions. More than anything else, Mr. Obama must reaffirm foreigners' trust in the dollar by showing that he can make difficult decisions, mobilize the electorate to reduce the national debt, raise new revenues and stimulate growth. Solid fiscal governance matters more for American foreign policy than loud debates about specific crises.
Nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are the equalizers that could allow weak and desperate competitors to undermine American power. Small and enormously destructive weapons raise the possibility of large-scale damage to American cities that could gravely harm the nation's infrastructure and health for years to come. This is the real nightmare scenario for the United States, and the president must do all that he can to prevent it from occurring.
Securing facilities and supplies must receive high-level attention and funding, despite defense budget cuts. Supporting a rigorous international system that penalizes proliferators (especially Iran and North Korea) must dominate Washington's activities in the United Nations and other international bodies. And the president must do more to build support for multilateral enforcement, including possible military action.
Finally, Washington must carefully cultivate its relationship with Beijing. China is still far from challenging American power, and its leaders have shown little interest in direct conflict with the United States. International stability will require sophisticated American efforts to engage China in ways that serve the interests of both countries -- particularly on fiscal and proliferation issues, where Washington and Beijing share common concerns about recession and terrorism. The key is to keep the relationship focused on big issues that are the most uniting, rather than divisive issues like currency valuations and Taiwan.
As the United States focuses on the dollar, proliferation and China, it must necessarily disengage from other costly and time-intensive commitments.
American disengagement has already begun, but it must go further. The Obama administration inherited long-standing efforts to support economic reconstruction, political reform, nation-building and peacemaking. Washington no longer has the resources or the political mandate to act in ways that make a positive difference in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Diffuse, halfhearted efforts make matters worse and drain resources from higher priorities.
The United States has too many commitments today to conduct a successful foreign policy. Perpetual crisis management contributes to confusion, waste and overall ineffectiveness. To re-establish focus, the nation needs clear and disciplined priorities. To re-establish leadership, the nation needs the courage to say it will do some things well, while practicing self-restraint everywhere else.

HEADLINE: Strauss-Kahn Is Not Charged In French Case

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and MAIA de la BAUME; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
PARIS -- For the second time this year, legal officials chose on Thursday not to prosecute Dominique Strauss-Kahn on charges of attempted rape, despite what investigators here said was evidence of sexual assault, ending months of scandal that have tarnished a political career that once seemed destined to lead to the French presidency.
There was evidence from Mr. Strauss-Kahn's own testimony of sexual assault in a 2003 encounter with a French writer and novelist, Tristane Banon, the prosecutor said in a statement, but given a three-year statute of limitations on that charge, no case would be brought.
''Facts that could be qualified as sexual assault have been acknowledged,'' the statement said. It did not offer any further details. 
Given the age of the case and the difficulty of finding physical evidence so long after the event, it appeared that prosecutors had little choice.
The decision provoked some controversy here, particularly in feminist circles, but nothing like the storms that surrounded this summer's case in New York involving Mr. Strauss-Kahn and a hotel housekeeper. In the New York case, criminal charges of attempted rape were dropped in August because of doubts about the credibility of his accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, who had lied to prosecutors about aspects of her background and personal life.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn had no immediate comment. One of his lawyers, Henri Leclerc, said in an interview that while Mr. Strauss-Kahn did admit to making advances toward Ms. Banon and kissing her without consent, ''no violence was acknowledged.'' Another of his lawyers, Frederique Beaulieu, said on television that her client had been ''totally cleared.''
Ms. Banon's lawyer, David Koubbi, issued a statement calling Mr. Strauss-Kahn an ''untried sexual aggressor.'' The prosecutors established ''without reserve that the case is not empty and what she denounced is not imaginary,'' Mr. Koubbi said. The finding of the prosecutors ''will allow him to escape criminal conviction, but not a legitimate suspicion about his behavior towards women.''
In a nationally televised interview on Sept. 18, Mr. Strauss-Kahn accused Ms. Diallo of lying about their encounter, which he said was consensual. He accused Ms. Banon of lying, too, when she said that he forcefully kissed her, stripped off her top and bra, undid her jeans and shoved his hand into her underwear. He called Ms. Banon's charges ''imaginary'' and said he would sue her for defamation.
But later, he told the police that he had made advances toward Ms. Banon and tried to kiss her, but said he had let her go when she rejected him. His lawyers said that such an admission did not qualify as sexual assault.
In some sense, Mr. Strauss-Kahn, 62, appears to be lucky. But he has been personally chastened and humiliated in a very public fashion, and his political career has been derailed by the charges.
Arriving in New York last May, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, highly respected for his handling of the early stages of the euro crisis, Mr. Strauss-Kahn was considered nearly a shoo-in as the Socialist Party's presidential candidate in next spring's race against the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Strauss-Kahn was about to announce his well-planned candidacy, and he was considered very likely to become the next president of France.
But on Sunday, an unshaven Mr. Strauss-Kahn, looking tired and old, cast his vote in the first round of the Socialist Party primary for his ally, Martine Aubry, who is running only because he could not.
Since his return to France in August, after the New York charges were dropped, Mr. Strauss-Kahn has largely kept out of sight, except for the television interview, when he was questioned by a journalist who is a close friend of his wife, Anne Sinclair. Then, he admitted to an ''error'' and ''a moral failing'' in the hotel room encounter with the housekeeper, Ms. Diallo, but insisted that no force had been used.
''I think it was a moral failing, and I'm not proud of it,'' he said then. ''It was a failing, a failing vis-a-vis my wife, my children and my friends, but also a failing vis-a-vis the French people, who had vested their hopes for change in me.''
He said: ''I am not proud of it. I regret it infinitely. I have regretted it every day for the past four months, and I think I'm not done regretting it.''
But in a strange choice of words, Mr. Strauss-Kahn also said that he had lost forever his ''legerete'' in his relations with women and toward life itself. The word, which can mean ''lightness,'' also means flippancy and irresponsibility.
Asked about his reputation as an aggressive womanizer, or ''dragueur,'' he said: ''I have respect for women, I understand their reaction, I understand they are shocked. I paid heavily, I'm still paying.''
He may pay still more. While his wife, the American-born daughter of a wealthy art dealer, is extremely rich, Mr. Strauss-Kahn is facing one and possibly two civil suits, one brought by Ms. Diallo in New York and one that is expected to be brought by Ms. Banon.
Ms. Diallo's lawyer, Kenneth P. Thompson, suggested that the French prosecutors were influenced by the decision by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to drop his case.
''The prosecutors in Paris must have felt emboldened by the failure of the Manhattan District Attorney to hold Mr. Strauss-Kahn accountable for his actions here in New York, which we look forward to doing in our civil case,'' Mr. Thompson said in an e-mail.
There was little chance Mr. Strauss-Kahn would have been convicted in the French criminal case or served time in jail, but his political career has been badly damaged by the charges, and the French seem almost bored now with him and the case.
''The sword of Damocles has been lifted'' from him in terms of prosecution, said Bruno Jeudy, the political editor of Le Journal du Dimanche, a weekly newspaper. ''Will it change anything? No, not in the immediate future.''
Mr. Strauss-Kahn ''is out of the political film,'' Mr. Jeudy said, describing the television interview as a kind of funeral. ''We would need very serious economic trouble to request his help.'' As for ordinary people, he said, ''the French feel very far from this now'' and ambivalent about Ms. Banon, now 32, who has garnered a lot of publicity and has just published a book, ''The Hypocrites' Ball,'' describing her experiences with Mr. Strauss-Kahn and afterward.
The two cases did bring a strong feminist reaction in France, however, with women's groups citing renewed interest in their work and new understanding, especially among younger men and women, of the line between flirting and sexual aggression.
Olivia Cattan, president of Paroles de Femmes, a feminist group, said Thursday that the French prosecutor's decision ''leaves a bitter taste'' but ''is half a victory,'' given that ''they acknowledge the crime'' even if the limits of the law prevent punishment. The case proves that Ms. Banon ''is not a liar,'' she said.
Since 2006, she said, her group has been pressing for an extension of the statute of limitations for sexual assault from 3 years to 10, as currently the case with rape, which she said required evidence of penetration. ''This case is symbolic enough to make it work,'' she said.

HIGHLIGHT: India's higher education crisis won't be solved overnight. 

 BODY:
Q.
What is main problem here? 
A.
The problem is clear. There's a demand and supply issue. The demand overstrips the supply by a factor of a hundred, I guess. You don't have enough quality institutions and there are enough quality young people who want to go to only quality institutions.

The other problem is that we have disciplines in schools -- commerce stream and science stream and arts stream. The commerce student goes to the commerce college and so the science student, no matter how well he does, if he wants to go to the commerce college his entry is limited, because first they absorb the commerce students then they take into account the science students. 
Q.
What measures is your office taking to fix these problems? 
A.
What can my office do? My office can't create colleges overnight, can it?
What we are trying to do is to expand the educational sector to allow for foreign investment to come in, allow the private sector to participate to build more quality colleges, and meet the increasing demand of the student community. 
But that's going to happen over a period of time, it can't happen overnight. 
Q.
What has been the biggest difficulty for you in trying to solve this problem?
A.
To restructure the entire education system is no easy job. 
You know how long it takes in the United States of America for you know .a health-care scheme to be accepted by the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
Well, we are trying to change the mindset of the people, we have to get political parties on board, the stakeholders in the educational sector on board, change the mindset of the parents, allow students to be given the kind of choice they've never been given, and we don't have enough teachers in the new disciplines that we want to put in place. 
To be able to expand the school sector one will need enormous investment - around $80 billion over the next five years. 
Once we get the quantity in place we also want to make sure while that expansion takes place it takes place with quality. Which means you should have quality teachers in place. Which means you need to train the teachers, and have strict standards in place both in terms of pupil-teacher ratio, and structure. 
Then if you use broadband and broadband wireless access, if you get that in place, along with IT content in the education sector, if all these things come together in the next five to 10 years, there will be a complete revolution in the education sector. 
Q.
What role do you think foreign institutions will play?
A.
Foreign institutions will play a role but only at the higher education level. 
Quality institutions will come in for joint degrees, for joint programs, for twinning arrangements. And there will be a lot of foreign investment in the area of skills development: short-term certification courses, diploma courses in areas where the industry in India needs skilled workers. 
Lots of Indian entrepreneurs will actually be investing in the sector; I think this will be one of the most significant sectors for economic growth in the years to come.
Q.
What about expanding the number of seats for the public universities. Is that also part of the equation?
A.
We are setting up more of them. We now have 30 central universities. We are expanding the IITs and expanding the IIMs.
Q.
But what about schools like St. Stephens, which were trying to double the seats they have? 
A.
We don't have any control over that. I mean, if they want to double the seats, they should double the seats. We won't come in the way.
Government doesn't come in the way of St. Stephens, St. Stephens comes in the way of St. Stephens. It's not a problem that we can solve.

HEADLINE: Do Attractive People Have Advantages Others Don't?

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Student Opinion | Does wearing makeup really make women seem more "capable, reliable and amiable"? 

 BODY:
In the article "Up the Career Ladder, Lipstick In Hand," Catherine Saint Louis describes the results of the study on makeup use and perceptions:
Want more respect, trust and affection from your co-workers?
Wearing makeup - but not gobs of Gaga-conspicuous makeup - apparently can help. It increases people's perceptions of a woman's likability, her competence and (provided she does not overdo it) her trustworthiness, according to a new study, which also confirmed what is obvious: that cosmetics boost a woman's attractiveness.
It has long been known that symmetrical faces are considered more comely, and that people assume that handsome folks are intelligent and good. There is also some evidence that women feel more confident when wearing makeup, a kind of placebo effect, said Nancy Etcoff, the study's lead author and an assistant clinical professor of psychology at Harvard University (yes, scholars there study eyeshadow as well as stem cells). But no research, till now, has given makeup credit for people inferring that a woman was capable, reliable and amiable.
The study was paid for by Procter & Gamble, which sells CoverGirl and Dolce & Gabbana makeup, but researchers like Professor Etcoff and others from Boston University and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were responsible for its design and execution.
... Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said the conclusion that makeup makes women look more likable - or more socially cooperative - made sense to him because "we conflate looks and a willingness to take care of yourself with a willingness to take care of people."
Professor Hamermesh, the author of "Beauty Pays" (Princeton University Press, 2011), which lays out the leg-up the beautiful get, said he wished that good-looking people were not treated differently, but said he was a realist.
"Like any other thing that society rewards, people will take advantage of it," he said of makeup's benefits. "I'm an economist, so I say, why not? But I wish society didn't reward this. I think we'd be a fairer world if beauty were not rewarded, but it is."
Students: Give us your take on the power of makeup and the societal "rewards" of beauty. Have you seen attractive people gain certain advantages? If so, why do you think it happens? What about the theory that it's the confidence of the attractive people, not their looks alone, that draws people to them? What do you think the makeup study's findings say about our culture? Does anything need to change? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: Make-Work and the G.D.P.

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A good deal of services that count toward gross domestic product involve getting Americans and companies into compliance with rules and regulations that promote inefficiency, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Suppose some evening a group of bored and mischievous teenagers slash tires on a number of cars in the parking lot of a shopping center. Distraught car owners call sundry nearby garages to send someone to fix the damage on the spot or tow the cars in for repairs. That work is speedily done, and the cars are ready for use again. The car owners pay the garage owners sizable repair bills. 
This fictitious event leads to a number of questions:
1. Did the garages deliver value to the car owners?
2. Was gross domestic product increased or decreased?
3. Were the car owners better off, after paying the repair bill?
My answer to the first question is yes and to the second yes, as well, unless the garages had to give up other jobs with revenue equal to or greater than what they earn coming to the car owners' rescue. To the third question, my answer is, it depends. 
If we take as the baseline the position of the car owners after the tires had been slashed, they would be better off, unless for some the repair bill turned out to be so high that, in retrospect, these owners would have preferred to abandon their cars. If we take as the baseline the situation before the tires were slashed, the entire affair left the car owners worse off. It reduced what economists would call social welfare.
Why is this vignette in so serious a blog as Economix? Because it illuminates a phenomenon not always fully appreciated when we talk about value added or G.D.P.

In many instances, Person (or Enterprise) A delivers great value to Person (or Enterprise) B to extract the latter from a situation into which B should not have been put in the first place. We count in G.D.P. the value added by the extrication but do not detract the value destroyed by being driven into a precarious situation. 
Quite a few economic transactions included in our G.D.P. parallel this vignette. Think of reconstruction after a natural disaster. We count the money paid for reconstruction in G.D.P. but do not deduct the value destroyed by the disaster.
Suppose a country developed long-range missiles that made our aircraft carriers sitting ducks for attack or developed the ability to paralyze our country with cyberattacks. To extract ourselves from that threat with possibly expensive countermeasures, we would give up enjoyable consumption or investments yielding future enjoyable output in order to increase military spending.
Now think about the almost incomprehensible tax code that Congress has imposed. Think of it as a disaster of human making. To cope with it, individuals and businesses hire legions of lawyers and accountants who have deployed their human capital to understanding this bewildering code. These tax experts work hard and often brilliantly to shield their clients from taxes, usually achieving tax savings that are multiples of what they charge for their services. 
For the clients, it is a highly valuable service. Indeed, the more confusing the tax code, the more of these experts we need, the harder they work, the greater the value of their services to their clients and the more income they earn. That income, of course, is part of the G.D.P. But for the most part, their work collectively amounts to one giant zero-sum game, because taxes not paid by one client will have to be paid by other taxpayers now or in the future to bring in the revenue needed to sustain the spending level Congress has set. It does not enhance overall well-being for society as a whole.
We can doubt that these professionals' work creates a more efficient incidence of taxation, because much of their work is to know and take advantage of complicated and inherently inefficient tax loopholes that Congress should not have established in the first place.
In many ways, our health care system mirrors our tax code - especially in its financing and health insurance facets. These can be made so complex and have been made so complex in the health care system in the United States that many decision makers in health care - patients, physicians, hospitals, employers and so on - need in-house or external consultants to find their way through the maze. 
A few months ago, I asked a Canadian hospital executive how many employees he had in his hospital's compliance department. "Compliance?" he responded. "What do you mean by that?" 
Somehow the Canadian provincial government-insurance plans manage to pay Canadian hospitals without requiring them to have the large compliance staff or outside compliance consultants engaged by hospitals in the United States whose task it is to ensure that the hospital does not violate the hugely complex, ever-changing terms of Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs or regulations. An academic health center may have a dozen or two dozen employees devoted to compliance. Such a center may employ several hundred billing clerks to cope with the myriad of private health insurance plans and policies, each with its own coverage, nomenclature and payment rules and requirements for prior authorizations.
Consulting firms help physiciansbill private and public insurers or help patients submit claims to insurers after an illness. Legions of insurance brokers help prospective clients through the maze of the nongroup or small-group health insurance market. Large employee-benefit consulting firms, helping large companies, establish what amount, in effect, to analogues of the health-insurance exchanges in the Affordable Care Act, and many more consultants of many stripes are involved. 
One does not find legions of expert consultants helping individuals and businesses through the administrative maze of the health care system in, say, Switzerland, Germany or other European countries, or Canada, or Taiwan. It seems to be a uniquely American phenomenon - part of American exceptionalism, I suppose. 
All of these consultants perform highly valuable services to their clients, but taken together their work consists for the most part of helping Americans extricate themselves from an administrative nightmare into which they should not have been put in the first place.
At Yale University I had the privilege of sitting in the classroom of the late James Tobin, an early Nobel laureate in economics and one of our profession's greats. He distinguished between "enjoyable" and "nonenjoyable" G.D.P., with the latter including military spending or other "value added" from coping with either externally inflicted or self-inflicted damage done to our society. I often think of our revered professor when I contemplate the composition of this country's G.D.P.

HEADLINE: From Oil and Gas Revenue, the Greenest of Schools

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new K-to-12 school in rural Mosca, Colo., offers plenty of natural daylight and other design features intended to create a better learning environment while reducing energy costs for the district. 

 BODY:
When students returned to school this fall in rural Mosca, Colo., they had plenty to cheer about besides the Thunderbirds, their football team. In August, the school district completed construction of the new Sangre de Cristo K-12 school, replacing an old metal building that more closely resembled a potato cellar, according to some students, referring to the low, dark warehouses for storing one of the region's primary crops.
The new building offers plenty of natural daylight and other design features intended to create a better learning environment while reducing energy costs for the school district, according to Paul Hutton, a sustainability consultant who worked on the project.
Designed by klipp Architects of Denver, the 80,000-square-foot building will use only 30 percent as much energy as the average school in the state. It qualifies for a LEED gold rating, and planners hope to win the top rating, platinum, after it completes the installation of a ground-mounted solar power array later this year.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, was developed by the United States Green Building Council and is like a report card for buildings, scoring energy efficiency and environmental impact. Only 30 K-to-12 schools across the country have been accorded a platinum rating. 
Much of the energy savings will come from a geo-exchange system that relies on a constant temperature below ground to heat and cool a building without the use of fossil fuels. The system maintains a comfortable indoor temperature throughout the year by circulating fluid through long loops of piping buried underneath the football and baseball fields.
Bringing natural daylight into the building will help cut electricity bills. Daylighting is now common in green building design, Mr. Hutton said, but the challenge is controlling the contrast ratio, the difference between light and dark areas in the room. "Too much contrast in a space makes it hard for our eyes to adjust and see everything in a space comfortably," he said. 
Allowing direct sunlight into a room where it hits a desk surface or computer screen increases the contrast ratio. People using the room are apt to switch on the overhead lights to reduce this contrast, and there goes your energy savings.
For the Sangre de Cristo building, the designers carefully calculated sun angles so there was never direct sun on a work surface during the day when the building was occupied, Mr. Hutton said. Upper "daylight" windows are translucent, lower "view" windows are protected by exterior sunshades and an interior shade cloth to control glare. 
Ceilings in the classroom are higher at the perimeter wall and slope down to the inner wall so the natural light can spread evenly across the room.
Finding the $23 million to develop the site and build the school would have been difficult for the Sangre de Cristo school district had it not been for the state's Building Excellent Schools Today program, which covered all but $4 million of the project. Created in 2008 by state legislators, the BEST program allocates money to school districts specifically to cover the construction costs of new buildings or refurbishing existing ones. The money is not taken from taxes but from payments from private companies leasing state lands.
Ted Hughes, the BEST program director, estimates that the program received $122 million in the last fiscal year, 85 percent of which came from oil and gas companies that operate on state lands. So in a nice bit of symmetry, money collected from energy companies is being used to build schools that use less energy.

HEADLINE: An Imaginary Ratchet

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No, stimulus doesn't persist. 

 BODY:
One thing I've been seeing in responses to the argument that Keynesianism is necessarily about favoring big government -- it isn't -- is the assertion that it actually is in practice, because Keynesian policies lead to rising spending in slumps that isn't withdrawn when the economy recovers.
This sounds worldly-wise and realistic -- but it's totally untrue as an empirical matter. The WPA and the CCC did not continue after the Great Depression ended. The discretionary spending parts of the Obama stimulus are expiring as we speak.
It's worth looking at the ratio of government spending (all levels) to potential GDP (potential to correct for the effects of the business cycle on the denominator):
So, there was a big rise for about 30 years after World War II. Was that about stimulus? No, it was about higher state and local spending on education, plus expansion of Social Security and the coming of Medicare and Medicaid. Then it was more or less flat once you take account of the fall in defense spending -- contrary to what the right thinks, government has not grown vastly bigger since the days of Saint Reagan. And there has been a recent rise, but as I've tried to point out on a number of occasions, most of that rise reflects safety net programs that will automatically shrink if and when the economy eventually recovers. There's a bit of stimulus spending in there too, but as I said, this is already fading out.
The point is that whatever you think of the rise in government spending -- which more or less stopped three decades ago -- Keynes had nothing to do with it.

HEADLINE: To Indian Students, Harvard's Admission Rate May Appear Almost Welcoming

BYLINE: THE EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Faced with cutoff scores that reached "a near-impossible" 100 percent in some cases, some Indian students are casting a longing glance toward American colleges. 

 BODY:
In a front-page article on Friday reported from New Delhi, Nida Najar writes of selectivity rates at Indian universities that have driven some students to find refuge at American colleges, whose admissions rates may look welcoming by comparison. 
Ms. Najar describes "a surging number of Indian students attending American colleges and universities, as competition in India has grown formidable, even for the best students.'' The problem, in part, is one of a numbers, "with about half of India's 1.2 billion people under the age of 25, and with the ranks of the middle class swelling.''
How tough is it to apply in India?
This summer, Delhi University issued cutoff scores at its top colleges that reached a near-impossible 100 percent in some cases. The Indian Institutes of Technology, which are spread across the country, have an acceptance rate of less than 2 percent - and that is only from a pool of roughly 500,000 who qualify to take the entrance exam, a feat that requires two years of specialized coaching after school. 
For those Indian students willing and able to pursue a higher education in the United States, recent trends on American campuses may prove fortuitous. As the article explains:
American universities and colleges have been more than happy to pick up the slack. Faced with shrinking returns from endowment funds, a decline in the number of high school graduates in the United States and growing economic hardship among American families, they have stepped up their efforts to woo Indian students thousands of miles away.
What do readers of The Choice -- those here in the United States, as well as others reading abroad -- make of these developments? And how do this year's applicants and their families feel about the concerted efforts to recruit students from India. Please use the comment box below to let us know.

HEADLINE: Opposite Sides of the Protest Come Together, Briefly

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: A polite, pointed exchange between two men who represent differing sides of the issues raised by the Occupy Wall Street protests. 

 BODY:
Two men at Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan on Thursday could hardly have looked more different.
One, Edward T. Hall III, 25, was barefoot and dressed in loud, multicolored tights. He wore a beaded American Indian necklace and New Age jewelry, with a baseball cap pulled sideways over his long hair.
The other, Jimmy Vivona, 40, wore a smart blue pinstripe suit, a conservative red-and-blue striped tie and good shoes. He had neatly coiffed hair and a close shave. He has caught glimpses of the protesters on walks during his lunch break.
In a way, they could serve as shorthand for a divide that has been come into stark relief during the Occupy Wall Street protests in downtown Manhattan, which are now in their fourth week. 
Mr. Hall is a well-educated young man with a privileged upbringing who said he was following a calling greater than getting a job and making money. He said he saw the protest as a global movement to help fight poverty and economic inequality. He has spent the past month sleeping in the park and is one of the organizers of the protest.
Mr. Vivona grew up in a working-class family on Staten Island and now lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, with his wife and two young children. He has been a stockbroker for 17 years, works "13- or 14-hour days" and has done well for himself on Wall Street.
"Not tens of millions of dollars, but I do O.K." was as specific as he would get.
City Room had arranged for the two to meet and to have a one-on-one discussion about the issues raised by the protesters. Trying to find someone to represent the views of the financial industry proved challenging, and several workers declined. Mr. Vivona, who was spotted outside Zuccotti Park, agreed.
At a nearby cafe, the men, an unlikely duo, sat across from each other. Mr. Vivona, who works in an office building two blocks from the park, had a Snapple. Mr. Hall - who, when told the meeting would be indoors, ended up covering his bare feet with a pair of women's rubber boots - went for a cappuccino.
The two men made cordial small talk at first. Mr. Hall said he played squash. Mr. Vivona said he played ice hockey. Then Mr. Hall began explaining some issues central to the protest, including concerns about a growing disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor in America.
Mr. Vivona reminded Mr. Hall that America was a democracy and that many of these issues should be resolved at the ballot box. He said that he respected the protesters' right to demonstrate and that this, in fact, was a testament to freedom of expression in America.
"We don't begrudge you the opportunity to protest," he said, adding that the right to free expression "makes us the best country in the world."
Mr. Hall agreed and said a goal of the protest was to help strengthen the United States by trying to address unemployment and lift wages for the working class that had been "crushed by banks."
Mr. Vivona said that he felt the protest was a bit unfocused in its message and that some of the signs made points that were "all over the place."
Mr. Hall acknowledged that "a lot of our message is easily distorted, as well as very hard to handle," and that "we've used, sort of, a sledgehammer" when a tiny hammer would have sufficed.
Mr. Hall said that he grew up in New Mexico and that both his parents were politically active lawyers who were thrilled that he was pursuing a socially conscious life and was involved in the Occupy Wall Street protest. Mr. Hall said he attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and then transferred to Bard College in upstate New York because of its reputation as a socially conscious school.
He had been renting in Washington Heights for the past two years while attending doctoral classes at Columbia University as a nonmatriculated student. He said that he supported his modest lifestyle with savings from working as a teenager and that he also had "a small trust fund" from his grandfather that he had not drawn from yet. For the past four weeks, he has eaten free meals and has slept in the park.
Mr. Vivona, a freelance broker for Empire Asset Management, a brokerage firm of about 30 brokers, said his prosperity depended on the economy. At best, he might be able to retire at age 50, but with a tougher economy would have to work into his 60s.
Perhaps his main message to Mr. Hall was that many Wall Street finance workers were not "fat cats," but rather hard-working people who had simply "done well for themselves" without becoming exorbitantly rich.
"They're guys like me, who work hard every day," he said. "Every nickel I make, I work hard for."
When Mr. Hall questioned why top executives made such big bonuses, Mr. Vivona countered with a sports analogy: of course Wayne Gretzky is going to earn much more than a much lesser hockey player.
When Mr. Hall mentioned capping high salaries, Mr. Vivona responded, "But isn't that a brand of socialism in a way?"
The discussion between the two men occurred before news broke that the planned cleanup of Zuccotti Park on Friday morning had been called off.
Reached by phone, Mr. Vivona said he hoped that it was not a sign that the protesters would be staying much longer.
"I'd like to see things get back to some normalcy down here," he said.
That was much the same point he made to Mr. Hall on Thursday.
"At some point, you have to be satisfied with the message you came to convey," he said.
But Mr. Hall saw no immediate end to the protest, saying, "We have to be patient with each other."
After the conversation, the two men exchanged phone numbers. Mr. Vivona straightened his tie and went back to his brokerage firm. Mr. Hall kicked off the boots and cheerfully walked barefoot back to the park to continue strategizing.

HIGHLIGHT: Third base at Comerica Park is where the elite meet. 

 BODY:
Official news conference transcript with third base, Oct. 13, 2011, 9:04 p.m., Central time, Comerica Park.
Question: How are you feeling?
Third Base: I am doing well. The Tigers' equipment manager rubbed some liniment oil on my front face where Cabrera's double hit me, and it feels soft and supple again. I'm a base, you know, so I absorb hits like that all the time when guys step on me or slide into me.
Question: After that play, did you interact with Cabrera or Beltre at all?
Third Base: Not really. I have gotten to know Adrian over the course of the series, and he is a professional. I know there are no hard feelings. Cabrera stepped on me on the next play, the Victor Martinez triple, but he didn't say anything, which is unusual considering all of the talking he has done throughout the series.
Question: Do you feel any sort of connection with Cabrera?
Third Base: I think we have a special relationship. On Wednesday night, he stood on me for an extra two seconds when he should have been tagging up on Delmon Young's flyout. It was like an old married couple saying goodbye in an airport. I know he used to play third base. Maybe I remind him of some other base. Anyway, we are tied together by history now.
Question: Have any other inanimate objects from baseball history reached out to you since the carom play?
Third Base: I just got a text from George Brett's pine tar bat. He said: "Get ready for a media circus!" The left-field foul pole at Fenway also called me. He warned me that Carlton Fisk doesn't even acknowledge him anymore; that this can be a cruel business, and that people can be fickle.
Question: Have you heard from Cooperstown?
Third Base: Going in the Hall of Fame would be great, but I was just talking to home plate outside the equipment bag, and he said, "You know what, Detroit is my home." And when home calls a place home, it really makes you think, you know?
Question: Is there any truth to the rumor that you are now dating Kourtney Kardashian's welcome mat?
Third Base: This interview is over!
Cruz Missiles: Nelson Cruz set a major league record with five league championship series home runs. In the process, he has officially moved into second place on the career list of baseball players named Cruz.
Cruz has been flirting with Jose Cruz Jr. for second place for some time, but with 11 runs batted in in this series, there is no question that he is the more historically significant player. If the Rangers reach the World Series and Cruz stays hot, he could challenge for first place.
The all-time Cruz list, as it now stands:
First: Jose Cruz. A tremendous line-drive hitter with speed and some power who played his best years in the Astrodome, where you needed a boarding pass and less than 3.4 ounces of toothpaste to reach the warning track. According to some sabermetricians, if Cruz had played in a neutral park, he would have hit 11 trillion home runs.
Second: Nelson Cruz.
Third: Jose Cruz Jr. Much like his father, plus a smidgen of power but minus about 40 points of batting average. Best known for dropping a routine fly in the 11th inning of the 2003 N.L.C.S., then winning the Gold Glove a few days later. When it comes to the 11th inning of playoff games, it is feast or famine for guys named Cruz.
Fourth: Vicente De La Cruz Padilla. A career midrotation starter with a 104-90 record. Padilla was briefly the Phillies' staff ace in the final days of Veterans Stadium, and fans would wear sombreros and paddle imaginary canoes through uninhabited sections of the ballpark as Padilla's Flotilla. Shaky cultural sensitivity aside, this is the cleverest thing that happened in Philadelphia in the era between Ben Franklin's lightning experiments and Comcast's purchase of NBC Universal.
Fifth: Julio Cruz. An incredibly light-hitting (career slugging percentage: .299) glove man at second base for the Mariners and the White Sox in the 1980s. Cruz stole 373 career bases. This was before baseball became a giant probabilistic modeling exercise, so you could enjoy a slap-hitting speedster without worrying about how his suboptimal econometric profile was costing your team runs. Was once traded straight up for Tony Bernazard.
Sixth: Tommy de la Cruz: A Cuban-born pitcher who got a wartime call-up in 1944, Cruz was 9-9 with a 3.25 E.R.A. as a 32-year-old rookie for the Reds. He was drafted that winter, but enlisted with the Cuban military instead, then pitched in the Mexican League (then an independent minor league that played at a very high level) for several years. He is in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame. Speaking of Cuban pitchers for the Reds, Ardolis de la Cruz Chapman could also make this list someday, but he has only six wins to Tommy de la Cruz's nine.
Seventh: Mike Stanton. The young Marlins slugger's full name is Giancarlo Cruz Michael Stanton. So the story goes, Stanton's name was so mangled by teachers that by fifth grade he shortened it to Mike. The real tragedy here is that Stanton, starting in kindergarten, encountered six college-educated professionals who had trouble pronouncing Giancarlo.
Eighth: Delvi Cruz. Batted .302 with 10 homers for the Tigers in his best season. Was last seen playing for the Bridgeport Bluefish five years ago. Another mysterious disappearance into the Connecticut Triangle.
Ninth: Heity Cruz. Jose Cruz's brother and Jose Cruz Jr.'s uncle, Heity finished third in the rookie of the year vote in 1976 with a .228-13-71 line. The bicentennial was a horrible year for National League rookies. (Mark Fidrych, known as the Bird, won it in the American League, so it was really a bad year all around.) Various teams spent the next decade waiting for Heity to turn into his brother, or at least match the awesome power of his 13-homer rookie year. He never did.
Tenth: Todd Cruz. A dribble-hitting utility infielder who made Julio Cruz look like Mel Ott. After several seasons of .200-level hitting, Todd somehow wound up the starting third baseman for Earl Weaver's pennant-winning 1983 Orioles. He batted seventh during the World Series despite a .199 season batting average, which tells you all you need to know about the offensive prowess of the longtime Orioles catcher Rick Dempsey. In Game 2 of the World Series, Cruz singled on a sacrifice attempt, helping the Orioles score the go-ahead run in a fifth-inning rally that became the turning point of the Series.
It only goes to show you that no player is too obscure or ineffective to embarrass the Phillies at some point in his career.

Welcome to a look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers and Acquisitions
PAYING FOR ENERGY Canada's oil-rich resources are increasingly attracting the attention of energy-hungry Chinese companies. "Sinopec of China agreed on Sunday to buy Daylight Energy, a Canadian oil and natural gas producer, for about $2.1 billion in cash," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reported.
Investment Banking
MORE JOB LOSSES COMING? A report issued Tuesday by New York's state comptroller warned that nearly 10,000 workers in the securities industry in New York could lose their jobs through the end of next year. "It now seems likely that profits will fall sharply, job losses will continue and bonuses will be smaller than last year," Thomas P. DiNapoli said. DealBook's Kevin Roose and Mark Scott report that "Wall Street's struggles will most likely be reflected in New York City's tax revenue, as well as in the revenues of nonfinancial businesses."
EARNINGS SEASON ARRIVES Banks began reporting earnings this week. The Times wrote that "over all, revenue is expected to fall 4 percent in the third quarter, slipping back to 2005 levels, according to data from Trepp. The industry's earnings are expected to be about what they were in late 2002."
JPMorgan Chase & Company reported on Thursday that profit fell 4 percent to $4.26 billion. The results came despite a "paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter."
Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. But Jesse Eisinger of Pro Publica, The Trade columnist, finds that Wall St. banks face a deficit of trust. "Morgan Stanley by any measure is a safe and solid investment bank. Except for one: The amount of trust people have in the whole financial and political system. It's just about zero."
IN EUROPE On Sunday, the leaders of Germany and France announced that they would have a package of reforms by the time leaders of the Group of 20 nations meet in early November. "The announcement came on the same day that the governments of France, Belgium and Luxembourg agreed to nationalize part of Dexia, Belgium's biggest bank," The Times reported.
On Tuesday, France detailed plans aimed at protecting its most vulnerable financial institutions.
On Wednesday, the European Commission released proposals to recapitalize Europe's banks and the European Union said the banks need to raise more capital.
IN ASIA Investors signaled their approval after China's sovereign wealth fund started buying shares in the countries four main banks to stem a steep decline in stock prices.
OCCUPY WALL STREET Anti-bank activism continues to spread to top college campuses, London and Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase. Pranks continue to ensue.
Private Equity
LOW-COST RETAILERS "99 Cents Only Stores agreed on Tuesday to sell itself to a group of investors that includes its founding family for $1.6 billion in cash, ending a months-long sales process," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reported. "So far this year, low-cost retailers have been a popular target for private equity firms. Such stores are expected to continue growing amid deepening economic malaise."
Hedge Funds
RECRUITMENT CONFLICTS In the auspicious 55,555 issue of The New York Times, DealBook examined the potential conflicts of Wall Street banks acting as full-time headhunters for their hedge fund clients. "Hedge fund executives may be swayed to direct business to the Wall Street firm that hired them rather than the bank that makes the best sense for investors," Susanne Craig and Azam Ahmed reported. The next day, Massachusetts's chief financial regulator asked top banks for more details on their recruiting.
NO ONE'S PERFECT John A. Paulson admitted in his quarterly conference call that he had made a bad bet on a recovery in the domestic economy. "We made a mistake," Mr. Paulson said. DealBook's Azem Ahmed reported that "so far, investors have largely been patient, choosing to stick by the manager who made them, or at least some of them, so much money in the recession."
I.P.O./Offerings
GROWTH VS. PROFIT Steven M. Davidoff, The Deal Professor, used his column this week to examine the accounting at Groupon and Zynga. "After pushing the envelope when it comes to accounting and corporate governance, it's no wonder that neither Groupon nor Zynga has been able to get an I.P.O. off the ground."
Venture/Capital
FUND-RAISING TUMBLES DealBook's Evelyn M. Rusli reported that "enture capital firms raised $1.72 billion in the third quarter, the lowest level since 2003, according to a report released on Monday by Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association."
Legal/Regulatory
GALLEON SENTENCING "The fallen hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam received the longest prison sentence ever for insider trading on Thursday," DealBook's Peter Lattman reported. Despite a sentence of 11 years in jail, "many Americans have questioned why authorities have not pursued charges against bank executives over their role in the financial crisis."
On Wednesday, Michael A. Kimelman, a journeyman trader convicted of insider trading, was sentenced to two and a half years. Mr. Lattman examined the man and his family caught in the outer edge of Mr. Rajaratnam's insider trading web. "Of course I have regrets about not pleading guilty; I could've ended this ordeal two years ago," said Mr. Kimelman. "But at the same time, I wouldn't have been able to look myself in the mirror if I admitted to doing something that I didn't do."
DODD-FRANK ACT The banking industry revamp known as the Volcker Rule moved a step closer this week to becoming law, reports DealBook's Ben Protess. On Tuesday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation unanimously approved an initial version of the regulation. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission also advanced the proposal.
NON-BANK OVERSIGHT The Financial Stability Oversight Council voted unanimously to seek public comment on a proposed rule that laid out the standards by which financial companies that are not banks but have more than $50 billion in assets and $20 billion in debt could be regulated by the Federal Reserve and required to meet tougher standards.
ENDING MARKET SWINGS The sustained volatility of the stock markets continues to worry investors and regulators alike. Multiple suspects are available. Regulators in the United States and overseas are worried that computerized high-speed trading is making market swings worse. DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin talked with investors who said that leveraged exchange-traded funds are the culprit behind the late-day market swings.
Miscellaneous
MUTUAL FUNDS The Times's third quarter mutual funds report came out on Sunday. "Conditions may improve for the long haul," Conrad de Aenlle reported, "but ponderous progress on major issues could bring more pain in the short run."
OFF THE CLOCK DealBook's Kevin Roose profiles a credit broker who dreams about dancing the cha-cha on the trading floor. A slide show of the broker/dancer is below.

HEADLINE: Research Group Sees Deterioration in U.S. Fuel-Economy Gains

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: A team from the University of Michigan said that while fleetwide efficiency had improved in recent years, 2011 had brought a backslide. 

 BODY:
For all the attention devoted to American car buyers' rediscovery of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles in 2011, a report released this week suggests that such purchase trends are having little impact on overall fuel economy.
A team at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute said this week that the fleetwide average fuel economy of new vehicles purchased in the United States had been on a downward slide since March. From a high of 23 miles per gallon in that month, the average has slid to 22.1 m.p.g. through September, according to the researchers. The 22.1 m.p.g. figure matched the team's calculation for August.
One reason that fuel economy numbers were flat, and have decreased since March, was the moderation of gasoline prices this year. Lower prices at the pump do not motivate people to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles, said Dr. Michael Sivak, the head of the institute's Human Factors Group, in a telephone interview.
During the summer of 2009, when the price of gasoline hit $4 a gallon, the team observed a corresponding increase in fleetwide fuel economy of new cars. The price of gas, however, is not the only determinant.
Larger vehicles like pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s have remained popular with consumers, said Brandon Schoettle, Dr. Sivak's colleague, which impacted the team's calculations.
"It is true the proportion of these small vehicles has increased in terms of overall sales during this time, but the fact is that some of the large pickup trucks remain at the top of the sales rankings," Mr. Schoettle said.
Year-to-date sales figures from J.D. Power & Associates showed that consumers bought 255,219 Ford F-150 pickup trucks, making it the best-selling vehicle so far this year. In contrast, Chevrolet had sold 187,524 Cruzes, which in Eco trim are rated at 42 m.p.g. in highway driving. And according to Edmunds.com, sales of advanced-powertrain models like hybrids and plug-in vehicles slowed in September.
The researchers noted that the average fuel economy for new vehicles had improved 2 m.p.g. since they began their study four years ago.
"To have improved by two miles per gallon in the course of four years is significant," said Dr. Sivak.
In addition to looking at average fleetwide fuel economy, the team is also calculating a national Eco-Driving Index. The index represents the average monthly amount of greenhouse gases produced by an individual American driver who purchased a new vehicle that month.
"We are trying to show where is society heading," Dr. Zivak wrote in a follow-up e-mail. "Are we making improvements in lessening dependence on oil? Are we making improvements in terms of the emissions that we are producing by burning gasoline? We are tracking changes both for fuel economy reasons as well as for environmental reasons. Having a broad picture is critical for policy makers."
The team will continue releasing monthly updates of both the average fuel economy of vehicles purchased and the index. To view historical fuel economy calculations, click here. Calculations of the Eco-Driving Index, along with a graph and table of current and recent values, can be found here.

HEADLINE: Lean on Me: Trust and Friendship Around the World

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Among the many reasons Americans are lucky is that they tend to have people they can depend on. 

 BODY:
Among the many reasons Americans are lucky is that they tend to have people they can depend on.
That is one of the takeaways from a recent reportfrom the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which in part looked at social relationships and trust around the developed world. Here is a chart showing the share of a country's population that say they have relatives or friends they can count on for help in times of need:
The United States is in the middle of the pack of the countries surveyed, with 92.3 percent of Americans saying they have a support network. Compare this to a country like India, where only 59.3 percent of people say they have a network they can depend on in times of need.
Having friends and family you can lean on is particularly important for those who are more likely to need support from time to time - that is, lower-income people.
Unfortunately, the O.E.C.D. found that people with lower incomes and less education were least likely to have a personal social safety net:
Perhaps partly because they generally have good support networks, Americans are slightly more trusting than residents of other countries; 36.6 percent of Americans agreed that "most people can be trusted," compared with 33 percent across the developed world.
But distrust reigns when it comes to opinions of some of their most prominent institutions.
Just 30.1 percent of Americans have a "high level of trust" in the media, compared to an O.E.C.D. average of 40.4 percent. Even China, where news organizations are state-run, somehow managed to have higher trust in the media (54.6 percent). The same is true in Mexico (52 percent), where journalists reportedly self-censor to avoid angering the drug cartels.
Americans are also slightly less likely than other developed countries to say they have a high level of trust in their national government, yet somewhat more likely to trust in their own country's judicial system.

HEADLINE: This Sunday: Twitterify the Magazine

BYLINE: HUGO LINDGREN


HIGHLIGHT: Like some people, I have misgivings about Twitter. Not a philosophical quarrel. It's more that I'm just not very good at tweeting. 

 BODY:
Like some people, I have misgivings about Twitter. Not a philosophical quarrel. It's more that I'm just not very good at tweeting. Mostly, I do it to promote the magazine's articles, but sometimes that feels too self-serving, and I impulsively tweet something that momentarily strikes me as witty and/or meaningful. That never goes well. A few weeks ago, I tweeted inanely about umbrellas. Why should anyone care? It haunts me still.
What I unabashedly like about Twitter, however, is the way it forces people to distill their thoughts. All you've got is 140 characters. The best practitioners have a way of mixing trivialities, humor and actually valuable insights in a way that I find really invigorating. So for this editor's note, I decided to ask the magazine staff to help me condense the entire issue into a series of tweets - what's funny or interesting or smart or weird about every story. The observant will notice that a few entries go a bit longer than 140 characters because, well, editors are not good at counting. Our culture editor Adam Sternbergh, a natural at Twitter, helped with with hashtags.
Here it is:

HEADLINE: Women in India: Bringing in the Other Half

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI and NIKHILA GILL


HIGHLIGHT: A World Bank report on gender equality presents a mixed picture in India. 

 BODY:
When put in charge, women in India are better than men at providing clean water and adequate sanitation for their communities. And despite the gains women have made in the developed world, they're still doing about as much of the housework and childcare as women in India. 
The World Bank's recently released 2012 World Development Report on gender equality and development shows progress in some areas, while in others gaps in inequality between men and women stubbornly persist. 
India Ink spoke to Sudhir Shetty, the co-director of the report, to find out more.
In a field that tends to focus on the glass-half-empty side of issues, those who worked on the report say there is still some reason for cheer.
"In all developed countries and 60 out of 90 developing countries, there are more girls in universities than boys, which is pretty striking," Mr. Shetty said.
There are other heartening indicators. Mr. Shetty points out that in the United States, it took about 110 years for the number of children a woman has, on average, to drop from six to three. It took just 35 years in India to make that stride. Iran managed it in eight.
Still, there are sobering facts: Mr. Shetty said that although the lifespan of women has improved over time, women and girls in developing countries still tend to die sooner than their counterparts in rich countries. Each year about 4 million women "go missing" as a result of either sex-selective practices, early childhood death due to malnutrition or lack of access to clean drinking water, or during childbirth.
It's not just the maternal mortality rate that's staggering. Jishnu Das, a senior economist who worked on the report, said that women still primarily take care of their homes and families as compared to men. And this is true across the world.
Women in India do about as much of a share of the household work and child care (81 percent) as the women in a developed country like Italy (77 percent), according to the report. (Page 219 of report)
In terms of productivity in the economy, Mr. Shetty said the gap between men and women doesn't come from gender differences but from disparity in their access to resources. For example, if access to fertilizers, credit and land was controlled for, female farmers were as productive as their male counterparts, the authors of the report found.
In India, the team discovered that measures like the introduction of quotasfor women in the Panchayati Raj, or village level, led to better access to clean water and sanitation, crimes against women being reported more often, and a jump in prosecution for those crimes. Women make up one-third to one half of all Panchayats, or village governments. 
The authors of the report, however, refrained from saying if such a quota system for women would work in Parliament, and stressed that it was still a temporary measure.
"Governments cannot wait only for growth to take care of the problems. There needs to be active intervention," said Anna Maria Munoz Boudet, a gender specialist who worked on the report. 
Mr. Shetty points out that it's also smart policy to bring in the talents of the other half of the population since it boosts productivity. Moreover, "it's just wrong to deny that share of the population the same opportunity, the same access as the other 50 percent," he said.

HEADLINE: Unilever Buys Russian Cosmetics Brand

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: As its home market slows, the Anglo-Dutch firm is looking to emerging countries, agreeing to buy an 82 percent stake in Russian cosmetics brand Concern Kalina for $537 million. 

 BODY:
With Western economies struggling to avoid a double-dip recession, European consumer product's giant Unilever is heading East.
The Anglo-Dutch firm has agreed to buy an 82 percent stake in Russian cosmetics brand Concern Kalina for $537 million, an acquisition that values Kalina at roughly $690 million.
Under the terms of the deal, Unilever will add Kalina's portfolio to the company's existing skin, hair and oral care brands in Russia.
As their home markets slow, consumer product giants have been looking to the emerging markets and beyond for growth. Russia's economy is on track to grow 4.3 percent this year. That compares with just a 1 percent growth forecast for the European Union, according to the International Monetary Fund.
 "Acquisitions such as Concern Kalina supplement organic growth and add powerful new brands to our portfolio," Unilever's chief executive, Paul Polman, said in a statement. "It will also strengthen and rebalance Unilever's portfolio and competitive position in Russia, an emerging market with considerable potential."
According to the companies, Kalina - Russia's largest domestic personal care company - is expected to report $418 million in revenue this year.
Unilever is not the only Western firm to target Eastern Europe. Last December, the beverage giant PepsiCo agreed to buy a 66 percent stake in a Russian food and beverage company, Wimm-Bill-Dann, for $3.8 billion.
Not every global brand, though, has enjoyed success in the East. The mega retailer Walmart closed its Moscow office last year after failing to buy a single Russian retail asset. 
Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., is taking another crack at the emerging market. Last month, the company appointed Lev Khasis, former chief executive of Russia's largest retailer, the X5 Retail Group, as a senior vice president.
Along with Russia, the other so-called BRIC countries have been popular for acquisitions, with all four countries expected to record bumper growth this year. According to the IMF, Brazil will record 3.8 percent growth this year, while the economies of India and China will expand by 7.8 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively.
That represents a fall in G.D.P. growth for all the BRIC countries compared with last year, but still outstrips the an expected 1.5 percent increase in the United States for 2011.

 BODY:
The Road Ahead for Raj Rajaratnam | Raj Rajaratnam is entering the next phase of his insider trading case.
With federal district court judge Richard J. Holwell sentencing Mr. Rajaratnam to 11 years in a federal prison and a $10 million fine, he will try to remain out of prison as long as possible while the lawyers prepare for the promised appeal.
Under the federal guidelines, a prison term of over 10 years means Mr. Rajaratnam will not be eligible to serve the first part of his sentence in a minimum-security work camp, and instead will be assigned initially to a low security facility. According to the B.O.P. website, that means he will be behind "double-fenced perimeters," with "mostly dormitory or cubicle housing."

HEADLINE: Podcast: Insider Trading, Job Creation and Fighting Cancer

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen. 

 BODY:
A federal judge in Manhattan this week imposed the longest insider-trading sentence ever in the United States. 
In a conversation on the new Weekend Business podcast, Peter Lattman, who covered the sentencing of the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam in the case, says the government argues that it will have a powerful deterrent effect. 
Mr. Lattman said that it contrasts, however, with a comparative lack of prosecutions, convictions and long sentences for executives whose firms may share responsibility for the financial crisis that began in 2007. 
In a separate conversation, Robert Shiller, the Yale economics professor, discusses the argument he makes in the Economic View column in Sunday Business that the government should put people to work in large-scale infrastructure projects. The proposal was included in President Obama's American Jobs Act, which was blocked at least in its full form by the Senate last week.
Natasha Singer talks to David Gillen in the podcast about her Sunday Business cover article on the "pinking of America" - the rise of a marketing powerhouse in the fight against breast cancer. 
And Steve Lohr discusses the importance of default choices on the Internet and in other parts of contemporary life. As he says in the Unboxed column in Sunday Business, much of the Internet is wide open, but the design of Web sites and the order of Web searches helps to determine what consumers actually see and select. 
In the news portion of the podcast, I discuss the Nobel prize in economics, which has been labeled a "Non-Keynesian Nobel." In my Strategies column in Sunday Business, Professor Christopher Sims of Princeton, one of the new Nobel laureates, makes it clear that he actually places his research within the Keynesian tradition. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: the insider trading case (30:23); news headlines (23:50); fighting breast cancer (21:23); Robert Shiller (11:55); designing for the Web (7:36); the week ahead (1:48).

HEADLINE: Ad Agencies Gear Up for Fourth Quarter

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: In preparation for the final quarter and the new year, several advertising agencies have announced major business moves to bolster their sales. 

 BODY:
6:12 p.m. | Updated This is the time of year when advertising agencies begin to announce major business moves in anticipation of positioning themselves for growth through the important fourth quarter and into the new year.
Among agencies with news on Friday are two units of Euro RSCG Worldwide, Euro RSCG New York and Euro RSCG Discovery; two agencies of MDC Partners that specialize in experiential marketing, Team Enterprises and Boom Marketing, which are joining forces with Michael Andretti for a new venture; and R/GA, the agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Euro RSCG New York and Euro RSCG Discovery are teaming up to expand Euro RSCG Discovery, which specializes in using data to decide how to develop ads, particularly in the digital realm. They are forming a unit, Euro RSCG Discovery New York, that will be part of Euro RSCG New York.

The new unit is to be led by Matt Blasco, 29, as managing director; he had been director of analytics at Euro RSCG New York.
Richard Notarianni, 46, executive director for planning and performance at Euro RSCG New York, will also serve as executive director at Euro RSCG Discovery New York.
The goal of the new unit is to help clients decide "where to spend their next dollar" more efficiently and effectively, Mr. Notarianni said, to improve business results.
Mr. Blasco said the rise of social media, which include the likes of Facebook and Twitter, made such steps more important. The new unit will help forge "better questions to ask," he said, and help determine "what type of person comes to social media" as well as who they talk to while there.
Euro RSCG Discovery New York starts with seven full-time employees, Mr. Blasco said, "and five more on the way."
Clients of the new unit include clients of Euro RSCG New York, Mr. Blasco said, like Dos Equis beer, General Electric, GlaxoSmithKline, Charles Schwab and Volvo.
"Our goal is to try and get some stand-alone clients" as well, he added. Euro RSCG Worldwide is part of the Havas Worldwide division of Havas.
The sports venture is centered on the opening of Andretti Sports Marketing, to be based in Indianapolis. It represents an effort by Mr. Andretti's Indycar team, Andretti Autosport, to expand its purview.
Andretti Sports Marketing will collaborate with the two MDC sports marketing agencies, which are to provide access to other agencies owned by MDC. There will be regional offices in New York, Toronto and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The management of Andretti Sports Marketing will include Mr. Andretti, as chairman and chief executive, and John Lopes, as president. Mr. Lopes will also continue as chief marketing officer at Andretti Autosport.
Andretti Sports Marketing will be devoted to helping marketers that use sports to reach their customers. Services will include managing how sponsorships work, public relations strategy, data tracking and analytics.
At R/GA, which is based in New York, the agency is bolstering its media and connections department by hiring Tony Effik to be managing director. The post is being created for Mr. Effik, who is 39.
Mr. Effik is joining R/GA from Publicis Modem in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, where he had been senior vice president for strategy and analytics. Before that, he was chief strategy officer in the Publicis Modem office in London.
At R/GA, Mr. Effik will report to Dawn Winchester, who is executive vice president and chief marketing services officer. R/GA, which is known for its digital work, has been beefing up other areas like creative, strategy and media.
In his new job, Mr. Effik will focus on improving R/GA's efforts in paid media, which include display ads and paid search as well as traditional media like television; owned media, which include client Web sites and Twitter feeds; and earned media, which include word of mouth and so-called viral videos.
Mr. Effik has also worked at agencies like JWT, M&C Saatchi and Wunderman. He also blogs at socialgraph.blogspot.com.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $17,000,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: The three-bedroom apartment at 15 Central Park West had sold for just $6.8 million three years ago. 

 BODY:
The three-bedroom condominium at 15 Central Park West that sold for $17 million - after last trading hands in 2008 for $6.8 million and thus generating nearly $10 million profit in just three years - was the highest sale of the week, according to city property records.
The 2,909-square-foot apartment is on the southeast corner of the third floor with views just above the tree line of Central Park, according to the listing posted by Kyle W. Blackmon, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens.
The sellers, Charles H. Berman, a real estate investor, and his wife, Melanie, had listed the apartment at $20.5 million, but reduced it to $16.75 million this spring. The buyer was a limited-liability company. Mr. Blackmon did not return calls seeking comment.
In addition to bringing the Bermans a hefty profit, the sale will enhance the reputation of 15 Central Park West as the building that can do no wrong. Home to celebrities like Sting and Denzel Washington, the Robert A. M. Stern-designed building has been breaking records since it opened on the Upper West Side in 2005.
Big Ticket includes closed deals from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Cleanup of Zuccotti Park Is Postponed

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN and CARA BUCKLEY


HIGHLIGHT: Some protesters said they believed that the desire to clean Zuccotti Park was a pretext to force them permanently out of the encampment that had been their home base for nearly a month. 

 BODY:
Updated, 2:38 p.m. | The cleanup of the Lower Manhattan park that has been occupied by protesters for nearly a month was postponed Friday shortly before it was supposed to begin, averting a feared showdown between the police and demonstrators, who had vowed to resist any efforts to evict them from their encampment.
But sporadic clashes between protesters and the police erupted anyway when demonstrators started marching through the winding streets of the financial district after learning that the cleanup had been called off. At least 15 were arrested, the police say.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a radio interview on Friday morning, sought to make it clear that the decision to postpone the cleanup was made by Brookfield Properties, the owner of Zuccotti Park.
He said the company made its decision after receiving a flurry of threatening phone calls from elected officials, though he said he did not know who those officials were or what they had specifically told Brookfield. It was also unclear how closely Brookfield and the Bloomberg administration had consulted before the decision on the clean-up operation was made. 
"Yesterday, as of 8 o'clock at night, they were going ahead to do it, but, as of midnight, they called and said they wanted to postpone the cleaning operations,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on his radio program on WOR-AM (710).
State Senator Daniel L. Squadron said on Friday that he had several conversations on Thursday night with Richard Clark, the chief executive of Brookfield, and "other stakeholders," urging Brookfield to delay the cleanup. "Brookfield Properties made the right decision in postponing its scheduled cleanup of Zuccotti Park,'' he said.
The announcement on the cleanup was made by the Bloomberg administration around 6:20 a.m., about 40 minutes before workers were scheduled to enter the park, which has been the home base for the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, angered by what they see as an unfair and corrupt financial system.
"Late last night, we received notice from the owners of Zuccotti Park - Brookfield Properties - that they are postponing their scheduled cleaning of the park, and for the time being withdrawing their request from earlier in the week for police assistance during their cleaning operation,'' Deputy Mayor Caswell F. Holloway said in a statement. 
"Brookfield believes they can work out an arrangement with the protesters that will ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use,'' Mr. Holloway said, "and that the situation is respectful of residents and businesses downtown.''
As news that the cleanup had been called off rippled through Zuccotti Park, cheers erupted among demonstrators who had been preparing for a possible confrontation.
"I did not come here to look for a fight,'' said Steve Sachs of Hightstown, N.J. "I've never been in a fight in my life. I've never been arrested. But I was ready to be arrested over this."
But clashes between the police and protesters flared on various streets in the financial district.
About 7:40 a.m., a man was seen being led away in handcuffs on Broadway. Moments later, a woman who said she was his girlfriend identified him as Michael Rivas.
Shortly afterward, at Maiden and Water Streets, police officers were seen taking four people into custody, placing them into a police wagon. One of those men appeared have a gash on his forehead and blood running down his face.
At one point, it appeared that as officers tried to keep the crowd on the sidewalk, a bag of garbage was hurled from the crowd and hit one officer. That prompted that officer and another to wade into the crowd and apprehend a man.
The crowds marched in roadways, accompanied or pursued by officers on foot or riding scooters.
Near the corner of Beaver and Broad Streets, officers wearing helmets leaped from scooters, tackled a man to the ground and placed him in handcuffs. At the intersection of William and Wall Streets, officers stood behind metal barricades as protesters filled the street in front of them. Some protesters waved mops and brooms that had been used earlier to clean Zuccotti Park.
Near Broadway and Exchange Place, officers drove scooters into a crowd of marchers. 
One man, a legal observer for the National Lawyers guild, had his leg pinned under a police motorcycle. Video appears to show an officer on a motorcycle, after running over the man's leg, leaving his motorcycle parked on the man's leg to go off to pursue protesters while the man writhes in pain.
Another video appears to show a police commander in a white shirt punching a demonstrator, though it does not show what came before.
Over the course of the morning, at least 15 people were arrested, including protesters who knocked over a police scooter, overturned trash cans, hurled bottles and sat in the street blocking traffic, said Paul J. Browne, the head police spokesman.
Brookfield's abrupt decision to call off the cleanup seemed to frustrate Mr. Bloomberg. He said that if Brookfield decided that it did still want to clean the park, it would place the city in a more difficult situation.
"From our point of view," Mr. Bloomberg said on the radio, "it will be a little harder, I think, at that point in time to provide police protection, but we have the greatest police department in the world and we will do what is necessary."
He also said Brookfield had come under intense pressure on Thursday night from local officials not to try to clean the park.
"My understanding is that Brookfield got lots of calls from many elected officials threatening them and saying, 'If you don't stop this, we'll make your life more difficult,' " Mr. Bloomberg said. "If those elected officials would spend half as much time trying to promote the city and get jobs to come here, we would go a long ways toward answering the concerns of the protesters.''
Hundreds of people had gathered overnight in Zuccotti Park in anticipation of what might happen on Friday, swelling the crowd to much larger numbers than have typically been encamped in the park, while others continued cleaning the park, which Brookfield complained had become filthy and a potential health threat.
Around 5 a.m., a collection of mops and brooms tood in a plastic bin on Liberty Street. Nearby were 27 buckets of soapy water. A woman handed out white rubber gloves to more than a dozen people. They walked to the west end of the park, at Trinity Place, and announced that they were going to begin a sweep, picking up and discarding objects that did not belong to anyone.
"This place is extremely important," said Kyle Christopher, 27, a photographer from Buffalo, who has been part of the protests since their first week.
Patrick Bruner, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street, said that on Thursday night protesters tried to deliver a petition with more than 100,000 signatures to City Hall, calling upon Mr. Bloomberg to allow the occupation to continue.
On Thursday night, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. sent a message to members asking them to show up at the park early Friday morning to support the protesters.
By 6 a.m., the crowd had swelled to more than a thousand.
Andy Friedman, 38, of Park Slope, Brooklyn, said he had come to the park in response to the union's call for solidarity.
"For the past 30 years, banks in this country have been making out like bandits," said Mr. Friedman, who works for the service employees' union, S.E.I.U. "And the rest of us are going backwards."
On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg announced that the park would be cleaned.
In a letter to the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, dated Tuesday, Mr. Clark, Brookfield's chief executive, wrote that conditions in the park had reached "unsafe" levels, and he reiterated his complaint that the encampment violated the law.
Overflowing garbage cans attract rodents, he wrote, gas-fired generators pose a fire hazard, bad smells abound, the lack of toilets are making things worse and complaints are mounting from disgruntled people who live and work nearby.
"In light of this and the ongoing trespassing of the protesters," Mr. Clark wrote, "we are again requesting the assistance of the New York City Police Department to help clear the park."
The protesters feared that Mr. Bloomberg's announcement that the park would be cleaned was a prelude to their being banned permanently. An appeal quickly went out on Facebook and other sites calling for brooms, mops and various cleaning supplies as well as volunteers willing to donate elbow grease. After cleaning the place themselves, the protesters planned to form a human chain around the park to try to keep police officers from entering. Supporters had been urged to go to the park at 6 a.m. Friday "to defend the occupation from eviction."
Clashes between the police and protesters have occurred several times since protesters began camping in the park on Sept. 17. Scores of protesters were arrested during a march to Union Square on Sept. 24, and several women were pepper-sprayed by a high-ranking police officer, in an episode that is being investigated by the Manhattan district attorney's office.
On Oct. 1, about 700 protesters were arrested while trying to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. And 28 people were arrested after an Oct. 6 march in Lower Manhattan, which attracted thousands and drew the backing of large labor unions.
Triggered by a call to action from Adbusters, a Canadian magazine, Occupy Wall Street began as a protest against income inequality and what demonstrators portray as corporate greed, drawing several hundred people to Lower Manhattan but barely registering a blip on the radar of mainstream news media. Participants declared themselves the part of the "99 percent" to highlight their claim that 1 percent of Americans control much of the country's wealth.
News of the protest steadily grew, fanned by coverage of pepper-spraying episodes, the mass arrests on the bridge and the eruption of similar protests nationwide and around the world. Its support base widened. Celebrities visited the protesters, among them Susan Sarandon and Kanye West. Unions, politicians and academics lent their support. The protest was taken up by more and more people, angry over chronic joblessness, rising debt and what they view as a grossly imbalanced economic system.

HEADLINE: A Look at the Debates, Beyond the Big Moments

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: The dirty secret of debates is that, for all the reporters who descend on each town for each verbal sparring match, they really can be covered just well as on television. 

 BODY:
The list of great moments in political debates is long and well-trod - Ronald Reagan bellowing "I'm paying for this microphone," Lloyd Bentsen putting down Dan Quayle with his "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy" line and, more recently, Barack Obama informing Hillary Rodham Clinton that she was "likable enough."
The 2012 presidential debates - featuring Herman Cain's invocation of "9-9-9!" and Rick Perry's scrambling of his attack on Mitt Romney - are still unfolding. But the dirty secret of debates is that, for all the reporters who descend on each town for each verbal sparring match, they really can be covered just well by watching television. 
Because, when reporters show up to cover debates, they don't sit in the actual debate hall. Instead, they're kept in an oversize filing center, completely removed from the real action, which is reserved for family, friends, party bigwigs and real live voters. 
It's no surprise, then, that as this debate seasons runs on and on and on - seven and counting, so far, with another one next Tuesday in Las Vegas - the press often remembers the debates less by what was said, and more by where they were put and what they were fed. 
The Fox News debate in Ames, Iowa, where Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, made his first appearance and Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, made his last? That would be the arena floor covered with folding tables, with just one large Jumbotron broadcasting the show. Also, when the debate was over, the staff cut the power, and reporters found themselves totally reliant on their laptop batteries to write their stories. 
The Politico/MSNBC debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.? Great location, but the press was stuck outside in a large tent with no air-conditioning.
Things improved a bit at the Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Fla., where Google took over the filing center and turned it into a mini version of their fabled Mountain View campus. There were fresh smoothies, a root beer float bar, sleek white couches and comfy beanbag chairs. Of course, in all the excitement, Google originally forgot to devote enough space for reporters to actually file their stories - and they were forced to haul out the foosball tables to make room for the work stations.
The most recent Bloomberg/Washington Post debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., was lovely, accoutremently speaking. The Bloomberg pre-and-post party tent featured lobster rolls and an open bar, and reporters found themselves inundated with debate swag. Blooomberg - until recently, best known swag-wise for their sturdy, oversize umbrellas - gave out sleek water bottles emblazoned with the company name. And The Washington Post offered up plastic windshield scrapers, prompting some loyal Post reporters to offer the type of spin normally reserved for political flacks; the scrapers, they pointed out, would be far more practical for the icy New Hampshire and Iowa winters than some old water bottle that probably would not even make it through airport security.
For candidates, as well, some of the most interesting action takes place offstage. Michele Bachmann's brief vanishing act during the Ames debate - when the cameras cut back to the stage after a commercial and her podium stood empty for a few awkward seconds - was the result of confusion over just how long was allotted for bathroom breaks. 
And what about that animated conversation Mitt Romney and Charlie Rose, the debate moderator, seemed to be having during the commercial break up at Dartmouth? Mr. Rose had asked Mr. Romney for his thoughts on how to handle the Greek economic crisis.
So, just what do candidates do to prepare for the big day? An adviser to Mr. Romney said that he spent about two hours Tuesday morning in debate prep. It was nothing super formal, but he sat around a table with a half dozen or so senior folks on the campaign, and talked through what had been in the news recently and possible responses to expected questions. (They also ordered lunch - "submarine sandwiches.") Mr. Romney spent his remaining free time relaxing with his wife, Ann.
Ron Paul, meanwhile, started his day with a 15-mile bike ride, said Jesse Benton, his campaign chairman. He then "worked in his garden" before hopping on a flight to New Hampshire, where he caught up on the financial news and met with his staff for about 45 minutes. 
Mr. Perry likes to go running on debate days, and his spokesman said he went for a jog. Rick Santorum said he opted for no debate prep, because he owed it to the voters to show them the "real," unvarnished Santorum.
"It's annoying," quipped an aide, who seemed to wish his boss might prepare a bit more diligently. 
And Fred Karger, who bills himself as the first openly gay Republican presidential candidate, did not make it into Tuesday night's debate, but he was there in the post-debate spin room, ready to go.
"I have a team assembled ready to do debate prep," he explained, if and when he finally makes it onstage.

HEADLINE: If Democratic Videos Are Guide, Romney Is the Front-Runner

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In the last several days, President Obama's political allies have made a series of attacks on Mitt Romney's character and record, virtually ignoring the other Republican candidates and the continuing primary campaign. 

 BODY:
Republicans are heading into an intense period of presidential campaigning as their candidates jockey to be the party's nominee next year.
But Democratic leaders appear to have already decided who will win that contest: Mitt Romney.
In the last several days, President Obama's political allies have made a series of attacks on Mr. Romney's character and record, virtually ignoring the other Republican candidates and the continuing primary campaign.
It is as if the Democrats have fast-forwarded to the spring of 2012.
In a new Web video released Friday morning, the Democratic National Committee continued to hammer Mr. Romney for referring to the president's proposed payroll tax cut as a "little Band-Aid" for the middle class.
"Fifteen hundred dollars might be a Band-Aid to Mitt Romney," the video says. "But to a middle-class family, fifteen hundred goes a long way. Mitt Romney, he's wrong for the middle class."
Committee officials have said that they plan to use the remark repeatedly to contrast Mr. Romney with Mr. Obama. The tactic underscores the assumption on the part of Democrats that Mr. Romney will emerge from the field of Republican candidates with the nomination.
That was the guess of most Democratic officials earlier this year. But their focus has bounced back and forth somewhat as other Republicans emerged as potential threats to Mr. Romney. 
When Michele Bachmann won the Iowa straw poll, Mr. Obama's allies focused on her briefly. Rick Perry's rise in the polls several weeks ago prompted a flurry of activity from the committee and others about his record. And Herman Cain's surge has even prompted some attention.
But now the focus is back squarely on Mr. Romney -- and his campaign has noticed.
In a new video released Friday, Mr. Romney's campaign asks "What is the White House worried about?" Is it jobs, the economy, home foreclosures, spending, the video wonders? 
It then cuts to a rapid-fire series of clips from Mr. Obama's top aides all saying Mr. Romney's name. It ends with the word "Nervous?" on the screen, and the date of the 2012 elections: "Nov. 6, 2012."
"President Obama has turned America into an economic disaster zone," said Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney. "The only question is whether we can make it to the election of 2012 before Obama takes us all the way back to 1929."
In a recent memo to reporters, Bill Burton, the head of a Super P.A.C. designed to support Mr. Obama's re-election, asked the question "What's the matter with Romney?"
"Rick Perry's sudden decline and Herman Cain's concurrent surge reinforces an important point about the primary: Republican voters are still desperately shopping for an alternative to Romney," Mr. Burton wrote. "While he may well end up the nominee, it is only because their voters will have exhausted all other options."
Mr. Burton, a former deputy press secretary in Mr. Obama's White House, noted poll numbers suggesting that Mr. Romney's support has failed to grow much. And he noted that favorability ratings for the former Massachusetts governor have remained unchanged for months.
But even as he raised the possibility of another nominee, Mr. Burton was clearly aiming to undermine Mr. Romney by pointing out his flaws.
The Democratic focus on Mr. Romney as the likely challenger to Mr. Obama is sure to intensify as 2012 approaches. And it could shift quickly if Mr. Romney stumbles or if Mr. Perry or Mr. Cain or another candidate seizes the spotlight again.
But for the moment, Democrats have Mr. Romney squarely in their sights.

HEADLINE: Perry Urges Aggressive Energy Production Policy

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican candidate's energy plan relies on tapping domestic resources to feed the nation's energy needs and help the economy. 

 BODY:
2:17 p.m. | Updated WEST MIFFLIN, Pa. - Gov. Rick Perry of Texas released a long-promised jobs and energy proposal that resembled a wishlist for the oil and gas industry, promising drilling across much of the country, including in Alaska's wilderness, and a curtailing of environmental regulations that includes a "dismantling" of the Environmental Protection Agency in its current form.
The plan he laid out during a speech at the United States Steel plant here on Friday morning contained several proposals that he predicted would free the nation from reliance on foreign energy and create 1.2 million jobs.
"My plan will break the grip of dependence we have today on foreign oil from hostile nations like Venezuela and unstable nations in the Middle East to grow jobs and our economy at home," he said in the speech.
But he offered no specific evidence in the speech to support its two major claims, and he made some questionable assertions, including one statement - that there had never been a case of unsafe hydraulic fracturing of natural gas - that was plainly false.
Mr. Perry called on oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico to be restored to the pace seen before the BP disaster, even though drilling activity there is already approaching pre-spill levels and the Interior Department has announced a major new lease sale.
Mr. Perry's plan has four parts: Use executive decrees to allow new or additional drilling in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and federal lands in the Western United States; rollback or weaken environmental regulations; dismantle the E.P.A. and replace it with a "scaled down agency;" and reshape subsidies and tax credits for different parts of the energy industry.
Many of Mr. Perry's proposals also appeared very similar to -- if not drawn from -- an industry-funded study that was endorsed last month by the American Petroleum Institute. That study asserted that opening new regions to drilling and taking other steps also proposed by Mr. Perry would create an additional 1 million jobs in seven years.
A Perry spokesman did not respond to an email about whether the governor's plan was based on the industry proposal or whether his aides had consulted the study's authors. Perry campaign officials have also declined to say who authored the new energy plan.
Mr. Perry, who has seen his popularity slip in recent polls after some lackluster debate performances, has staked his rebound in part on the rollout of his economic plan, and his hopes that it will be taken seriously by Republican voters and donors.
The Texas governor has premised much of his campaign on the notion that he has been a job-creator in Texas, claiming credit for hundreds of thousands of jobs through his policies, even though many economists say other factors like the state's robust oil and gas economy and relatively muted housing problems are major reasons for its recent job growth.
A spokesman for President Obama's re-election campaign said Mr. Perry's energy plan "isn't the way to win the future, it's straight out of the past - doubling down on finite resources with no plan to promote innovation or to transition the nation to a clean energy economy."

HEADLINE: Perry Addresses Wife's Comments on His Faith

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Anita Perry described a "rough month" of criticism in the press and from other Republicans. 

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas used a round of interviews Friday morning to address comments his wife made in which she said that other Republicans were attacking him because of his faith. 
"We're being brutalized by our opponents in our own party," Mrs. Perry said Thursday in a speech interwoven with prayer and studded by tears at North Greenville University, a Southern Baptist college in Tigerville, S.C. "So much of that is, I think, they look at him because of his faith."
She also described a "rough month" during which the family had been "have been brutalized and beaten up and chewed up in the press."
Mr. Perry explained his wife's comments diplomatically, telling NBC's Matt Lauer, for example: "Family members always take these campaigns a little more personally than the candidates do."
At her appearance, recorded by NBC News, Mrs. Perry also said that she had had a "nagging, pulling at my heart" for Mr. Perry to run last November, shortly after he won a third term as governor. But Mr. Perry resisted.
"God was already speaking to me, but he didn't want to hear it," she said, adding, "He felt like he needed to see the burning bush. I said, 'Look, let me tell you something: You might not see that burning bush, but there are other people seeing that burning bush for you.'" 
On Friday, Mrs. Perry once again spoke of the trials of her family, this time saying in Spartanburg, S.C., that she could "empathize" with the plight of the unemployed because her son "lost his job because of this administration."
"He resigned his job two weeks ago because he can't go out and campaign with his father because of S.E.C. regulations," she said, according to a CNN report.
The Perry's son, Griffin, was reportedly working at Deutsche Bank before leaving to start an independent consulting firm that would let him focus more time on campaigning for his father.
On Thursday, Mrs. Perry told the audience that her son had enthusiastically volunteered to resign -- "I'll do what I need to do" -- when he heard his father was considering a presidential bid.

HEADLINE: In Private, Wall St. Bankers Dismiss Protesters as Unsophisticated

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Publicly, bankers say they understand the anger at Wall Street -- but believe they are misunderstood by the protesters camped on their doorstep.
But when they speak privately, it is often a different story.
''Most people view it as a ragtag group looking for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll,'' said one top hedge fund manager.
''It's not a middle-class uprising,'' adds another veteran bank executive. ''It's fringe groups. It's people who have the time to do this.''
As the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations have grown and spread to other cities, an open question is: Do the bankers get it? Their different worldview speaks volumes about the wide chasms that have opened over who is to blame for the continuing economic malaise and what is best for the country. 
Some on Wall Street viewed the protesters with disdain, and a degree of caution, as hundreds marched through the financial district on Friday. Others say they feel their pain, but are befuddled about what they are supposed to do to ease it. A few even feel personally attacked, and say the Occupy Wall Street protesters who have been in Zuccotti Park for weeks are just bitter about their own economic fate and looking for an easy target. If anything, they say, people should show some gratitude.
''Who do you think pays the taxes?'' said one longtime money manager. ''Financial services are one of the last things we do in this country and do it well. Let's embrace it. If you want to keep having jobs outsourced, keep attacking financial services. This is just disgruntled people.''
He added that he was disappointed that members of Congress from New York, especially Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, had not come out swinging for an industry that donates heavily to their campaigns. ''They need to understand who their constituency is,'' he said.
Generally, bankers dismiss the protesters as gullible and unsophisticated. Not many are willing to say this out loud, for fear of drawing public ire -- or the masses to their doorsteps. ''Anybody who dismisses them publicly is putting a bull's-eye on their back,'' the hedge fund manager said.
John Paulson, the hedge fund titan who made billions in the financial crisis by betting against the subprime mortgage market, has been the exception. His Upper East Side home was picketed by demonstrators earlier this week, but Mr. Paulson offered a full-throated defense of the Street, even going so far as to defend the tiny sliver of top earners attacked by the Occupy Wall Street protesters -- whose signs refer to themselves as ''the other 99 percent.''
''The top 1 percent of New Yorkers pay over 40 percent of all income taxes, providing huge benefits to everyone in our city and state,'' he said in a statement. ''Paulson & Company and its employees have paid hundreds of millions in New York City and New York State taxes in recent years and have created over 100 high-paying jobs in New York City since its formation.''
The messages coming from the protesters are by no means in accord. They have myriad grievances, though many see Wall Street as the most powerful symbol of the income inequality and ''economic injustice'' they are railing against. There is ample indignation over banks being bailed out while their customers are being foreclosed upon, and over banks handing out hefty bonus checks and severance packages so soon after the crisis erupted.
Similarly, executives keep getting generous payouts when they leave. Just last week, Bank of America disclosed it was paying a total of $11 million in severance to two executives forced out in a management reshuffle, Sallie Krawcheck and Joe Price, even as the company said it would begin laying off roughly 30,000 employees over the next few years.
''Wall Street continues to underestimate the degree of anger among citizens and voters,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a former investment banker who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. For the most part, bankers say that they see the protests as a reaction to the high unemployment and slow growth that has plagued the American economy since the recession and the financial crisis of 2008. Despite all the placards and chants plainly indicating otherwise, some bankers suggest that deep down, the protesters are not really all that mad at them.
''I don't think we see ourselves as the target,'' said Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents the nation's biggest banks and insurers in Washington. ''I think they're protesting about the economy. What's lost is that the financial services sector has to be well capitalized and well financed for the economy to recover.''
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Company, typifies the conflicting messages coming from Wall Street. In a conference call with reporters after third-quarter earnings were announced Thursday, he stuck a sympathetic note. ''I do vaguely remember the First Amendment that it is legal to demonstrate and it is completely fine,'' he said. ''You should listen and not just have a knee-jerk reaction.''
But in a later conference call with analysts, Mr. Dimon's remarks were more offhand when asked about the protests and the negative perception of his industry. ''Most of our clients like us,'' he said. Besides, changing the industry's image now is a tall order, he told the analysts, before adding, ''If you have any great ideas on the phone you guys can write them up and send them to me. We'll take them into consideration.'' Without a coherent message, the crowds will ultimately thin out, Wall Street types insist -- especially when the weather turns colder. They see the protesters as an entertaining sideshow, little more than flash mobs of slackers, seeking to lock arms with Kanye West or get a whiff of the antiestablishment politics that defined their parents' generation.
''There is a view that it will be a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,'' said one financial industry official.
Most bankers were far more concerned this week about the business impact of the new Volcker Rule restrictions on speculative trading than they were about the demonstrations, this official added.
A smaller group of bank executives are taking the protests more seriously. They see them as a sign of the growing economic divide in this country -- and are even monitoring the latest developments on Twitter. While peaceful so far, the demonstrations at Bank of America, Chase and Wells Fargo branches from San Francisco to Peoria are eerily similar to those routinely seen at Citibank outposts in Athens, Hong Kong, and in other overseas markets. Some believe it could be years before the swarms of protesters end their marches on bank branches.
A few outspoken members of the financial industry have broken ranks with their more skeptical brethren to say they understand a bit of the outrage of the Occupy Wall Street crowd.
''When I tell people I went down to research the protests, they're shocked, they literally laugh,'' said Michael Mayo, a veteran bank analyst at Credit Agricole Securities. ''It's just not a location they frequent.''
Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, even said he would be happy to talk with the protesters any time they wanted to drop by. Mr. Pandit, onstage Wednesday at a Fortune magazine conference, said that the protesters' ''sentiments were completely understandable.''
''I would also corroborate that trust has been broken between financial institutions and the citizens of the U.S., and that it's Wall Street's job to reach out to Main Street and rebuild that trust,'' Mr. Pandit said. The protesters should hold Citi and others ''accountable for practicing responsible finance,'' he said, ''and keep asking us about how we're doing.''

HEADLINE: A Month On $1,000

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Could you live on $1,000 a month? An online game called Spent lets you see what it's like to make the tough choices necessary to get by on that amount of income.
The interactive game was developed by a team at McKinney, a national advertising agency based in Durham, N.C., as a pro-bono effort to raise awareness of Urban Ministries, a local emergency services outfit seeing heavy demand in the tough economy.
Spent challenges users to experience what it is like -- and what tradeoffs must be made - to get by on $1,000 a month. The game debuted early this year and has been played more than 1.7 million times, says Janet Northern, director of communications for McKinney. But we here at Bucks somehow missed it, and we thought it was worthy of note because it's so compelling. Spent cleverly makes use of actual economic data and links to social media to get its point across. 
The game - it's more of an exercise, really -- first allows you to apply for different jobs at different rates of pay, like a waiter at a restaurant or a temporary typist. If you choose the temp job - which I did -- it has you take a typing test (which, to my dismay, I failed).
Next, it poses a series of choices and lists the accompanying cost for each one, plus its respective impact on your cash. If you're lucky enough to get a job as a waitress, for instance, ($2 and change an hour, plus tips), but drop a stack of plates and break them, do you fess up and pay for the damage or hide the evidence to avoid busting your budget?
Many people give up on the eighth or ninth day of choices, and are dismayed to find that the only way they can live on the allotted funds is to make decisions they wouldn't ordinarily make - like being dishonest, says Jenny Nicholson, a 33-year-old McKinney copywriter who came up with the initial idea for Spent.
Ms. Nicholson has built a successful career, but she said she brought to the effort her own personal experience as a child in a family that struggled with poverty. ''It's easy to think that it's something inherent in you that made you successful - that somehow, you made better decisions,'' she said. So the tool aims to show that for many people, given the current economy, there are often no good choices - just ones that are equally unpalatable and, sometimes, morally ambiguous.
One of the questions in the game involves whether to bring a sick pet to the vet. She recalls her family agonizing over whether to take an ill puppy for treatment. ''It's not that we loved him any less,'' she said. ''But we didn't even have enough money to take my mother to the dentist.''
This spring, Ms. Nicholson said she visited a private Durham elementary school to play Spent with a class of fourth graders. The students had a spirited debate over whether to pay $15 to send a child on a school field trip. When they finally decided that the money shouldn't be spent, they were pleased - until they learned that meant that the child had to spend the day in the school office, while the rest of the class went on the outing. ''They all gasped, 'Oh, no!''' Ms. Nicholson recalled.
Take a go at Spent, and let us know how you fare in the comments section.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Near Zuccotti Park, a Momentary Detente for 2 Representatives of Opposing Views

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Two men at Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan on Thursday could hardly have looked more different.
One, Edward T. Hall III, 25, was barefoot and dressed in loud, multicolored tights. He wore a beaded American Indian necklace and New Age jewelry, with a baseball cap pulled sideways over his long hair.
The other, Jimmy Vivona, 40, wore a smart blue pinstripe suit, a conservative red-and-blue striped tie and good shoes. He had neat hair and a close shave. He has caught glimpses of the protesters on walks during his lunch break. 
In a way, they could serve as shorthand for a divide that has been come into stark relief during the Occupy Wall Street protests in downtown Manhattan, which are now in their fourth week.
Mr. Hall is a well-educated young man with a privileged upbringing who said he was following a calling greater than getting a job and making money. He said he saw the protest as a global movement to help fight poverty and economic inequality. He has spent the past month sleeping in the park and is one of the organizers of the protest.
Mr. Vivona grew up in a working-class family on Staten Island and now lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, with his wife and two young children. He has been a stockbroker for 17 years, works ''13- or 14-hour days'' and has done well for himself on Wall Street.
''Not tens of millions of dollars, but I do O.K.'' was as specific as he would get.
City Room had arranged for the two to meet and to have a one-on-one discussion about the issues raised by the protesters. Trying to find someone to represent the views of the financial industry proved challenging, and several workers declined. Mr. Vivona, who was spotted outside Zuccotti Park, agreed.
At a nearby cafe, the men, an unlikely duo, sat across from each other. Mr. Vivona, who works in an office building two blocks from the park, had a Snapple. Mr. Hall - who, when told the meeting would be indoors, ended up covering his bare feet with a pair of women's rubber boots - went for a cappuccino.
The two men made cordial small talk at first. Mr. Hall said he played squash. Mr. Vivona said he played ice hockey. Then Mr. Hall began explaining some issues central to the protest, including concerns about a growing disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor in America.
Mr. Vivona reminded Mr. Hall that America was a democracy and that many of these issues should be resolved at the ballot box. He said that he respected the protesters' right to demonstrate and that this, in fact, was a testament to freedom of expression in America.
''We don't begrudge you the opportunity to protest,'' he said, adding that the right to free expression ''makes us the best country in the world.''
Mr. Hall agreed and said a goal of the protest was to help strengthen the United States by trying to address unemployment and lift wages for the working class that had been ''crushed by banks.''
Mr. Vivona said that he felt the protest was a bit unfocused in its message and that some of the signs made points that were ''all over the place.''
Mr. Hall acknowledged that ''a lot of our message is easily distorted, as well as very hard to handle,'' and that ''we've used, sort of, a sledgehammer'' when a tiny hammer would have sufficed.
Mr. Hall said that he grew up in New Mexico and that both his parents were politically active lawyers who were thrilled that he was pursuing a socially conscious life and was involved in the Occupy Wall Street protest. Mr. Hall said he attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and then transferred to Bard College in upstate New York because of its reputation as a socially conscious school.
He had been renting in Washington Heights for the past two years while attending doctoral classes at Columbia University as a nonmatriculated student. He said that he supported his modest lifestyle with savings from working as a teenager and that he also had ''a small trust fund'' from his grandfather that he had not drawn from yet. For the past four weeks, he has eaten free meals and has slept in the park.
Mr. Vivona, a freelance broker for Empire Asset Management, a brokerage firm of about 30 brokers, said his prosperity depended on the economy. At best, he might be able to retire at age 50, but with a tougher economy would have to work into his 60s.
Perhaps his main message to Mr. Hall was that many Wall Street finance workers were not ''fat cats,'' but rather hard-working people who had simply ''done well for themselves'' without becoming exorbitantly rich.
''They're guys like me, who work hard every day,'' he said. ''Every nickel I make, I work hard for.''
When Mr. Hall questioned why top executives made such big bonuses, Mr. Vivona countered with a sports analogy: of course Wayne Gretzky is going to earn much more than a much lesser hockey player.
When Mr. Hall mentioned capping high salaries, Mr. Vivona responded, ''But isn't that a brand of socialism in a way?''
The discussion between the two men occurred before news broke that the planned cleanup of Zuccotti Park on Friday morning had been called off.
Reached by phone, Mr. Vivona said he hoped that it was not a sign that the protesters would be staying much longer.
''I'd like to see things get back to some normalcy down here,'' he said.
That was much the same point he made to Mr. Hall on Thursday.
''At some point, you have to be satisfied with the message you came to convey,'' he said.
But Mr. Hall saw no immediate end to the protest, saying, ''We have to be patient with each other.''
After the conversation, the two men exchanged phone numbers. Mr. Vivona straightened his tie and went back to his brokerage firm. Mr. Hall kicked off the boots and cheerfully walked barefoot back to the park to continue strategizing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Smaller Markets and Smarter Thinking

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MAHLER

 BODY:
If you're interested in learning how agile, innovative thinking can triumph over deep pockets, go out and see ''Moneyball'' -- or just stay home and watch baseball's 2011 playoffs.
Of the four teams that are still alive -- the Detroit Tigers, the Texas Rangers, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers -- only the Tigers boast one of baseball's 10 largest payrolls, and even they barely make the cut, at No. 10.
This has made for a thrilling postseason. Fox may have groaned at the unexpected departure of the Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies (not to mention the Red Sox' September collapse), but a lot of baseball fans didn't. Thanks partly to the cultural phenomenon of ''Moneyball,'' which demonstrated that teams didn't need a big payroll to win, we're all small-market fans now, no longer rooting for the hapless underdog -- sorry, Mets and Cubs -- but for the team that is doing more with less. 
It's a subtle but significant distinction and it has unmistakable political overtones, especially during this time of rising class resentment. You didn't have to spend the day dancing around the drum circle in Zuccotti Park to see Game 5 of the Yankees-Tigers division series in New York -- with its constant cutaways to those slick-suited men hunched over their BlackBerrys in the Legends Suites -- as more than just a baseball game. (It may be time to update the old cliche that rooting for the Yankees is like rooting for U.S. Steel. Today, it's more like rooting for Goldman Sachs.)
Conspicuously absent from the postseason is the team run by the hero of ''Moneyball,'' Billy Beane. The Oakland Athletics finished the 2011 season 14 games under .500, making it the fifth consecutive year the team has failed to make the playoffs.
To hear Beane tell it, baseball's Moneyball era is over. In a profile in The New York Times Magazine last month, he basically blamed the A's recent history of mediocrity (or worse) on the fact that the rest of the league had stolen his playbook. The various competitive advantages that he was once able to exploit -- valuing, say, on-base percentage over batting average -- no longer exist.
Baseball is moving ''back to an efficient market,'' said Beane, sounding every bit like the in-demand corporate speaker that he has become. He went so far as to suggest that the game was starting to resemble European professional soccer, which is dominated by a handful of big-spending ''superfranchises.''
The problem with this narrative is that it isn't true. Baseball is more competitive than ever, and we have this year's postseason to prove it.
Behind each of the surviving teams is a story of shrewd management that flies directly in the face of Beane's self-serving assessment of the state of the game, starting with the Cardinals, who have essentially turned into the perennial contender that Beane's A's were supposed to be. This year they made the playoffs against all odds, after losing their ace, Adam Wainwright, in spring training and then falling 10 1/2 games behind the Atlanta Braves in the wild-card race with just over a month to play.
A lot has been made of the Cardinals' pluck and resilience. But what has kept them on the field into mid-October isn't character or, for that matter, a carefully crafted long-term plan. It was a few risky yet ultimately vindicated moves, like asking an aging Lance Berkman, who hadn't been an everyday outfielder since 2004, to man right field.
Above all, it was an almost irrational unwillingness to give up on what looked like a lost season, which yielded a flurry of quick fixes (and quick fixes of those quick fixes) as well as a trade-deadline Hail Mary -- the swapping of a budding star, Colby Rasmus, for some badly needed pitching depth -- that seemed crazy until they worked.
The Brewers have baseball's 17th-largest payroll and the sort of homegrown lineup -- Ryan Braun, Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks -- that is not supposed to exist in the game's modern era.
But they wouldn't be playing for their first World Series berth since Ronald Reagan was president if their general manager, Doug Melvin, hadn't traded away several other products of the club's killer farm system for a pair of starting pitchers, Zack Greinke and Shaun Marcum. He was widely second-guessed at the time, but it's hard to do so now.
Then there are the Tigers, run by Dave Dombrowski, the architect of the 1997 Florida Marlins, one of the youngest expansion teams to win a World Series. After a disappointing 2010, Dombrowski made what was probably the best free-agent signing of the off-season (Victor Martinez), then plugged the remaining leaks, adding a starting pitcher (Doug Fister) and a third baseman (Wilson Betemit) in late July.
With Justin Verlander, a former first-round draft pick who hasn't always looked as if he would live up to his enormous potential, that has been more than enough.
But the best evidence that Beane is wrong, that money isn't all that matters, is the Texas Rangers. Remember Tom Hicks, the financial whiz who signed Alex Rodriguez to a 10-year contract worth at least $50 million more than the next-highest bidder, then surrounded him with free-agent sluggers at the end of steroid-inflated careers?
Hicks failed to buy a World Series, but he nearly went broke trying. Guess what happened when he started belatedly slashing expenses in a vain attempt to prevent the team from going under? Jon Daniels, who was 28 when he became the Rangers' general manager, had the chance to take a different, more cost-effective approach . He restocked the team's depleted farm system, refocused on pitching and made a few big trades that created the nucleus of the team that is now on the brink of its second straight World Series appearance.
Baseball, ''Moneyball'' teaches us, is an inherently unfair game. It's undeniably true that big-market teams are at an advantage. They have the resources to reload every winter and take a fresh shot at the pennant, while clubs like the Brewers have to play a different game, biding their time and seizing their win-now moment before they can no longer afford to keep players they've spent years cultivating.
But there's a reason general managers like Theo Epstein are now courted as aggressively as the players themselves: Building a baseball club is an enormously complicated business. Unlike G.M.'s in the N.B.A. and N.F.L., you're not plucking pro-ready players. You're identifying and developing raw prospects, and mixing and matching them via trades and free agency, all the while knowing that every player you let go is a potential star and every one you sign a possible bust. Being a big-market team is no guarantee of success, just as being a small-market one is no guarantee of failure.
Which brings us back to Beane's A's, who may actually have a more relevant lesson to teach us about baseball's -- and America's -- economy than that David can defeat Goliath.
In a fascinating essay posted last week on the Baseball Prospectus Web site, the writer Kevin Baker traces the 100-year downward trajectory of the A's franchise. It's the story of greedy, inept management making one bad decision after another to move the club to ever-smaller, poorer markets -- the A's, recall, went from Philadelphia to Kansas City before landing in Oakland -- all the while soaking up de facto subsidies that they didn't reinvest in the team.
The A's are trying to relocate to San Jose, which is bigger and richer than Oakland. This would presumably improve their financial prospects. But baseball's governing body is sitting on their request, apparently in deference to the more politically powerful San Francisco Giants, who don't want to lose their monopoly on the Bay Area's wealthiest ZIP codes.
Who suffers? The fans, of course, who are left to watch a second-rate team play uninspiring baseball in a decaying, outdated ballpark. If Beane is looking for a new baseball story to tell his corporate clients that illuminates the state of American capitalism, this could be a good place to start.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Sports of The Times column on Saturday, about the success of smaller market teams in this year's baseball playoffs, erroneously attributed a distinction to the 1997 Florida Marlins. It was the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks -- not the Marlins -- who were the youngest expansion team to win the World Series. (The Diamondbacks won in their fourth year of existence; the Marlins in their fifth.)

HEADLINE: G-20 Aims to Quarantine Euro Zone Crisis

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- Even as officials of the Group of 20 industrialized nations were gathering here on Friday to flesh out a solution to the European debt crisis, a new challenge confronted them, when ratings agencies warned that globally interconnected banks in France and elsewhere faced rising risks.
After offering piecemeal solutions for more than a year, the G-20 finance ministers are seeking a broader plan to prevent the crisis from engulfing big countries like Italy or Spain, whose sovereign credit rating was cut anew on Thursday, a move that may deepen the impact of the debt crisis on European banks. 
The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, who is attending the meetings, has said a solution is needed to prevent Europe's troubles from infecting the rest of the world. Francois Baroin, the French finance minister, said after talks on Friday that officials had ''already come to some agreements that will be very important,'' but he did not elaborate.
The weekend discussions are a precursor to a summit meeting of European leaders planned for Oct. 23 in Brussels.
Officials want to strike a deal soon to increase the size of a bailout fund for troubled countries and banks across the Continent, known as the European Financial Stability Facility. They also want to force Europe's banks to raise more capital and to require private investors to take larger-than-anticipated losses on their holdings of Greek government bonds to avoid running up the bill to taxpayers.
Financial markets seemed to believe that the Europeans were getting serious about a solution: stock markets have risen recently on hopes for a deal, especially after Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, pledged last weekend to deliver a plan. Major European stock indexes and Wall Street all rose this week.
But investors reading between the lines see further complications, especially for Europe's banks.
On Friday, Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit rating of the biggest French bank, BNP Paribas, citing its ''material'' exposure to Italy, which faces problems similar to Greece's, but on a much larger scale.
Also Friday, the Fitch ratings agency said it would review various ratings for Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse and Barclays, citing ''increased challenges the financial markets are facing'' as a result of economic developments and regulatory changes.
That followed the announcement by S.& P. that it was downgrading Spain's sovereign rating again, to AA- from AA, amid signs that harsh austerity measures may tip the country into a recession. The decision is ill timed for the many European banks that together hold about $637 billion worth of Spanish government debt.
The banking industry has been girding for battle with European policy makers and regulators in the coming days, especially over a plan that would force the banks to take losses on their holdings of Greek debt of up to 60 percent -- much more than a 21 percent loss agreed to under an accord reached by European leaders in July as part of a second Greek bailout.
Several of Europe's biggest banks, including BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, have said they are ready to take losses of around 50 percent. But most banks that hold Greek debt would have to sign off on a new deal, and an agreement is not certain.
Bankers are particularly angered by two additional proposals from the European Banking Authority, which has come under fire for overseeing flimsy tests on the safety margins of Europe's banks.
One would require lenders to raise their capital buffers to around 9 percent, from 6 percent now, or be forced into the undesirable position of taking money from their governments. Another would require lenders to value all their sovereign debt holdings at current market prices, as part of a ''stress test'' to ensure that Europe's banks have enough capital to insure against large-scale losses if the crisis were to spread.
Goldman Sachs on Friday said at least 50 of the 91 European banks tested previously by the banking authority were likely to fail the revised stress tests, and would need to raise as much as 298 billion euros if the capital requirement were raised to as high as 9 percent.
While European banks hold about $128 billion in Greek sovereign debt, that is dwarfed by the whopping $819 billion they hold in Italian debt, according to the most recent data from the Bank for International Settlements, published in March. All told, European banks hold $2.165 trillion worth of sovereign debt from Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Banks say that new capital requirements will force them to curb lending to consumers and businesses, hurting economic growth. But some are already selling assets and businesses to raise money to meet them.
Charles H. Dallara, the managing director of the Institute for International Finance, a powerful lobbying group of the world's biggest financial firms, said the banking authority's plan also would create an uneven playing field globally for European banks.
Requiring banks to value their Italian and other sovereign debt holdings at current prices, known as marking the assets to market, would also create ''serious risks,'' Mr. Dallara said in an interview. The plan would ''put further pressure on the debt markets of those countries, and potentially eat up any new capital which may be raised by those banks or injected by governments.''
The risk, he added, is that a ''vicious circle is created where capital goes through the front door and comes out the back door, as the value of sovereign debt remaining on banks' balance sheets declines.''
In a sign of nervousness about the rising costs of the crisis, the difference between the interest rate that France pays to borrow in international markets, compared with that paid by Germany, rose on Friday to the highest level since the euro currency was created in 1999. France, which is leading the euro zone rescue talks together with Germany, is particularly wary of feeding money into major French banks because President Sarkozy does not want to risk damaging France's AAA credit rating, which came under scrutiny after S.& P. downgraded the United States in August.
If France were to pump too much money into its banks, that would jeopardize its efforts to reduce the deficit and debt level, putting the rating at risk.
Should that happen and France get sucked into Europe's debt crisis, that would threaten one of the two main pillars -- along with Germany -- supporting the euro, taking the crisis to a new level.

HEADLINE: A Golden Touch Turns Leaden

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
No wonder Occupy Wall Street took its protest this week to East 86th Street and the 28,500-square-foot limestone mansion owned by the billionaire hedge fund manager John A. Paulson. What better symbol of the excesses of Wall Street than Mr. Paulson, who made billions betting on the real estate collapse and whose opulent surroundings stand in such contrast to the million of Americans who have lost their homes?
Mr. Paulson made more than $15 billion for his hedge funds by betting on the collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market in 2007 and 2008, then followed up with an equally well-timed bet that large banks would survive the financial crisis and that the price of gold would soar. Last year he personally earned what has been estimated as the largest single payday in Wall Street history: $4.9 billion. 
The media branded him the man with the Midas touch. Institutional and individual investors rushed to give him their money, eagerly paying management fees of 2 percent plus 20 percent of any gains, and pushed his funds' assets earlier this year to $38 billion. In September, Forbes ranked him 17th on its list of the 400 richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of $15.5 billion. The man-who-could-do-no-wrong embarked on 2011 with confident predictions that a global economic recovery would strengthen, inflationary pressures would push gold to new highs and financial institutions would prosper.
This week Mr. Paulson reported his results through the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30. His flagship Advantage Plus and Advantage funds were down 47 percent and 32 percent. His Recovery Fund was down 31 percent. His once high-flying gold fund lost 16 percent in September, cutting its gains this year to just 1 percent. HSBC ranked Mr. Paulson's Advantage Plus fund the fourth-worst-performing hedge fund in its entire universe, and that was before it recorded September's dismal results.
It's hard to feel all that bad for Mr. Paulson. For one thing, he remains fabulously wealthy despite his recent setbacks, and his management fees alone -- 2 percent of roughly $30 billion-- which depend only on the amount under management, and not performance, would amount to $600 million. His ability to stand back from the real estate mania and recognize it for the bubble it was offered the trade of a lifetime, one that few others had the courage or conviction to embrace.
At the same time, Mr. Paulson has suffered the fate of most short-sellers, investors who typically make bets on the misfortunes of others. Markets arguably need such speculators to provide liquidity and price discovery. But to many if not most people, there's something distasteful, even offensive, about profiting from the suffering of others, especially so for the protesters occupying Zuccotti Park.
It's not as if Mr. Paulson gained his wealth by creating new technology that transformed lives, like Steve Jobs (net worth $7 billion, according to Forbes) or Mark Zuckerberg ($17.5 billion), or by entertaining people (Oprah Winfrey, $2.7 billion) or clothing them (Ralph Lauren, $6.1 billion). No one's protesting against them.
Even among billionaire hedge fund managers, Mr. Paulson is distinctive, and not only because he appears to be the richest. He was the only one of them targeted by the protesters on their march through the Upper East Side, and he displayed a tin ear when he lectured them (in a news release) about how much he pays in taxes, adding: ''Instead of vilifying our most successful businesses, we should be supporting them and encouraging them to remain in New York City and continue to grow.''
More fundamentally, allegations made last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its civil fraud suit against Goldman Sachs & Company, which Goldman settled by paying a record $550 million, made clear that Mr. Paulson didn't earn his billions purely because of his shrewd market insights. He helped select the mortgages he was betting against, the ones most likely to default, something Goldman failed to tell the party on the other side of the bet. This wasn't a level playing field, which contributed to the protesters' allegations that Wall Street is a game rigged to benefit the wealthy and powerful.
That isn't to say Mr. Paulson did anything illegal. He wasn't charged by the S.E.C. or accused of any wrongdoing, and it's hard to fault him for taking advantage of a perk Goldman offered him. Others did it too; JPMorgan Chase recently settled similar charges, suggesting the practice was widespread. But Mr. Paulson's was the first and most visible case, and fairly or not, it indelibly linked his name to what the S.E.C. labeled fraud. (Through a spokesman, Mr. Paulson declined comment on all aspects of this column.)
Mr. Paulson's recent performance has already cost him his Midas reputation, and investors are questioning his strategy. ''I can't say I expected this, but it doesn't surprise me,'' said one hedge fund adviser who, like the others I spoke to, didn't want to be identified. ''The way he runs a portfolio is going to come with volatility.''
Several advisers noted that Mr. Paulson had been in business for many years before emerging as a star, both on his own and at another firm, and while his returns were respectable, no one claimed he was a genius. A review of his S.E.C. disclosures this year suggests that much of his losses have come not only from being wrong about broad issues, like the direction of the stock market or global economy, but from bad judgments about individual stocks. Mr. Paulson stayed bullish on Bank of America and Wells Fargo long after other investors fled, though he reduced his positions somewhat. Another singularly ill-timed position was his 23.5 million shares in Hewlett-Packard as of June 30. H.P. shares have since been rocked by management turmoil and strategic miscalculations. A Chinese timber company in his portfolio was accused of fraudulent accounting. Shares in gold producers and a gold exchange-traded fund, one of Mr. Paulson's largest holdings, whose gains had helped mitigate his losses earlier this year, plunged in September.
Investors in Mr. Paulson's funds now face the unpleasant task of deciding what to do now that their funds have lost, in some cases, nearly half their value. Some benefited from his spectacular returns during the financial crisis, but many others, like the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico, invested only within the last year.
Nothing short of a spectacular rebound can redeem Mr. Paulson's performance this year. In a conference call with investors this week, he conceded that ''we made a mistake'' about the direction of the United States economy and said he would be reducing leverage and risk in his most aggressive fund. But investors said he largely stood by his previous predictions.
I've been speaking periodically with Joelle Mevi, chief investment officer for New Mexico PERA (as the pension fund is known), who manages more than $12 billion in assets and had $24.6 million invested in Mr. Paulson's Advantage Fund as of mid-August. Back then, she said the hedge fund portfolio over all had been performing as anticipated, and as for Mr. Paulson, ''We have to expect volatility.''
By September, with the Advantage Fund down about 23 percent for the year, she said, ''I'm more concerned about the underperformance and especially our losses from inception to date. Granted, these are hedge funds, and we're in for the long term. But it's very hard to overcome those performance numbers. I'm sure the board will recognize that it's a very large loss on a single investment.''
This week, with the Advantage Fund down another 9 percent, Ms. Mevi said the board would vote by the end of the month whether to liquidate its Paulson position. Like other Advantage investors, PERA faces an Oct. 31 deadline if it wants to withdraw funds on Dec. 31. ''We'll be taking a close, hard look this month,'' Ms. Mevi said. ''I've asked our consultants to monitor this very closely, and we remain very concerned.'' She reiterated that PERA was a long-term investor, adding ''that doesn't mean some managers won't have to be replaced.''
Mr. Paulson has assured investors he will have no trouble meeting withdrawal requests, and so far they have been modest. Many longtime investors appear to be standing by him. But the next weeks will be critical, as others like the New Mexico board make their decisions. In the meantime, many investors are steering clear of stocks in Mr. Paulson's portfolios out of concern he will be forced to sell by the end of the year, further driving down prices.
More broadly, Mr. Paulson's recent performance raises questions about the high fee structure charged by hedge funds, the seemingly indiscriminate rush to invest in them and the ability of anyone -- even so celebrated a trader as Mr. Paulson -- to consistently beat broad market averages.
What's surprising isn't that Mr. Paulson's returns have crashed to earth, or even that his reasoning this year has so far proved so spectacularly and consistently wrong. It's that in lionizing Mr. Paulson and handing their money over to him, so many people succumbed to the enduring myth of the financial genius, ignoring the boilerplate that appears on every prospectus: ''Past results are no guarantee of future returns.''

He added: ''I can further suppose that a Child of average Wit or even moderate Dullness -- a boy of Nine, let us say, who can be coaxed away from the Wii of a Christmas afternoon -- might pass a pleasant interval chuckling at the absurd incongruities that arise when something very large is placed beside something very small.''

HEADLINE: Tackling High Infant Mortality Rates Among Blacks

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- Amanda Ralph is the kind of woman whose babies are prone to die. She is young and poor and dropped out of school after the ninth grade.
But there is also an undeniable link between Ms. Ralph's race -- she is black -- and whether her baby will survive: nationally, black babies are more than twice as likely as white babies to die before the age of 1. Here in Pittsburgh, the rate is five times.
So, seven months into her first pregnancy, Ms. Ralph, 20, is lying on a couch at home as a nurse from a federally financed program listens to the heartbeat of her fetus.
The unusual attention Ms. Ralph is receiving is one of myriad efforts being made nationwide to reduce the tens of thousands of deaths each year of infants before age 1. But health officials say it is frequently disheartening work, as a combination of apathy and cuts to federal and state programs aimed at reducing infant deaths have hampered progress, with dozens of big cities and rural areas reporting rising rates. 
The private nature of infant mortality has made it a quiet crisis, lacking the public discussion or high-profile campaigns that accompany cancer, autism or postpartum depression.
The infant mortality rate in the United States has long been near the bottom of the world's industrialized countries. The nation's current mark -- 6.7 deaths per 1,000 live births -- places it 46th in the world, according to a ranking by the Central Intelligence Agency.
African-Americans fare far worse: Their rate of 13.3 deaths per 1,000 is almost double the national average and higher than Sri Lanka's.
Precisely why the black infant mortality rate is so high is a mystery that has eluded researchers even as the racial disparity continues to grow in cities like Pittsburgh, Los Angeles and Boston.
In Pittsburgh, where the unemployment rate is well below the national average, the infant mortality rate for black residents of Allegheny County was 20.7 in 2009, a slight decrease from 21 in 2000 but still worse than the rates in China or Mexico. In the same period the rate among whites in the county decreased to 4 from 5.6 -- well below the national average, according to state statistics. Figures for the past two years, which are not yet available, have most likely increased the gap significantly, county health officials said.
While Pittsburgh's struggles are illustrative of problems in other cities, it also faces its own particular issues, including the county's privatization of many of its health care services over the years.
With the county taking a reduced role, Healthy Start, a federally financed national nonprofit group, is now responsible for Pittsburgh's most vulnerable pregnant women. None of its $2.35 million budget, much of which is used for 6,000 annual home visits, comes from the county. The group's budget has not increased since 1997.
Even with its high-risk clients, Healthy Start has had success: in 2007 there were no child deaths among its participants countywide. The numbers though, have begun to creep up, and in 2010 the mortality rate among participants was 13.9.
''As a city you want to be known for your football and baseball teams, but you don't want to be known as a place where babies die,'' said Cheryl Squire Flint, who leads the group's Pittsburgh branch.
That, however, is precisely what is happening.
''We have one of the top schools of public health and one of the top schools of medicine, yet the problem is hidden,'' said Angela F. Ford, executive director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Minority Health, which works to address health disparities.
Recent studies have shown that poverty, education, access to prenatal care, smoking and even low birth weight do not alone explain the racial gap in infant mortality, and that even black women with graduate degrees are more likely to lose a child in its first year than are white women who did not finish high school. Research is now focusing on stress as a factor and whether black women have shorter birth canals.
''It is truly one of the most challenging issues, because it is multifactorial,'' said Dr. Garth Graham, a deputy assistant secretary in the Office of Minority Health at the Department of Health and Human Services. ''And nationally, the disparity has remained despite our best efforts.''
Dr. Bruce W. Dixon, Allegheny County's health commissioner for the last 19 years, said the primary cause for the growing disparity is an inequity in health care access.
''It's not medical care, it's social issues,'' he said.
Dr. Dixon, who is white, has supported shifting much of the county's previous health care burden to private providers like Healthy Start because he believes they are able to deliver medical services more effectively and at lower cost. He said his department's mainly white, middle-age bureaucrats had failed to adequately reduce mortality rates, which he blamed on their inability to communicate effectively. Black residents, however, say the disparity is not perceived as a problem because it is limited to a marginalized group.
''It wasn't affecting whites, so no one really cared because they didn't know about it,'' said Wilford Payne, who operates 11 community health centers in Pittsburgh.
Some here say black women are reluctant to seek prenatal care because they fear they will be mistreated.
''People who need the services are the ones least likely to get them,'' said Dannai Harriel, 34, who was a Healthy Start client when she became pregnant at 17, and later worked for the organization.
Ms. Ralph, who expects to deliver a healthy baby girl around Christmas, said when she first found out she was pregnant she hid her face under a blanket and lay motionless on her living room floor.
But after meeting with Healthy Start nurses and outreach workers, who provide as much psychological support as health care, Ms. Ralph said, she became excited about having a child.
Her living room floor is now full of little pink boxes and brightly colored bags filled with lotions and candles -- party favors she bought for guests to her forthcoming baby shower. Among the guests will be her obstetrician. While Ms. Ralph is doing well, Healthy Start workers still have concerns. Because she drinks too much soda and does not appear to be eating nutritious foods, Ms. Ralph has gained 50 pounds during her pregnancy and now weighs 181. She has been told that overweight women have a higher risk of complications during pregnancy.
But Ms. Ralph has few healthy food options. The nearest grocery store is a 15-minute walk from the home she shares with her mother. Local shops sell little more than soda, chips and candy. Ms. Ralph, who said she was eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, acknowledges a taste for tacos and comfort foods.
''I can't help it,'' she said. ''I love my mama's cooking.''
At the end of a 45-minute visit with Dradia Toblin, her caseworker, and Clara Brown, a registered nurse, she was told that her baby -- whom she has decided to name Kaylah -- is now able to open her eyes and practice her breathing.
''You are doing a good job,'' Ms. Brown tells her. ''You are growing a good baby.''
Others, however, may not be so fortunate, and without focused attention, infant deaths in the county -- now more than 100 each year -- may continue to rise, advocates say.
''We're not looking and thinking long-term,'' said Carmen Anderson, who previously led Healthy Start and is now a senior officer with the Heinz Endowments of Pittsburgh. ''We are in day-to-day crisis mode. Sometimes those who scream the loudest get the attention. And there's no screaming.''

HEADLINE: Gas Boom Aids Pennsylvania, But Some Worry Over the Risk

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
MONTROSE, Pa. -- In the economic downturn three years ago, Adam Diaz idled the trucks at his bluestone quarry and silenced the saws at his lumber mill.
Fortunately for him, the gas companies arrived at about the same time, and Mr. Diaz saw an opportunity.
He started hauling their waste. He parlayed 1 truck into 8 and now has a fleet of 53. Then he revived a weedy rail spur and now leases 210 rail cars to haul more waste containers. His work force grew to 180 from 30 as he created a business that now has revenues of $45 million a year.
Other residents also began taking advantage of the ''gas rush.'' Some supplied the companies with machine parts; others laid pipe. One entrepreneurial couple opened a food wagon where they also sell alpaca socks to drillers from Louisiana and Texas who were unprepared for the cold.
The gas boom is transforming small towns like this one (population 4,400 and growing) and revitalizing the economy of this once-forgotten stretch of rural northeastern Pennsylvania. The few hotels here have expanded, restaurants are packed and housing rentals have more than doubled. 
''There's been a snowball effect due to the gas companies coming in,'' Mr. Diaz, 33, said recently at his bustling empire near here.
But the boom -- brought on by an advanced drilling technique called hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking -- has brought problems too. While the gas companies have created numerous high-paying drilling jobs, many residents lack the skills for them. Some people's drinking water has been contaminated. Narrow country roads are crumbling under the weight of heavy trucks. With housing scarce and expensive, more residents are becoming homeless. Local services and infrastructure are strained.
''Very little tax revenue goes to local governments to help them share in the benefits of the economic development,'' said Sharon Ward, executive director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, an independent policy research organization.
And some are asking whether short-term gains have obscured the long-term view of an industry marked by boom-bust cycles.
''What happens in the long run is the critical question,'' said Kathy Braiser, associate professor of rural sociology at Penn State. ''How can communities take advantage of the benefits and try to mitigate the negative issues so that they are well-positioned for when this does tail off?''
The boom has been driven by extensive gas reserves in the Marcellus Shale, the vast rock formation under several Middle Atlantic states and concentrated in Pennsylvania. Industry-backed research says that a typical Marcellus well can generate millions of dollars in economic benefits, including wages, taxes and stimulation through the supply chain. (Critics say the amount is exaggerated.)
In Pennsylvania, more than 3,000 wells have been drilled in the past three years and permits for thousands more have been issued. Here in Susquehanna County, a poor rural county of which Montrose is the seat, 262 wells had been drilled by a half-dozen different gas companies as of the end of July; permits have been issued for 400 more.
At this time of year, the roller-coaster hills are blanketed in the oranges of fall. Dotted among them are industrial well sites, typically three to five acres, where drills crank and groan around the clock, glowing at night like spaceship colonies.
For Mr. Diaz and a charmed circle of local winners -- water haulers and motel operators, pipeline workers and waitresses, lawyers, surveyors and launderers -- the drilling has fueled an economic turnabout.
John and Phyllis DiGiori, who own an alpaca farm, started a food concession truck along the main road. Along with burgers and fries, they now offer warm clothing to workers from Texas and Louisiana. ''Ask us about our alpaca socks and more,'' says a handwritten sign taped to the service window.
Dan and Gretchen Backer, who oversee 40 rooms in hotels and apartments, including the Inn at Montrose, responded to the boom by renovating their rooms and adding amenities like flat-screen TVs. Now, Ms. Backer said, they have doubled their rates, to $2,500 a month, for a two-bedroom rental.
Bill Kelley Sr., and his son, Bill Jr., have expanded their equipment-rental business, Taylor Rental, and now sell hard-to-find items to the gas companies. The senior Mr. Kelley said it has grown 40 percent in each of the last three years. His wife runs her own bustling business, PJ's Cafe, a smoky roadhouse where off-shift gas workers congregate.
''We're not in the recession that the rest of the world is in,'' Mr. Kelley said.
Indeed, unemployment in the county was 7.5 percent in August, below the state average of 8.5 percent, and below the national figure of 9.1 percent. Mr. Kelley Sr. likes to repeat a piece of wisdom handed down from the forty-niners: it was not the gold miners in California who got rich, it was the people who sold the shovels.
George Stark, a spokesman for the Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation, the dominant gas company here, said that local entrepreneurs like Mr. Diaz and the Kelleys had created more than 400 industry-related jobs. He said Cabot directly employed about 100 skilled workers on the rigs, but over time local residents would be trained for those jobs.
The company expects to be drilling here for at least two decades, he said, and the wells will be producing gas for three decades after that. ''This isn't a bust-type situation,'' he said. ''This is probably the sweetest spot in the Marcellus play.''
But the gas influx has put a strain on local services. Cabot recently gave $50,000 to the local Red Cross and has helped a fund-raising drive to build a local hospital. Cabot also spent $12 million last year on road repairs here.
''That is a heck of a lot of money for a county like Susquehanna,'' said MaryAnn Warren, a county commissioner. ''But Susquehanna is poor, and it doesn't matter how much gas there is.''
The companies pay certain taxes, but only to the state, not to the counties. And they do not pay any local property tax. Various proposals, including one offered earlier this month by Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, would allow counties to impose a tax on the wells and keep most of the money, but there is no agreement on an approach. Pennsylvania is the only major gas-producing state that does not tax gas extraction directly.
Fully half of the work force in Susquehanna County is employed outside its borders, said Timothy W. Kelsey, a professor of agricultural economics at Penn State. He said that was an unusually high percentage, but the county simply did not have enough employers to keep the work force here.
''The folks who have connections are able to get the dollars and they're doing very, very well,'' Professor Kelsey said. ''But the majority of spending associated with natural gas isn't being done in the county.''
There are other strains, some between neighbors, especially those who signed early leases with gas companies that yielded them only $25 an acre while others waited and got more than $5,000 an acre.
And some of it is between local residents and out-of-state workers. ''We come up here, the housing is expensive and they raise the rates on us,'' grumbled one worker from Louisiana who did not want his name used because of the level of local hostility.
Dee Stephens, 47, a former schoolteacher from Missouri, and one of the rare women who work on the wells, said she did not feel welcomed here.
''Everyone feels threatened,'' she said of local residents. ''We're doing a job, but they think we're tearing up the land.'' She said that was not the case. ''Obviously we won't put it back as perfectly as Mother Nature made it, but we're doing the best we can.''
The successful entrepreneurs are highly conscious of the fragility of the new economy and some are hedging their bets.
''At some point they will finish and go away,'' said Ms. Backer, owner of the Inn at Montrose, said of the gas companies.
''We're taking their advice and trying to pay off our liquid debt that we've gotten into,'' she said. ''But we still get our water tested. We're all concerned about whether the companies are drilling safely and that our watersheds are safe. We're not putting our heads in the sand.''

HEADLINE: The U.S.-South Korea Trade Deal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Textile Makers Struggle to Be Heard on South Korea Free Trade Pact'' (Business Day, Oct. 12): 
The United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which Congress passed on Wednesday, poses no threat to American textile companies. South Korea is not a significant source of cheap textiles, and the agreement won't make it one.
Over the last decade, Korea's textile and apparel exports to the United States decreased by 72 percent, while those imports from the United States increased by 42 percent.
Korea is the 10th largest market for American-made textile products. The agreement will further open that market. Without it, American textile companies would lose market share to foreign competitors like the European Union that are racing ahead with their own trade agreements.
Through free trade, the textile industries of both countries can prosper. President Lee Myung-bak highlights this message of co-prosperity during his state visit to Washington this week.

HEADLINE: Vote on Ford Contract Leaning Into 'Yes' Territory, So Far

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The ratification outlook for a proposed four-year labor agreement between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union improved on Friday, but opposition at several large plants that have yet to finish voting could still be enough to sink the deal.
As of late Friday morning, the contract was supported by 50.8 percent of voters so far, the union said on a Facebook page dedicated to its negotiations with Ford. It said 6,271 ''yes'' votes had been counted, compared with 6,085 ''no'' votes. 
Until then, the ''no'' votes had been leading after workers at three large plants -- one in Wayne, Mich., and two in Chicago -- rejected the deal, largely over complaints that most workers would not receive wage increases. The swing into positive territory happened when 79 percent of workers at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich., voted in favor of the contract, according to the Web site of Local 3000 there; that is the largest margin of approval reported publicly so far.
The Flat Rock plant, which makes the Ford Mustang and a Mazda sedan as part of a joint venture, is in line to begin building the Ford Fusion midsize sedan if the contract passes, saving it from layoffs or possible closing after Mazda ends production there next year.
Voting is scheduled to finish Tuesday. The outcome largely hinges on how many of the more than 10,000 workers at U.A.W. locals in Dearborn, Mich., and Louisville, Ky., support the contract in the coming days.
If the deal fails, negotiators could return to the bargaining table under an indefinite extension of the old contract, the union could call a strike, or Ford could lock out the workers.
Union leaders across the country have begun assembling strike committees and distributing information about strike pay and procedures. At the same time, many have stepped up efforts to win support for the deal, warning workers that rejecting the agreement could result in a worse outcome.
''With the way the economy is and the way labor's been under attack, I think to vote it down expecting to get more I don't think that's realistic,'' said Keith Brown, the president of Local 245 in Dearborn, Mich.
In 2009, Ford workers turned down concessions that the company sought to the four-year contract it signed in 2007. Mr. Brown said he hoped that workers would realize that turning down an entirely new contract could have more negative consequences than voting against modifications to an existing contract.
Ford is the only American auto company that the U.A.W. can strike against during this round of contract talks, but both the company and the union have said they wanted to maintain a civil relationship.
If the Ford contract passes, workers would get bonuses of $6,000, or $5,000 if they were hired less than a year ago. They also would receive a $3,752 advance on next year's profit-sharing checks in November and $1,500 annually from 2012 through 2015.
The total of the bonuses is at least 50 percent more than G.M. and Chrysler agreed to pay their workers. G.M. workers have already ratified their new contract, and voting at Chrysler, which reached a tentative deal Wednesday, is to begin soon.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In a Volatile Market, Some Turn to Insurance Instead of Bonds

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
LIFE insurance, it's fair to say, is a subject that provokes strong opinions. People who like insurance see it as a way to leave money to heirs tax-free or to make sure there is money for a rainy day. Those who don't like it see a product that generates huge fees for the seller and a diminishing benefit for buyers who probably don't understand it.
But given the low interest rates on government bonds, some financial advisers have begun encouraging clients to buy permanent life insurance -- permanent because it does not lapse, like term insurance, after a set time -- as a substitute for bonds in their portfolio.
Their argument is threefold: the rate of return on permanent life insurance is 3 to 5 percent, the money in a policy ultimately passes to beneficiaries free of income tax, and owners can borrow against the policy without incurring any taxes. If they do not repay the loan, it will simply be deducted from the death benefit. 
But there are plenty of advisers who point to the layers of fees in any insurance policy -- for the management of the underlying investments, for expenses and for the cost of covering the risk of people dying without making all their premium payments. The advisers also say that insurance policies limit the gains that someone gets on the money invested and that the gains go down the longer you live.
But given the continued volatility in the stock market and low yields on United States Treasury bonds for the foreseeable future, there has been an increase in interest in insurance policies for their steady, if low, returns.
Is this a good thing? It depends whom you ask. ''As far as saying your bonds aren't performing well right now, let's put them all in the insurance policy, I don't agree with that,'' said Larry Rosenthal, president of Financial Planning Services, a wealth management firm in McLean, Va. ''But I understand it from the perspective of accumulation, death benefits and tax deferrals.''
Bob Plybon, chief executive of Plybon & Associates, an insurance agency and wealth adviser in Greensboro, N.C., took the other side. ''I think where we are from an economic standpoint it makes tremendous sense to look at it as an asset class,'' he said. ''Right now, you have the ability to generate yields that are competitive with other investments.''
Surprisingly, some people in the insurance industry are cautious about treating life insurance as an asset class. ''I believe insurance should be used as insurance,'' said Ron Herrmann, senior vice president of sales and distribution at the Hartford. ''Taking money out of the life insurance has ramifications to the life insurance itself.''
So what do you need consider if your adviser suggests you think about putting money into a permanent life insurance as an investment?
WHEN IT WORKS People who want to use permanent life insurance policies to build wealth do so by paying more than the premium, a practice known as overfunding. This can mean anything from increasing annual payments to making a lump sum payment.
''Overfunding could be a good use because it enables you to get a longer-term return,'' Mr. Herrmann said. ''If someone was doing this to take money out in one year, it's probably not a good thing. If you're looking 15 to 20 years down the road, it works better.''
For people with substantial wealth, above $5 million, the advantage is predictable growth on a part of their portfolio that they hope not to need.
''Over a 20-year holding period, most permanent life insurance policies have an internal rate of return of 3 to 5 percent depending on the company,'' said Adam Sherman, chief executive of Firstrust Financial Resources, a wealth manager and insurance broker in Philadelphia. ''Given how the world looks, is it bad to have a 5 percent tool in your investment box? It's not going to hurt you.''
Or put another way, life insurance gives you guaranteed growth: the death benefit will be worth more than what you put in. Critics would argue that you could earn more money investing that money outside an insurance policy, but even some very wealthy people do not want to take the risk.
Mr. Plybon said he worked with a couple in their 70s who wanted to buy a large insurance policy after watching their net worth drop to $20 million from $30 million in 2008. While they clearly did not need money to live on, they wanted to find a way to get it back, since they had earmarked it for their family foundation. For a premium of about $1 million, he sold them a policy that would pay out $10 million after both spouses died.
Why not just invest that money in other, faster-growing assets? ''They didn't want to take a chance,'' Mr. Plybon said. ''They wanted to get less aggressive, not more aggressive.''
The other main advantage of insurance as an asset class is its preferential tax treatment. It is well known that the death benefit passes to heirs free of income tax. But policy holders can also borrow up to the amount they put into the policy tax-free and after that take out a loan against the policy, which can be repaid or deducted from the death benefit.
WHEN IT DOESN'T Treating an insurance policy as an asset class can be a bad idea if you expect the policy to be more than it is.
''Just like any other asset someone would invest in, you have to pay attention to it,'' said Glen Coral, director of advanced planning at CBIZ, a consulting firm. ''You have to make sure the reason you purchased it in the first place still makes sense, and you have to make sure it's performing as you anticipated it might when you first purchased it.''
Borrowing against the policy, for example, means you have to pay interest, and as the interest compounds over the years, it could greatly reduce the value of the policy.
Permanent life insurance is also loaded with fees up front, so anyone who wants to cash in a policy before 10 or 15 years is going to lose money. So those frustrated by the current low yields in the bond market need to weigh whether their frustration will last a decade.
They also have to decide whether the security of insurance is worth what they will lose in returns. Mr. Coral estimated that over 25 years a low-cost bond portfolio would have returns 1 to 1.5 percent higher than a permanent life insurance policy.
Most policies sold today are some variation on universal life, where the cash value of the policy grows as the underlying investments grow. So there is the chance for higher returns. But there is also a chance for far lower returns. Many policies guarantee at least a 3 percent return, but others, like variable universal life that allow for greater appreciation, may not.
''Insurance companies want you to think of it as an investment vehicle, but it's a protection vehicle,'' said Robert D. Russell, president of Russell & Company, a retirement adviser in Dayton, Ohio. ''Fifteen years at 5 to 6 percent? Show me that in writing.''
Of course, at some point someone will get a return on the money you put in, whether it is 3 percent or 15 percent. ''Mortality is recession-proof,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''When we go, it's not going to be because the Dow was up or down.''

HEADLINE: Dow Returns to Positive Territory for Year

BYLINE: By JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
Stocks ended the week on an upswing, after a report Friday showed that retail sales rose in September, even as another survey indicated that Americans were feeling less confident about the economy.
Analysts also said that fear about Europe's debt crisis had faded somewhat in the last few days.
Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index are higher than they were at the end of 2010. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was still in negative territory, down 2.63 percent for the year. 
On Friday , the S.& P. 500 rose 20.92 points, or 1.74 percent, to 1,224.58; it gained 5.98 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrials gained 166.36 points, or 1.45 percent, to 11,644.49, and the Nasdaq rose 47.61 points, or 1.82 percent, to 2,667.85. The weekly gains on the Dow and the Nasdaq were 4.88 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively.
Interest rates continued to rise. The yield on a 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent, from 2.18 percent late Thursday.
Analysts said the retail sales numbers had beaten expectations. Sales rose 1.1 percent in September from August, and 7.9 percent from the previous year -- the fastest clip since February, according to the Commerce Department. The rate of growth between July and August was also revised upward to 0.3 percent, after having been initially reported as flat. Total retail sales were $395.5 billion.
Every category of retailers reported higher sales from a year ago except for electronics and appliance stores, whose sales remained flat. Automobiles were particularly strong, with sales rising 3.6 percent from August, and 8.5 percent from September 2010.
The report was another sign that the economy may be in better shape than many economists thought, said Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG. The recent rise in stock prices reflects the change in the prevailing outlook, he added.
''When the stock market collapsed, you were uncool if you were weren't saying that the U.S. was going into recession,'' he said.
In a surprise, however, preliminary figures for the Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index showed a drop to 57.5 for October from 59.4 in September. Analysts expected confidence to rise. Instead, sentiment in every category dropped.
Consumer sentiment has been hovering near the levels reached during the recent recession, which economists take as a troubling sign that the perception of a weak economy could end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.
But Russell Price, a senior economist at Ameriprise Financial, said that attitudes could get out of line with how people were actually acting during turning points in the economy. ''If people are confident enough to go out and spend $30,000 on a new automobile, it shows they are pretty confident in their own financial situation,'' he said.
European markets were also higher Friday, as the Group of 20 finance ministers began a two-day meeting to discuss their approach to the European debt crisis. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 was up 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 in London gained 1.17 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 0.89 percent.
Optimism about a European rescue plan also continued to push up the price of the euro against the dollar. The euro traded at $1.3876, up 0.92 percent.
The urgency of the G-20 talks was underlined when the Fitch Ratings agency said Friday that it would review its ratings for some of Europe's most globally interconnected banks. This week the European Commission proposed requiring the Continent's largest banks to bolster their protection against losses. There has also been discussion of the International Monetary Fund helping to increase the power of Europe's rescue plan.
The euro zone is entering a critical countdown, with investors in financial markets expecting European officials at a summit meeting on Oct. 23 and leaders of the Group of 20 on Nov. 3 to endorse specific plans to confront the crisis. For now at least, investors have taken heart at perceived progress in Europe. The VIX, which measures volatility in the market, has dropped to its lowest levels since it spiked on Aug. 4. Popularly known as the fear index, the VIX ended at 28.24, down from a peak of over 45 in early October.
Analysts stressed the fragility of investors' confidence, and some voiced concern that optimism about the prospect of a plan could fade when its specifics were hammered out.
''We've been here before,'' said Nariman Behravesh of IHS Global Insight. ''It's pretty tenuous right now.''

HEADLINE: The 1930s Sure Sound Familiar

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Not long ago, someone suggested that I read ''Since Yesterday,'' a book by Frederick Lewis Allen, a popular historian of the 1930s and 1940s. Published in 1940, it turned out to be a shrewd, concise, wonderfully written account of America in the '30s.
It also turned out to be something else: a reminder of why history matters. It is impossible to read ''Since Yesterday'' without reflecting, again and again, on the parallels between then and now. The Great Depression, of course, dominates the book -- and is far worse than anything we've been through. Still, when Allen writes about Ivar Kreuger, the industrialist who built an empire that some considered a Ponzi scheme, you instantly think of Bernie Madoff. The country's fixation with the Lindbergh kidnapping seems strikingly similar to the country's fixation with Casey Anthony. 
And when Allen describes ''Hooverville'' -- a large encampment of war veterans demanding promised bonus payments -- Occupy Wall Street springs to mind. The veterans, who had gathered in a park near the Capitol, were treated well at first, but were eventually routed by the Army in a brutal show of force.
In ''Since Yesterday,'' bankers are vilified; homes are foreclosed on; people desperately search for work -- just like today. Businessmen speak of the need for ''confidence,'' a word that ''enters the vocabulary only when confidence is lacking.'' Elsewhere Allen writes, ''No longer were vital economic decisions made at international conferences of bankers; now they were made only by the political leaders of states.''
Allen makes the surprising point that, while small business suffered terribly during the Great Depression, big corporations did well. When large companies needed to lay off workers to maintain profitability, they did so ruthlessly. Bursts of economic growth, however, were rarely accompanied by an increase in employment. Why? Because new technology allowed companies to increase productivity at the expense of workers. Just like today.
What dominates ''Since Yesterday'' -- as it must dominate any history of the Great Depression -- is the government's responses to the crisis. Herbert Hoover was ''leery of any direct governmental offensive against the Depression,'' writes Allen. ''So he stood aside and waited for the healing process to assert itself, as according to the hallowed principles of laissez-faire economics it should.'' Sticking to his convictions, Hoover allowed the country to sink deeper and deeper into Depression, becoming in the process one of its victims -- ''along with the traditional economic theories of which he was the obstinate and tragic spokesman.''
Then came Roosevelt, untethered to any economic theory and willing to try anything to get people back to work. Allen describes the alphabet soup of agencies he created, the deficits he generated, the regulations he enacted. The economy, which bottomed out in 1932, steadied and then began to grow until, by 1937, it appeared that the Great Depression had ended.
Allen then takes us through the terrible days of late 1937, when the economy collapsed again. ''Roosevelt's Depression,'' businessmen called it, blaming it on a business tax they particularly loathed. In fact, Allen makes the convincing case that the real problem was that Roosevelt had tried to do something business wanted: balance the budget. Shrinking government spending dried up demand. And not until the following spring, when he reversed course and decided to ''go in for heavy spending again,'' did conditions begin to improve.
The tragedy of Washington today, as the supercommittee begins its task of finding $1.2 trillion in cuts, is that nobody seems to remember the lessons of ''Since Yesterday'' -- and most other books about the Great Depression.
Cutting deficits always sounds good. Certainly, nobody wants the inflation that runaway deficits can produce. But in a depressed economy, cutting spending can lead to deflation, which is every bit as ruinous. To read ''Since Yesterday'' at this particular moment -- with the economy hanging in the balance, with President Obama's jobs program already voted down in the Senate, with fiscal policy so stubbornly focused on the wrong things -- is to fear that we are headed for worse times ahead, not better times.
Toward the end of his book, Allen sums up the mood of the country. By 1939, people were weary of hard economic times, but they were also weary of Roosevelt's endless experiments. Many modern historians believe that Roosevelt's biggest problem was not that he'd done too much, but that he'd done too little -- that the Depression required a response bigger than even Roosevelt's New Deal. Implicitly, Allen agrees with that.
Still, he writes, ''Despite all the miseries of the Depression and the recurrent fears of new economic decline and of war, the bulk of the American people had not yet quite lost their basic asset of hopefulness.''
He concludes: ''A nation tried in a long ordeal had not yet lost heart.'' When our current long ordeal finally ends, will we be able to say the same?

LAKE ORION, Mich. -- The chief question rippling through a General Motors plant here in this vital swing state on Friday, as President Obama and his new B.F.F., President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea, tootled around on their free trade victory tour, was this: How did Mr. Obama get Mr. Lee to don that Detroit Tigers hat?
Fresh from a state visit in Washington that came with all the bells and whistles, including a state dinner, Congressional passage of a free trade pact and an address to a joint meeting of Congress, Mr. Lee joined his ''good friend'' Mr. Obama for a visit here to promote the trade bill. 
But Mr. Lee did much more, offering a strong show of support for Mr. Obama in a politically crucial state among auto workers who the president is desperately hoping will reward him for the auto industry bailout by showing up at the polls to vote for him next year.
''One thing Mr. Obama and I agree on is jobs,'' Mr. Lee said, sounding a little like a running mate. ''It was three years ago that I met President Obama, and there was one thing that we talked about, and that was on President Obama's mind, and that was how to revive the U.S. automotive industry.''
The assembled workers cheered.
They cheered some more when Mr. Lee -- the hat of the hometown team, still battling in baseball's playoffs, perched somewhat awkwardly on his head -- assured them that the free trade pact would not take away their jobs. ''Let me tell you one thing, that is not true,'' Mr. Lee said. ''I am here with President Obama today to give this promise to you: The Korea free trade agreement will not take away any of your jobs. Rather, it will create more jobs for you and your family. This is the pledge I give you today.''
Then he handed the microphone over to his good friend.
Mr. Obama's bailout of the auto industry was controversial when he initiated it in 2009, but in Michigan, at least, it was welcome. The plant itself, where workers make the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact and the larger Buick Verano in this town some 30 miles outside of Detroit, was going to shut down back in 2008. It did not, thanks to an agreement that G.M. struck with the United Auto Workers for flexible scheduling, one G.M. executive said.
Whether the 2009 auto bailout ends up paying off for Mr. Obama next year remains to be seen. Michigan is home to some of his biggest challenges, including a depressed economy and an angry middle class. And while Mr. Obama could conceivably afford to lose a few of the states that he carried in 2008, most Democrats believe that he cannot lose Michigan and still assemble the electoral votes needed for victory.
But shifting demographics and deep economic burdens have snapped the Democratic Party's recent hold on the state, and given Republicans confidence that Michigan is again one of the country's most fiercely competitive battlegrounds.
At the same time, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who is running for president, grew up in Michigan and has ties to the state as well; if he is the Republican nominee, many political observers say Mr. Obama will have to campaign harder in Michigan.
Already the president has been here three times in two months.
Mr. Obama seemed to be in good spirits as he took the microphone after Mr. Lee. ''They buy as much stuff from us as they sell to us!'' Mr. Obama said of South Koreans. ''That's how free and fair trade is supposed to be!''
More cheers.
''I know President Lee is a Hyundai guy,'' Mr. Obama said, to chuckles. He added that ''Koreans should be able to buy some Fords and Chryslers and Chevys that are made right here in the United States.''
Then he bounded off the stage as music blared. Mr. Obama worked the crowd for a few minutes as a mystified-looking Mr. Lee watched, his blue baseball cap with its big D in the front still on his head.

HEADLINE: British Defense Minister Resigns Over a Friend's Political Access and Influence

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain's defense minister, Liam Fox, resigned abruptly on Friday after more than a week of damaging newspaper headlines about his personal and professional relationship with a 33-year-old man who accompanied him on numerous official trips abroad and appeared to have brokered access for wealthy people who shared Mr. Fox's interest in fostering still closer ties with the United States and Israel.
The resignation of Mr. Fox, one of the most senior figures in the British cabinet, was a major blow for Prime Minister David Cameron's 17-month-old government and Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party, which counts Mr. Fox as the effective standard-bearer in the cabinet for the party's right wing. A desire to avoid alienating the powerful right-wing bloc of Conservative backbenchers appeared to have been one reason Mr. Cameron had not already ousted Mr. Fox.
Mr. Cameron quickly replaced him with Philip Hammond, the transportation secretary. Mr. Hammond, in turn, was replaced by Justine Greening, formerly a junior treasury minister, an appointment that should soften criticism that Mr. Cameron's cabinet has few women in powerful posts. 
Mr. Fox revealed his decision to quit in a letter to Mr. Cameron, effectively pre-empting an internal inquiry the prime minister had ordered into his relationship with his close friend, Adam Werritty. The official charged with the inquiry, Britain's top civil servant, Gus O'Donnell, had been expected to submit his findings next week, and there was a widespread expectation that it would be harshly critical and force Mr. Fox out.
Mr. Fox's resignation letter made no mention of Mr. Werritty, his companion on 18 trips abroad while Mr. Fox was defense minister. According to Defense Ministry records, Mr. Werritty was also at a number of meetings Mr. Fox held with senior foreign officials, including a dinner in Tampa, Fla., in July 2010 with American military officials, including Gen. John R. Allen, now the NATO commander in Afghanistan.
Official records made public in recent days showed that Mr. Werritty, born in Scotland, like Mr. Fox, and best man at his wedding in 2005, had also visited him 22 times in the Defense Ministry headquarters since the May 2010 elections that put the Cameron government in office. At one point in the Conservatives' years in opposition, the two were London roommates, in a property whose mortgage was paid out of Mr. Fox's parliamentary expenses.
''As you know, I have always placed a great deal of importance on accountability and responsibility,'' Mr. Fox said in his resignation letter, which was released by his aides. ''As I said in the House of Commons on Monday, I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my government activities to become blurred. The consequences of this have become clearer in recent days. I am very sorry for this.''
He added: ''I have also repeatedly said that the national interest must always come before personal interest. I now have to hold myself to my own standard. I have therefore decided, and with great sadness, to resign from my post as secretary of state for defense -- a position which I am immensely proud and honored to have held.''
Mr. Cameron responded with a letter that said he was ''very sorry'' to see Mr. Fox go and lauded his performance in the defense post, which included overseeing Britain's participation in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as the harshest cuts in Britain's defense budget in decades. Those were part of broad and painful spending reductions as the Cameron government grappled with a debt and deficit crisis.
''You have done a superb job in the 17 months since the election, and as shadow defense secretary before that,'' Mr. Cameron said, calling Mr. Fox's tenure a time of ''fundamental changes in the Ministry of Defense and in our armed forces'' as they modernized.
''On Libya, you played a key role in the campaign to stop people being massacred by the Qaddafi regime and instead win their freedom,'' he said, adding, ''I appreciate your commitment to the work of this government, particularly highlighting the need to tackle the deficit, and the relationship between Britain's economic strength and our national security.''
Mr. Werritty has at no time held any official position on the Defense Ministry staff or in Mr. Fox's personal office. In Mr. Fox's public statements before his resignation, he said that the relationship was a personal one and that he had rebuked Mr. Werritty for using business cards carrying the House of Commons logo that identified him as an ''adviser'' to Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox also said that Mr. Werritty's income did not depend on any ''transactional'' activity during the foreign trips they made together or in contacts with those Mr. Werritty introduced to Mr. Fox in his role as a self-styled defense consultant.
In recent days, articles in major British newspapers have suggested that the two men may have had an intimate relationship, and reporters have asked Mr. Fox, 50, whether it was sexual. Mr. Fox has answered obliquely, while other Conservative politicians have said that he is happily married to his wife, Jesme. On Monday, he used a 75-minute confrontation with opposition Labour politicians in the Commons to denounce the ''innuendo'' and ''undermining'' he said he had endured.
After an initial inquiry by a senior Defense Ministry official concluded last weekend that there was no evidence of any security breach, Mr. Cameron deferred any decision on Mr. Fox pending the conclusion of the O'Donnell inquiry. But the torrent of damaging headlines continued to build, even as Mr. Fox went to Paris on Thursday to meet with his French counterpart.
On Friday, Mr. Fox returned to a report in The Times of London that a not-for-profit company established by Mr. Werritty, Pagav Ltd., had received payments of about $230,000 from people with interests in promoting closer British ties with Israel, the United States and Sri Lanka. The newspaper said that some of the money was used by Mr. Werritty to pay for his overseas journeys with Mr. Fox.
Jim Murphy, the Labour Party's shadow defense minister, demanded a public inquiry into what he called ''the off-the-books, shady sort of arrangement'' that he said had allowed Mr. Fox, with Mr. Werritty's help, to promote foreign policy interests that were favored by the right wing of the Conservative Party. But there was no mention of any of this in the correspondence between Mr. Fox and Mr. Cameron on Friday.
Mr. Cameron has also faced criticism for what some opponents have described as a lack of decisiveness in handling troubling personnel issues. This year, many Conservatives voiced dismay at his failure to heed warnings about his former Downing Street media chief, Andy Coulson. Mr. Coulson was hired by Mr. Cameron for the Conservatives in 2007 after Mr. Coulson resigned as editor of The News of the World, now defunct. He stepped down from his government job in January as the police stepped up their investigation of phone-hacking and other accusations of newsroom wrongdoings at the tabloid, and was among the 16 people arrested this summer in the inquiry.
Mr. Fox has been an outspoken proponent of close relations with the United States and Israel at a time when many British politicians, especially on the left, have become increasingly skeptical of alliances that tie those countries too closely.
While still in opposition before the Conservatives' victory last year, he established a foundation, Atlantic Bridge, as a forum for fostering closer ties with the United States, and appointed Mr. Werritty as its executive director. The organization drew financial backing from wealthy individuals on both sides of the Atlantic, but was closed last year after questions were raised about its tax-free status as a charity.

HEADLINE: Johnson & Johnson Wins Suit Over Antibiotic's Side Effects

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson on Friday won a significant lawsuit concerning whether it adequately alerted doctors to the risks in prescribing its popular antibiotic Levaquin.
Last year, the drug was the best-selling antibiotic in the United States, with sales of about $1.5 billion, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescription drug sales. 
Johnson & Johnson is facing more than 2,000 lawsuits from plaintiffs who claim the company was slow in fully warning doctors about reports linking Levaquin to tendonitis and tendon ruptures. The company denies any wrongdoing.
In a New Jersey state court in Atlantic City, lawyers for the drug maker told jurors that the Levaquin label had included information about tendon problems since the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug in 1996. The company periodically updated the label to make the information more prominent and more specific, they said.
The jury agreed on Friday that the company and Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the unit that markets the drug in the United States, had properly warned of the risks
''We are pleased with the jury verdict, which recognizes that Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. properly disclosed the risks associated with this medicine that has been used to treat millions of patients over 15 years,'' Christy Jones, an outside lawyer for the company, said in a statement.
The verdict comes at a time when Johnson & Johnson's once-stellar reputation has been tarnished by multiple recalls of over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol as well as recalls of faulty hip replacement devices.
The suit was brought by two New Jersey patients, Robert Beare and Paul Gaffney, who sued after taking Levaquin and suffering tendon problems.
''It was a very difficult case for the jury,'' said a lawyer for Mr. Beare and Mr. Gaffney, Andres F. Alonso, who plans to appeal.
Levaquin is one of a class of powerful antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, which are associated with an increased risk of tendon injuries, particularly for people over 60 and people taking steroids. In 2008, the F.D.A. required manufacturers of this class of drugs to put a ''Black Box,'' the most serious kind of warning, on the label.
The New Jersey case was the third of what are known as test cases over Levaquin, used by lawyers to try out their arguments.
A Minnesota man won the first case last December and was awarded $1.8 million, including punitive damages and Johnson & Johnson won the second case earlier this year. A fourth case is expected to go to trial in January.
But Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said it was too early to conclude that Johnson & Johnson would succeed in persuading other juries that it fully disclosed the drug's risks when it should have. ''We have to see the rest of the bellwethers to see how this is going to play out,'' he said of the test cases.
The company has stopped actively marketing Levaquin because it is now available as a generic.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. vs. the Environment

 BODY:
As of Friday, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives had voted 168 times this year to undercut clean air and water laws while blocking efforts to limit global warming, protect public lands and guard against future oil spills. Henry Waxman, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, calls this ''the most anti-environmental Congress in history.'' 
Mr. Waxman, whose staff compiled that grim tally, can recall a time when Republicans voted for bills to protect the environment, as happened in 1990 when he and Republican moderates worked together to strengthen the 1970 Clean Air Act. Now a new Republican breed -- driven by antiregulatory fervor, allegiance to industry and a refusal to accept the fact of climate change -- seeks to tear apart the edifice of environmental law constructed largely under a Republican president, Richard Nixon, and sustained until recently by bipartisan support.
Some of the House's votes have seemed entirely reflexive, like a 240-to-169 thumbs down for a sensible amendment requiring regulators to seek independent advice on drilling safety from an organization not affiliated with the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's lobby. Far more worrisome have been votes that would dangerously weaken basic clean air and clean water laws and undermine the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate toxic pollutants like mercury and set clean air standards based solely on science.
The Senate and the White House may be able to stop the worst legislation. But the Republicans' assault is relentless, and in the bargaining over spending bills there is always a danger that a few bad bills may make it through.
Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who is the chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has been warning her colleagues of just such an outcome. She has also been reminding them that the clean air laws have reaped net economic benefits in terms of lives saved and illnesses avoided.
The Republicans, predictably, claim that regulations cost jobs and that all they are trying to do is help the working man. What they are really doing by destroying years of environmental law is putting the interests of corporations above all others and threatening public health.

HEADLINE: Perry Presents a Jobs and Energy Proposal With an Oil and Gas Industry Sound

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; John M. Broder and Ian Urbina contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WEST MIFFLIN, Pa. -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas released a long-promised jobs and energy proposal Friday that resembles a wish list for the oil and gas industry, promising new drilling across much of the country, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as a curtailing of environmental regulations and ''dismantling'' the Environmental Protection Agency.
The plan he laid out in a speech at the United States Steel plant here contained proposals he said would free the nation from reliance on foreign energy and create 1.2 million jobs. 
But critics said the plan -- much of which tracks a recent proposal by an oil industry trade group -- would make little headway toward either goal, and they feared that it would imperil drinking water supplies and hurt the environment.
''My plan will break the grip of dependence we have today on foreign oil from hostile nations like Venezuela and unstable nations in the Middle East to grow jobs and our economy at home,'' Mr. Perry said in the speech.
With his popularity slipping in recent polls, Mr. Perry is clearly hoping to shift the recent narrative of his campaign away from a focus on what even he has acknowledged has been a lackluster performance in debates. His attention on the energy issue, a subject he is comfortable with, could be an effort to bolster his credibility among voters and donors.
His energy plan has four parts: use executive decrees to allow new or additional drilling in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico and federal lands in the West; roll back or weaken environmental regulations; dismantle the E.P.A. and replace it with a ''scaled-down agency''; and reshape subsidies and tax credits for different parts of the energy industry, in what appears would be a move away from renewable energy.
A major part of his approach, he added, would be to put an end to what he described as the Obama administration's complicity in allowing bureaucrats to ''grind the economy to a halt in pursuit of activist regulations.''
But Mr. Perry did not elaborate on how, specifically, his plan would create 1.2 million new jobs and end dependence on foreign oil. And he made questionable assertions, including one -- that the E.P.A. had never found a case of unsafe hydraulic fracturing of natural gas -- that was plainly false.
He also called on oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico to be restored to the pace seen before the BP disaster last year, even though drilling activity is already approaching prespill levels and the Interior Department has announced a major new lease sale.
Many of Mr. Perry's proposals also appeared very similar to -- if not drawn from -- an industry-financed study that was endorsed last month by the American Petroleum Institute. That study asserted that opening new regions to drilling and taking other steps that were also proposed in Mr. Perry's speech would create an additional one million jobs in seven years.
A spokesman for Mr. Perry did not respond to an e-mail asking whether the governor's plan was influenced by the industry proposal. Perry campaign officials have also declined to say who wrote the new energy plan. However, Rayola Dougher, a senior economic advisor at the Petroleum Institute, said institute officials had met with all the Republican presidential candidates.
''We're very pleased to see them pick up on the potential our industry has to create new oil and gas jobs,'' she said.
Ms. Dougher added that if proposals in the institute's report were enacted, that would increase domestic oil production by 5.8 million barrels a day over projected levels 15 years from now. Currently, the United States imports a little more than nine million barrels a day.
But other experts were sharply critical of Mr. Perry's proposals. While he promoted the potential of natural gas in the giant rock formation known as the Marcellus Shale to create a quarter-million new jobs, some experts noted that federal researchers recently cut estimates of undiscovered and technically recoverable gas in the shale formation by almost 80 percent -- calling into question the reliability of any long-range predictions about the amount of energy available for extraction there.
The Perry proposal ''is largely a political gesture to powerful interests,'' said Thomas Power, former chairman of the University of Montana economics department and an expert on energy industry employment. ''It's not going to make a dent in the unemployment rate, because the vast majority of people who have those skills are very busy right now pursuing oil and gas.''
''We've been through this before -- the 'drill, baby, drill' routine,'' he added.
Dusty Horwitt, senior counsel to the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, expressed bafflement at the assertion that environmental regulators had crippled the energy industry.
''The E.P.A. is not standing in the way of oil and gas drilling, because they legally have very little power to regulate the industry,'' Mr. Horwitt said. The balance between the need to guarantee reliable energy and to protect the nation's drinking water supplies has already been tilted too far toward oil and gas companies, and the Perry proposal would exacerbate that further, he added.

HEADLINE: Britain's Self-Inflicted Misery

 BODY:
For a year now, Britain's economy has been stuck in a vicious cycle of low growth, high unemployment and fiscal austerity. But unlike Greece, which has been forced into induced recession by misguided European Union creditors, Britain has inflicted this harmful quack cure on itself. 
Austerity was a deliberate ideological choice by Prime Minister David Cameron's ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, elected 17 months ago. It has failed and can be expected to keep failing. But neither party is yet prepared to acknowledge that reality and change course.
Britain's economy has barely grown since the budget cuts began taking effect late last year. The most recent quarterly figures showed the economy flat-lining, with growth at 0.1 percent.
New figures released this week reported Britain's highest jobless numbers in more than 15 years. Independent analysts expect unemployment -- now 8.1 percent -- to keep rising in the months ahead. The government has kept its promise to slash public-sector jobs -- more than 100,000 have been lost in recent months. But its deficit-reduction policies have failed to revive the business confidence that was supposed to spur private-sector hiring.
Drastic public spending cuts were the wrong deficit-reduction strategy for the weakened British economy a year ago. And they are the wrong strategy for the faltering American economy today. Britain's unhappy experience is further evidence that radical reductions in federal spending will do little but stifle economic recovery.
A few years of robust growth would go far toward making swollen federal deficits more manageable. But slashing government spending in an already stalled economy weakens anemic demand, leading to lost output and lost tax revenues. As revenues fall, deficit reduction requires longer, deeper spending cuts. Cut too far, too fast, and the result is not a balanced budget but a lost decade of no growth. That could now happen in Britain. And if the Republicans have their way, it could also happen here.
Austerity is a political ideology masquerading as an economic policy. It rests on a myth, impervious to facts, that portrays all government spending as wasteful and harmful, and unnecessary to the recovery. The real world is a lot more complicated. America has no need to repeat Mr. Cameron's failed experiment.

HEADLINE: Cain Unable

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The 9s have it. 

 BODY:
An irate correspondent is furious with me for dismissing Herman Cain's ideas. Cain's program, he angrily asserts, has been endorsed by none other than Arthur Laffer, a "much smarter economist than you." Indeed, Laffer capped his brilliant career two years ago by warning, presciently, that interest rates would soar thanks to the Obama plan.
But seriously -- or as seriously as anything involving Cain can get -- Jared Bernstein has a good summary of the reality of nein, nein, nein. The key point is that each of the nines is a tax that would more or less fully fall on middle-income families, who in addition to paying 9 percent of their income in taxes would find their living costs 9 percent higher and their wages 9 percent lower. That's a 27 percent tax, way above the average federal taxes now paid by middle-income households.
So the Cain plan amounts to a huge tax increase on most Americans, but a huge tax cut on the wealthy.

HEADLINE: "Occupy Wall Street" and Inequality

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers comment on my column about Occupy Wall Street and the staggering economic inequality in the United States. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column hopes and prays that the Occupy Wall Street movement will help put the issue of economic inequality on the national agenda for the 2012 election. It seems to me to be one of the background challenges our economy faces, and it's an issue of fairness, yet it has received very little attention until recently.
So what do you think? Do you agree with my column argument that inequality has become an impediment to economic growth? And do you think Occupy Wall Street has set it firmly on the agenda? 

        
Suggestions for that, er, Tahrir on the Hudson?

HEADLINE: Bachmann Raised Almost $4 Million in Third Quarter

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Michele Bachmann raised almost $4 million in the third quarter but spent nearly $6 million, leaving her campaign for the presidency with about $1.3 million as she heads into the final few months before voting begins. 

 BODY:
Michele Bachmann raised almost $4 million in the third quarter but spent nearly $6 million, leaving her campaign for the presidency with about $1.3 million as she heads into the final few months before voting begins.


Total $3Receipts,907,748.06	$5Disbursements,947,630.95	Cash on $1Hand,339,184.10	Source:F.E.C. filing	Mrs. Bachmann has been struggling in the polls since winning the Iowa straw poll this summer. The entrance of Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, into the race and some stumbles of her own slowed her momentum.
But documents filed Saturday with the Federal Elections Commission shows that she raised more in the third quarter than she did in the second. She brought in about $3.2 million in under two weeks after entering the race in the early summer, though some of that was transferred from her House campaign fund. 
In recent weeks, Mrs. Bachmann's campaign has seen the departure of several of its top aides, including campaign manager Ed Rollins and pollster Ed Goeas. Both said they still support Mrs. Bachmann.
Those departures may help to stem some of the flow of money out of the campaign. The records show that Mr. Rollins was paid $55,000 during the last three months. Mr. Goeas's company got about $80,000, the records show.
Mrs. Bachmann's campaign said in a statement on Saturday that she will hold a tele-town hall on Monday with Donald Trump, the real estate mogul, as a special guest.
"Bachmann and Trump will discuss critical economic issues facing American families and businesses, while taking questions from the listening audience," her campaign said in a statement. "This is the first appearance Trump has made on a tele-town hall with a 2012 presidential candidate."

HEADLINE: Romney Finds It's Not Free to Move About the Country

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's financial disclosure reports show that the Romney campaign spent $233,812 on private air travel. 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Mitt Romney made a point of letting voters know - via Twitter - that he is a Southwest man, a fan of the airline known for its budget fares and primary-colored planes. What he did not Tweet about, however, were the flights he took on private jets.
But Mr. Romney's financial disclosure reports for the third fund-raising quarter, which he released Friday afternoon, show that the Romney campaign spent $233,812 on private air travel - over $100,000 more than he spent on commercial flights. (To be sure, private flights are costly, compared with a budget airline, where a discerning traveler can spend roughly $100 on a flight.) 
Mr. Romney's private air travel spending went to three aviation companies, with the bulk going to Marquis Jet Partners ($135,083) and Skyshoe II (more than $86,000). Over all, the Romney campaign spent $369,848.75 on air travel. 
Mr. Romney likes to talk and Tweet about flying commercial, and his disclosures show that he did pay money to 13 commercial airlines, including those known for their low fares, like Southwest, to which he paid $14,212 in the third quarter.
Mr. Romney, whose net worth hovers around $200 million, has struggled to show voters that in these tough economic times, he is an average guy just like them. His message was undercut in August, when reports of Mr. Romney's plans to quadruple the size of his $12 million oceanfront mansion in the La Jolla section of San Diego surfaced. 
The Romney campaign declined requests for comment.

HIGHLIGHT: Republican debates, "Wal-Mart moms," the perils of mathematical horseplay and our comment of the half-month. 

 BODY:
Reactions
FiveThirtyEight has been following the Republican debates like everyone else, in particular the continuingdebatingtravails of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Well, the latest debate was held earlier this week in Hanover, N.H., and Mr. Perry again performed pretty poorly.
The Plum Line's Jonathan Bernstein thought so, too. "There's just no getting around it: Rick Perry's inept performances are dominating these debates," Mr. Bernstein wrote.
In Hanover, FiveThirtyEight wrote, Mr. Perry "was more subdued than in past debates." The Los Angeles Times's James Oliphant concurred. In an article that graded each candidate's debate performance, Mr. Oliphant observed that Mr. Perry "appeared to be the most laid-back Texan since Matthew McConaughey."
In other presidential election news, there has been much discussion recently of the electoral significance of "Wal-Mart moms."
Way back when (in March), FiveThirtyEight tackled the popular notionthat in politics, demographics are destiny. Here is what Nate wrote:
"Demographics, certainly, are a part of the picture - and they are something that we discuss around here on occasion. But with one clear exception, the impact that demographics have on voting behavior is a lot more fluid than you might think from all the talk of 'soccer moms' and 'Nascar dads.'"
Tack on "Wal-Mart moms" to the end of that sentence. John Hudson, at The Atlantic Wire, citing that FiveThirtyEight article, raised objections to the demographic grouping.

Indeed, the emerging "Wal-Mart moms" meme may be fueled by a commercial propellant. Erika Fry, at the Columbia Journalism Review's Campaign Desk blog, wrote that two polling firms have been pushing to get this "'key swing group' of 2012 voters into the press." Ms. Fry went on:
"It should surprise no one that the firms responsible for pushing the story, Public Opinion Strategies and Momentum Analysis, are doing the work on behalf of, um, Walmart."
And lastly, our comment of the half-month goes to ... WKJ from Falls Church, Va. In response to "Early New Hampshire Primary Could Backfire on Romney" and the New Hampshire law that dictates the state hold its primary before any other primary, WKJ wrote:
"One of the other 49 states that doesn't currently attract much attention should pass a law to say that their primary must be on the same day as the one in NH."
Reads
At The Monkey Cage, Erik Voeten looked at how financial crises affect the partisan makeup of electorates.
Brad Plumer, at The Washington Post's WonkBlog, unpacked a new Government Accountability Office report "looking at how much federal highway money each state gets, per dollar of gas-tax revenue they chip in to the Highway Trust Fund."
Predicting presidential elections is hard, in large part because there haven't been that many of them. That's the message of two great articles: The Difference Between Presidential Elections and Baseball" by The Atlantic Wire's Elspeth Reeve and "Misleading Predictions About Why Obama "Can't Win" in 2012" by The Washington Monthly's Keith Hmuphreys. 
Mother Jones's Adam Weinstein highlights a fascinating, though mostly pseudo-scientific, look at the Ashton Kucher and Demi Moore breakup.
At DailyFinance, Bill Barker had some interesting thoughts on the fact that the "S&P 500 finished at the same level that it did exactly three years earlier on Monday."

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
HEMINGWAY IN LOVE: Ernest Hemingway has been having a tough few months. First, he gets slapped around in Paula McLain's best-/selling revenge novel ''The Paris Wife,'' which retells the story of his years in France from the point of view of his jilted first wife, Hadley Richardson. Then he's mocked in Woody Allen's ''Midnight in Paris'' as a self-serious blowhard. But a little bit of rehabilitation is on the way, thanks to ''Hemingway's Boat,'' Paul Hendrickson's sympathetic biography (new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list), not to mention the first installment of Hemingway's complete letters, just out from Cambridge University Press. 
That project, which includes previously unseen materials from the Finca Vigia, Hemingway's estate outside Havana, reminds us why we fell in love with the guy to begin with -- or at least why Hadley did, even if his spelling and grammar weren't always so hot. The book -- the first of a projected 16 volumes -- includes his earliest recorded love letter to ''Hash,'' written a few days before Christmas 1920. (Hadley burned most of his letters to her after they divorced in 1927.) ''You can make me jealous -- and you can hurt most awfully -- 'cause my loving you is a chink in the armour of telling the world to go to hell and you can thrust a sword into it at any time,'' Hemingway wrote, before explaining why he hadn't kissed her goodbye on the train platform. ''Lord -- I thot I was loving you -- If I wasnt I never could and never would love any one. Guess I was thinking too much about how I didn't want you to go -- Don't you believe I love you? . . . I didn't want to kiss you goodbye -- that was the trouble -- I wanted to kiss you good night -- and there's a lot of difference.''
REVOLUTIONARY READING: The anti-Wall Street protests that started in downtown Manhattan may lack a coherent set of demands, but they do have a lending library stocked with titles like ''Howl,'' ''Leaves of Grass,'' Noam Chomsky's ''Profit Over People'' and Curtis Sittenfeld's ''Prep'' (huh?), not to mention a dedicated newspaper, The Occupied Wall Street Journal. But exhausted demonstrators looking for the lightest reading they can find, at least in the literal sense, might want to pick up Joshua Glenn and Mark Kingwell's ''Wage Slave's Glossary,'' a nifty pocket-size volume also spotted on the shelves in Zuccotti Park. A follow-/up to the authors' ''Idler's Glossary,'' the book provides energized Marxists and depressed Dilberts alike a witty guide to terms like ''air family'' (the false sense of community among co-workers), ''afternoon farmer'' (19th-/century slang for someone who wastes the entire morning), ''keeping up with the Joneses'' (the title of a popular cartoon that first appeared in 1913) and ''on the wallaby'' (Australian for ''tramping the country on foot, looking for work''), not to mention more self-explanatory terms. (''Bossnapping,'' anyone?) Glenn, who has been following the protests from Boston via the Twitter hashtag #OccupyWallStreet, said he wished he could make a few revisions. ''The first term is '99ers,' referring to out-of-work Americans who have exhausted their 99 weeks of unemployment benefits,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''But if the book were being published this month, instead of last month, the term would be '99 percenters,' referring to the diffuse, leaderless resistance movement's statement: 'The one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent.' I agree with those pundits who've said the '99 percent' line is the one really persuasive idea coming out of the movement, so far. Also, the wearethe99percent Tumblr is excellent stuff.''

HEADLINE: High And Hollow

BYLINE: By KATRINA BROOKER

 BODY:
''Where else in Manhattancan you get this?'' shouted Ira Shapiro as he stood high above the streets of Manhattan on the penthouse terrace of One Madison Park. It was a bright blue spring morning, and he stretched out his arms to show off the view, a clear shot in three directions: north to the Empire State Building, south to the Brooklyn Bridge and west over the Hudson River to Jersey City. Music drifted upward from the bandstand in Madison Square Park, a lovely expanse of trees and paths, 57 stories below. It was by far the tallest building on the block. ''We wanted to change the skyline of Manhattan,'' Shapiro said. ''And we did.'' 
Five years ago, when Shapiro and his best friend, Marc Jacobs, first conceived of the idea for One Madison, they were just two regular guys from the suburbs. The pair became friends through their wives and kids, socializing and playing tennis at the Dellwood Country Club in Rockland County. Jacobs was a commodities trader, and Shapiro worked for his family's real estate firm, building low-income housing in Brooklyn and the Bronx. But both had bigger ambitions. Seeing money pour into real estate starting in the early 2000s, Jacobs and Shapiro decided to join together and develop luxury condos. Their first project was Mirabelle-on-the-Hudson in North Bergen, N.J., which was completed in 2005. The squat building wasn't particularly distinctive, but it looked across the Hudson River toward Manhattan in what marketers were calling ''the Gold Coast of New Jersey.'' Units sold for prices ranging from $500,000 to $1.8 million, which was a lot for the New Jersey waterfront at the time. By 2005 Shapiro was claiming a net worth of more than $12 million. Still, selling condos in New Jersey, even expensive ones, fell short of their goal. They wanted to build in Manhattan.
''I remember when they first came to see me,'' recalls Marcia Rose Yawitz, a broker who showed the pair around the city in the spring of 2006. ''They were looking for something special.'' They found it in what appeared to be an unlikely spot: a two-story McDonald's and a rickety walk-up on the south side of Madison Square Park.
The park sits close to some of the city's most vibrant neighborhoods -- Gramercy, Chelsea, the Flatiron -- and allows for a rare stretch of open sky. Its landscaping and architecture come with a rich history, a physical record of the city's past booms and busts. Eleven Madison Avenue, on the east side of the park, was meant to be 100 stories high, but the developer ran out of money after the market crash of 1929 and halted construction, and only 28 stories were completed. In the 1970s, the park was abandoned to rats and drug dealers and remained that way for years. It would have been unimaginable to pay millions of dollars to live there. But by the time Shapiro and Jacobs came scouting, Madison Square Park was in the process of an extraordinary transformation. A privately financed conservancy repaved paths and replanted the grounds to recreate its original 19th-century landscaping, turned on the water in a renovated fountain and brought in music and sculpture. It also built the Shake Shack. Today the park is filled with tourists eating gourmet burgers and admiring the changing exhibits by artists like Jaume Plensa and Alison Saar.
Jacobs and Shapiro appreciated the revival of the park, but they were more interested in another benefit: there were no landmark restrictions on the plot they were eyeing, and the zoning supported a tall building. They wanted a really tall building, a tower, 60 stories high that would soar above the others on the block and take in the magnificent views. This was the perfect spot to stake their claim on the New York skyline. All they needed was money.
During rational times, no lender would have given a penny to two guys from Rockland County who had never built a skyscraper -- let alone one in Manhattan. ''They would have no shot,'' says Robert Lapidus, president of the L&L Holding Company, which developed 200 Fifth Avenue (home to Eataly), on the west side of the park. Manhattan is one of the toughest places to build in the world. Space is tight; costs are high; the neighbors are litigious. The process for getting approval and permits is draconian. ''You can be the best developers in the world,'' Lapidus says. ''It doesn't matter. There are so many nuances and complexities. It's like being a conductor: If you don't orchestrate everything just right, you get chaos.''
But in the irrational exuberance of the real estate bubble, none of this mattered. Banks were tripping over themselves to finance real estate projects. Between 2003 and 2008, construction and development loans increased by 150 percent to $630 billion. Jacobs and Shapiro were, by all accounts, great pitchmen. ''They had a vision,'' says one lender who met the pair in the initial stages of the project. ''They were very convincing. They described it as a one-of-a-kind building.'' Within a few months of their initial scouting trip, the partners secured a construction loan for $149 million from Credit Suisse; a year later they refinanced with iStar Financial, which gave them $89 million more. They also got an additional $60 million from other investors, including friends and families and neighbors in Rockland County. Eventually, they would have about $325 million.
From the moment One Madison Park began rising, it seemed to encapsulate the mood of the moment. With plenty of cash from banks and investors, Shapiro and Jacobs -- who drove into the city together each day -- began spending lavishly to realize their dream. They hired top contractors: Bovis Lend Lease, the company that built the Time Warner Center, was their construction manager. Plans called for a spa and a 50-foot lap pool. They spent a fortune on top-of-the-line fixtures and details -- Zuma bathtubs, rosewood cabinets, expensive wall-mounted toilets. The white-oak floors cost $30 a square foot. They engaged Rem Koolhaas to draw up plans for a second tower next door. To meet and entice wealthy buyers, they hired a concierge service to get them into the of-the-moment restaurants around the city.
They also hired brokers from Brown Harris Stevens to begin a marketing campaign. The slogan on the building's Web site said, ''It's not lonely at the top, just very, very exclusive.'' Jacobs and Shapiro first called it ''the Saya'' but changed the name later when their brokers told them it wasn't chic enough for Manhattan. The partners and their brokers began leaking stories to the media about over-the-top spending. The New York Times described a $31 million offer on one unit that could have broken downtown records. Another article described how the penthouse would come with its own butler. Suddenly, One Madison was one the hottest buildings in the city, and everyone seemed to want a piece of it. Rumors circulated that Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber and Susan Sarandon were moving in. By the summer of 2008, the building was still a construction site, but, according to Shapiro, there were offers on nearly all of the units.
Diane Stern was one of those swept up in the frenzy over One Madison Park. ''The broker said it was impossible to get in,'' she says. She asked a friend to introduce her to Jacobs and Shapiro. Stern, an entrepreneur who runs a pediatric home-care agency in the Hudson Valley, says she felt lucky to pay $1.5 million for a 970-square-foot one-bedroom. Still, she remembers thinking it was odd when, a few weeks before closing at the end of 2009, Shapiro asked her for a $500,000 loan in return for knocking $150,000 off the purchase price. She was tempted. Shapiro is a likable guy. His soft voice and gentle demeanor make him seem younger than he is, which is 47. He looks you straight in the eye when he speaks. He comes off as someone you could trust. Still, Stern turned him down. Something felt off. She says now, ''That made me feel there were issues with the building.''
On a hot afternoon in August, Marc Jacobs sat in his lawyer's office with a stack of accordion files in front of him. Inside, pages and pages of documents detail the demise of One Madison Park and his relationship with Shapiro. The two have not spoken in a year. ''I started realizing that there was all this stuff Ira wasn't telling me,'' Jacobs said. He says he wasn't getting a complete version of the budget. In a sworn affidavit, Jacobs describes how throughout 2009 and 2010, he started to grow uneasy with Shapiro's accounting for expenses. He discovered that his friend had been using the company charge card to pay for private jet and helicopter rides. Shapiro spent $30,000 on wine one month and $2,000 for tickets to a Miley Cyrus concert. Jacobs says that he canceled Shapiro's Platinum and Centurion American Express cards but that subsequently his partner used Jacobs's card to charge $30,000 of unauthorized expenses. (Shapiro says he repaid the partnership for his personal expenses.)
Then, in the fall of 2009, Jacobs says he began receiving notices at his home of lawsuits indicating that he and his wife were personal guarantors on various loans. Jacobs's signature is on 18 loan documents, but he has sworn in court that he never knew anything about them. He claims that Shapiro forged his signature on the loan documents. He has submitted these documents to the Rockland County district attorney's office in hopes that it will investigate. ''Here is my real signature,'' Jacobs says. He scribbled his name on a sheet of paper and held it against one of the notes. ''They are not the same,'' he insisted. Shapiro refutes the allegations and says the district attorney has not contacted him. (The district attorney's office did not return calls for comment and has not announced an investigation.) Jacobs, who has filed for personal bankruptcy, has left real estate. He works again as a commodities trader, passing the spire of One Madison Park every day on his way to the office. ''I try not to look at it,'' he said. ''It's too painful.''
Although few could see them at the time, the financial cracks at One Madison started appearing almost as soon as the tower began rising. Inexperience, ambition and hubris led to cost overruns. When a broker suggested, after construction was well under way, that the windows should all have automatic shades, they installed them for an additional $1 million. Changing the penthouse floor plans added $200,000. The plans for the Rem Koolhaas building added $8 million to the budget. By the fall of 2008, almost two years into construction, and heading into a recession, the partnership had spent $240 million, and their building was still incomplete.
''It makes you wonder how the money was spent,'' says Cevdet Caner, an Austrian-born real estate mogul who now lives in Monaco. He committed $25 million to the project. Until last year, Caner kept a low profile about his involvement. He has had his own troubles in Europe, where lenders have claimed that one of his companies defaulted on a $1.7 billion loan. But starting in 2009, Caner became increasingly uneasy about his New York partners. He began an investigation, spending millions of dollars to figure out exactly where the money went. What Caner says he discovered disturbed him. For starters, he says he was never informed of the budget overruns and claims to have learned about the Rem Koolhaas plan after reading about it in the paper. More seriously, Caner says he uncovered numerous side deals that Shapiro made to raise money for the project without telling him. ''He took on more loans that totally changed the capital structure,'' Caner says.
Starting as far back as June 2008, Jacobs and Shapiro were asking everyone they could for money -- tennis buddies, prospective buyers, neighbors -- to cover cost overruns. ''We had to go to alternative financing,'' is how Shapiro puts it. Some loans were for a few thousand dollars, some were for a few million. In this patchwork way -- borrowing from dozens of different individuals -- the partners raised about $25 million. To persuade their lenders to give, the partnership pledged apartments in One Madison as collateral, or in some cases offered to sell them at deep discounts. (Jacobs is disputing his role in some of these transactions.) By some accounts, however, the partners did not have the authority to make these deals. ''There are unsecured loans that were taken on by the borrowers without disclosing it to the bank,'' Matthew Parrott, iStar's lawyer, later testified in a hearing in New York state court. Shapiro says iStar and the lenders knew about the details of the deals.
Had the real estate mania lasted a little longer, it's possible that Shapiro and Jacobs might have been able to sell enough apartments and borrow enough money to cover their debts. But when the economy collapsed and the real estate market imploded in 2009, the buyers disappeared. Some with contracts wriggled out of them after filing complaints with the state attorney general. By early 2010, only 12 units -- out of 69 -- had sold. Those sales generated only $38 million, far too little to cover the overwhelming debts. Out of cash, Jacobs and Shapiro stopped paying their bills. IStar, which in the downturn saw its shares go from $50 to less than a dollar in 2009, began foreclosure proceedings to try to recoup its investment in One Madison. Everyone else Shapiro and Jacobs owed money -- from the plumbers to their neighbors -- sued.
''In my 28 years of practicing law, I have never seen anything like this,'' says Ricki Berger, a lawyer from Rockland County who represents four former friends and neighbors who lent money to the project. ''Everybody is suing everybody.'' At one point, Shapiro counted 40 lawsuits in which he, or one of his companies, was named as a defendant. One suit involves the building next door to One Madison, which the partnership was negotiating to buy. Before the sale closed, according to the owner, the partnership knocked down two stories of the building. (Shapiro claims he had verbal permission.) There has been perhaps more than the usual amount of name-calling for a New York construction dispute. Parrott, the iStar lawyer, cast one of the more printable aspersions when he testified in court that Shapiro and his affiliates ''don't have clean hands.'' Burton Dorfman, Shapiro's onetime lawyer, was dismissive: ''I've been called a lot of things in this case, and my client is the bogy man. Mr. Shapiro is the bogy man.'' Extracting the facts -- who owes what and to whom -- is now the subject of thousands of pages of court documents.
One particularly knotty episode involves Ian Bruce Eichner, a longtime developer and chairman of the Continuum Company, builder of the Cosmopolitan Resort and Casino in Las Vegas and CitySpire in Manhattan, both of which have had their own financial troubles. Eichner became involved when Shapiro offered him an unfinished apartment in One Madison for $5 million, in exchange for a $4.5 million loan. Whether Shapiro had the right to do this is now in dispute. During court testimony, iStar contended that its loan agreement with the partnership called for that particular apartment to sell for $9.5 million.
After the project filed for bankruptcy, Shapiro saw Eichner as someone who could help in bigger ways. According to Shapiro, in November of last year, he and Eichner decided to team up to submit a reorganization plan: Shapiro would advocate in court for Eichner to take over the project; Eichner would commit $40 million. (Eichner says Shapiro's recollection is inaccurate, but would not provide more details.)
But control of the project wasn't exactly Shapiro's to give away. Caner bought Jacobs's voting rights in 2009 and was the majority shareholder in the project. Caner didn't want Shapiro making deals on his own. In January, during a trial that lasted several weeks, Caner testified against Shapiro, accusing him of forgery, misappropriation of the building's funds and other misdeeds. In the end, the judge issued an order that prevents Shapiro, who now owns a 33 percent stake in the partnership, from making any decisions about the building without Caner's permission.
Now Shapiro and Caner must work together to take the building out of bankruptcy. It is an uneasy partnership. Caner is furious at Shapiro, blaming him for the building's problems. Shapiro accuses Caner of purchasing Jacobs's voting rights behind his back and trying to remove Shapiro from the project. But he is most hurt by Jacobs, whose filing for personal bankruptcy has left Shapiro alone liable for $50 million in personally guaranteed loans. ''We were best friends,'' Shapiro says. ''How do you drive in with someone every day in good times, and then when things get tough, say, 'It was all Ira'?''
What happens to One Madison now is up to the bankruptcy court. Until the court reaches a decision on a reorganization plan, all construction and sales are frozen. The lawsuits are also delayed. Two outside developers are vying to take over the project. In May, HFZ Capital Group submitted a plan that stalled when, in June, Related Companies -- the developer of the Time Warner Center -- bought iStar's loan and began working on its own reorganization plan. Related's entrance is particularly significant. The company has years of experience building in Manhattan and plenty of cash. Earlier this year, it set up a $1 billion fund to invest in distressed properties. ''Related does a lot to restore the reputation of the project,'' says Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group.
Despite its troubles -- or because of them -- there is still money to be made at One Madison. It sits on a desirable piece of land, it is already largely built and it has those views -- one of the rarest commodities in Manhattan. All over the city, there are similar properties: abandoned, half built, the casualties of hubris and a terrible market. In fact, two other nearby buildings -- the Metropolitan Life clock tower and the north International Toy Center -- have been padlocked for years. This is good for developers with money on hand. ''There are some of the greatest opportunities that I have seen in 30 years,'' says Steven Witkoff, the developer whose company bought the abandoned Toy building in July for $190 million -- a low price for prime property. He plans to convert it into luxury condominiums. The construction slowdown brought on by the recession will eventually lead to a spike in demand for those condos as the current crop fills up. If you are an experienced, well-capitalized developer, it's a good time for bargain hunting.
In late August, shortly before Hurricane Irene hit New York, Shapiro sat in the living room of 30A, an apartment that at one time would have sold for $10 million. Out the window, the hour hand on the MetLife clock inched past the four. Spread out before him were stacks and stacks of court documents, copies of e-mail messages and press clippings, many of which he had marked meticulously with stick-on notes and highlighters. These, he says, show that ''all the allegations against me are false.'' He feels betrayed by Jacobs. ''He got scared and ran away,'' Shapiro says. ''I stayed and fought.'' Looking pale and a bit paunchy, Shapiro sees himself as the building's champion. And despite all the troubles it has caused him, he can't let go. He keeps an office there, and all the doormen know him, as do most of the residents of the 12 units that sold before the building went into lockdown. Shapiro's enthusiasm about the project remains intact. During a tour of the penthouse, he wistfully recalled, ''I was a day away from going under contract for $34 million for this.'' The 7,600-square-foot penthouse looked gutted. Exposed pipes were visible in the ceilings; the walls were unfinished; rodent droppings littered the staircase; wind whistled through the window frames. No one had been there for a long time. Shapiro's shoulders seem bent forward in a defensive crouch, and when I asked about the big buyer, he pulled them in a little bit more, saying, ''He never pulled the trigger.''
Still, Shapiro genuinely believes that one day, a different story of One Madison will emerge. ''I think I have built something to be proud of,'' he says. ''Every big developer in the city has come in here and said, 'Ira, you did a great job.' '' He is pleased that Related and HFZ are now fighting to take over the building. Shapiro, who was receiving a consulting fee paid by HFZ, says he would be happy with either or both taking over. If they do, it is conceivable that by next year the building will be back on the market. ''People will see what I have done, what I have achieved,'' Shapiro says. ''I have transformed the New York skyline.'' He hopes at some point to do it again. He has started looking for a new project. ''This time I will pick my partners more carefully,'' he said.
For now, One Madison remains in a state of real estate limbo. The outside of the building is finished. Fifty of its 69 apartments have certificates of occupancy. Everything else is an abandoned construction site: the lap pool is a dry hole; the elevator buttons are marked with handwritten numbers; slabs of marble in the lobby are protected with blue masking tape.
''The lawyer we had recommended not buying in the building,'' says Natalia Potapova, an ophthalmologist, who, with her husband, was among the last buyers to close on a unit before the bankruptcy courts blocked further sales. ''She said there was a lot of trouble.'' They nevertheless paid $5 million for an apartment on the 16th floor; she is surrounded by empty units that had once promised to house New York's rich and glamorous.
Life here is strange. The building is fully staffed with a doorman, concierge and handyman -- yet Potapova doesn't have to pay any maintenance. Until the bankruptcy case is resolved, the building's senior lender, which is now Related, pays all its operating expenses. The views are lovely, and her kitchen appliances are the envy of her friends. ''I try to keep positive,'' Potapova says.
But odd things happen: At one point, the doormen stopped getting paid, and Potapova and the handful of other residents who have moved in were handed key cards to a side door and told they might have to fend for themselves in the 190,000-square-foot cavern. (They never had to use them; the doormen were paid.) Diane Stern, who also lives in the building, recalls the time when her electronic shades broke, and the company that installed them wouldn't respond; it is suing the developer.
Despite all this, Potapova and Stern both believe they made the right choice to move in. ''This is going to be a good investment,'' Stern says. For all the troubles, the building brokers still have a waiting list of buyers trying to get in. The day-shift doorman says that once a day, someone drops by and asks, ''Are there any apartments for sale?'' When the dust clears, it's very likely that Stern, Potapova and their neighbors will be the owners of highly sought after pieces of Manhattan real estate. Until then, they live in an odd world of derelict luxury and wait for the day that this building comes back to life.

HEADLINE: The Reluctance To Invest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Deer in the Headlights, Financially Speaking'' (Economic View, Oct. 9), in which Richard H. Thaler saw a paralysis in the reluctance of individuals and businesses to invest during these uncertain times: 
The column did not discuss an important point in regard to the business side of the issue: Businesses hoard cash at their own peril. Unless they are among the very largest companies, they are essentially setting themselves up for leveraged buyouts by corporate raiders who will swoop in, relieve them of their cash and leave the bones for the vultures to pick over.
This doesn't serve the best interests of stockholders, and it doesn't bode well for millions of Americans who are employed by these companies. Nothing will stop the gold rush once it commences. I'm surprised it hasn't started already. Eric P. Jorve
Roseville, Minn., Oct. 10
To the Editor:
Richard H. Thaler wants both businesses and individuals to drop their fears of investing in the future -- even suggesting that Americans spend money now in home improvements instead of keeping savings in Treasuries or money market accounts. He also lamented a recent survey in which many companies said they were waiting for economic uncertainty to decline before deploying their huge piles of cash.
Has he dismissed a possibility that many planners, treasurers and wealthier households are considering? After the plunge in stock prices during the summer, everyone seems to be worried about long-term high unemployment, lower wages and benefit cuts. So it is possible, if not likely, that the general price level will fall, or at least not rise so much as to make a delay in investing look unwise.
There is a term for this possible state of affairs. It is not paralysis, and it is not inaction. It's deflation. Savita A. SahayShort Hills, N.J., Oct. 9

HEADLINE: Looking to Rent? Good Luck

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than two years ago, Tom Graney was paying a reasonable $2,200 for a spacious two-bedroom apartment on 11th Avenue and 52nd Street.
When Mr. Graney learned in early 2009 that his rent would be rising to $2,500, he decided to see if he could do better for his money. After all, it was just months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and many of New York's most luxurious apartment buildings were desperate to find tenants, offering wildly generous incentives and cut-rate deals.
Mr. Graney settled on the Helena, a new glass tower at the corner of 11th Avenue and 57th. He found a one-bedroom with a home office for $2,840, and the management paid his broker's fee and gave him one month's free rent on a two-year lease.
''When you add in the month's free rent,'' he said, ''it was really not much more than I would have been paying at my old place.'' The new building was posh, with a fitness center and a rooftop deck that had stunning views. ''It was nice,'' said Mr. Graney, 28, a video producer, ''and it felt like I was making progress.'' 
Fast-forward to June 2011, when his lease was up.
''I got a letter in the mail notifying me that they wanted to raise my rent,'' he said. ''I looked at it and just started laughing. I could not believe they were serious.'' He immediately began to look for a new apartment. According to the Durst Fetner Organization, the building's owner, rent for a one-year lease would have been $3,590.
Across New York, rents have not only rebounded from the depths of two years ago, but are also surpassing the record high of 2007 during the real estate boom, according to figures from Citi Habitats, a large rental brokerage, and other surveys.
That means a perennially frustrating process has become almost frenzied. Brokers say prospective renters need to come prepared to close a deal on the same day -- ready to write a check for thousands of dollars to cover the first and last month's rent, and the broker's fee. For desirable apartments, forget about open houses -- the best places are snapped up within a few days, or less, through private showings by brokers.
And renters need to be prepared for disappointment. On a recent Wednesday, about a dozen people milled around in front of a Citi Habitats office outpost at Perry and Hudson Streets, looking at the listings on the storefront. When they inquired about the apartments, they were told they were already too late.
''As soon as we put something up in the window, it is gone the same day,'' said Udi Eliasi, a broker at Citi Habitats.
Several factors are conspiring to keep rents high, brokers and real estate analysts said, citing the virtual disappearance of any incentives, a vacancy rate in Manhattan that is hovering around 1 percent, and a shortage of new developments on the horizon.
''Over the past year, the market has gotten stronger, stronger and stronger,'' said Daria Salusbury, the national head of leasing for Related, which owns and operates 18 buildings in New York City with a total of 5,000 tenants. ''Over the past few months, we are exceeding our 2007 rents.''
Prices are rising all across Manhattan and for all kinds of apartments. In traditionally strong neighborhoods like Greenwich Village, TriBeCa and SoHo, rents are up 13 percent since September 2008, according to a survey of 10,000 apartments priced under $10,000 a month by the real estate firm MNS. And even in areas like Harlem, where the real estate slump was keenly felt, rents also jumped 13 percent.
Over all, the average rental price for a Manhattan apartment in September was $3,331, according to data compiled for The New York Times by Citi Habitats. Last year at the same time it was $3,131, and in 2009 it was $3,013.
In the past year the increase has been especially sharp. In TriBeCa, for example, a one-bedroom in a doorman building averages $4,635, compared with $3,937 last September, and a similar apartment in Harlem is now $2,398, up from $1,786 last year, Citi Habitats found.
''To put it simply,'' said Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, ''there has been a lot of interest in the rental market this year, and there just has not been that much inventory.'' Manhattan's vacancy rate last month was 1.08 percent, compared with 1.83 percent in 2009 and just 0.83 percent in 2006, according to his company. Brokers say the greatest demand is for larger apartments, two-bedrooms and up.
The average rent for a two-bedroom in a nondoorman building is now $4,137, up from $3,560 last September, according to the MNS survey. In doorman buildings, the average rent for a two-bedroom is $5,857, compared with $5,321 a year ago.
Given the generally pessimistic economic outlook, skyrocketing rents may be baffling to tenants. For many renters, Mr. Malin said, there seems to be a disconnect. ''The world is very shaky and things are not good,'' he said, ''and that is what they see, and they think, 'There is no way my landlord can raise my rent.' ''
Mr. Graney said that even if he had been able to afford the rent increase at the Helena, he would have moved out on principle.
''They are just trying to take advantage of people,'' he said. Landlords know that it costs a lot of money to move, what with paying brokers and hiring movers, he added, so many tenants accept a large increase.
Mr. Graney decided to rent a small office space separately from his home and downsized to a small studio on First Avenue and 85th Street for $1,600 a month.
Ms. Salusbury of Related said that her company dealt with tenants on a case-by-case basis when deciding on increases. ''We like to keep all our residents in our buildings,'' she said, ''and we think they understand the state of the market.''
She also said that back when Related was offering incentives like one month's free rent, the company made sure tenants were qualified to pay the stated rental price rather than just the net adjusted rent.
Ms. Salusbury gave an example of how Related calculated rent increases by citing the Caledonia, a luxury rental building at 450 West 17th Street in Chelsea. A renter who signed a lease in 2009, when most companies were offering incentives, would have paid a net rent of $4,217 on a $4,600 apartment with one month free, a savings of $383 per month.
But now, that renter may see an increase to $4,850, $633 more than the net rent with incentives. ''If they can pay $4,600,'' she said, ''we think they can pay $4,850.''
Renters wedded to a neighborhood, especially a hot one, are particularly torn by rent increases.
Marcella, 46, an executive assistant who lives on 12th Street in the West Village, said she received a letter notifying her the rent on her two-bedroom apartment was being raised to $5,000 from $3,850. She did not want her last name used since she is still negotiating with her landlord.
The apartment has drawbacks, including a small galley kitchen that makes it hard to cook and entertain friends. But she said living in the West Village was ample compensation.
''They are sort of willing to negotiate,'' she said of her landlord, ''but I want to see what else is out there.'' Recently she went to see a spacious one-bedroom with an office in a walk-up building near the corner of Bleecker and Perry Streets.
Although the $4,800-per-month rent would not save her much, the place had a full kitchen and was only one floor up.
''These chips on the mirror, would the landlord fix that?'' she asked the broker, Mr. Eliasi of Citi Habitats.
''I don't think so,'' Mr. Eliasi said. ''He really does not have to do anything and this apartment will move.''
A few days after seeing that apartment and about 15 others, she decided that trying to negotiate with her landlord was the better solution. ''It seems like one has to compromise on some level just to get into an apartment in the West Village,'' she said by e-mail. ''Hence my strategy of trying to renegotiate my current situation.''
The low vacancy rate means that apartment hunters who are pressed for time -- and on a budget -- have precious few options. On a recent Tuesday Ingrid Biorck, 22, and her mother were visiting New York from Sweden to find an apartment for Ms. Biorck, a film student. They had given themselves just one day to look.
A small two-bedroom apartment at Hudson and Perry Streets cost $3,000 a month, but it was a sixth-floor walkup. Her mother bemoaned the trek, to which her daughter responded: ''It's O.K. It's good for my legs.''
After some discussion, Ms. Biorck decided to go for an apartment she had seen earlier in Chelsea, a two-bedroom walk-up on the fourth floor of a loft for $3,200.
''My father will be paying for a year rent upfront,'' she said, ''so perhaps they will negotiate.'' The landlord agreed to $3,000 a month.
One consequence of rising rents historically is that more people consider buying, thus strengthening the sales market -- and eventually driving down rents again. But that is not proving to be the case this time around, said Pamela Hannigan, an assistant professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.
Despite record low interest rates, tightened lending standards have denied mortgages to many people who might have succeeded several years ago. With few qualified buyers and a stubbornly high unemployment rate, new home prices across the country have stagnated or fallen.
''There are new households forming all the time,'' Ms. Hannigan said, ''and people need a place to live, so given these circumstances, it is not surprising rents are rising.''
Jeffrey W. Baker, an executive managing director of Savills, which advises clients on real estate investments, said rents were unlikely to fall anytime soon.
''I would say both landlords and investors are incredibly bullish about the prospects of rental stock over the next two to three years,'' Mr. Baker said. ''We are going to see double-digit rent increases over the next four years'' in New York and major metropolitan areas like Boston, San Francisco and Washington.
In a hot rental market, there is often pressure to make a decision on the spot since good apartments are rare and move fast.
Coralie Carlson, 34, a journalist, thought she and her fiance had found the perfect apartment, a two-bedroom on Christopher Street with a small garden in front. The price was a bit above their budget, but because they were willing to pay for a year upfront, the landlord agreed to a discount, and they settled on $4,500 a month.
The previous tenant was supposed to leave by Oct. 1 but has yet to do so. Even though Ms. Carlson had already paid the landlord the full amount for the year, she worried that the deal might fall apart, so she returned to the apartment search.
On Monday, Ms. Carlson visited a one-bedroom with an office on Bleecker Street, for $4,800. It was the same apartment that Marcella had passed on just a few days earlier.
She liked it, but she and her fiance are holding off on making an offer, hoping that the tenant situation at the Christopher Street place is resolved.
''In the worst-case scenario,'' she said, ''we'll follow legal advice to get our money back and cut our losses.''
''I think most any place will feel like settling compared to the Christopher Street apartment,'' she acknowledged. ''Before, I was looking for 'the one.' Now, we will be looking for a place we can move into quickly.''
Correction: October 23, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the rising cost of renting in New York City misstated a rent increase offered to Tom Graney, a tenant at the Helena, at 11th Avenue and West 57th Street. He was offered a new rent of $3,590 for a one-year lease; it was not ''more than $5,000 a month.'' (The information about the increase was supplied to The Times by Mr. Graney. Efforts to reach his landlord, Durst Fetner Residential, to confirm his account in advance of publication were unsuccessful.)

HEADLINE: Where Do Bohemians Come From?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH CURRID-HALKETT

 BODY:
Elizabeth Currid-Halkett is an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of Southern California and the author of ''The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art and Music Drive New York City.''
Los Angeles
THESE days, even the National Endowment for the Arts is getting into the job-creation business. Last month it started a $23.5 million effort to revitalize blighted urban neighborhoods, including money for public arts projects in St. Paul, museum renovations in Detroit and artists' housing in Harlem. 
The idea that art can be an economic engine is hardly new, and a walk through SoHo, Venice Beach or Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood shows it can work. The N.E.A.'s promotional material makes clear that its goal is to create new SoHo's in hard-hit cities across the country. But contrary to the N.E.A.'s good intentions, it takes more than grants and tax breaks to make the arts thrive. Too often, art-driven revitalization efforts overlook the mercurial nature of art itself.
Take the now-canonical revitalizations of New York's SoHo and Chelsea districts. By the 1960s, both areas had an abundance of abandoned light-manufacturing buildings -- perfect breeding grounds, in retrospect, for artists.
But it took something else, too. Paula Cooper, who opened her first SoHo gallery in 1968, could have opened anywhere; deindustrialization had emptied large parts of the city. And when the dealers Larry Gagosian and Barbara Gladstone, as well as Ms. Cooper, opened in Chelsea in the mid-'80s and '90s, it was not because SoHo's rents were too high, as the conventional wisdom said.
What drove them was the need for even bigger spaces to fit the even bigger aesthetics of artists of the moment like Richard Serra and Jasper Johns. Mr. Serra is known for his freestanding steel sculptures, some 14 feet tall; Mr. Johns's enormous canvases require high walls. ''If you want to show big work, you need big open doors ... and concrete floors,'' Ms. Gladstone told me.
SoHo and Chelsea were full of such large, lofty spaces; the East Village, among other, similarly cheap neighborhoods, was not. SoHo and Chelsea offered another advantage. Studying historical zoning codes, my colleague Richard Green and I found that unlike heavy manufacturing, which was mostly pushed to the city's fringes, the light-manufacturing buildings that dominated these neighborhoods were adjacent to conventional residential neighborhoods, with coffee shops, restaurants and other amenities.
By 1971, when the city rezoned SoHo buildings for artists' work-live spaces, it was merely catching up to a phenomenon well under way. The rezoning also allowed commercial activity on the buildings' first floors, opening the way for more galleries and restaurants, adding momentum to the neighborhood's already robust revitalization.
But art's physical characteristics are just one factor in shaping where it takes root; the social, political and economic context matters, too.
Take the emergence of the arts district in London's East End in the late 1980s. In many ways, the area fit the SoHo model: cheap, flexible spaces that were close to urban amenities. But it didn't really take off until 1988, at the height of anti-Thatcherism, when the artist Damien Hirst opened an exhibition featuring a slate of politically charged artists. Soon labeled the Young British Artists, or Y.B.A.'s, they yanked British art into the center of the contemporary art world.
The radical anti-establishment character of Y.B.A.'s art seemed to grow with the rise of Tony Blair and his New Labor in the 1990s, culminating in the 1997 exhibition ''Sensation.'' Such works as Mr. Hirst's infamous stuffed shark floating in formaldehyde and Tracey Emin's tent ''Everyone I Have Ever Slept With'' replaced stodgy historical pastoral landscapes as representative of British art.
An explosion of interest in their work had a transformative effect on the East End, with galleries and performance spaces paving the way for trendy apartments, restaurants and shops. None of this was planned, nor could it have been.
The evolution of these districts shows that using art as a development tool is like working with quicksilver: it's hard to know which path it might take, and a tough proposition when dealing with taxpayers' money and foundation grants.
Which is not to say that there's no place for programs like the N.E.A.'s. But it does counsel circumspection. These examples demonstrate that specific cultural circumstances dictate art's role as a change agent. Instead of a shotgun approach that assumes every post-industrial zone or blighted district can, with a few million dollars in subsidies, become the next SoHo, we should follow the lead of the metaphorical college that puts down sidewalks only after the students have hewn their own paths.
Groups like the N.E.A. should first identify where artists are doing promising work, and determine whether public resources might help catalyze an artistic community. There's nothing wrong with looking to art as a way to raise a city's economic development. But before we go tossing money at anyone with a paintbrush or an art space, we have to understand the complex ways artistic communities shape our cities' fortunes.

HEADLINE: Love's Labors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Simon Sebag Montefiore's review of ''Love and Capital: Karl and Jenny Marx and the Birth of a Revolution,'' by Mary Gabriel (Sept. 25): concentrating on Marx's private life, Gabriel apparently devotes a good portion of her book to presenting him as a hedonist much taken with gossip, dancing and philandering -- a worthy companion to Friedrich Engels, whose ''clear blue eyes,'' Gabriel writes, ''sparkled at the prospect of adventure -- whether it be revolutionary or, perhaps even better, sexual.'' Instead of critically interrogating what it means to sensationalize and depoliticize the pair's partnership, Montefiore portrays Engels as an ''irrepressibly promiscuous bon viveur.'' 
How did they produce so much weighty matter amid all the romping and frolicking? Could it be that Marx and Engels, while possessing human foibles, were serious intellectuals and committed revolutionaries who analyzed, critiqued and advocated solutions to political and social problems in their time? And if so, might we not conclude that, especially given the current economic crisis and the light it throws on the contradictions of capitalism, it would be a fruitful enterprise to revisit their ideas through thoughtful and sustained consideration, rather than subjecting them to the kind of fatuous treatment shown here?

HEADLINE: Forget 9-9-9. Here's a Simple Plan: 1

BYLINE: By JILL LEPORE. 
A professor of history at Harvard and the author of ''The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History.''

 BODY:
Jill Lepore is a professor of history at Harvard and the author of ''The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History.''
Cambridge, Mass.
IN the Republican debate on Tuesday, the restaurant industry executive Herman Cain, deftly countering a quip, said his ''9, 9, 9'' economic plan, which calls for a 9 percent corporate tax, a 9 percent income tax and a 9 percent national sales tax, ''didn't come off a pizza box.'' Asked where it did come from, he said ''the American people,'' but added that he also has a team of economic advisers.
''One of my experts that helped me to develop this is a gentleman by the name of Rich Lowrie out of Cleveland, Ohio,'' Mr. Cain said. ''He is an economist.'' Mr. Lowrie, a licensed stockbroker, is a wealth management consultant for Wells Fargo. 
Lately, Mr. Cain has risen in the polls, buoyed by Tea Party populism, which is curious because when the word ''populism'' was coined, in 1890, it meant opposition to a monopoly on wealth held by businessmen and bankers.
Henry George, the most popular American economic thinker of the 19th century, was a populist before populism had a name. His economic plan was known as the Single Tax. His plan wasn't 9-9-9; it was just: 1.
George was born in Philadelphia in 1839. He left school at 14 to sail to India and Australia on board a ship called the Hindoo. At the time, a lot of people were writing about India as a place of jewels and romance; George was struck by its poverty.
Returning to Philadelphia, he became a printer's apprentice. He went to New York where he saw, for the first time, ''the shocking contrast between monstrous wealth and debasing want.'' In 1858, he joined the crew of a ship sailing around the Cape Horn because it was the only way he could afford to get to California. In San Francisco, he edited a newspaper; it soon failed. He spent most of his life editing newspapers, and, as with every other industry in the 19th century, many of them failed. In 1865, George was reduced to begging in the streets.
The 19th century was the Age of Progress: the steam engine, the power loom, the railroad. (Awestruck wonder at progress animated that era the way the obsession with innovation animates American politics today.) George believed that the other side of progress was poverty. The railroad crossed the continent in 1869. From the West, George wrote an essay called ''What the Railroad Will Bring Us.'' His answer: the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. In a Fourth of July oration in 1877, George declared, ''no nation can be freer than its most oppressed, richer than its poorest, wiser than its most ignorant.''
In 1879, George finished a draft of his most important book. ''Discovery upon discovery, and invention after invention, have neither lessened the toil of those who most need respite, nor brought plenty to the poor,'' George wrote. He thought the solution was to abolish all taxes on labor and instead impose a single tax, on land. He sent the manuscript to New York. When no one would publish it, he set the type himself and begged publishers simply to ink his plates. The book, ''Progress and Poverty,'' sold three million copies.
George was neither a socialist nor a communist; he influenced Tolstoy but he disagreed with Marx. He saw himself as defending ''the Republicanism of Jefferson and the Democracy of Jackson.'' He had a bit of Melville in him (the sailor) and some of Thoreau (''We do not ride on the railroad,'' Thoreau wrote from Walden. ''It rides upon us.'') But, really, he was a Tocquevillian. Tocqueville believed that democracy in America was made possible by economic equality: people with equal estates will eventually fight for, and win, equal political rights. George agreed. But he thought that speculative, industrial capitalism was destroying democracy by making economic equality impossible. A land tax would solve all.
In 1886, George decided to run for mayor of New York. Democrats urged him not to, telling him he had no chance and would only raise hell. ''You have relieved me of embarrassment,'' George answered. ''I do not want the responsibility and the work of the office of the Mayor of New York, but I do want to raise hell.'' The Democrat, Abram Hewitt, won, but George got more votes than the Republican, Theodore Roosevelt.
In the 1880s, George campaigned for the single tax, free trade and ballot reform. The last succeeded. George is why, on Election Day, your polling place supplies you with a ballot that you mark in secret. This is known as an Australian ballot, and George brought it back from his voyage halfway around the world.
George ran for mayor of New York again in 1897 but died in his bed four days before the election. His body lay in state at Grand Central. More than 100,000 mourners came to pay their respects. The New York Times said, ''Not even Lincoln had a more glorious death.'' And then: he was left behind.
Even Clarence Darrow, who admired him, recanted. ''The error I found in the philosophy of Henry George,'' Darrow wrote, ''was its cocksureness, its simplicity, and the small value that it placed on the selfish motives of men.''
The economist hadn't accounted for greed.

HEADLINE: The Default Choice, So Hard to Resist

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the wide-open Web, choice and competition are said to be merely ''one click away,'' to use Google's favorite phrase. But in practice, the power of digital distribution channels, default product settings and traditional human behavior often matters most.
In a Senate hearing last month about Google, Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, pointed to that reality in his testimony. ''If competition really were just 'one click away,' as Google suggests,'' he said, ''why have they invested so heavily to be the default choice on Web browsers and mobile phones?'' 
''Clearly,'' he added, ''they are not taking any chances.''
Indeed, Google made a big bet early in its history: In 2002, it reached a deal with AOL, guaranteeing a payment of $50 million to come from advertising revenue if AOL made Google its automatic first-choice search engine -- the one shown to users by default. Today, Google pays an estimated $100 million a year to Mozilla, coming from shared ad revenue, to be the default search engine on Mozilla's popular Firefox Web browser in the United States and other countries. Google has many such arrangements with Web sites.
Most economists agree that Google's default deals aren't anticompetitive. Rivals like Bing, the general search engine from Microsoft, and partial competitors like Yelp, an online review and listing service for local businesses, have their own Web sites and other paths of distribution. Choice, in theory, is one click away.
But most people, of course, never make that single click. Defaults win.
The role of defaults in steering decisions is by no means confined to the online world. For behavioral economists, psychologists and marketers, defaults are part of a rich field of study that explores ''decision architecture'' -- how a choice is presented or framed. The field has been popularized by the 2008 book ''Nudge,'' by Richard H. Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago and a frequent contributor to the Sunday Business section, and Cass R. Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who is now on leave and is working for the Obama administration. Nudges are default choices.
In decision-making, examples of the default preference abound: Workers are far more likely to save in retirement plans if enrollment is the automatic option. And the percentage of pregnant women tested for H.I.V. in some African nations where AIDS is widespread has surged since the test became a regular prenatal procedure and women had to opt out if they didn't want it.
A study published in 2003 showed that while large majorities of Americans approved of organ donations, only about a quarter consented to donate their own. By contrast, nearly all Austrians, French and Portuguese consent to donate theirs. The default explains the difference. In the United States, people must choose to become an organ donor. In much of Europe, people must choose not to donate.
Defaults, according to economists and psychologists, frame how a person is presented with a choice. But they say there are other forces that make the default path hard to resist. One is natural human inertia, or laziness, that favors making the quick, easy choice instead of exerting the mental energy to make a different one. Another, they say, is that most people perceive a default as an authoritative recommendation.
''All those work, and that is why defaults are so powerful,'' says Eric J. Johnson, a professor at the Columbia Business School and co-director of the university's Center for Decision Sciences.
THE default values built into product designs can be particularly potent in the infinitely malleable medium of software, and on the Internet, where a software product or service can be constantly fine-tuned.
''Computing allows you to slice and dice choices in so many ways,'' says Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. ''Those design choices also shape our social, cultural and economic choices in ways most people don't appreciate or understand.''
Default design choices play a central role in the debate over the privacy issues raised by marketers' tracking of online consumer behavior. The Federal Trade Commission is considering what rules should limit how much online personal information marketers can collect, hold and pass along to other marketers -- and whether those rules should be government regulations or self-regulatory guidelines.
Privacy advocates want tighter curbs on gathering online behavioral data, and want marketers to have to ask consumers to collect and share their information, presumably in exchange for discount offers or extra services. Advertisers want a fairly free hand to track online behavior, and to cut back only if consumers choose to opt out.
New research by a team at Carnegie Mellon University suggests the difficulty that ordinary users have in changing the default settings on Internet browsers or in configuring software tools for greater online privacy. The project, called ''Why Johnny Can't Opt Out,'' has just been completed and the results have not yet been published. Forty-five people of various backgrounds and ages in the Pittsburgh area were recruited for the study.
To qualify as research subjects, they had to be frequent Internet users and express an interest in learning about protecting their privacy online. Each was interviewed for 90 minutes, and each watched a video showing how online behavioral advertising works.
Then, each person was given a laptop computer and told to set privacy settings as he or she preferred, using one of nine online tools. The tools included the privacy options on browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and online programs like Ghostery and Adblock Plus, as well as Consumer Choice from the Digital Advertising Alliance.
The privacy tools typically proved too complicated and confusing to serve the needs of rank-and-file Internet users.
''The settings they chose didn't block as much as they thought they were blocking, often blocking nothing,'' says Lorrie Faith Cranor, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon who led the research.
Ms. Cranor says the research points to the need to simplify privacy software to few choices. ''If you turn it on, it should be pretty privacy-protective,'' she says. ''The defaults are crucial.''

HEADLINE: Maybe Teach Them Math, Science and Chess

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
The 120 elementary school children sat so quietly and intently that you might have assumed this was a mass detention period.
But it was chess, not confinement, in an Oak Brook hotel ballroom on Columbus Day. And the lessons learned might assist school leaders everywhere, including those attempting a systemwide resuscitation for Rahm Emanuel, Chicago's very disciplined, if impatient, mayor.
''My dream is to get in front of education decision makers and convince them to make chess part of the curriculum for K through second grade,'' said Susan Polgar, the star of the show. ''That's when thinking patterns and habits are formed. It should be mandatory, like physical education.'' 
Ms. Polgar, 42, was a Hungarian chess prodigy taught by her psychologist father after she stumbled on chess pieces in a closet at home. At age 4, she stunned Budapest by winning the 11-and-under category in the city championships, sitting on phone books and pillows to reach across the board.
She was the first woman to become a grandmaster and the first to qualify, in 1996, for what was still known as the Men's World Championship. She was one of the three highest-ranked female players for more than two decades, traveling the world and winding up fluent in seven languages.
I'd made my way to the Susan Polgar Foundation's World Open Championship for Boys and Girls with an ulterior motive: to explore why boys dominate every class or tournament to which chess-ignorant me has taken my 7-year-old son.
''It's interesting,'' said Ms. Polgar. ''Socially, I think, they're not supported enough, so in general girls drop out of chess by fourth and fifth grades,'' she said as 5-to-9-year-olds competed nearby.
When she was a girl, ''it was very much ingrained that women were not able to play,'' Ms. Polgar said. ''A lot of experts and elite players believed that we were not physically able to do it, our brain was not big enough or that we couldn't keep quiet long enough.''
She became an advocate for girls, especially through the Susan Polgar Foundation, which she founded while living in New York. She's now in Lubbock, Tex., with her husband and their two children, where she runs the Susan Polgar Institute for Chess Excellence at Texas Tech University.
The foundation supports chess for boys and girls, but especially girls, and sponsors events nationwide. The institute lures young players, with the university offering scholarships and excelling in college tournaments.
Ms. Polgar's mantra is that chess teaches discipline, analytical thinking, time management, focus and patience -- skills that can be useful throughout life. She cites countries, like Armenia, where chess is either a mandatory part of school curriculums, especially in the early elementary years, or strongly encouraged.
It cuts across socioeconomic divides, exemplified by impressive performances of high-poverty students in Brownsville, Tex., who have whipped privileged Manhattan rivals -- ''kids who get individual lessons from grandmasters,'' she said -- and shown how ''a boost in self-confidence can change lives.''
Indeed, there is no shortage of hedge fund managers and corporate leaders who are chess players, some of whom link the habits of mind learned at chess with their success. As we fret about China's economic success, we might note that it's a growing chess force, including four female world champions in 20 years.
Last week's tournament in Oak Brook brought children from all over the country; perhaps 70 percent were boys. Many of the children were Asian-Americans, including Ashley Ceohas, 6, of Wilmette, the child of a Chinese-American mother who smilingly swore to me that she was ''not a Tiger mom!'' as her daughter segued from a chess match to drawing a crowd as she played a nearby piano beautifully.
''She's aware of there being more boy players,'' said her mother, Yijia Ceohas. ''But we tell her anything boys can do, girls can do better. And she knows that Susan Polgar's dad said geniuses are not born but made through hard work.''
My investigation into the gender divide led me to Shiva Maharaj, a private investor who teaches the game throughout the Chicago area, including a free Saturday morning session that my son has attended at the Edgebrook Library on the Northwest Side.
Mr. Maharaj had students competing in Oak Brook and cited an American Girl mentality of parents, referring to the store that sells high-priced dolls and accessories. He sees the parents succumbing to cultural stereotypes of daughters being pretty rather than intellectually empowered.
I've watched him teach diverse groups of children, mostly boys, and effectively insist they sit up straight, concentrate, take time to assess problems critically and learn to deal with losing. He offers seemingly creative solutions to challenges faced on the board.
On the heels of the impressive inaugural Chicago Ideas Week, here's a free idea for its energetic, ambitious promoters: a panel next year on ''American Education: Should We Make a Move to Chess?''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Wall Street Protest

 BODY:
Is the perceived lack of a clear leader and agenda a shortcoming, or a key to the movement's appeal? Readers are divided.
To the Editor:
As a student of political science, I find that the Occupy Wall Street protests are missing a political window of opportunity. The absence of clear leaders prevents coordination with people who could actually help bring about political change. Having a large mass of unidentified people discussing their concerns is a great blog or Tumblr technique, but in the practical political arena it just lends itself to confusion and the lack of a clear message.
Occupy Wall Street needs to turn a social and Internet phenomenon into a tangible political movement that would benefit the ''99 percent'' it says it is representing. The Declaration of the Occupation of New York, issued on Sept. 29, lists many grievances against corporations, including illegal foreclosures, exorbitant bonuses, workplace discrimination, job outsourcing, anti-union tactics and campaign contributions.
The protest needs leaders who will put forth concrete policy solutions to these problems. Their agenda should include these reforms: 
Campaign finance reform, including a constitutional amendment in response to the Citizens United decision.
Tougher financial legislation than Dodd-Frank, whose most salient reform components, like size limits on financial institutions, never made it into the final bill.
Assistance for students who are unable to pay back their college loans.
Stronger protection of the rights of unions and minorities in the workplace.
I am afraid that without a clear agenda, leaders or policy goals, Occupy Wall Street will be a fruitless exercise with only a sense of nostalgia (or annoyance) for those involved.
ERIN BOHANAN Boston, Oct. 11, 2011
The writer is studying toward a Ph.D. in political theory at Boston University.
Readers React
If Occupy Wall Street were an isolated phenomenon, I might agree with Ms. Bohanan that it ''will be a fruitless exercise.'' But the protests have struck a deep vein of dissent in America, as the many new occupations prove.
It is a classic defense of the status quo to complain that a movement does not have a cohesive ''agenda.'' It is not the Occupy movement's job to advance a specific agenda. Its job is to make people wake up to the inequities in American society today. And its job is to inspire us to do something about it. I would say the participants are doing a heck of a job.
LINDY GIFFORD Damariscotta, Me., Oct. 12, 2011
It's amazing that so many people, like Ms. Bohanan, have transposed their agendas onto the protesters at Occupy Wall Street. The protesters have become ciphers for liberals, conservatives and everything in between. Perhaps their anonymity is their real power.
If leaders eventually emerge, they will come under intensive scrutiny by the media and the chattering classes. The same holds true for any sort of policy solutions that Occupy Wall Street may put forth. Right now, everyone is talking about the protesters, and their very presence is speaking quite loudly.
Look at their signs that say the 99 percent versus the 1 percent. Most of us in the 99 percent are saying, ''Thank you for representing us and just being there in person.'' The 1 percent is unnerved by the protesters, and that is quite enough.
JOHN GILLILAND Fleming Island, Fla., Oct. 12, 2011
As a recent college graduate who has spent the last two years fighting to find work, I'm every bit as mad as the folks down at Zuccotti Park. But my anger deserves substance, and that is where the Occupy Wall Street movement has fallen flat. The demonstrations are a vague and listless attack on a hollow symbol.
What are the protesters for? What are they against? What are their goals? Being ''anti-Wall Street'' is hardly a platform. Their lack of message is an embarrassment to those of us who yearn for tangible reform in this country.
Ms. Bohanan is spot on with her suggestions, but I question whether the political will exists in this country to enact them. At the end of the day, that is what we should all be protesting -- the utter cowardice shown by our political class as the American dream rapidly recedes into a faint memory.
ADAM SALBERG Chappaqua, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2011
The Occupy Wall Street protest is far from lacking a ''clear message.'' I have found that we participants are quite unified in our message -- that the financial system is predatory, the economic inequality in our nation is too extreme and the corporate influence over our government must be removed.
I would urge Ms. Bohanan to engage with these demonstrations directly, if she hasn't done so already, and not to rely on impressions given by the media. What she will find will no doubt surprise her, and millions of other Americans, should they dare to look.
DOMINIC QUINTANA Astoria, Queens, Oct. 12, 2011
Ms. Bohanan's proposed list of demands seems to be a rehash of the standard left-wing issues, with the addition of debt forgiveness for students.
Some of us, myself included, support real change in America, but her list leaves most Americans out of the equation. Why should only the rights of union workers and minorities be more strongly protected? Shouldn't every worker's rights be protected more strongly?
How come only students should receive assistance for debt? Why not everyone with debt?
Any change that Occupy Wall Street hopes to achieve has to embrace the needs of every American; otherwise it is just one more self-centered special interest group.
ROBERT CICERO Tuckahoe, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2011
As a fellow political scientist, I applaud Ms. Bohanan's effort to critically engage with Occupy Wall Street. But her focus on admonishing the protesters to designate a leader and agree on a platform has led her to miss the most potentially transformative elements of the movement.
The General Assembly at Zuccotti Park is structured to allow participants to arrive at decisions through consensus. A central aim of this arrangement is to avoid the subtle processes of domination by small factions and dogmatic leaders that have undermined many emerging social movements.
As a result, Ms. Bohanan's suggestion that Occupy Wall Street transform itself into a ''tangible political movement'' has the potential to undermine the protesters' aim of using direct democracy to radically change how citizens engage in the political process.
RYAN SHEELY Boston, Oct. 12, 2011
The writer is an assistant professor of public policy at Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
Let's give the Occupy Wall Street protesters a break and stop demanding that they come up with a more ''focused'' and ''coherent'' agenda. Vietnam War protesters did just fine with stop the war and get out of Vietnam. Occupy Wall Street is doing just fine with stop the greed and get out of our pockets.
The day President Obama stands up -- preferably among the protesters on Wall Street -- and states unequivocally that he counts himself among the 99 percenters will be the day he ensures his re-election.
LUCIAN K. TRUSCOTT IV Franklin, Tenn., Oct. 12, 2011
The Writer Responds
Mr. Quintana says there are three unifying messages of the protesters, but as we have seen and heard, if you were to ask another person you might receive a different answer. Having a unified message is a first step; proposing a feasible political solution is the next.
I assure Mr. Cicero that the agenda I put forth was not meant to be exhaustive, but more of a guideline.
Professor Sheely makes an excellent point: the protesters may hope to use direct democracy to radically change how citizens engage in the political process. In Federalist Paper No. 10, James Madison warns of the dangers of pure or direct democracy because of the inability to protect individual liberties from majority rule.
In response to Mr. Truscott, the agenda of the Vietnam War protesters was to stop the war and remove the troops -- clearly defined and obtainable objectives. ''Stop the greed'' and ''get out of our pockets'' are euphemisms for vague objectives.
Without leaders, an agenda or goals, the protesters are not students of the Arab Spring they were inspired by; they are merely imitators of something they do not understand.

HEADLINE: Joshua Stein

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Stein, 56, is a commercial real estate lawyer and the sole proprietor of the law firm that bears his name. Before starting the firm over a year ago, he was a partner in the Real Estate Practice Group in the New York office of Latham & Watkins.
Mr. Stein specializes in financing and land leases and has also written five books on commercial real estate. 
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO
Q So it's been just over a year since you started your firm.
A Aug. 1, 2010, was the first day of the new practice. The last day at the old firm was July 31, 2010. I jumped right into it.
Q You were with Latham & Watkins for 23 years. Why did you leave?
A It was a lot of things. I kind of had my run with a large firm. I wasn't sure, really, that the real estate practice that I've been doing at Latham -- and that I'm doing now -- was a good match for a big global law firm.
There were certain kinds of work that I couldn't really do there -- like expert witness work, arbitration work, receivership, which just does not fit in with a large firm. I decided that my practice will probably work better with just me.
Q How big is the firm?
A I'm the principal, and the sole member. I have other attorneys working for me -- it's been typically three -- on an hourly basis. I have one guy working for me answering the phone, dealing with computers and mail.
Q Have some of your old clients followed you to your new firm?
A Yes, most of the clients I worked with. The clients who followed me tended to be the clients that I had brought to the firm almost entirely.
Q Who are some of these clients?
A AvalonBay is one; Credit Agricole is another. I represent landlords, developers, lenders and retailers. The largest client right now is a new client that came to me after I moved, for whom I've been doing a major development -- a ground-up project in Queens.
Q Can you tell me more about the project?
A I cannot identify at this point the client or the transaction. There's a principle in real estate: if you know two or three pieces of information about a transaction, you can usually guess what it is.
I'm doing the financing, the acquisition, joint venture, leasing issues -- the whole nine yards.
Q Your specialty, though, is financing.
A I'm identified primarily for financing, but also ground leases, hotels and then I also do joint ventures and space leases. If you look at all the books I've done, my biggest book -- the thickest book -- is called ''Stein on New York Commercial Mortgage Transactions.''
Q Speaking of financing, how would you assess the lending markets these days?
A They are loosening up very selectively. The New York market generally is doing better than all the other markets in the country.
If you have a 50 percent loan-to-value on a super-high-quality project in Midtown Manhattan, the lenders will be tripping over each other to finance that asset at very favorable rates. If you have the second- or third-tier shopping center in Wichita, Kan., or a lousy apartment building in one of the boroughs, you're not going to have as much interest.
Q Are you still doing many loan modifications or workouts?
A It hasn't died out completely. I think what has happened in the world of loan modifications and workouts is the servicers by and large have adopted the strategy of kicking the can down the road -- amend and extend and pretend -- and largely that strategy has worked. So far. Now if we have another recession, that strategy could stop working.
Q Are most clients in New York?
A I guess mostly in New York.
Q What are your goals for growing the firm?
A I don't have any yet. My initial goal was to open the practice and bring in some good clients that I liked working for.
Q You have five books published, along with dozens of articles on commercial real estate law. How do you find the time to write?
A When I used to live in a distant suburb -- in Goldens Bridge, near Katonah -- I did almost all of my writing on the train. But since I moved into the city in '05, it's a little harder to write. I have to carve out time on the weekend.
Q Do you ever do any other kind of writing?
A My ex-wife and my daughters think that my next book should be about real estate fraud, and it should be a novel and spin together various things that I've seen.
It'll be interesting, but the problem is, it needs to have things like a plot and character development, and I've never really done that.

HEADLINE: One Day, Maybe, Artisanal Train Cars

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Among the 275 tenants filling four million square feet of leasable space at the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- now in the midst of its biggest expansion since World War II -- are any number of industries that do not easily evoke the imagery of ''On the Waterfront.'' These are businesses where fine art is warehoused, where antiques are restored, where jewelry and leather garments are made -- where the prosperous life, so much and so misleadingly in evidence in modern New York, receives its methodical upkeep. 
Steiner Studios, the film and television production facility, and the most visible occupant, has given New York its own version of Burbank, and more than that, a factory for reproducing the city's glittering, millennial self-image. Since the studio opened seven years ago, it has been home to movies and television series set in the world of high-end Manhattan real estate brokers (''Did You Hear About the Morgans?''), high-end Manhattan plaintiffs' lawyers (''Damages'') and high-end Manhattan maternity (''Baby Mama,'' ''The Nanny Diaries''). In the middle of the last century, it would have been possible to arrive for work at the Navy Yard to build an ice breaker barge. Today it is possible to show up and light the sets for the fourth season of ''The Celebrity Apprentice.''
All employment is good employment, obviously -- 5,800 people work at the Navy Yard today -- but the transition carries a powerful symbolism. Before the decommissioning of the yard in 1966 by Robert McNamara, then the secretary of defense, it employed 9,000 workers and stood as the oldest continually active industrial plant in the state. In 1938, an even greater number, 10,000, were employed on its grounds, a third of them through the Works Progress Administration.
Poignantly, the spirit of the W.P.A. hovered over a conference that took place at the Navy Yard a few weeks ago, one that sought to capitalize on the resonance of its location's history and offer a vision of something new. It was called Building the Future and sponsored by a coalition of union interests, policy organizations and sustainable-living advocates. The participants called for a large-scale initiative to expand transit manufacturing in the state and city. Why couldn't our brake parts and headlights and signal equipment, even our rail cars and buses, be made here?
The argument forged was at once dreamy and entirely persuasive: From 2000 to 2009, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was responsible for nearly a third of all buses, subway cars and commuter trains bought in the United States. Its current $23 billion capital program involves the acquisition of more than $7 billion worth of train cars, buses and signaling and communications equipment. These are not indulgent expenses: The signal system at the West Fourth Street subway station, for example, has not been replaced since 1932. About a third of the city's buses are at least 12 years old -- their official life span -- while others, as Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, told me, ''are not in the greatest shape -- they've stayed too long at the fair.''
Economists say a healthy capacity for increased transit manufacturing exists across the state and in the city, including at repair facilities in Coney Island and at the 207th Street Yard in Manhattan (where subway cars were still being made in the early '90s) and potentially amid the vast industrial shells at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. New York City Transit recently awarded a $115 million contract to New Flyer, a bus manufacturing company in Minnesota, for a series of compressed-natural-gas buses; only 13.8 percent of the materials used to produce them will have been made in New York State.
The most obvious benefit of producing buses and G trains in relative proximity to where one might catch them is the potential to have a real impact on unemployment. The transit authority's previous capital program, of $21.2 billion and spanning the period from 2005 to 2009, resulted in more than 324,000 jobs in the state, nearly two-thirds of them in New York City.
At the conference, John Samuelsen, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, who eight days later would deliver a rousing speech at the Occupy Wall Street protest on behalf of working families, made the simple but meaningful case that people using the transit system should be the people making the transit system. ''We have the talent to do to this; we have full-blown engineers now doing signal work because they can't find jobs,'' he said.
Upstate, the fate of factories that produce mass transit vehicles and components rises and falls on investment by the authority. The Canadian company Bombardier employed 1,000 workers in Plattsburgh, N.Y., in 1999 when it was making R-142 subway cars for the city and coaches for Metro-North. Now reliant on an order from the Chicago Transit Authority, it employs only 230 people there. Alstom, a French company, had 1,000 employees in its Hornell, N.Y., plant three years ago when it was still producing some of the 382 subway cars the authority had ordered in 2002, as well as Long Island Rail Road cars. Only 75 employees are there today.
The impediment to all of this sensible thinking around transit manufacturing is, of course, financing: With a $10 billion budget gap, the authority, in awful shape, is attempting to sustain itself with cuts to its capital plan and the issuing of ever more debt. The substance of Building the Future's proposals can be realized only with significant public spending, which is forever diminishing. In the past three decades, contributions from the city and state have decreased to 2 percent of the authority's capital program from a total of 29 percent.
The value of a well-maintained and high-functioning public transit system -- vital to people, vital to the economic ecosystem -- would seem self-evident; the value of ambitious job creation, equally so. In a sense, another obstacle to these plans is cultural: the romance much of the country still has with American manufacturing doesn't really hold sway in New York, where love affairs, now, are more likely to be forged with the artisanal pickler, the imaginative sausage-maker, the emigre in Red Hook who would seem to possess a doctorate in mahogany. New York would do well to revitalize (and glamorize) old-school labor; the city should feel more hospitable to working people than it looks.

HEADLINE: Wall Street, With Calm, Not Hysteria

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
ON the day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, shattering confidence in the banking system and sending the stock market into a tailspin, the trading floor at the firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters appeared surprisingly calm. Bankers conferred in whispers; some quietly fiddled with resumes. The only obvious signs of tumult were the television news trucks parked outside.
I happened to be there that morning in 2008, not as a banker but a trespasser: a reporter covering Wall Street, I had sneaked into the building with the help of a trusted source. As I avoided security guards and surreptitiously filed reports from a men's-room stall, what struck me most was the absence of panic, the strange stillness that seemed to permeate the place: the melancholy silence of a once-great global corporation staring into the void. 
Wall Street movies, which must find entertainment in ticker symbols and balance sheets, tend to fall somewhat short of Wall Street reality, where millions of dollars can be won and lost with all the pomp of a mouse click. Filmmakers like Oliver Stone and others have tried to inject a palpable sense of the underlying stakes. Think of the mano a mano Blue Star Airlines fight in Mr. Stone's ''Wall Street,'' the glamorous merger in ''Working Girl,'' or the commodities frenzy at the end of ''Trading Places.''
Then there's the new film ''Margin Call,'' which recounts 24 hours in the life (and near death) of an unnamed firm facing a Lehman-like crisis. It may be one of the quietest films about Wall Street ever made.
Its showdowns take place not on Hamptons estates or at motorcycle races but in sterile boardrooms, where lives and careers are upended in muted conversation. It forgoes screaming-on-the-phone scenes for coolly lighted images of traders calmly working their desks. Gordon Gekko, this is not. And that's fine with J. C. Chandor, the film's first-time writer and director, who was never aiming for the master-of-the-universe approach.
''You walk onto most trading floors, and the more tense things get, the quieter they become,'' Mr. Chandor said over lunch the other day. Pausing for a laugh, he added later: ''It is sort of a challenge! It's not very exciting visually, a bunch of people stressing out.''
''Margin Call,'' which Mr. Chandor, 37, wrote in the days after Lehman failed, was an effort to understand the human side of a financial crisis, or as he put it, ''the decision-making process that got us into this mess.'' The idea was to avoid oversimplification. ''Everything in my gut said don't lie here,'' he said. At the same time, he told himself, ''Don't blow this up into something that it isn't.''
Other cinematic takes on the financial crisis have aimed for grander themes. Mr. Stone made ''Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps'' as a morality tale, pitting Good against Gekko. Like the original ''Wall Street,'' with its pro-labor overtones, it also served as something of a liberal manifesto against the evils of unchecked capitalism and consumption. The more recent ''Too Big to Fail,'' an adaptation of Andrew Ross Sorkin's play-by-play account of the Lehman collapse, tried to make an action hero of Henry M. Paulson, the former treasury secretary -- perhaps the ultimate in Hollywood fantasy.
Mr. Chandor said his approach ''doesn't mean there isn't a great truth'' to those other films. ''But they are a little bit amped up.''
In its attention to human fears and foibles, ''Margin Call'' resembles a higher-end version of ''Boiler Room,'' also a low-budget Wall Street film, but one set in the unsavory world of penny stocks. Yet Ben Younger, that film's writer and director, laughed at the idea of another stock-market-related film.
''I'm frankly surprised they're still making them,'' Mr. Younger said. ''Between 'Wall Street,' 'Boiler Room,' 'Wall Street 2' and then 'Too Big to Fail,' I felt that kind of covered every iteration of a finance movie.''
For Mr. Younger, the inevitability of financial folly -- and real bankers' odd veneration of ostensibly evil characters like Gekko, an irony he highlighted in ''Boiler Room'' -- has turned him sour.
''These people keep taking advantage of the system, and we keep getting burned,'' he said. ''What else is left to explore? It's in the headlines every day, and nothing else seems to change.''
''Margin Call'' did not stem from a desire to indict the system. Somewhat akin to Mr. Stone, the son of a stockbroker, Mr. Chandor grew up watching his father, a Merrill Lynch investment banker, muddle through the day-to-day challenges of a career on Wall Street.
''He was a lifer,'' Mr. Chandor said of his father, who recently retired. ''I was watching that human side of it: when you're depressed, when you're not depressed, when you're up or down.''
A realistic film also fit with Mr. Chandor's realistic budget: a former director of commercials who briefly detoured into real estate, he was doubtful that he would have much money to play with: ''How do you tell a story about one of the biggest global things that's happened in the last 15 or 20 years for under a million bucks?''
The budget ended up at $3.5 million, after the project was picked up by Before the Door Pictures, the actor Zachary Quinto's production company. It helped attract a cast of name actors, including Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci, in addition to Mr. Quinto (''Star Trek''), who plays a junior bank analyst.
''A lot of what our film is really exploring is that it's easy to vilify, it's easy to moralize and judge and blame people for what happened,'' Mr. Quinto said. ''And not inappropriately, completely! But there's also a whole swath of people who were just doing their jobs, who weren't complicit in the decision-making process that led to all of this.''
So is this supposed to be Requiem for a Banker? ''It was a little more complicated,'' Mr. Quinto said. ''I knew I came out of it with a strong intention to not invest in the stock market, that's for sure.''
Peter Sullivan, Mr. Quinto's character, is the one who discovers the sour assets that may doom the company. Though he spends much of the film wondering whether the world of seven-figure paychecks is worth saving, it's fair to say Peter is no Bud Fox, the ''Wall Street'' character who is slugged by his boss, Gordon Gekko, while wearing a wire for the feds.
''He has a deeply rooted moral ambiguity about it,'' said Mr. Quinto, who added that he and the filmmaker discussed his character's arc at length. ''It was hard for me as an actor to reconcile Peter's choices.''
Yet those contradictions were among the reasons that Mr. Quinto and his colleagues backed the project. ''We want to generate those kinds of conversations that make people think,'' he said.
''Margin Call'' happened to be screening around the corner from the old Lehman offices, and I stopped by for a look. The building is now festooned with the logos of Barclays, which acquired Lehman after its bankruptcy, and the trading floor was filled with a new crop of bankers, plugging away at their desks. It looked a lot like business as usual.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 16, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 10 this weekend about the new Wall Street movie ''Margin Call'' reverses the names of the two characters in the 1987 movie ''Wall Street'' who slugged each other in a scene in Central Park. It was Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Gekko, who punched Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just the Currency

 BODY:
The Senate's vote on Tuesday to punish China for cheapening its currency is not likely to persuade Beijing to change its ways. On Thursday, the renminbi actually fell more against the dollar. If the currency bill were to become law -- a long shot given opposition by Republican leaders in the House -- the more likely response from China would be some form of trade policy retaliation.
That is not an argument for doing nothing. But the United States and its allies need to find better ways to persuade China to change policies that are both battering the global economy and damaging its own development. 
An artificially cheap currency is hurting China in many ways. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that it costs China's central bank $240 billion a year -- more than its entire trade surplus -- because it requires amassing huge reserves in dollars that are gradually losing value against the renminbi. And to buy United States Treasury bonds for its reserves, the central bank must issue domestic bonds that pay a higher rate of interest, losing money in the process.
This leads to other costs. To keep domestic interest rates as low as possible in order to reduce its losses, the central bank has forced bank deposit rates below the inflation rate, eating into the savings of ordinary Chinese and inhibiting spending. The cheap currency also drives inflation by making imports more expensive. And low interest rates are creating a bubble in housing and corporate investment.
For all these costs, China gets remarkably few jobs from its export-led strategy, which increasingly relies on mechanization to produce more sophisticated goods. Employment has grown by only 1 percent per year since 2004 despite G.D.P. growth of 10 percent.
And an export-dependent strategy is not sustainable with faltering global demand. China's exports fell in the third quarter, suggesting foreign consumers are too spent to keep buying even China's artificially cheap goods and keep sustaining China's growth.
For China to develop further, it must rely more on its own consumers to buy its products and services. To get its citizens to spend more, the government must go beyond undoing the financial distortions -- like artificially depressed interest rates that encourage huge savings. It should invest more in social goods, like its pension and health insurance programs, to encourage families to reduce their just-in-case savings and spend more.
Many Chinese officials realize this. In fact, ''rebalancing'' the economy is a prominent goal in China's new five-year economic plan. The currency has been allowed to rise 7 percent against the dollar since June of 2010. Yet in late August the rise slowed to a virtual halt. Analysts fear that China is returning to its old playbook to support its exports amid a faltering global economy.
We have no sympathy for the desire of China's autocrats to stifle political freedoms, but their fear that a swift change in course could lead to social and political upheaval is legitimate. Even if China's leaders were persuaded of the need to change, it could not happen overnight. If the currency rose too fast, it would slash exports, bankrupt many firms and increase joblessness. Other needed components of reform -- like raising interest rates and freeing credit from state control -- could bankrupt firms and banks if done too abruptly.
In June, a report by the International Monetary Fund argued that, alone, a 20 percent revaluation of the Chinese currency would do little to improve the trade balances of its largest trading partners, including the United States. It recommended a reform package for China that included letting the renminbi rise at a brisker pace, allowing interest rates to rise, expanding social spending and allowing workers to move freely in search of better jobs.
A more expensive renminbi is part of the answer for China and its trading partners. But the trade problem won't really be addressed until China's consumers start saving less and spending more -- including on American products.

HEADLINE: In His Shoes

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
THIS is the tale of the little stiletto that could, a shoe that in the long-ago days of the luxury-goods boom scampered to the top of a rarefied heap. It was just a handful of years ago that the name of Manolo Blahnik, a 68-year-old London cobbler born in the Canary Islands, was familiar only to hard-core fashion hunters and residents of ZIP code 10021.
Then a funny thing happened: ''Sex and the City.''
As man-crazy as the character Carrie Bradshaw was on the long-running series, she was just as obsessive about what Vanity Fair once termed every woman's favorite phallic symbol, shoes. Lust for footwear seldom featured as a continuing television plot line before the show came along. Yet such was the shoe-mania of the character played by Sarah Jessica Parker that, merely by name-checking Manolo Blahnik, she made his a household name. 
One sign of the familiarity American women developed with Blahnik's classically styled shoes -- so comfortable, some claimed, you could wear them to scale Everest -- was a 2007 survey by Women's Wear Daily and the trade journal Footwear News. In it, 37 percent of the 2,000 consumers canvassed about their buying habits conceded that they'd willingly bungee-jump off the Golden Gate Bridge in exchange for a lifetime supply of Manolos.
And if they had, they probably would have met Manolo on the way down.
Soon after the 2007 survey appeared, Mr. Blahnik's name and label took a style dive, his often kittenish designs supplanted by the more aggressive efforts of a new crop of shoemakers, people like Nicholas Kirkwood, Brian Atwood and Christian Louboutin.
It was Mr. Louboutin who most effectively hijacked Manolo Blahnik's thunder and a chunk of his market, using an arsenal of gaud and ostentation, shoes that came studded, strapped, buckled and fur-covered and that were also made instantly identifiable by his signature red soles. (The same soles have embroiled him in a long-running trademark infringement dispute with the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent.)
Unlike Mr. Blahnik, Mr. Louboutin seemed to revel in borderline vulgarity. What, after all, is a red sole but an update on the comedian Minnie Pearl's custom of wearing her hat with the price tag attached? ''It was a chic idea for a minute,'' said George Malkemus, president of Manolo Blahnik U.S.A. ''You wore a red sole, and everyone knew you spent $1,200 or $1,400 for your shoes. And I would say there was a period when certain customers abandoned us and moved into that world.''
Even among those closely associated with the iconic Blahnik shoe there was a sense that the tide had shifted. A time came, Ms. Parker said, ''when Manolo wasn't defining the aesthetic,'' when Blade Runner styles took over from smart patent pumps, and wearing Manolos was almost like announcing one had turned in one's coquette card and started taking style cues from Judge Judy.
Mr. Blahnik, notoriously indifferent to fashion trends, stayed true to an aesthetic that he said was formed in his 1950s boyhood by women like Audrey Hepburn and the ultra-elegant model Dovima, nee Dorothy Juba. ''The gimmicky thing I'm not very keen on,'' Mr. Blahnik said last week from London. ''I've never been tempted to do these hideous furniture shoes.''
But fashion, as we all know, is nothing if not fickle; Heidi Klum is merely reporting fact when she notes each week on ''Project Runway'' that one day you're in and the next day you're out. So it should come as no surprise that, suddenly, signs are everywhere that Blahnik is back in style.
When Kate Moss married last summer, she was shod in a pair of classic Manolos. When Ms. Parker was photographed in a multipage page pictorial for last August's Vogue, she wore Manolo's BB pump exclusively. When Marc Jacobs showed his spring 2012 collection last month in New York, he paid sly homage to Manolo and the designer's classic high-heel Mary-Janes.
And at the recent spring 2012 shows in Paris, the style of footwear dominating runways had a lot less in common with the stunt shoes that held sway in recent seasons -- the ones compulsively name-checked by Real Housewives and in songs by J. Lo, and that garnered Mr. Louboutin full-scale profiles in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair -- than with the simple and ladylike shoe Mr. Blahnik has designed since his competitors were in their teens.
''In the fight for the shoe summit,'' Ms. Parker said, Manolo is suddenly on top again.
The reasons seem clear. Not only did ''the cult of the ugly shoe have to end,'' as Andre Leon Talley, a contributing editor of Vogue, recently noted, but unbridled ostentatious spending has come to look a lot less chic when nearly 1 in 10 Americans is unemployed.
''Fashion had to turn on its ugly heel and return to beautiful shoes,'' Mr. Talley said, citing among the appealing elements of Manolo Blahnik shoes their sleek lines and absence of gimmickry.
''They're a staple, something you have to have in your refrigerator, like butter or milk,''' he said, or Champagne and caviar, anyway.
''Manolo's shoes are very much in the spirit of this moment's clothes, pared down, with simple lines, and I hate to say ladylike, but classic,'' said Linda Fargo, the senior vice president for women's fashion at Bergdorf Goodman, where recent deliveries of a particular Manolo Blahnik pump sold out so fast, the store was forced to institute a waiting list, that forgotten symbol of '90s excess.
''We do a very, very strong business in his shoes,'' Jonathan Joselove, senior vice president and merchandise manager for Neiman Marcus Stores, said by phone from Paris, adding that the stores have difficulty keeping certain Manolos in stock, despite a cost of $600 or more a pair. ''He knows how to make a woman look beautiful,'' Mr. Joselove said.
Understandably, most Americans might struggle to understand the irresistible allure of a shoe whose cost is equal to about a quarter of the average annual household clothes budget for a family of four. Yet for retail analysts, the current rush on Manolo Blahnik shoes is an encouraging sign for the economy, over all.
''The upper end of the market is driving much of the growth'' in retail, said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at the NPD Group, a consumer research firm. And surprisingly, despite a near constant din of doomful economic news, that market is by all accounts robust.
''Luxury is strong,'' said Mary Lou Quinlan, the chief executive of Just Ask a Woman, a marketing company with clients like Clairol and GlaxoSmithKline. ''There's an element among women who are still doing well in their jobs of, 'I deserve it, I need it, I've got to have my fix.' ''
As recently as a year ago, that shoe fix might have been delivered by Jimmy Choo, Sergio Rossi, Pierre Hardy, Brian Atwood, Walter Steiger, Nicholas Kirkwood or any of the other high-end players who got in on the lucrative market in keeping women well shod.
It might have had bondage straps or menacing spikes, ornamental elements that made it seem, during one recent season, as if Miuccia Prada had found inspiration in Rosa Klebb, Ian Fleming's Cold War villain who secreted stiletto blades in her soles.
On certain Louboutin shoes, heels rose above six inches, the better to accommodate thick wedges and platforms and to justify prices that crept toward $2,000 a pair. ''Louboutins were just so much cooler, spikier and more high-fashion,'' said the writer Molly Jong-Fast, a self-professed shoe fiend. ''If you're going to spend $800 for a pair of shoes, you want something cutting edge, not something you'll see everyone wearing at shul.''
Curiously, the reemergence of Blahnik's restrained ''classic'' styles counters an apparent trend sometimes noted by footwear historians: the more depressed the economy, the more vertiginous the shoe. ''But this recession has dragged on so long'' that the playful vulgarity of wearing sinister and gravity-defying shoes is seen as unseemly, said Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto. ''If the first wave was an overexuberant expression of wealth, the next is of ostentatious restraint.''
Or, as Ms. Quinlan of Just Ask a Woman said, ''It's tacky to strut around in your red-soled shoes when other people are trying not to get a pink slip.''
Yet it's style, and not political correctness, that is driving a return to Manolo Blahnik. ''For classic, timeless Jackie O dressing, it's always back to Manolo,'' said Lisa Bytner, a Manhattan publicist who owns 20 pairs. ''I bought Louboutins to be in on the platform fad and now they're sitting in the closet because they hurt.'' In Manolos, say fans like Ms. Bytner, ''I can jog down the street and run for a taxi.''
Why bother, Mr. Louboutin said in a recent interview timed to coincide with the release of a lavish 304-page coffee-table book (Rizzoli, $150) celebrating his designs? ''I don't have the pretensions that they are there to fulfill every need that people have,'' he told The New York Post. ''Who wants to run, anyway, really?''
Arriving for her Vogue shoot last spring, Ms. Parker entered a dressing room filled with the latest styles and a wall of shoes secured for the sitting by Tonne Goodman, a seasoned editor at Vogue. ''I walked in and looked around and saw all these shoes, and then I spotted the Manolos and it was like water in a desert,'' Ms. Parker said.
''I was just so excited to see a simple black pump.''

HEADLINE: Eyes Once on the Ticker Are Now on the Meter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
SCOTT CURTIS spent 25 years trading stocks on Wall Street before he lost his job in the recession.
Now he drives a yellow cab, not just to make a living, but also to find his next post: He hangs a hiring pitch in the back seat. ''Three interviews so far,'' he said with a grin.
At his taxi garage in the South Bronx, Mr. Curtis, 47, shares job-hunting tips with another felled financier, who drives home after shifts to Westchester County in his own car, a BMW. They wave hello to a pal, laid off from JPMorgan, who drives to help pay for her son's European study-abroad program.
It is a long slide from the trading floor to the driver's wheel of a taxicab, but these former bankers have adopted a bullish outlook on their new profession. They say taxi driving, with its flexible hours and all-cash wages, is an undervalued asset -- and an efficient way to meet potential employers face to face. 
''There are 20 million other people on Monster.com,'' said Mr. Curtis, who chats up his fares in case a chief executive or headhunter has stumbled in. ''I thought people would see this, and think, 'He'll go the extra yard to go and get a job.' ''
More accustomed to the back seat of a taxi, these cabbies are importing skills from their former world to the front seat, dressing well to impress their ''clients'' and finding ways to exploit the inefficiencies of the taxi market.
While most cabbies view the meatpacking district in Manhattan as a must for late-night fares, Herb Reyes, once a financial director at a major entertainment company, sees a market with excess supply. So he heads to the usually deserted Avenue of the Americas in Midtown, where he knows bankers who work the Asian markets will be looking for rides home.
Tough times have prompted more New Yorkers to seek financial relief and upward mobility in the taxi trade. The number of licensed city cabbies has risen by 10 percent since the stock market began its decline in late 2007, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission. License renewals are up, too, officials said, suggesting that drivers who used to move on to higher-paying jobs are sticking with the hack trade for now.
At Master Cabbie Taxi Academy in Long Island City, Queens, instructors have noticed an increase in former financial workers since the recession began. ''As they lay off, people come through,'' the owner, Terry Gelber, said. ''I haven't driven in 18 years, but somebody I drove with back then was a broker. He was back last year to get his hack license again.''
Mr. Reyes, 38, registered for a cabby license after the severance from his former job ran out. ''People weren't hiring at the salary I was making,'' he said on the phone from Westchester, where he lives with his wife and two sons, who both attend private school. ''They weren't offering jobs at a level below, or even two levels below, where I was.''
When a friend suggested he look into taxi driving, he scoffed. ''I was born and raised in the city,'' Mr. Reyes recalled saying. ''I'm not driving a cab in New York.'' But on his first night in a taxi, he cleared $180 on fares. It was a Tuesday. ''I could only imagine what Saturday and Sunday would be like,'' he said.
Passengers who climb into Mr. Curtis's cab are greeted by a laminated sheet of paper reading: ''Ask to see my resume. You won't be sorry!'' It has led to three interviews, one with a major British bank, though none has yet resulted in a job offer.
Mr. Curtis, who is hoping to land a hedge-fund position, said he decided to become a cabby after having little luck with traditional headhunters and job Web sites. ''I just figured the best way to market myself was to be driving around town with a sign that said: 'Hey, help me! I need a job!' '' he said.
Mr. Curtis, divorced with two children and living in Cliffside Park, N.J., is earning a small fraction of his former income, he said. He is asked for his resume about four times a day but acknowledges that after five months, he had hoped to already be back in an office. ''I get guys who say, 'This is ingenious!' I'm like, if I'm such a genius, why am I driving a cab?''
The stigma of the job, although softened, is not entirely gone. The JPMorgan veteran agreed to be interviewed on the condition that only her first name, Janet, be published. Her job, she said, could prompt her condo board on the Upper East Side to consider ousting her from the building.
Janet was finishing an afternoon shift the other day in her work uniform: a navy blazer, floral scarf and Ralph Lauren sunglasses. She was raised in Manhattan; cab driving was never part of the plan. ''I always thought cabdrivers were idiots,'' she said. ''I still do. If anything, that has been reaffirmed.''
The regulars at the garage in the Bronx did not think she would last a week; two years later, she is still driving. She keeps a stack of 20 resumes by the driver's seat, handing them out to passengers. One man submitted her name for three jobs at UBS, but it came to nothing.
''I wanted a job while my son was in Europe,'' she said. ''I set myself a benchmark that by the time he's back, I'd have a real job. And when he came back, and I didn't -- ''
Her voice trailed off. ''I was depressed for a week,'' she said. ''I picked up some young kids from JPMorgan, who I knew didn't know what they were talking about in the cab, but they had the job. I didn't.''
''There's a lot of people doing things now that they didn't think they'd be doing,'' Janet added.
The new crop of cabbies might do well to consider the example of a predecessor: James Williamson III, an M.B.A. graduate who gained some renown in 2008 for his own resume-in-the-backseat routine. Although his efforts earned a segment on CNN, Mr. Williamson, who studied business at La Salle University, never found a job after 18 months behind the wheel.
''I never really got any leads,'' he said on the phone from Philadelphia, where he now lives. ''It was always 'Keep your hopes up; things will work out.' And I would say, 'Are you guys hiring?' They'd say, 'Nobody's hiring.' ''
Last year, Mr. Williamson gave up his hack license after an aunt found him work as a nursing assistant. Today, he drives a van for disabled travelers. He is still looking for a professional position.

HEADLINE: The Reluctance to Invest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Deer in the Headlights, Financially Speaking'' (Economic View, Oct. 9), in which Richard H. Thaler saw a paralysis in the reluctance of individuals and businesses to invest during these uncertain times: 
The column did not discuss an important point in regard to the business side of the issue: Businesses hoard cash at their own peril. Unless they are among the very largest companies, they are essentially setting themselves up for leveraged buyouts by corporate raiders who will swoop in, relieve them of their cash and leave the bones for the vultures to pick over.
This doesn't serve the best interests of stockholders, and it doesn't bode well for millions of Americans who are employed by these companies. Nothing will stop the gold rush once it commences. I'm surprised it hasn't started already. Eric P. Jorve
Roseville, Minn., Oct. 10
To the Editor:
Richard H. Thaler wants both businesses and individuals to drop their fears of investing in the future -- even suggesting that Americans spend money now in home improvements instead of keeping savings in Treasuries or money market accounts. He also lamented a recent survey in which many companies said they were waiting for economic uncertainty to decline before deploying their huge piles of cash.
Has he dismissed a possibility that many planners, treasurers and wealthier households are considering? After the plunge in stock prices during the summer, everyone seems to be worried about long-term high unemployment, lower wages and benefit cuts. So it is possible, if not likely, that the general price level will fall, or at least not rise so much as to make a delay in investing look unwise.
There is a term for this possible state of affairs. It is not paralysis, and it is not inaction. It's deflation. Savita A. SahayShort Hills, N.J., Oct. 9
The Art of Food Ads
To the Editor:
''Grilled Chicken, That Temperamental Star'' (Oct. 9), which examined the practice of tabletop directing for food commercials, hit home with me.
After years working as a prop person for various masters of the art, I wrote a play called ''Tabletop'' that won the 2001 Drama Desk award for best ensemble performance.
Theater asks an audience to identify with characters who in some sense feel as if their lives are at stake. While one may question many aspects of television commercials, there's no doubt about the skill and determination of the people who create them or their importance to capitalist culture.
As an idealistic assistant observes in my play: ''In the 13th century, we'd be carving gargoyles on a Gothic cathedral. Well, we don't make such valuable stuff anymore. But at least we make memorable images.''

HEADLINE: In Protest, The Power Of Place

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Michael Kimmelman is the architecture critic of The New York Times.
THE ever expanding Occupy Wall Street movement, with encampments now not only in Lower Manhattan but also in Washington, London and other cities, proves among other things that no matter how instrumental new media have become in spreading protest these days, nothing replaces people taking to the streets.
Another reminder came late last week when the landlord of Zuccotti Park, where the demonstrators in New York City have settled, at the last minute withdrew a request for police assistance in cleaning up the park. This, at least temporarily, averted a confrontation in front of the global media over what protesters regarded as just a pretext to evict them.
We tend to underestimate the political power of physical places. Then Tahrir Square comes along. Now it's Zuccotti Park, until four weeks ago an utterly obscure city-block-size downtown plaza with a few trees and concrete benches, around the corner from ground zero and two blocks north of Wall Street on Broadway. A few hundred people with ponchos and sleeping bags have put it on the map. 
Kent State, Tiananmen Square, the Berlin Wall: we clearly use locales, edifices, architecture to house our memories and political energy. Politics troubles our consciences. But places haunt our imaginations.
So we check in on Facebook and Twitter, but make pilgrimages to Antietam, Auschwitz and to the Acropolis, to gaze at rubble from the days of Pericles and Aristotle.
I thought of Aristotle, of all people, while I watched the Zuccotti Park demonstrators hold one of their ''general assemblies'' the other day. In his ''Politics,'' Aristotle argued that the size of an ideal polis extended to the limits of a herald's cry. He believed that the human voice was directly linked to civic order. A healthy citizenry in a proper city required face-to-face conversation.
It so happens that near the start of the protest, when the police banned megaphones at Zuccotti Park, they obliged demonstrators to come up with an alternative. ''Mic checks'' became the consensus method of circulating announcements, spread through the crowd by people repeating, phrase by phrase, what a speaker had said to others around them, compelling everyone, as it were, to speak in one voice. It's like the old game of telephone, and it is painstakingly slow.
''But so is democracy,'' as Jay Gaussoin, a 46-year-old unemployed actor and carpenter, put it to me. ''We're so distracted these days, people have forgotten how to focus. But the 'mic check' demands not just that we listen to other people's opinions but that we really hear what they're saying because we have to repeat their words exactly.
''It requires an architecture of consciousness,'' was Mr. Gaussoin's apt phrase.
Much as it can look at a glance like a refugee camp in the early morning, when the protesters are just emerging from their sleeping bags, Zuccotti Park has in fact become a miniature polis, a little city in the making. That it happens also to be a private park is one of the most revealing subtexts of the story. Formerly Liberty Park, the site was renamed in 2006 after John E. Zuccotti, chairman of Brookfield Office Properties, the park's owner. A zoning variance granted to Brookfield years ago requires that the park, unlike a public, city-owned one, remain open day and night.
This peculiarity of zoning law has turned an unexpected spotlight on the bankruptcy of so much of what in the last couple of generations has passed for public space in America. Most of it is token gestures by developers in return for erecting bigger, taller buildings. Think of the atrium of the I.B.M. tower on Madison Avenue and countless other places like it: ''public'' spaces that are not really public at all but quasi-public, controlled by their landlords. Zuccotti in principle is subject to Brookfield's rules prohibiting tarps, sleeping bags and the storage of personal property on the site. The whole situation illustrates just how far we have allowed the ancient civic ideal of public space to drift from an arena of public expression and public assembly (Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, say) to a commercial sop (the foyer of the Time Warner Center).
Living in Europe for the past few years, I often came across parks and squares, in Barcelona and Madrid, Athens and Milan, Paris and Rome, occupied by tent communities of protesters. Public protest and assembly are part of the European social compact. Maybe the difference in America has something to do with our longstanding obsessions with automobiles and autonomy, with our predilection for isolationism, or our preference just for watching, more than participating.
In Europe, the protests were about jobs, government rollbacks and debt. That the message of the Zuccotti Park occupiers is fuzzy somewhat misses the point. The encampment itself has become the point.
''We come to get a sense of being part of a larger community,'' said Brian Pickett, a 33-year-old adjunct professor of theater and speech at City University of New York. I found him sitting last week among the neat, tarpaulin-covered stacks of sleeping bags in one corner of the park. ''It's important to see this in the context of alienation today. We do Facebook alone. But people are not alone here.''
And as a result, demonstrators also reveal themselves to each other. Egyptians described this phenomenon at Tahrir Square. Tea Partiers have talked about it, too. Protesters don't just show the world a mass of people. They discover their own numbers -- people with similar, if not identical, concerns. Imagine Zuccotti Park, one protester told me, as a Venn diagram of characters representing disparate political and economic disenchantments. The park is where their grievances overlap. It's literally common ground.
And it was obvious to me watching the crowd coalesce over several days that consensus emerges urbanistically, meaning that the demonstrators, who have devised their own form of leaderless governance to keep the peace, find unity in community. The governing process they choose is itself a bedrock message of the protest.
It produces the outlines of a city, as I said. The protesters have set up a kitchen, for serving food, a legal desk and a sanitation department, a library of donated books, an area where the general assembly meets, a medical station, a media center where people can recharge their laptops using portable generators, and even a general store, called the comfort center, stocked with donated clothing, bedding, toothpaste and deodorant -- like the food, all free for the taking.
That's where I found Sophie Theriault the other morning, sorting through loads of newly arrived pants and shirts. A soft-spoken 21-year-old organic farmer from Vermont, she had already spent many days and nights working as a volunteer. ''We may not have all come here with the exact same issues in mind,'' she told me, ''but sharing this park day in and day out, night after night, becomes an opportunity for us to discover our mutual interests.''
At that moment, a teenager in skinny jeans and a tank top started nosing through piles of coats. ''I'm looking to keep warm,'' he mumbled.
''That looks cool,'' Ms. Theriault offered, about a used polyester winter jacket with a fake-fur-lined hood he seemed to be considering.
''Not that warm,'' he replied, and gestured instead toward a pair of socks, which Ms. Theriault handed over before returning to her point: ''We meet every night to talk about how to keep this place clean and sober, to keep it an emotionally, physically safe space for everyone. Consensus builds community.''
Patrick Metzger, a 23-year-old sound engineer and composer, echoed the thought: ''From Web posts, you never get information about race, class, age -- who people really are. Fox News talks about flakes and mobs. But you can see how complicated the mix really is: students and older people, parents with families, construction workers on their lunch break, unemployed Wall Street executives.''
O.K., a few flakes, too, as at any political rally. But Mr. Metzger got it right. The protesters' diversity, at least during the day, is intrinsic to the protest's resilience. Not since 9/11 have so many people been asking ''Have you been there?'' ''Have you seen it?'' about anyplace in Manhattan. The occupation of the virtual world along with Zuccotti Park is of course jointly propelling the Occupy Wall Street movement now, and neither would be so effective minus the other.
That said, on the ground is where the protesters are building an architecture of consciousness.

HEADLINE: Where's the Beach? Under the Seaweed.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
AN invasion of seaweed that is extraordinary in volume and geographic scope has been besieging the eastern Caribbean since June, sending resorts and government agencies from Anguilla in the north to Tobago in the south scrambling to rid beaches of the smelly, brown, bug-attracting algae before the impending high season.
In Antigua, the $600-a-night St. James's Club & Villas was forced to close for the month of September while it removed 10,000 tons of seaweed from its beaches. The weed, a floating species of algae known as Sargassum that inhabits the Sargasso Sea, had completely filled the bay on which the hotel sits and created piles as high as five feet tall on the usually pristine shore. In St. Maarten, swimmers were warned away from some beaches because of fears that they could get tangled in the seaweed and drown. In Barbados, the government installed an oil-containment boom across the mouth of a river on its northeast shore to keep the weed at bay. In Tobago, where for several months workers have been carting the stuff off beaches regularly and trucking it to the dump, the government has been encouraging farmers to use it as fertilizer. 
''This is completely unprecedented,'' said David Freestone, executive director of the Sargasso Sea Alliance in Washington, which has been fielding reports of unusual quantities of the seaweed washing ashore in places as far-flung as Sierra Leone in West Africa. While small amounts of Sargassum are normally found in the Caribbean from May to September when regional currents and winds transport the floating algae to the islands, such large accumulations across so many regions, he said, has ''never happened in living memory.''
Theories as to why range from shifts in ocean currents to climate change to the gulf oil spill. But at least for now, ''it's a mystery,'' Mr. Freestone said.
Resorts and tourism officials fear that the weed could linger into high season, which starts in November, but anecdotal reports suggest that the worst may be over. Ramon Roach, a water-quality analyst for the Barbados Coastal Zone Management Unit who has been part of the effort to clear the weed, said that in the last week and a half, ''we haven't seen any additional seaweed coming from the sea.''
And according to Jerald Ault, professor of marine biology and fisheries at the University of Miami, cooler fall weather traditionally slows algae's growth, changes ocean circulation patterns, water temperature and nutrient systems. These shifts, he said, ''typically keep the weed at sea.''
Though not a threat to human health, the seaweed, which attracts flies and smells like rotten eggs as it decomposes, is a nuisance at best and a repellent at worst. If it is thick in the water it can harbor plastic and other garbage, making swimming hazardous. Concerns that swimmers could become ensnared by it led the Nature Foundation St. Maarten to issue a warning in August advising swimmers to steer clear of Guana Bay Beach and Gibbs Bay, which were inundated with Sargassum until a few weeks ago when storms swept much of the algae to sea.
While there is still ''quite a bit of weed washing ashore,'' said Tadzio Bervoets, director of the Nature Foundation, ''the situation has gotten better.'' But for islands that depend on tourism, that's not enough. ''Tourists don't want to see it or smell it; it can't be there,'' said Eli Fuller, owner of Adventure Antigua, a tour company with an environmental bent, who has been writing about the seaweed influx at antiguaisland.blogspot.com. While many of Antigua's beaches are free and clear of the seaweed, he said, if a visitor ''left their hotel and went for a drive, say, to Half Moon Bay,'' normally a beautiful eastern beach, ''they would find lots of weed on it.''
Accounts of the severity of the situation vary depending on whom you ask, with hotel and tourism officials often painting rosier pictures. Ines Bouchaut-Choisy, a director of the Saint-Barthelemy Tourism Committee, described the situation on St. Barts's 22 beaches as ''ribbons of algae'' that are ''decorating the sand'' on only three beaches: St. Jean, Lorient and Public.
Deborah Brosnan, a marine biologist who lives there and has been chronicling the Sargassum phenomenon on BrosnanCenter.com, said though amounts vary, ''it's on all the beaches.''
On nearby Anguilla, ''it has been coming in droves,'' said A. Nat Hodge, editor and publisher of The Anguillian, a local newspaper, saying that there was a surge at the beginning of the month. Anguilla officials said that removal efforts have been under way for weeks. ''In some cases private contractors have been commissioned to remove the weed,'' said Candis Niles, director of tourism for the Anguilla Tourist Board, ''but in most cases, business operators on the beach as well as community volunteers are taking the initiative to clean up the seaweed on a regular basis so that the appearance of the beaches is maintained.''
One consolation is that it is currently the rainy season in the Caribbean when fewer tourists visit and some elite resorts on islands like St. Barts are closed anyway. Nevertheless, islands are worried that if word of messy beaches spreads, tourists may decide to go elsewhere -- even if the problem is resolved soon.
For anyone headed to the Caribbean before then, the probability of finding a seaweed-covered beach is greater in some places than others.
For the most part island governments and marine experts say, the bulk of the seaweed is ending up on the eastern side of the islands, where beaches tend to be rockier with fewer resorts.
On French St. Martin, northern beaches like the popular Orient Bay and Le Galion as well as the east coast beaches have been the most affected, said Jadira Veen, president of the Sint Maarten PRIDE foundation, a nonprofit environmental awareness group. On the Dutch side, Guana Bay Beach has been out of commission for months because of the seaweed, she said. But hotel beaches are likely to be assiduously tended, which can make a difference. Dawn Beach, for example, which is also on the east coast and has been faced with large amounts of seaweed, is mostly clear of it because several hotels have been working hard to keep the beach attractive for tourists, Ms. Veen said.
Meanwhile, Mullet Bay beach, Cupecoy beach and others on the western side of the island ''are still pristine white sandy beaches as one expects in the Caribbean,'' she said.
The seaweed invasion comes at time when Caribbean tourism has not yet not fully recovered from the effects of the recession. ''Business has not been exactly booming,'' said Rob Barrett, chairman of Elite Island Resorts, which includes the St. James's Club, the hotel which was forced to close so that it could clear thousands of tons of seaweed from its beach. ''We are still in a recovery period and then this hits,'' he said. ''It was just like an onslaught. If you were standing behind it, you wouldn't see the ocean.'' Mr. Barrett said that it took three backhoes and five 10-ton dump trucks hauling seaweed ''12 hours a day, 7 days a week for 3 weeks'' to clear the beach, which he said is now pristine. The effort, combined with the loss of guests during the closure, cost the company about $1 million.
There could be environmental fallout as well. Seaweed plays an important role in the Caribbean ecosystem, and such large quantities can have positive and negative effects. Sargassum can help bulk up eroding beaches, for example. But large deposits can also make it difficult for tiny sea turtle hatchlings to find their way to the ocean. ''It's an intrusion on tourism,'' Mr. Ault said. ''But the reality is it serves as fertilizer on beaches and it may turn out to be extremely positive for fishery resources,'' because the seaweed becomes a refuge and a food source for young fish and other sea creatures.
The big unknown is what happens next year. ''The question of whether it was an exception to the rule or representing some sort of regime shift in the way ocean currents are operating is a pretty major question,'' said Jeff Ardron, director of the High Seas Program for the Marine Conservation Institute in Washington, who has been tracking the issue. A repeat, he said, could ''strongly indicate that something serious is afoot.''

HEADLINE: How Medicare Fails the Elderly

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
Jane Gross is a former New York Times reporter and the author of ''A Bittersweet Season: Caring for Our Aging Parents -- and Ourselves.''
HERE is the dirty little secret of health care in America for the elderly, the one group we all assume has universal coverage thanks to the 1965 Medicare law: what Medicare paid for then is no longer what recipients need or want today.
No one then envisioned the stunning advances in medicine that now keep people alive into advanced old age, often with unintended and unwelcome consequences. Indeed, scientific reports have showed the dangers, not merely the pointlessness and expense, of much of the care Medicare is providing.
Of course, some may actually want everything medical science has to offer. But overwhelmingly, I've concluded in a decade of studying America's elderly, it is fee-for-service doctors and Big Pharma who stand to gain the most, and adult children, with too much emotion and too little information, driving those decisions. 
In the last year alone, and this list is far from complete, here is what researchers have found both useless and harmful, according to leading medical journals:
Feeding tubes, which can cause infections, nausea and vomiting, rarely prolong life. People with dementia often react with agitation, including pulling out the tubes, and then are either sedated or restrained.
Abdominal and gall bladder surgery and joint replacements, for those who rank poorly on a scale that measures frailty, lead to complications, repeat hospital stays and placement in nursing homes.
Tight glycemic control for Type 2 diabetes, present in 1 of 4 people over 65, often requires 8 to 10 years before it helps prevent blindness, kidney disease or amputations. Without enough time to reap the benefits, the elderly endure needless dietary limits and needle sticks.
Yet Medicare, which pays for all of the above, does not, except in rare instances, pay for long-term care in a supervised, safe place for frail or demented old people, or for home aides to help with shopping, transportation, bathing and using the toilet.
Nationwide, the median annual cost of a nursing home in 2010 was $75,000; room and board in an assisted living facility, with no additional help, was $37,500; and the most basic category of home health aide, who can perform no medical tasks, like the dispensing of medication, was $19 an hour. These expenses are left to the elderly (and their adult children) to pay for out of pocket until their pockets are all but empty.
Then they are eligible for Medicaid, the state-run safety net for the poor. While Medicare, a federal program, is financed by payroll taxes, and thus is an ''earned'' benefit, Medicaid is ''charity,'' in the minds of the formerly middle class who worked their whole lives and never imagined themselves destitute.
In the case of my mother, who died at 88 in 2003, room and board in various assisted living communities, at $2,000 to $3,500 a month for seven years, was not paid for by Medicare. Yet neurosurgery, which I later learned was not expected to be effective in her case, was fully reimbursed, along with two weeks of in-patient care. Her stay of two years at a nursing home, at $14,000 a month (yes, $14,000) was also not paid for by Medicare. Nor were the additional home health aides she needed because of staffing issues. Or the electric wheelchair after strokes had paralyzed all but the finger that operated the joy stick. Or the gizmo with voice commands so she could tell the staff what she needed after her speech was gone.
She paid for the room. My brother and I paid for the private aides and bought her the chair and the ''talking board.'' What would her life have been like without the skilled care she required and the ability to get around her floor and communicate her needs? I shudder to think. But none of this was Medicare's responsibility.
Yet Medicare would pay for ''heroic'' care for a woman who was dying of old age, not a disease that could be treated: Diagnostic tests. All manner of surgery. Expensive medications. Trips to the emergency room or the hospital -- had she not refused all of them, in the last year of her life. So, in less than a decade, by my low-ball estimate, my mother spent $500,000 of her own money and uncalculated sums from her two children before winding up what she considered, with shame, ''a welfare queen.''
A recent state-by-state study of long-term care, the first of its kind, by a consortium of researchers, has found that this kind of essential help costs anywhere from 166 percent to 393 percent of the average annual income of America's elderly.
BY now, you may be wondering if your parents have a half million dollars for old age. Or if you or your children do. You may be counting on quick and easy deaths. Shoot me, so many people say. Alas, 70 percent of the elderly will need extended care before they die. Denial is powerful but doesn't pay the bills.
This mismatch between what is covered and what is actually useful is the central flaw in Medicare today, a shock to families who have no clue, until they're smack in the middle of it, about how this system works.
This mismatch tortures our elderly, drains the Medicare trust fund and leaves adult children with depleted retirement reserves. Yet in all the debate about the national debt, medical inflation and the need to pare Medicare costs by such means as raising the eligibility age, why is nobody, outside the insular community of long-term care providers, even mentioning the difference between acute and chronic care and how each is paid for (or not)?
Why is nobody enraged that our taxes are paying for hip replacements, for example, for people with advanced Alzheimer's disease, who are incapable of physical therapy? Why is nobody saying out loud, like it or not, that one of our great challenges is figuring out what to do about our elderly people, our fastest growing-population cohort, which will grow exponentially when 76 million baby boomers join the ranks?
The current system is unsustainable, but the alternative is the third rail of health care policy. President Obama's original legislation included Medicare reimbursement to doctors for discussion of end-of-life issues. These are what Sarah Palin called ''death panels''; days later, they were cut from the legislation. An Independent Payment Advisory Board will make recommendations to Medicare about what works and what doesn't, beginning in 2015, but its proposals are not binding, as intended. A long-term-care insurance provision -- with an average daily benefit of a mere $50 -- is under siege.
Reading the history of the Medicare law, which was not intended for long-term care because today's technology and demographics were unimaginable then, one is struck by the battles and ultimate compromises between President Lyndon B. Johnson and Wilbur Mills, the head of the House Ways and Means Committee, who originally opposed Medicare.
That the crafting of that legislation was so difficult leaves one despairing that this pillar of the Great Society could now be rewritten, given our partisan incivility. But right now, according to the health economist Marilyn Moon, there are 47 million Medicare beneficiaries, costing a half trillion dollars a year, or one-fifth of the nation's health spending. In 2050, the population on Medicare will number 89 million. How scary is that?

HEADLINE: Uneasy With Labels (Or Attention)

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
NOBEL prizes may be the ultimate attention-grabbers. When Theodore Roosevelt became the first American to win one, in 1906, he already had a bully pulpit -- the White House -- and he thumped it gleefully.
But Thomas J. Sargent of New York University and Christopher A. Sims of Princeton, who were awarded the Nobel in economics on Monday, aren't accustomed to the media spotlight. And they didn't entirely relish it last week.
Asked by a Nobel representative how he would deal with being certified as an economic sage in a time of global economic distress, Professor Sargent was puzzled: ''Well, I, sorry, I don't know what's involved in that. You know, we're just bookish types that look at numbers and try to figure out what's going on,'' he said. ''So I don't know what to say to that!''
Speechifying didn't appeal to Professor Sims, either. At a news conference at Princeton, he was asked to comment on the fiscal and financial rescue operations in the United States. 
''Answers to questions like that require careful thinking and a lot of data analysis,'' he replied. ''The answers are not likely to be simple.'' Neither he nor Professor Sargent is accustomed to talking ''off the top of our heads,'' he said. ''You shouldn't expect much from us.''
Journalism abhors a vacuum, however. Others assigned ideological views to the Nobel laureates.
An op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday carried the headline, ''A Nobel for Non-Keynesians,'' placing the professors in the camp that opposes the interventionist philosophy of the influential British economist John Maynard Keynes.
It said the two had put ''a sizable chink in the Keynesians' armor.'' An editorial said the pair was '' at odds with the recent Keynesian vogue, and in tune instead with the frustration with government fine-tuning that has dominated world economic policy since 2008.''
That's a compelling narrative. But it's not the way Professor Sims sees himself, as he told me by phone late last week. (It doesn't seem to be Professor Sargent's view, either, but we had only a brief e-mail exchange.)
Professor Sims doesn't want to be pigeonholed. ''I'm not 'non-Keynesian,' '' he said, adding that he has been an active ''promoter of new Keynesian macroeconomic models,'' because they ''are the place in our profession where theory and data and policy decision-making are coming together.''
''It doesn't really make much sense to stand on the sidelines and take potshots at them,'' he said. ''If you don't like the way they're working, you should try to do better.''
He and Professor Sargent have been ''trying to do empirical macroeconomics using formal tools of statistics,'' he said. ''Those tools aren't in themselves ideological.''
Professor Sims spoke favorably of the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus programs, which are Keynesian in their countercyclical spending. ''An expansionary fiscal policy is probably what we need right now,'' he said.
But he criticized traditional Keynesian thought for inadequacy in ''the temporal dimension,'' meaning that it didn't focus on the consequences of running long-term deficits. ''The implications of that for future stringency are very important,'' he said. ''Our current policy debates just aren't doing it.''
President Obama deserves praise for offering a ''grand compromise'' -- including spending cuts and tax increases -- to resolve the long-term deficit, Professor Sims said. He criticized the Republican Congressional leadership for ruling out tax increases, which, he said, most economists know are needed. And he generally approves of the accommodative monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, led by his fellow Princetonian, Ben. S. Bernanke, whom he described as a ''new Keynesian.''
I asked whether there is a sense in which this is a ''non-Keynesian'' Nobel.
Yes, he said, but mainly in a historical sense that is already outdated.
It derives from musty arguments from the ''warring schools'' period of economics in the 1970s and '80s. William Nordhaus of Yale and the late Paul Samuelson of M.I.T. used that phrase in 1985. They listed Professor Sargent, then at the University of Minnesota, as a leader of the ''rational expectations school,'' which was ''anathema'' to ''old-style Keynesians.''
What is the rational expectations theory? In a 2007 essay, Professor Sargent said it described ''economic situations in which the outcome depends partly on what people expect to happen.'' This insight is now part of ''modern mainstream'' economics, Professor Nordhaus said by e-mail.
In his essay, Professor Sargent says that ''while rational expectations is often thought of as a school of economic thought, it's better regarded as a ubiquitous modeling technique used widely throughout economics.'' He says the idea evolved from the work of many economists -- including Keynes.
Here's how Professor Sargent says it works: ''The value of a currency and its rate of depreciation depend partly on what people expect that rate of depreciation to be. That is because people rush to desert a currency that they expect to lose value, thereby contributing to its loss in value. Similarly, the price of a stock or bond depends partly on what prospective buyers and sellers believe it will be in the future.''
In early iterations, Professor Sims says, the theory was ''ideological and controversial.'' It was sometimes used to imply that government intervention in markets wouldn't work because ''the public understands what you want to do, so many of those policies will just have no effect.''
Today, with or without that implication, ''rational expectations are built into everyone's model,'' he says. But it's become an old approach, and he and Professor Sargent have been moving beyond it.
People don't comprehend all economic information well or quickly, he says, and often engage in what he calls rational inattention. For example, he says, many of us only sporadically check our bank balances or digest all the information that is relevant to our stock portfolios. Incorporating such behavior into economic models is now a focus of his work, as it is for behavioral economists.
The research goes on, under many labels. As another Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman, said in 1966: ''In one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian.'' Or a non-Keynesian, for that matter.

HEADLINE: Gertie's Ghost

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE

 BODY:
In 2000, BokaraLegendre, an artist and a stage performer, inherited her family's plantation in the Lowcountry of South Carolina. She promptly set about making the place her own, redecorating the antebellum mansion with abstract paintings and a pastel color scheme. But this seemed to unsettle the house. The first night Legendre spent in her redone bedroom, there was a problem with the fireplace, and the chamber filled with thick black smoke. As a member of the plantation staff put out the fire, he glimpsed an apparition: the late mistress of the house, Legendre's mother, Gertie. She was not pleased with the changes. 
Legendre tells this ghost story to illustrate a mortal lesson: It is one thing to live in a house, quite another to possess it. Most people can only fantasize about coming into something like Medway, a pink gabled plantation house surrounded by 6,700 acres of moss-hung oaks, pine forests and swamps. But every homeowner wrestles, in ways great and small, with the recalcitrant spirit of the property he occupies. Legendre, a student of Tibetan Buddhism, says she saw a sort of cosmic opportunity in her mother's bequest, a chance to ''change the karma'' of an estate once cultivated by slaves and used by her parents as a hunting playground. She discovered that the gift came with hidden conditions, however; some legacies aren't so easy to exorcise.
On a languid late-summer day, Legendre and I strolled around Medway's grounds, past empty stables and the grave of Thomas Smith, who owned the estate in the late 1600s and later served as the governor of the southern portion of the Carolina colony. ''It was weird that I inherited this place,'' Legendre said. She is a petite blonde, trim at 70, and speaks with a theatrical, patrician warble. Next to a pond inhabited by alligators, we sat beneath umbrellas as an older man in a white coat and a black bow tie -- Sam Washington, the fire-douser, whose family has worked on the property since the 19th century -- proffered a silver bowl filled with hummus. ''I never wanted to be known as some rich girl who lived on a plantation.''
Over the years, in a series of onstage monologues, Legendre has explored her ambivalence about the house, and by extension the domineering character of her mother, Gertrude Sanford Legendre, whose influence has stretched beyond the grave. ''Mummy,'' as Legendre calls her, was a carpet heiress who grew up in upstate New York, summered on the French Riviera with the Fitzgeralds and fell in love with her husband, who was from a prominent New Orleans family, on a big-game hunting trip to Ethiopia. Her life inspired a character played by Katharine Hepburn in the movie ''Holiday.''
In 1929, when they were newlyweds, Gertie and Sidney Legendre took a trip to South Carolina, where they stayed with some friends who had recently purchased a plantation outside Charleston
After abolition, growing labor-intensive crops like rice ceased to be economical, and during the Depression era, wealthy Northerners often came South and bought rundown estates for a pittance. While horseback riding one day, the Legendres stumbled upon a neglected Medway. ''Something about it haunted us both,'' Gertie later wrote in her memoirs. With some help from Gertie's father, the Legendres purchased Medway for $100,000.
Gertie restored the house, putting in bathrooms and electricity, and filled its rooms with trophies from the many expeditions she and Sidney took to Africa and the Far East. She later wrote that she named Bokara for ''an exotic place in Turkestan that we had always wanted to see.'' Motherhood did not impinge on her quest for adventure. During World War II, Gertie left behind her baby daughter to work for the Office of Strategic Services, the U.S. spy agency, and ended up spending six months as a German prisoner of war. Bokara says one of her earliest memories is of her governess answering a stranger's knock at the door. ''She said, 'Say hello to your mother, Bo.' And I thought, 'Who is this woman?' ''
Sidney Legendre died unexpectedly, of a heart attack, when Bokara was 7. She spent much of her childhood away at school, visiting Medway only on vacations. The plantation remained her mother's domain. Gertie hosted guests like Bing Crosby for shooting holidays and held a lavish costume ball every New Year's, making her entrance on one occasion on the back of an elephant. Bokara never felt as if she fit in. ''I only shot a quail once,'' she said. ''I just saw his little eyes, and I haven't killed anything since.''
After boarding school, Bokara bounced around Paris and New York, tried acting, hosted a television show in Palm Beach called ''Bobo in the Celebrity Room,'' took a reporting job at The Charleston News and Courier -- her sister had married the publisher -- and ended up covering the 1968 presidential campaign for a wire service. She, too, traveled the world, and in what she calls a moment of ''just total madness,'' married a friend of her mother's, a man People magazine described as ''a Hemingwayesque sportsman-scientist-entrepreneur.'' In the years after the couple divorced, Legendre lived in New York and California, went through a period of spiritual seeking and began making art. She seldom spent time at Medway. ''I was constantly kind of pushing it away,'' Legendre said.
Gertie loved to quote a sentimental poem someone once wrote about Medway, describing it as a place where ''restless Time himself has come to rest.'' Maintaining its leisurely atmosphere, however, required unseen effort, great wealth and delicate class diplomacy.
Gertie kept the household running with aristocratic formality, employing a large staff that worked around the clock in shifts. She had a warm, if somewhat old-fashioned, relationship with her domestic workers, especially Sam Washington, whose family, descended from slaves, was living on the plantation when she bought it. (After World War II, they relocated to a nearby town.) The plantation generated some money through a small-scale timber operation, but Gertie was primarily concerned with the pleasurable routine she pursued from fall to spring: shooting in the morning, picnics for lunch, more shooting, cocktails at sunset.
''Not many people around today have her same love and affection for land,'' says Robert Hortman, who has managed Medway for more than 30 years. ''They look at land as a commodity.'' A silver-haired man with a soft drawl and a biology degree, he took me out into the woods early one morning. He stopped his truck at one point so I could hear the thrum of the wind through the longleaf pines, and a flock of wild turkeys glided past. Medway is full of birds -- rare red-cockaded woodpeckers, migratory ducks -- many of which are attracted by its ponds, which are themselves the man-made remains of rice reserves originally constructed by slave labor. ''It's mind-boggling what it must have taken to create this,'' Hortman told me. Merely maintaining the land requires a forester, bulldozers and a year-round proc/ess of selective timbering and controlled burns.
Over the years, Gertie watched as many great Lowcountry estates were sold to timber corporations, heavy industry and eventually homebuilders. ''Because of development pressure and Charleston's economic growth, the land became too valuable,'' says Max Hill III, a development consultant whose family has preserved a plantation in the area. Today, he says, intact properties on the scale of Medway are ''an extreme rarity,'' and a few old houses are surrounded by subdivisions.
Gertie was determined to protect her land from the encroachments of modernity. Hortman recalled that one day, ''she got dead serious, and she pointed her finger at me and she said, 'Bob, don't you ever let anything happen to this place.' '' In a practical compromise, she sold about a thousand acres and used the proceeds to endow a nonprofit foundation, which would technically own Medway. Bokara Legendre is now its sole trustee. Gertie placed conservation easements on the house and the remaining land, shielding it from estate taxes while prohibiting commercial development. Over the past 25 years, South Carolina landowners have used such legal instruments to preserve some 560,000 acres. ''The beauty of an easement is that it protects the property in perpetuity,'' says Katharine Robinson, executive director of Historic Charleston Foundation, which enforces the one on the house at Medway. But they also place inflexible restrictions on future generations.
Gertie refused to consider any possibility that Medway might one day be run as a public attraction after her death -- she didn't want strangers tramping through the house -- and put her affairs in strict order. ''Mummy got terribly specific,'' Legendre says. ''In the last years of her life, she lay in bed and redid her will every day, until the secretary wouldn't bring it anymore.''
When Gertie died at age 97 in 2000, her ashes were scattered around the grounds and a headstone was erected next to Sidney's grave near the house. Her daughter took over the management of Medway, not fully appreciating the difficulties. Medway's main source of revenue, timber, had never fully recovered from damage inflicted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Legendre couldn't see how she could continue to employ a staff of 22. Shortly after her mother's death, she gathered all the employees for a somber meeting. ''I told them I couldn't run it like Mummy ran it,'' she says. These days, Medway has only seven full-time employees.
Layoffs weren't the only source of tension. ''Bo was trying to learn how things function at Medway, and we were learning how to function according to what Bo needed,'' Hortman says. In contrast to her mother, Legendre was self-sufficient -- she was happy make her own sandwich for lunch. ''She came in and she did a lot of things herself, and that was very difficult for us,'' Hortman says. After a series of minor mishaps, including the incident with the bedroom fireplace, the remaining household workers began exchanging knowing glances: Gertie was making her displeasure known. But Hortman, a rationalist, had a less superstitious explanation. It was Washington's job to light the fires, but Legendre had decided to do it herself, without realizing the dampers were closed.
A more serious conflict involved the question of how Medway should function. ''Bo has a theory,'' Hortman says. ''Her way of thinking is that mother nature has a way of taking care of itself.'' Legendre was horrified by the notion of killing animals for sport, but Hortman saw nature's methods of managing population -- starvation, disease -- as much crueler than hunting. In her redecoration, Legendre took down her parents' trophy heads and put up her own impressionistic paintings of wolves. She described this purging in a 2001 performance in the storytelling series ''The Moth.'' ''The whole plantation hated that I was trying to do this. The gall of me, trying to throw away the fruits of Mummy's life.''
''I could always pretty much anticipate her mother,'' Hortman says. ''It's very hard to anticipate Bo.'' But over time, Legendre says she has learned to rely heavily on her manager's experienced counsel. She now calls Hortman ''the answer to life.''
Legendre says it took experimentation to figure out ''how to be myself and yet, without losing myself, be a person who is in control of this.'' She was divorced from her second husband, a venture capitalist, and eager to challenge her mind in new ways. She talked to her friend Laurance Rockefeller, who persuaded her to put together a Medway conference on one of his pet interests: U.F.O.'s. Eventually, Legendre turned the foundation that owned the house into something called the Medway Institute.
The plantation would remain a retreat, but for writers and artists. Legendre, who is on the board of The Paris Review, got George Plimpton involved. ''It was incredibly exotic and romantic,'' says Jonathan Ames, a novelist who went on to create the HBO television show ''Bored to Death.'' ''Before I headed down, George Plimpton said to me, 'There is going to be a beautiful poet there,' and sure enough, there was a beautiful poet there.'' Ames acquired a girlfriend and produced a comic novel about artist colonies.
The composer Eric Schorr, who worked on a piece about a Civil War regiment of escaped slaves at Medway, has since become friends with Legendre. ''Here's somebody who inherits something that she ostensibly has no interest in, and she found a way to make it work for her,'' he says.
After a while, though, even the retreats became exhausting. Then, one weekend, Legendre invited some old friends down, just to visit, and she finally felt at home. ''I somehow fell into it a little bit more,'' she says, ''and I saw that I was giving people a really good time, and I was having kind of a good time.'' She stopped trying so hard, and let the plantation change her.
Then, just as Legendre was finally getting comfortable, she received some distressing news from her financial adviser. In characteristic fashion, she wrote a poem about it.
The money master came to lunch
It's always fun we laughed a bunch.
He said it's time to make a choice,
I heard a slight change in his voice --
''In seven years you will be
Dead or in penury.''
Even after downscaling, the costs of running the plantation were enormous -- more than $800,000 a year on average, according to the publicly available tax returns of the Medway Institute. Salaries, benefits and maintenance costs were sapping the endowment left by Legendre's mother. ''The recent financial crash brought the inappropriate use of my money into clear focus for me,'' she told me in an e-mail. If she could have sold a bit of land, she might have been able to keep things going, but she says the irrevocable terms of the conservation easements made that practically impossible.
''She just had the vague idea that, having killed and destroyed everything all her life, that maybe one should save it,'' Legendre says of her mother. But in Gertie's effort to dictate that the family estate would remain just as she left it, she helped to pave the way for most significant change of all. The property was put up for sale last year. Legendre originally asked $25 million but has since made a series of drastic price reductions. The harsh economy has hurt its market value, as have the usage restrictions, which effectively prevent it from being reused as other historic homes in the area have been, for instance as an event space, a hotel or a hunting resort.
''Clearly, a piece of property with an easement is worth less than a piece of property without an easement,'' says Charles Lane, a South Carolina plantation owner, real estate broker and conservationist. ''You buy Medway, and the only person you can sell it to is somebody who wants to use it for exactly what you bought it for.''
Lane says that the likely buyer for Medway, now priced at $15 million, would be a wealthy outdoors enthusiast who appreciates its relative isolation. Since Medway belongs to the foundation, any sale proceeds will have to be devoted to philanthropy, but Legendre will be free of ongoing operating expenses. When I visited, she was deeply immersed in research for panel discussion she would be conducting on fighting elephant hunters, at a benefit for the Wildlife Conservation Society, and beginning to formulate another monologue, on the process of selling the plantation.
''I've had this opportunity to live in a really glamorous way for 11 years,'' she told me as we had breakfast in a room paneled with cypress, beneath a painted portrait of her father, a shotgun slung jauntily over his shoulder. ''I don't feel that Bo will not exist if I'm not living this way.'' She is looking forward to spending more time at a house she owns in Mill Valley, Calif., a cozy two-bedroom place near the water. She is now going through the difficult process of figuring out which things she will incorporate into her new, more modernly scaled, life. Nearly everything at Medway, she says, will go along with the sale. That includes Mummy's gravestone -- and her very interested spirit.

America's Royal Family of Journalism During a Century of Turbulent Splendor

In place of press lords the United States has had press families: the Binghams in Louisville, the Chandlers in Los Angeles, the Ochs-Sulzbergers in New York and Chattanooga. None, though, compared in power or zaniness with the family of Joseph Medill at its height. Born in 1823, Medill was a fervent abolitionist, one of the founders of the Republican Party, and is perhaps most notable for having helped put Abraham Lincoln over as his party's candidate in the 1860 presidential election. In 1855 Medill bought a one-third ownership of The Chicago Daily Trib/une, and eventually controlled the majority stock in the paper, which he took great care before his death in 1899 to make certain stayed in his family. 
Imperious, self-approving, utterly self-confident, a man who in his 40s carried a large black ear trumpet -- but probably wasn't listening anyway -- Joseph Medill availed himself of the trifecta of law (which he read as a young man in Ohio), politics (he was the mayor of Chicago after the great fire of 1871) and journalism, which brought him prestige, power and money. The only flaw in his otherwise perfect game plan was his children. He had no sons but three daughters, one of whom died young. The surviving daughters, Katherine and Elinor, he described as ''the worst two she-devils in all Chicago.'' His great-/granddaughter Felicia Gizycka claimed that this was the bowdlerized description and that what he had actually said was ''the two biggest bitches in Christendom.''
Socially ambitious, hard on their husbands, cold to their children, rivalrous between themselves, Kate and Nellie Medill took the smile out of Christmas and every other holiday. Kate married a nephew of Cyrus McCormick, the reaper man; Nellie a Patterson, the son of a Presbyterian minister. They raised four children -- two each -- who would expand Joseph Medill's journalistic empire.
Kate's first son, Joseph Medill McCormick, was elected to the United States Senate in 1918 but, plagued by alcoholism and depression, killed himself at the age of 47. Her other son, Robert Rutherford McCormick -- who styled himself Colonel but within the family was known as Bertie -- was the publisher of The Chicago Tribune and, through great business acumen, turned The Tribune Company into a powerhouse corporation.
Nellie's son, Joseph Medill Patterson, after working with his cousin Bertie on The Trib, went to New York to found The Daily News, the first successful tabloid in America and for many years the country's /highest-circulation newspaper. Her daughter, Eleanor Medill Patterson, every/where known as Cissy, after a wretched marriage to a Russian-Polish aristocrat named Josef Gizycki -- he disappeared on her on their wedding night, drank heavily, beat her and absconded with their daughter, Felicia -- flounced about Washington as the Countess Gizycka, a social butterfly with the fangs of a viper. In 1930, at the age of 48, Cissy persuaded William Randolph Hearst to let her edit his money-losing Washington Herald, which she bought nine years later and combined with The Washington Times, turning the two, under the name The Washington Times-Herald, into the largest-circulation daily in that city.
Megan McKinney's ''Magnificent Medills'' and Amanda Smith's ''Newspaper Titan'' between them expend more than 1,000 pages chronicling the escapades of Joseph Medill and his family. McKinney's book includes accounts of Joseph Medill and his offspring, on to the great-/grandchild Alicia Patterson Guggenheim, who came to own and run Newsday. Smith (the editor of Joseph P. Kennedy's letters), at much greater length than Mc/Kinney, concentrates on Cissy Patterson, who was Joseph Medill's favorite grandchild and led the gaudiest life of the Medill /grandchildren.
McKinney, an authority on historic Chicago families, has no fear of cliches -- her book begins on the clang of one: ''Printer's ink raged in their veins'' -- and she frequently lapses into overwriting. ''The Magnificent Medills,'' though, is saved by its organization and economy. Shifting smoothly from the life of one Medill, Patterson or McCormick to another, in the end she achieves a clear and comprehensive family biography, with all its complex interconnections.
''Newspaper Titan'' feels roughly 200 pages too long; it rambles on fully 74 /pages after its heroine's death, and ends on a note of unearned sentimentality. Even at its extravagant length, the book fails to get inside its subject, leaving the reader with a portrait of Cissy Patterson as little more than a wildly intemperate woman who used her money to bully friends and employees.
Contra McKinney, the Medills were not magnificent but neurotic, alcoholic, megalomaniac and inordinately unpleasant generally. Far from being a titan, of newspapers or anything else, Cissy Patterson was, in Smith's own showing, capricious, spoiled, headstrong, snobbish, litigious, anti-/Semitic, a mean drunk and vindictive. Not, as we should say today, a fun family, Joseph Medill's offspring.
They did spend grandly, though chiefly on themselves, living more like Medicis than Medills. They called on Stanford White to build them mansions on Astor Street in Chicago, on Dupont Circle in Washington, and had other architects build them mansions elsewhere. Vast sums went on clothes, jewels, luxurious travel, liveried servants, private railroad cars, horses, fox hunting and buying off ex-husbands and -wives. Large dogs -- Bertie's German shepherds, Cissy's poodles -- disported everywhere. Bertie McCormick flew to work at The Chicago Tribune on his private plane from his suburban estate, Cantigny, 30 or so miles west of the city. Even the most austere among them, Joe Patterson, who claimed to be a socialist, a man most comfortable out among the people, spent lavishly on himself and on his children, running an experimental farm, building town houses and keeping a mistress and an illegitimate child living in comfort. Never in short supply, owing to their shares in the gold mine that was the Tribune Trust, money was not the family problem; perspective and good sense were what they were missing.
The Medill grandchildren viewed journalism as purveying entertainment while enhancing their social positions and spreading their political views. ''Never overestimate the intelligence of the American people'' might have been their motto, and in their newspapers they rarely did. They gave their readers what they thought they wanted. This included large photo spreads, stories of sex and violence, advice columns, lots of gossip, strong opinions, contests and comic strips. (Joe Patterson was especially adroit at developing new comic strips for The Daily News.) The formula worked. At one point the family owned and controlled the three largest-circulation dailies in the three most important cities in the United States.
When through their newspapers the Medill grandchildren attempted to educate their readers, it was in seriously mistaken ideas. Bertie, Joe and Cissy were known during World War II as the ''three furies of the isolationist press.'' During World War I the family had been accused of being pro-German, and Colonel McCormick's Anglophobia was no secret. None showed the least notion of the menace of Nazism. But, then, how could they when their hatred of Franklin D. Roosevelt far exceeded their hatred of Hitler?
The fall of the House of Medill was slow but precipitous. The successful media empire that Robert McCormick put together was acquired at a bargain price by a profiteer, and is being sadly dismantled. Joe Patterson's Daily News, now owned by a real estate operator, has been divested of its old panache with no corresponding improvement in its character. Cissy Patterson's Washington Times-Herald is long gone and, like its proprietress, mourned by no one. Were he alive today, Joseph Medill might well mutter that most memorable line from Shelley's ''Ozymandias'' -- ''Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'' -- set down his ear trumpet and, head bowed, shamble out of the room.

HEADLINE: Making the Most Of Our Financial Winter

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
ON a traditional farm, when winter comes and there's no need for planting, fertilizing or harvesting, it's time for infrastructure projects. Farmers fix their barns, build fences or dig wells -- important tasks that could be done in any season if there weren't more pressing jobs to do.
If the winter is unusually long and cold, planting time is delayed and additional projects are undertaken. It's all very simple and sensible: the idea is not to let people sit around idle, and to use down time to get important things done. 
The farm needn't go into debt to do this. All able-bodied people on the farm are expected to contribute their labor, an imposition we can view as an informal tax. Later, everyone on the farm enjoys the benefits of all that work, by participating in the various benefits -- the economic growth -- it helps to create.
In many respects, the American Jobs Act, proposed by President Obama but blocked in its full form by the Senate last week -- would do much the same thing for the nation during the current economic winter. Parts of the plan would provide for projects like school modernization, airport and highway improvements, high-speed rail systems and redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed-upon properties to stabilize neighborhoods. Those are the modern national equivalents of fixing the barn and building a fence.
And these projects would be made possible by taxes. As Mr. Obama said last month: ''Everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything.'' The bill would start public improvement projects in 2012, and raise taxes, in the form of a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires, in 2013, more than paying for the public improvements part of the bill.
In every depression the nation has faced, there have been proposals for the government to do just this: increase spending on public improvements to create jobs for the unemployed.
An article in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, written in 1877, during the 1873-79 depression, argued that the government could create a great many infrastructure jobs. ''There are many needed improvements: the construction of the Texas and Pacific Railroad, the widening of the entrances to the Mississippi, the diking of its alluvial blanks, the clearing of obstructions from the beds of the great rivers of the West, the improvement of the harbors and rivers in the East, the completion of the post offices, custom houses, seawalls, breakwaters and other useful works of a national character,'' the article said.
An article in The New York Times, written in 1893, during the 1893-97 depression, described public improvements to relieve unemployment and said there were plenty of things that could be done to create jobs: ''building of lines of rapid transit, widening and deepening the Erie Canal, improving the Mississippi, and building canals across the peninsula of Michigan.''
BUT neither of those proposals got very far back then, because either substantial tax increases or substantial debt increases were politically unacceptable. State, local and federal governments were limited mainly to accelerating the use of existing revenue (or only slightly increasing their borrowing) or to coordinating voluntary donations for infrastructure projects. One observer wrote in The Chicago Daily Tribune in 1877 that it was an outrage ''when the government exacts a tax for subsidizing any business scheme, for providing public improvements that are not needed, or in any other enterprise which is intended merely to furnish work for the unemployed.''
In 1894 in St. Louis, the city government backed a campaign to secure private donations to create an artificial recreational lake with picturesque islands in Forest Park. Called the ''Lake Poor Fund,'' it appealed to dual motives: to improve the city and to hire the unemployed. It paid 750 of the jobless to dig with shovels and picks. (The steam shovel hadn't yet fully emerged as a dominant technology.) The lake was completed within the year, and city residents still enjoy it today.
It was not until the Great Depression of the 1930s that financing infrastructure programs through serious deficit spending was prominently advocated. A revolution in economic thinking, led by John Maynard Keynes, enabled us to think of the economy as something that can spontaneously fail, that the government can stimulate to get going again and make everyone better off.
In his 1988 book, ''The Origins of the Keynesian Revolution,'' Robert W. Dimand, a historian of economic thought at Brock University in Canada, says that precursors of Keynes-like thinking about economic stimulus can be traced back to the 1890s, but that their reasoning was muddled and unpersuasive. It was not until 1931, in one of the most influential scholarly economic articles of all time, that Richard F. Kahn, a 25-year-old student of Keynes, clarified his mentor's ideas and showed how a little government stimulus could have what we now call a multiplier effect.
Mr. Kahn assumed that there would be debt financing of stimulative spending, saying that the effects of increased balanced-budget expenditures -- spending that is fully paid for by tax increases -- were ''a matter for separate study'' which, in fact, he never got around to. The terms ''multiplier'' and ''deficit spending'' were coined soon thereafter.
Making everyone better off, and a lot better off through the power of the multiplier, was the key to the idea's success in the political arena.
It wasn't until the 1940s that economists realized that a balanced-budget stimulus could be effective, too. As I've discussed in earlier columns, economists starting with Walter S. Salant and Paul A. Samuelson realized that during a depression or in near-depression conditions, any government expenditure fully funded by taxes will increase national income approximately one for one, without raising national debt. This is known as the balanced-budget multiplier.
The public improvements suggested in the president's proposal would have been fully paid for by the bill's tax surcharge. And any new legislation we now consider could also pay for such improvements with tax increases, so as not to raise the national debt even temporarily. This idea should still have common-sense appeal to Americans in this time of high unemployment, just as the idea of winter work does on the farm.

HEADLINE: Brazil Makes Its Own Manhattan

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
Sao Paulo is almost beyond the imagination -- a drizzle-shrouded megacity of almost 20 million that sprawls like Los Angeles and boasts enough skyscrapers to vie with New York. The gritty financial engine of the new Brazil, Sao Paulo exerts influence over commerce, media and culture. The Brazilian writer Roberto Pompeu de Toledo calls it an ''urban labyrinth that reaches toward the infinite.'' It might not have the palm-fringed glamour of Rio de Janeiro, but in the view of urbane Paulistanos, Brazil has only one truly global city: theirs.
As Brazil's economy soars -- partly as a result of China's great appetite for its commodities, like iron ore and soybeans, not to mention the oil recently found in abundance offshore -- Sao Paulo prospers. A surge in deal-making and the resilience of Brazil's currency, the real, has attracted foreign investment bankers, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists. Well-educated Brazilians are returning from abroad. Compensation in some executive suites now rivals the pay on Wall Street. 
All these people need a place to live. Even though jackhammers often awaken Paulistanos at dawn, buildings aren't going up fast enough to satisfy the population, and a housing deficit persists. For the poor with dreams of joining the growing middle class, this means living cheek by jowl in favelas. For the rich seeking to avoid the infamous traffic jams, it means surreal competition for apartments that can be downright ordinary in prestigious and strategically located neighborhoods. The market-research firm IBOPE Inteligencia found that prices for newly constructed apartments across Sao Paulo climbed 31 percent from a year ago. Prices for existing properties in some coveted neighborhoods surged even higher: apartments in Jardins were up 81 percent; Itaim Bibi rose 59 percent.
''The market's getting a little out of hand,'' says Marcos Faria Lamacchia, a banker who bought his apartment in Jardim America two years ago and was recently offered a price in the millions of dollars, double what he paid. ''I'd rather put my money in Miami, where it's still possible to buy low.''
Despite such concerns, renting or buying real estate in Sao Paulo has become a contact sport. A furnished penthouse apartment in the well-heeled Jardins district might rent for as much as $20,000 a month, a sum unimaginable a short time ago. The penthouse in the new Daniel Libeskind building going up in the ritzy Itaim Bibi area recently sold for $12 million. An apartment owned by the heiress Athina Onassis in the Chateau Margaux building in Vila Nova Conceicao, near Ibirapuera Park, sold for about $20 million last year.
Broader access to credit fuels a lot of the buying. Traditionally, Brazilians bought homes without much bank financing, often putting up cash and bartering other properties or even automobiles as part of each deal. Or they simply rented. But economic stability now gives Brazilians access to loans with interest rates in the neighborhood of 12 percent. While that rate might be unthinkable to Americans, it is a big shift for Brazilians happy to have any type of home loan in a country with a history of hyperinflation and high interest rates. Apartment flipping, especially at the high end, is growing more common.
The surge in real estate prices dominates conversation at Sao Paulo's restaurants just as it did in New York City before the financial collapse. Many of the new luxury buildings are sleek, rec/tangular affairs, but smog-darkened high-rises from earlier booms still occupy big swaths of Sao Paulo. Rarer are the elegant districts that have preserved their allure, like Jardim Europa, with its winding streets and shady pitanga trees. One aesthetic that hasn't changed much in the latest boom involves security. While Sao Paulo's once-horrific homicide rate has declined, crime -- robberies and home invasions -- remains a preoccupation. Guarding those elegant mansions in Jardim Europa are towering walls with gunmen at their sentry posts.
Cristiana Arcangeli, an entrepreneur, lives in one such home with a courtyard, lap pool and upstairs gym. The streets outside are lined with meticulously groomed trees and sidewalks, luxuries in a city where cars rule. But living in such an exclusive spot does not yet seem to have much to do with reclaiming the urban right to stroll around without fear of assault. ''Sao Paulo is still a risky place,'' Arcangeli says. ''There's a restaurant a couple of blocks from my house, but I've never walked there.''

ANA PAULA JUNQUEIRA, an executive and aspiring politician, has lived for seven years in Jardim Europa in a home that includes work by the designer Herve van der Straeten and the artist Gustavo von Ha. ''I have 10 dogs,'' she says. ''I like walking with them around here.'' (MM80)
DUARTE D'OREY, a Portuguese banker who shuttles among Brazil, Spain and Angola, absorbs Sao Paulo's skyline from the deck of the penthouse apartment he rents in Jardins, a short drive from his offi ce. He pays twice as much in rent in Sao Paulo as he does for a luxury apartment he rents in Madrid.

HEADLINE: The Stroll of the Bulls: Arizona Keeps It Tamer

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Salvador Rodriguez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAVE CREEK, Ariz. -- Here is what not to do at a bull run: Pull the tail of one of the bulls. Stop to pick up a fallen cellphone as the crowd -- and the bulls -- bears down on you. Wear a costume that makes it hard to see the oncoming animals.
Participants in Running of the Bulls America, held Friday and Saturday on a quarter-mile dirt track at a ranch in this town just north of Phoenix, broke all those rules and more. But because the Arizona animals were tamer than their Spanish counterparts, injuries were kept to a minimum. 
''These bulls are like golden retrievers, and the bulls over there are like pit bulls with rabies,'' said Justin Kufahl, 35, who has participated in 22 Pamplona runs and was on hand to offer advice to novice bull runners.
He told people to keep an eye on the bulls but also to watch out for other runners. He advised those who did fall to stay down and allow the bulls to pass. The most fundamental piece of advice, though, he did not need to utter: Run!
He might have brought up the issue of dropped cellphones; one participant dropped hers as she was filming her experience and tried to recover it as bulls and people rumbled past her. The tail puller ended up face down in the dirt after he lost his footing and the bull ran on.
Participants ran in oversize sombreros, kilts and prison uniforms. It was those wearing masks who found it most difficult to track the pursuing animals.
''There's a lot of adrenaline,'' said Mike Holzberg, a retiree from Scottsdale who dashed ahead of the bulls along with college students, stockbrokers, teachers and the unemployed.
After huffing and puffing around the track, some said they found the bulls to be not as fierce as they had imagined.
''What is this, walking with the bulls?'' one participant shouted out as he finished the course, looked back and still did not see any bulls at his heels.
''Gotta slap some fur,'' said Christopher Stine, a salesman from Scottsdale who wore a Viking helmet and red armband as he dashed so close to the bulls that he could reach out and touch one. Organizers said the risks were real, given that the 21 bulls, even with their dull horns and relatively docile natures, weighed 800 to 1,500 pounds.
''What's going to happen is someone is going to fall, and then others will fall, and the bulls will run right over them,'' an organizer, Patrick O'Donnell, said as the event got under way on Friday night, a prediction that did not come to pass, at least on a grand scale. ''That's what you sign up for: the unexpected.''
Mr. O'Donnell experienced just that years ago when he was riding a bull and a horn tore through his left cheek. The scar, an indentation that resembles a dimple, is still visible.
Though runners were concerned about their safety, John Hetzel was more focused on the well-being of the bulls, which he owns and uses for rodeos. ''The worst thing that could happen is one of them gets hurt,'' said Mr. Hetzel, who rode on horseback behind the pack of bulls to drive them toward the runners. ''They're my babies.''
Animal rights activists criticized the bull run as cruel, and the town of Cave Creek, which is known for its Western charm, withdrew its support after organizers did not come up with $3 million in insurance. As an ambulance stood at the ready near the track, which was on private property, Mayor Vincent Francia said he would be holding his breath until the event was over, hoping that nothing went awry.

HEADLINE: America's 'Primal Scream'

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
IT'S fascinating that many Americans intuitively understood the outrage and frustration that drove Egyptians to protest at Tahrir Square, but don't comprehend similar resentments that drive disgruntled fellow citizens to ''occupy Wall Street.''
There are differences, of course: the New York Police Department isn't dispatching camels to run down protesters. Americans may feel disenfranchised, but we do live in a democracy, a flawed democracy -- which is the best hope for Egypt's evolution in the coming years. 
Yet my interviews with protesters in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park seemed to rhyme with my interviews in Tahrir earlier this year. There's a parallel sense that the political/economic system is tilted against the 99 percent. Al Gore, who supports the Wall Street protests, described them perfectly as a ''primal scream of democracy.''
The frustration in America isn't so much with inequality in the political and legal worlds, as it was in Arab countries, although those are concerns too. Here the critical issue is economic inequity. According to the C.I.A.'s own ranking of countries by income inequality, the United States is more unequal a society than either Tunisia or Egypt.
Three factoids underscore that inequality:
The 400 wealthiest Americans have a greater combined net worth than the bottom 150 million Americans.
The top 1 percent of Americans possess more wealth than the entire bottom 90 percent.
In the Bush expansion from 2002 to 2007, 65 percent of economic gains went to the richest 1 percent.
As my Times colleague Catherine Rampell noted a few days ago, in 1981, the average salary in the securities industry in New York City was twice the average in other private sector jobs. At last count, in 2010, it was 5.5 times as much. (In case you want to gnash your teeth, the average is now $361,330.)
More broadly, there's a growing sense that lopsided outcomes are a result of tycoons' manipulating the system, lobbying for loopholes and getting away with murder. Of the 100 highest-paid chief executives in the United States in 2010, 25 took home more pay than their company paid in federal corporate income taxes, according to the Institute for Policy Studies.
Living under Communism in China made me a fervent enthusiast of capitalism. I believe that over the last couple of centuries banks have enormously raised living standards in the West by allocating capital to more efficient uses. But anyone who believes in markets should be outraged that banks rig the system so that they enjoy profits in good years and bailouts in bad years.
The banks have gotten away with privatizing profits and socializing risks, and that's just another form of bank robbery.
''We have a catastrophically bad misregulation of the financial system,'' said Amar Bhide, a finance expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ''Its consequences led to a taint of the entire system of modern enterprise.''
Economists used to believe that we had to hold our noses and put up with high inequality as the price of robust growth. But more recent research suggests the opposite: inequality not only stinks, but also damages economies.
In his important new book, ''The Darwin Economy,'' Robert H. Frank of Cornell University cites a study showing that among 65 industrial nations, the more unequal ones experience slower growth on average. Likewise, individual countries grow more rapidly in periods when incomes are more equal, and slow down when incomes are skewed.
That's certainly true of the United States. We enjoyed considerable equality from the 1940s through the 1970s, and growth was strong. Since then inequality has surged, and growth has slowed.
One reason may be that inequality is linked to financial distress and financial crises. There is mounting evidence that inequality leads to bankruptcies and to financial panics.
''The recent global economic crisis, with its roots in U.S. financial markets, may have resulted, in part at least, from the increase in inequality,'' Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry of the International Monetary Fund wrote last month. They argued that ''equality appears to be an important ingredient in promoting and sustaining growth.''
Inequality also leads to early deaths and more divorces -- a reminder that we're talking not about data sets here, but about human beings.
Some critics think that Occupy Wall Street is simply tapping into the public's resentment and covetousness, nurturing class warfare. Sure, there's a dollop of envy. But inequality is also a cancer on our national well-being.
I don't know whether the Occupy Wall Street movement will survive once Zuccotti Park fills with snow and the novelty wears off. But I do hope that the protesters have lofted the issue of inequality onto our national agenda to stay -- and to grapple with in the 2012 election year.

HEADLINE: In Poor Neighborhoods, TIF May Need a Boost

BYLINE: By JUAN-PABLO VELEZ. 
jpvelez@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Local residents once called the far western stretch of Madison Street the downtown of the West Side. That was before the race riots and factory closings of the late 1960s sent this area around the thriving commercial corridor into a tailspin of population loss, poverty, crime and blight.
When Chicago set out over a decade ago to turn around the crumbling retail area, it created a tax increment financing district along Madison Street from West Garfield Park to the city limit at Austin Avenue. But halfway through the TIF's 23-year life span, the city has spent only $4.8 million on commercial revitalization projects there, and western Madison Street remains a place of struggling retail strips and vacant, decaying blocks. 
Criticism of TIFs under Mayor Richard M. Daley focused largely on his administration's heavy spending of TIF funds in and around Chicago's thriving downtown. But the scant investment along Madison raises a key question not answered by a TIF reform task force created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel: Can the city's primary economic development tool help reverse decades of economic decline and physical decay in Chicago's poorest neighborhoods?
The TIF program was created 27 years ago specifically to spur development in the city's blighted areas. When the city creates a district, it freezes the amount of property taxes that local governments can collect within a particular area for a period of 23 years. If property values rise during that time, the city is required to spend the additional property-tax revenue -- the tax increment -- on economically beneficial projects within the district or in a bordering one.
Whether they are public works or business subsidies, the projects are meant to catalyze development within the district. But if property values do not rise and create money for new investment, TIFs are virtually powerless to spur growth.
''It's very difficult for those poor places to be turned around by this tool because the property taxes aren't going to generate enough revenue to do the massive push that you need,'' said David Merriman, an economics professor and director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois. ''There's got to be development to generate revenue, and that's probably not going to work unless you already have some market momentum.''
According to a Chicago News Cooperative analysis of the last eight years of Mr. Daley's tenure -- during which the city escalated TIF investment -- only 23 percent of the $1.84 billion in TIF funds spent went to districts in the city's poorest neighborhoods.
City documents show that TIF districts in and around downtown received $891 million of TIF investment during the final eight years of Mr. Daley's tenure, or about 48 percent of the total. Districts in the North and Northwest Sides, areas with median household incomes well above the city median of $46,781, received $305 million, or another 17 percent of TIF outlays. The city spent another $219 million, or 12 percent, in the Southwest and Far South Sides, where the median household income is around $44,000.
In the city's poverty-pocked South and West Sides, where the median household income is around $35,000, TIF spending amounted to $428 million, 23 percent of total outlays. Andy Mooney, commissioner of the city's Department of Housing and Economic Development, which runs the program, warned against comparing results in downtown TIF districts with those in impoverished areas. ''They're entirely different characters,'' he said.
When Mr. Emanuel announced the creation of his TIF reform commission in May, he promised to return the program to its roots, telling reporters that TIFs were intended for blighted communities, not high-rent areas.
When the city created the Madison-Austin TIF in 1999, the district's redevelopment blueprint outlined plans for the city to spend $42 million on a mix of public works and private-development subsidies to ''re-establish Madison Street as an active and vibrant commercial district, while accommodating residential and institutional uses where appropriate.''
Between 2002 and 2010, the Daley administration spent $4.8 million in TIF money on commercial revitalization projects, largely on small-business grants and streetscaping along Madison Street from Pulaski Road to Kostner Avenue. That was less than half the $12.3 million collected from the district as a property-tax increment.
The largest commercial subsidy was $150,000 for MP Mall -- one of only nine buildings in the district renovated during the last decade thanks to small-business improvement grants paid for by TIF dollars. Total outlay for the nine buildings: $523,084.
On a recent midweek afternoon, dozens of people loitered on the newly widened sidewalks in front of MP Mall, a former Goldblatt's department store on the corner of Madison and Pulaski Streets. The building's clothing stores were packed with merchandise, but there were fewer than five shoppers. The owners of the handful of small shops on Madison Street that received face-lifts thanks to TIF investment say the improvements helped boost sales.
''It helped tremendously, yeah. We generated over 10 jobs,'' says Almetris Stanley, owner of the Hair Salon and Spa. Ms. Stanley said a $50,000 grant allowed her to turn a long-abandoned, dilapidated building into a home for her salon.
The Madison-Austin TIF appears to be mired in an economic Catch-22: it needs more money to attract more development, but spotty development so far has generated only a trickle of new revenue.
''The TIF district can't survive just on the increase in increment on existing properties,'' said Alderman Jason Ervin, whose 28th Ward covers much of the district. ''That's why we're really pushing aggressively for new development.''

HEADLINE: Meet the Newest Faces of Wall Street

 BODY:
DISCONTENT over the economy has found a focus in Occupy Wall Street -- a movement that says it has no leaders but is united in seeking justice for the 99 percent of the population that isn't superrich. Now a month old, its protests have led to many others across the country, but nowhere are they more freighted with symbolism than in the area around the New York Stock Exchange. As the protesters camp out in the nearby Zuccotti Park, some onlookers -- among them members of the 1 percent who work in the area -- are asking: who are these people, and what exactly do they want? A visit to Lower Manhattan shows that their answers, although reflecting a general unhappiness with the status quo, are by no means similar. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: DAVE SILVER, 87: A World War II veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, Mr. Silver, who lives in Brooklyn, carries a sign that favors taxing the rich and providing money for jobs. He writes: ''Occupy Wall Street. Unoccupy Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq.''

HEADLINE: The Land of Milk and Money

BYLINE: By JAY CASPIAN KANG

 BODY:
Fredy Harianto was one of 30 or so people who congregated at the headquarters of Boot HK, an incubator for Internet start-ups in Wan Chai, one of Hong Kong's many business districts, to hear a lecture on how to create a punchy, likable corporate blog voice. The attendees were mostly young; each had sharp clothes and impeccable posture. Only two were born in Hong Kong.
The demographics of the room reminded me of what a London-born banker told me a couple of nights before: ''There are only two reasons why a white guy will come to Hong Kong. The first is to make money and evade taxes. The second is girls. But really, once you get down to it, there's really only the first reason.'' In Hong Kong, individual income tax maxes out at 15 percent, and many businesses operate under tax-free status. 
And of course, nearly everyone at Boot HK had been seduced by the proximity to China, the biggest market in the world. There was a college kid from Berkeley who was vaguely interested in starting ''some sort of social-networking site.'' There was a guy from Nebraska who also wanted to create a social-networking site -- this one for industrial manufacturing companies. Seated next to me was a half-drunk Chinese-American investment banker, who seemed to have come only to drink Boot HK's liquor and berate the young and hopeful. About 20 minutes in, he interrupted the lecture, stood up and demanded that everyone explain why, for God's sake, they would ever want to start their own companies. After it was clear that nobody wanted to answer, he pointed at a woman and said, ''You start.''
Most of the boot campers ended up saying they wanted to found Hong Kong's Groupon, Hong Kong's Zynga or Hong Kong's Yelp, in the hope that they could cross over to the Chinese market. The investment banker rolled his eyes after each response, clearly agitated by the collective lack of imagination.
Then came Fredy Harianto. When the question of why he wanted to start his own company got to him, he leaned forward onto his elbows and started yelling: ''I am so tired of everyone saying that the Chinese people are not creative and that everything they are doing is a copy of American Internet companies. They are right!'' The room went silent.
When the lecture finally ended, the entrepreneurs milled around, forcing eye contact and passing out business cards.
Before he left, I asked Harianto if he would meet me for lunch. The next day, we walked up the steep, narrow incline of Wyndham Street in central Hong Kong because he said the best dumplings in the city were somewhere around some corner. We found the place down an alley lined with English pubs in the expat district called Soho. A woman came from behind the counter and yelled at us in Cantonese before throwing two laminated menus onto the table and stalking off. ''The people of Hong Kong are very rude, but I still love them,'' Harianto said. ''No. 1: They are my people. No. 2: They are very motivated to succeed.''
Over lunch, he talked mostly about American movies. During a brief period of unemployment last year, he downloaded ''The Social Network,'' which opens with the line, ''There are more people with genius I.Q.'s living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States.'' Over the next three months, Harianto watched the opening scene as many as 10 times a day. ''Those words were chilling to my spine,'' he explained. ''I saw what Mark Zuckerberg said as a calling to the Chinese people. If there are so many geniuses in China, we should broadcast that genius to the rest of the world.''
To achieve this goal, Harianto scraped together $7,500 to start offilink.com, a social-networking site he describes as the perfect mix of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. In Hong Kong, all forms of commerce are fueled by the tinder of billions of business cards. The exchange of cards is reflexive and ceremonial: two hands when presenting and two hands when accepting, each and every time you meet someone whose station in life might be equal to or greater than your own. Within a week of arriving in Hong Kong, I was finding them everywhere -- between the pages of my notebooks, in every pocket, in between the sheets of my bed. Harianto's idea: Take all these business cards and put them online.
Everyone I talked to in Hong Kong, from the billionaire clothing manufacturers to the unionized domestic workers, buzzed with a similar ambition. Just as everyone who moves to San Diego considers learning how to surf, nobody comes to Hong Kong without, at some point, considering some entrepreneurial endeavor. It was easy to see how Harianto, still spearing his dumplings in the empty restaurant, got so wrapped up in the idea of success.
''Offilink has to start here, in Hong Kong,'' he explained. ''This is the place the world looks to for leadership in business.''

HEADLINE: Nice Guy Finishing Last

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
PEPPERONI and flatulence. That's what Jon Huntsman was reduced to. Groveling for attention at the Republican debate last week, he fired off one joke, a tasty one, about 9-9-9 sounding more like the price of a pizza than the contours of a tax plan. He fired off another joke, less savory, about Washington as a font of natural gas. He meant bloated and meaningless rhetoric -- at least I think he did -- but still. Some metaphors just aren't worth it.
Forget 9-9-9; someone call 9-1-1. Huntsman has flat-lined. It actually happened a while back -- a few nanoseconds after his campaign began, to be precise -- but until recently it was possible to hold out hope for resuscitation. No more. His steadfastly abysmal poll numbers suggest that nearly four months since he announced his candidacy, you'd be hard-pressed to find enough Huntsman supporters to occupy so much as a dinghy bobbing in the water near Wall Street.
The contrast between the promise of his debut and the reality of his denouement is stunning, one of the 2012 election cycle's most interesting arcs. One of its most illuminating, too. Sometimes the losers tell us as much as the winners. In that sense alone, Huntsman is a spirited chatterbox. 
For starters he proves the limits of the mainstream news media's sway. He got a dazzling sunburst of attention at the outset, including a lengthy profile in this newspaper's Sunday Magazine, and the pundits salivated and swooned. On the MSNBC news show ''Morning Joe,'' Mark Halperin told his rapt tablemates that he was ''blown away'' by an early Huntsman swing through New Hampshire. The messiah had come, and voters were instructed to worship him.
They didn't. Not then. Not ever. Instead they flirted with Michele Bachmann and then two-stepped with Rick Perry before high-fiving Herman Cain, even though that tax plan of his sounds more like numerology than economics. Cain was polling well above 15 percent nationally by the time reporters and pundits fully got around to him. Turns out he didn't need us. Huntsman has been lucky to get 3 percent, and in some polls makes do with 2 or 1. Factor in the margin of error and he's in negative integers. Nifty trick, that.
Much has been made of the hurdle he faces as a moderate in a primary system that rewards staunchly conservative views. Not enough has been made of how odd the definition of moderate has become. Huntsman opposes abortion rights. It's not same-sex marriage he favors, just civil unions. Yes, he believes in climate change, but that doesn't make him moderate. More like sentient. And when candidates at the Ames, Iowa, debate were asked if they'd accept a deficit reduction plan with $1 in tax increases for every $10 in spending cuts, he stood with the pack in saying no. Taxes were out of the question. Moderate? Only by the warped yardstick of these wacky days.
He has other problems, anyway. Primary candidates don't just campaign against one another. They audition to campaign against the other party's nominee. And from his announcement speech forward, Huntsman has demonstrated a palpable hesitation to take on President Obama, who gave him his last job, as ambassador to China.
''I don't think you need to run down someone's reputation in order to run for the office of president,'' Huntsman said in that speech, adding: ''I respect the president of the United States.'' I wish we lived in a country where that sort of gentility and civility was the political norm. We don't, and we haven't for quite some time. That's something else Huntsman's failure has proved.
He has been naive, perhaps because he is new to this. Though Obama and George W. Bush hit presidential pay dirt their first times out, it usually helps to have gone down the road before, and Mitt Romney is a textbook example. For this presidential bid, his second, he has honed precisely the clarity of message and relentlessness of attack that Huntsman can't muster and that he himself lacked four years ago. It's funny: Romney says you should vote for him because he's fundamentally a creature of the private sector and politics isn't his vocation. But it's his time in politics that has made him the poised, forceful campaigner of the current election cycle. He's now effective as a self-styled outsider only because he has been an insider.
Every Republican presidential candidate who has had brief or sustained success over the last four months -- Romney, Bachmann, Perry, Cain -- has come across as someone with clear-cut answers, no matter how far-fetched, and a distaste for equivocation or compromise. These contenders are all certainty, no doubt. To the extent that Romney hasn't yet sealed the deal, it may well be because he still has too strong a whiff of reason and wishy-washiness about him. For all his painstaking tailoring, passion is a suit that even now fits him awkwardly. It doesn't accommodate his chromosomal pocket kerchief.
The current climate's all wrong for Huntsman's fundamentally cool-headed approach. He's not just a fish out of water; he's a hapless porpoise in the Sahara. This is the red hot moment of Occupy Wall Street on the left and the Tea Party on the right. And the two movements are indeed linked, in that both feed off a growing fear and sense of dislocation in Americans who feel, rightly, that the world's order has shifted, the game's rules have changed and playing, let alone winning, is harder than before.
Many of them want a leader whose emotional temperature validates their own sense of urgency. Obama has obviously concluded as much. After a brutal summer of bitter compromise, he's growing more and more incendiary. Brimstone is his best bet.
Huntsman, the ex-diplomat, placed his own early wager on calmness and nuance, and that has made all the difference. He has tried over time to fire himself up and dumb himself down; according to a University of Minnesota breakdown of recent debates, he shot off more gibes and zingers than most of his rivals. But to my eyes he could never get comfortable doing it and at times looked slightly abashed.
It's as if he's still somewhat confounded by the oversimplified discussion he has joined and the underwhelming company he's keeping. You can't really blame him. But you can pretty much kiss him goodbye.

 BODY:
Buoyed by the longevity of the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Manhattan, a wave of protests swept across Asia, the Americas and Europe on Saturday, with hundreds and in some cases thousands of people expressing discontent with the economic tides in marches, rallies and occasional clashes with the police.
In Rome, a rally thick with tension spread over several miles. Small groups of restive young people turned a largely peaceful protest into a riot, setting fire to at least one building and a police van and clashing with police officers, who responded with water cannons and tear gas. The police estimated that dozens of protesters had been injured, along with 26 law enforcement officials; 12 people were arrested.
At least 88 people were arrested in New York, including 24 accused of trespassing in a Greenwich Village branch of Citibank and 45 during a raucous rally of thousands of people in and around Times Square. More than 1,000 people filled Washington Square Park at night, but almost all of them left after dozens of police officers with batons and helmets streamed through the arch and warned that they would be enforcing a midnight curfew. Fourteen were arrested for remaining in the park. 
Other than Rome's, the demonstrations across Europe were largely peaceful, with thousands of people marching past ancient monuments and gathering in front of capitalist symbols like the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Similar scenes unfolded across cities on several continents, including in Sydney, Australia; Tokyo; Hong Kong; Toronto; Chicago; and Los Angeles, where several thousand people marched to City Hall as passing drivers honked their support.
But just as the rallies in New York have represented a variety of messages -- signs have been held in opposition to President Obama yards away from signs in support of him -- so did Saturday's protests contain a grab bag of sentiments, opposing nuclear power, political corruption and the privatization of water.
Yet despite the difference in language, landscape and scale, the protests were united in frustration with the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
''I have no problem with capitalism,'' Herbert Haberl, 51, said in Berlin. ''But I find the way the financial system is functioning deeply unethical . We shouldn't bail out the banks. We should bail out the people.''
In New York, where the occupation of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan was moving into its second month, a large crowd marched north early Saturday afternoon to Washington Square Park, where it was joined by several hundred college students who decried, among other things, student debt and unemployment.
In late afternoon, the crowds marched up Avenue of the Americas toward a heavily barricaded Times Square, beseeching onlookers to join in with cries of ''You are the 99 percent.''
At Times Square, they convened with thousands of other protesters and caught hundreds of tourists unawares. ''We thought they were going to stay down on Wall Street,'' said Sandi Bernard -- who is 59 and was visiting from Waldorf, Md. -- while wondering if she would have trouble making the 8 p.m. curtain call for ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.''
Some tourists pumped their fists and whooped from atop double-decker sightseeing buses as the protesters cheered back. To keep 42nd Street clear the police shunted marchers up to 46th Street, where officers and the pressed-in masses had several run-ins. At one point the police pushed the barricades in toward the crowd, and the crowd pushed back. At another point two mounted officers moved their horses briefly into the throng.
Three people were arrested trying to take down barricades, the police said. Later, as officers tried to disperse people east on 46th Street, 42 people who the police said defied their orders were taken away, in plastic handcuffs, in three police wagons. One witness, Harry Kaback, a 26-year-old comic selling tickets to the Ha! comedy club, said the protesters were ''getting rowdy'' with the police and shouting in their faces.
For the protesters, marching on Times Square held almost as much significance as did protesting against Wall Street.
''Times Square represents business as usual -- buy, buy, buy in this economic climate, watch the latest show,'' said Elias Holtz, 29, a Web designer who lives in Bushwick, Brooklyn. ''But the crisis is everywhere.''
The protest moved back to Washington Square Park, where people listened to speeches and debated whether to stay while police officers marched down Fifth Avenue and into the square. One officer gave a warning as midnight approached: ''The park closes at 2400 hours. You can exit to the east, west or south. You have 10 minutes.''
Virtually everyone chose to leave, and it was unclear if anyone was arrested. Many headed back to Zuccotti Park, where there is no curfew.
Earlier, about a dozen protesters entered a Chase branch in Lower Manhattan and withdrew their money from the bank while 300 other people circled the block, some shouting chants and beating on drums. The former Chase customers, who declined to reveal how much they had in their accounts -- though a few acknowledged it was not much -- said they planned to put their money into smaller banks or credit unions.
''The more resources we give to small institutions, the more they'll be able to provide conveniences like free A.T.M.'s and streamlined online banking so they can compete with the larger banks,'' said Hannah Appel, 33, a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University.
Five people wearing masks were arrested during the march to Times Square for ''loitering with masks,'' said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, an apparent reference to an old state law prohibiting masked gatherings (the law does not apply to masquerade parties).
And two dozen people were arrested at a Citibank branch on LaGuardia Place on trespassing charges.
Some witnesses said that the protesters had tried to leave but were locked inside by bank employees. ''They were trying to leave, but they wouldn't let them,'' said Meaghan Linick, 23, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. She said one woman who had been inside and left was forced back inside by police officers.
Citibank, in a statement, said the protesters ''were very disruptive and refused to leave after being repeatedly asked, causing our staff to call 911.'' The statement continued, ''The police asked the branch staff to close the branch until the protesters could be removed.''
In Washington, several hundred people marched through downtown, beginning in the early morning, passing by several banks. Escorted by the police, the marchers also demonstrated in front of the White House and the Treasury Department before moving on to a rally on the National Mall, where they were joined by representatives of unions and other supporters.
''You see how people are beholden to corporate interests no matter how hard you might have worked to get them elected,'' said Kelly Mears, 24, a former software engineer. ''There is a disconnect.''
Saturday's protests sprang not only from the Occupy Wall Street movement that began last month in New York, but also from demonstrations in Spain in May. This weekend, the global protest effort came as finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 industrialized nations meet in Paris to discuss economic issues, including ways to tackle Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
Tens of thousands of protesters assembled in Madrid on Saturday evening, when chants mingled with live music, including a rendition of Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' lending the downtown area an upbeat feel on an unusually balmy fall afternoon.
Brief clashes were reported in London, where the police were out in force with dozens of riot vans, canine units and hundreds of officers. But the gathering, attended by people of all ages, was largely peaceful, with a picnic atmosphere and people streaming in and out of a nearby Starbucks.
The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, made an appearance when a crowd assembled in front of St. Paul's Cathedral. To loud cheers, Mr. Assange called the protest movement ''the culmination of a dream.''
In Rome, the protests Saturday were as much about the growing dissatisfaction with the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who narrowly survived a vote of confidence on Friday, as they were about global financial inequities. Tens of thousands of people turned out for what started as peaceful protests and then devolved into ugly violence. The windows of shops and banks were smashed, a police van was destroyed, and some Defense Ministry offices were set alight.
''We don't feel represented by the government. We feel made fun of,'' Alessia Tridici, 18, said in Rome. ''We're upset because we don't have prospects for the future. We'll never see a pension. We'll have to work until we die.''

 BODY:
HEMINGWAY IN LOVE: Ernest Hemingway has been having a tough few months. First, he gets slapped around in Paula McLain's best-/selling revenge novel ''The Paris Wife,'' which retells the story of his years in France from the point of view of his jilted first wife, Hadley Richardson. Then he's mocked in Woody Allen's ''Midnight in Paris'' as a self-serious blowhard. But a little bit of rehabilitation is on the way, thanks to ''Hemingway's Boat,'' Paul Hendrickson's sympathetic biography (new at No. 14 on the hardcover nonfiction list), not to mention the first installment of Hemingway's complete letters, just out from Cambridge University Press. 
That project, which includes previously unseen materials from the Finca Vigia, Hemingway's estate outside Havana, reminds us why we fell in love with the guy to begin with -- or at least why Hadley did, even if his spelling and grammar weren't always so hot. The book -- the first of a projected 16 volumes -- includes his earliest recorded love letter to ''Hash,'' written a few days before Christmas 1920. (Hadley burned most of his letters to her after they divorced in 1927.) ''You can make me jealous -- and you can hurt most awfully -- 'cause my loving you is a chink in the armour of telling the world to go to hell and you can thrust a sword into it at any time,'' Hemingway wrote, before explaining why he hadn't kissed her goodbye on the train platform. ''Lord -- I thot I was loving you -- If I wasnt I never could and never would love any one. Guess I was thinking too much about how I didn't want you to go -- Don't you believe I love you? . . . I didn't want to kiss you goodbye -- that was the trouble -- I wanted to kiss you good night -- and there's a lot of difference.''
REVOLUTIONARY READING: The anti-Wall Street protests that started in downtown Manhattan may lack a coherent set of demands, but they do have a lending library stocked with titles like ''Howl,'' ''Leaves of Grass,'' Noam Chomsky's ''Profit Over People'' and Curtis Sittenfeld's ''Prep'' (huh?), not to mention a dedicated newspaper, The Occupied Wall Street Journal. But exhausted demonstrators looking for the lightest reading they can find, at least in the literal sense, might want to pick up Joshua Glenn and Mark Kingwell's ''Wage Slave's Glossary,'' a nifty pocket-size volume also spotted on the shelves in Zuccotti Park. A follow-/up to the authors' ''Idler's Glossary,'' the book provides energized Marxists and depressed Dilberts alike a witty guide to terms like ''air family'' (the false sense of community among co-workers), ''afternoon farmer'' (19th-/century slang for someone who wastes the entire morning), ''keeping up with the Joneses'' (the title of a popular cartoon that first appeared in 1913) and ''on the wallaby'' (Australian for ''tramping the country on foot, looking for work''), not to mention more self-explanatory terms. (''Bossnapping,'' anyone?) Glenn, who has been following the protests from Boston via the Twitter hashtag #OccupyWallStreet, said he wished he could make a few revisions. ''The first term is '99ers,' referring to out-of-work Americans who have exhausted their 99 weeks of unemployment benefits,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''But if the book were being published this month, instead of last month, the term would be '99 percenters,' referring to the diffuse, leaderless resistance movement's statement: 'The one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent.' I agree with those pundits who've said the '99 percent' line is the one really persuasive idea coming out of the movement, so far. Also, the wearethe99percent Tumblr is excellent stuff.''

HEADLINE: For Romney, a Role of Faith and Authority

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
BELMONT, Mass. -- In ticking off his credentials on the campaign trail -- management consultant, businessman, governor -- Mitt Romney omits what may have been his most distinctive post: Mormon lay leader, offering pastoral guidance on all manner of human affairs from marriage to divorce, abortion, adoption, addiction, unemployment and even business disputes.
Bryce Clark was a recipient of Mr. Romney's spiritual advice. Late one summer night in 1993, distraught over his descent into alcoholism and drug use, Mr. Clark, then a 19-year-old college student, decided to confess that he had strayed from his Mormon faith. So he drove through this well-heeled Boston suburb to Mr. Romney's secluded seven-bedroom home.
As the highest-ranking Mormon leader in Boston, Mr. Romney was responsible for determining whether Mr. Clark was spiritually fit for a mission, a rite of passage for young Mormon men. Mr. Clark had previously lied to him, insisting that he was eligible to go. But instead of condemnation that night, Mr. Clark said, Mr. Romney offered counsel that the younger man has clung to for years. 
''He told me that, as human beings, our work isn't measured by taking the sum of our good deeds and the sum of our bad deeds and seeing how things even out,'' recalled Mr. Clark, now 37, sober and working as a filmmaker in Utah. ''He said, 'The only thing you need to think about is: Are you trying to improve, are you trying to do better? And if you are, then you're a saint.' ''
That encounter with Mr. Clark provides a rare glimpse into the way Mr. Romney -- now a Republican candidate for president -- expresses his faith and exercised authority as a religious leader. From 1981 through 1994, he was a powerful figure in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is run almost entirely by volunteers beyond its headquarters in Salt Lake City.
First as bishop of his own congregation, and later as Boston ''stake president,'' overseeing a region akin to a Roman Catholic diocese, he operated as clergyman, organization man and defender of the faith, guiding the church through a tumultuous period of rapid growth.
He confronted anti-Mormon sentiment and management challenges, supervising youth programs, the church's social welfare system, missionary training and outreach to Hispanic, Portuguese and Southeast Asian converts, including Cambodian and Laotian refugees whose teenagers were joining the church in droves.
Later, when his official duties were complete, he contributed handsomely to the construction of the grand -- and controversial -- Boston Temple, high on a hilltop in Belmont, its steeple topped by a golden angel, just minutes from the Romney home. ''Mitt's Temple,'' some local residents called it derisively.
Some Mormons, like Mr. Clark, found Mr. Romney thoughtful and compassionate; one mother recalled his kindness to her dying son. Others, including a group of Mormon feminists demanding a greater role for women, found him condescending, doctrinaire or just plain bossy. He clashed with a married mother of four who sought to terminate a pregnancy; the incident made news years later, when Mr. Romney ran for United States Senate as a supporter of abortion rights -- a position he has since abandoned.
''Mitt is the type who liked to be called Bishop Romney or President Romney,'' said Judy Dushku, a professor of government at Suffolk University in Boston and a Mormon feminist leader. ''He is very conscious of his place in the hierarchy, but not yours.''
Mr. Romney declined to be interviewed for this article. Facing a primary electorate in which Christian conservatives are a powerful force, he is trying to keep his religion from becoming a barrier to his election. When his faith has become an issue -- a Texas pastor supporting a rival candidate recently proclaimed Mormonism ''a cult'' -- Mr. Romney has not offered a full-throated defense, but instead called for civility.
But here in Belmont, where Mormons estimate their population at 500 in a town of 25,000, Mr. Romney's fellow congregants, many of them professionals and academics, are accustomed to hearing him talk of his beliefs. Mr. Romney has traded his large home for a townhouse; just a few months ago, he stepped to the lectern during a Sunday service to deliver what Tony Kimball, a retired professor of government, called a ''traditional Mormon testimony,'' in which he proclaimed his faith in Jesus as his savior.
Mr. Kimball, a close aide when Mr. Romney was stake president, says culture, rather than political calculus, may keep candidate Romney from talking about faith. ''It's kind of considered bad form by a lot of Mormons to wear it on your lapel,'' he said, ''and Mitt is not that way.''
Deep Church Roots
Mr. Romney has an impeccable Mormon pedigree. His family traces its church lineage to 1837; a great-great-grandfather, Miles Romney, began following the first Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, that year, and later trekked to Utah with the early Mormon pioneers. As son of one of the nation's most prominent Mormons -- George W. Romney, a former Michigan governor and presidential candidate -- Mitt Romney seemed destined for a prominent position in the church.
In 1971, Mr. Romney arrived in Boston to attend a joint program at the Harvard Business and Law Schools. He had completed a Mormon mission in France, graduated from Brigham Young University and was already married with a son. On weekends, he and other young Mormons would take overnight bus trips to the nearest Mormon temple, outside Washington, to perform sacred rituals, like baptism for the dead.
''Most of us would yak or sleep on the bus, or read a book,'' recalled one of the participants, Helen Claire Sievers. ''Mitt was always working.''
It was an early hint of the intensity and business acumen that would make Mr. Romney rich as the founder of Bain Capital, a Boston-based private equity firm. He used those same skills, in salesmanship, deal making, organization, networking and public relations, as a steward of the church.
He was highly motivated and ''hands-on,'' said Philip Barlow, a professor at Utah State University, who as a graduate student was one of Mr. Romney's top aides as bishop. If somebody's roof leaked, Mr. Romney would show up with a ladder to fix it. Mr. Barlow remembers Mr. Romney picking butternut squash and yanking weeds on the church's communal farm.
When young Southeast Asian converts began joining gangs, Mr. Romney set up small storefront churches in rough areas of town, with the hope of drawing them back. When the approach did not work, he shut the branches down. Every other Sunday, he convened his high council -- akin to a president's cabinet -- to discuss operational matters.
''He would run it like a business, and he would listen to us,'' said Mick Watson, a Brandeis University graduate school dean and one of the councilors. ''But Mitt, of course, was in charge -- he was always in charge.''
That take-charge attitude sometimes rankled in a setting where people yearned for consensus.
Ron Scott, a journalist and Mormon who has written a forthcoming biography of Mr. Romney, remembered how, when he moved to Boston, Mr. Romney asked him to run public affairs for the church -- and then proceeded to tell him precisely how to do the job. ''He had more of an imperious approach,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He wanted to direct everything.''
Yet he proved himself an effective salesman for his faith. Shortly after he became bishop, at age 34, with five young sons, the church announced plans for a new meetinghouse in Belmont, on a wooded, 14-acre plot. Townspeople were suspicious. ''The tenor was, 'The Mormons are moving in,' '' said Grant Bennett, who succeeded Mr. Romney as bishop. In 1984, with the construction almost complete, the meetinghouse burned down. Officials suspected arson.
Soon Mr. Romney was flooded with offers from other churches wanting to lend their buildings. Sensing an opportunity to strengthen community ties, he accepted them all, and the Mormons of Belmont rotated from one house of worship to another for a year while theirs was being rebuilt.
It was not the last time Mr. Romney would try to smooth church-town relations. In 1996, church leaders in Salt Lake announced plans for a granite temple -- 94,000 square feet with six soaring spires -- on a hilltop adjacent to the Belmont meetinghouse. (Unlike Mormon meetinghouses, Mormon temples are reserved for sacred ceremonies, and non-Mormons may step no farther than the lobby.) Incensed neighbors filed suit.
Mr. Romney, fearing he would become a lightning rod after his Senate loss to Edward M. Kennedy in 1994, kept a relatively low profile. He and his wife, Ann, hosted meetings in their home so the neighbors could meet the architects, and perhaps sort their differences out. He spoke in favor of the project at a public hearing. His tithe -- Mormons are expected to give the church 10 percent of their income -- helped foot the $30 million bill.
But mostly, said Scott Ferson, a public relations executive (and former Kennedy aide) who helped calm tensions, Mr. Romney functioned as high-level adviser, a liaison between Boston and Salt Lake. The project was eventually built, albeit on a smaller scale.
''He was kind of a Big Mormon,'' Mr. Ferson said of Mr. Romney. ''A lot of people would say, 'Let's see what Mitt thinks.' ''
Hewing the Line
As a Senate candidate, Mr. Romney angered higher-ups in Salt Lake with his independent stance on abortion; he said that he was personally opposed, but favored laws allowing women to choose. But earlier as a church leader, he hewed much more closely to the official Mormon view.
Mormons oppose abortion, except in extreme cases like rape, incest or where the life of the woman is in danger -- and require that church elders be consulted. In 1990, Exponent II, a Mormon feminist magazine that Ms. Dushku, the Suffolk University professor, helped found, published an article by a married mother of four who recounted her own experience after doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy when she was being treated for a potentially dangerous blood clot.
Her bishop got wind of the situation, she wrote, and showed up unannounced at the hospital, warning her sternly not to go forward. The article did not identify Mr. Romney as the bishop, but Ms. Dushku later did.
Now the woman has come forward, identifying herself in Mr. Scott's book as Carrel Hilton Sheldon. (Through Ms. Dushku, she declined to be interviewed.) ''Mitt has many, many winning qualities,'' she is quoted as saying, ''but at the time he was blind to me as a human being.''
Ms. Dushku sees hypocrisy and callousness; Mr. Scott sees inexperience.
''I don't think he's an evil, unfeeling, uncaring kind of guy,'' Mr. Scott said. ''He was a brand new bishop, he was pretty young to begin with, my sense is he was pretty full of himself, and he thought that he would not fulfill his obligation as bishop if he didn't press the matter.''
But if Mr. Romney was blind in that instance, his time as an ecclesiastical leader may have also opened his eyes. Having been raised in wealth and privilege, he was now exposed to hardship and human suffering, especially among Boston's immigrant populations. ''I had no idea people lived this way,'' Mr. Barlow recalls him saying.
A Reserved Demeanor
Ted Oparowski, a retired firefighter, and his wife, Pat, a secretary, still praise Mr. Romney for ministering to their 14-year-old son, David, who was dying of cancer three decades ago.
The boy, upon hearing that Mr. Romney was a lawyer, asked him to help draft a will, so that he might leave something to each of his friends. Mr. Romney pulled out a legal pad, and together they wrote one up. Later, he gave the eulogy at the boy's funeral.
If Mr. Romney, who no longer holds an official church title, seems overly polished or wooden on the campaign trail, his defenders say that is just how he is, reserved yet caring. ''He's always been that way, that's his demeanor,'' Mrs. Oparowski said.
Because the church imposes such heavy volunteer obligations on its members, much of Mr. Romney's work involved functioning as a cheerleader to keep things up and running. When a congregant asked to be released from his church duties during a difficult divorce, Mr. Romney said no; he did not want to send a message that divorced people could not serve.
When Clayton Christensen, a Harvard business professor, and his wife, Christine, felt overwhelmed by church obligations, Mr. Romney showed up unexpectedly at the door. With three young children, Mr. Christensen was in charge of missionary work; his wife ran the relief society, ministering to Boston's poor.
''He said, 'I was just driving home from work, and I had a feeling that I needed to stop by and tell you that God loves you.' '' Mr. Christensen was so moved, he recalled, that he wept.
On the night in 1993 that Mr. Clark, the filmmaker, arrived at the Romney home here, Mr. Romney greeted him in a white business shirt, dress slacks and bedroom slippers. He was waiting at the door; the young man's parents had called ahead.
The Clarks and the Romneys had been close for years -- Mr. Clark's father, Kim, now president of Brigham Young University's campus in Rexburg, Idaho, was then dean of the Harvard Business School -- and Mr. Romney had been the family's ''home teacher.'' For nearly a decade, he made monthly visits to the Clark home, checking on the family's welfare and serving up Gospel lessons to the seven Clark children.
The Romney house, Mr. Clark remembers, was quiet. Mr. Romney ushered him into the library, and they spoke for more than an hour. ''He talked a lot about the Savior, and what the atonement means,'' Mr. Clark said. ''He said, 'I just want you to know you are not alone.' ''
In the months and years that followed, Mr. Romney wrote the young man notes of encouragement, frequently reminding him of what he had said that summer night, about always ''trying to improve.'' Mr. Clark says he still has them.

HEADLINE: Limits on Collective Bargaining Face Fierce Repeal Fight in Ohio

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- ''Hi, Teresa,'' said Phil Hayes, a high school social studies teacher. ''I'm voting no on Senate Bill 5 because it can make my class size larger and can make it harder for me to be a teacher.''
That was how Mr. Hayes plunged into yet another call as he and a dozen other union members at a labor phone bank made hundreds of calls to urge Ohioans to repeal one of Gov. John R. Kasich's signal achievements: the enactment of Senate Bill 5, a law that weakens public employees' bargaining rights.
The push to repeal the law, enacted by the Republican-led legislature in March, will be one of the biggest battles in the country this Election Day, with the law's supporters and opponents expected to spend in total more than $20 million in the fight. 
Supporters say the law is vital to curb labor's power and to hold down state and local compensation costs during an era of increasing budget deficits. But opponents -- who collected 1.3 million signatures to place the repeal vote on the Nov. 8 ballot -- say the law unfairly scapegoats public employees, and weakens unions, a powerful ally of the Democrats.
''As someone who set out to serve his students, I don't work on Wall Street; I serve Main Street,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''I didn't cause the economic and financial problems caused by Wall Street, but now public employees like me have to suffer the consequences. We don't sell collateral debt obligations, but we do sell cookies to help keep our schools going.''
In dozens of towns across Ohio, rival sides have set up phone banks and door-knocking efforts. Unions and their allies have created We Are Ohio, a group that is leading the repeal effort, which has 10,000 volunteers and hopes a victory will discourage Republicans in other states from adopting anti-union legislation. Mr. Kasich's allies have created Building a Better Ohio, financed by business and conservative donors, to block repeal.
In many ways Senate Bill 5 goes further than the antibargaining law that Wisconsin's Republican-led Legislature enacted in March over the protests of tens of thousands of union supporters. Ohio's law allows only limited bargaining: If management and union do not reach a settlement, then city councils and school boards can impose their side's final contract offer unilaterally. The Ohio law bans binding arbitration and bargaining on health coverage, pensions or staffing levels. It also requires government workers to pay at least 15 percent of their health insurance costs and pay 10 percent of their salaries toward their pensions.
The Ohio Senate president, Thomas E. Niehaus, who is campaigning against repeal, said, ''These are reasonable reforms asking our public sector employees to do what private sector employees have been doing for decades: paying more for their health care and their pension benefits.'' He denied that the bill eviscerated collective bargaining. ''We are reforming collective bargaining,'' he said.
But one prominent Republican opponent of Senate Bill 5, State Senator Bill Seitz, said the bill all but erased collective bargaining by letting management decide which side's final offer would prevail. He said it was like ''going to divorce court and finding out your wife's father is the judge.''
A Quinnipiac poll in late September found that Ohioans favor repeal by a 13 percentage point margin, 51 percent to 38 percent, down from a 24 percentage point margin in July. Opponents of repeal say they have significantly narrowed the gap since they began broadcasting advertisements after Labor Day.
As one of their most powerful arguments, opponents of Senate Bill 5 say the law will jeopardize public safety by no longer letting firefighters and police bargain over staffing levels.
A union-backed television commercial shows 3-year-old Zoey Quinn slumped on a Cincinnati firefighter's arm as he rescued her from her family's burning house. The advertisement warns that firefighters might not be able to save Zoey next time, because the law bars bargaining over minimum staffing levels.
Zoey's great-grandmother, Marlene Quinn, says in the advertisement, ''I don't want the politicians in Columbus making decisions for the firefighters, police, teachers, nurses or any organization that's helping people. Fewer firefighters can mean the difference between life or death.''
Ms. Quinn is now at the center of a controversy because the side fighting the repeal has run a broadcast advertisement using her words, without her permission, and then goes on to say that without Senate Bill 5 there will be more layoffs of firemen. Repeal supporters say that is twisting her sentiments.
Jeff Berding, a former member of the Cincinnati City Council and one of the most outspoken Democratic supporters of Senate Bill 5, said the union-backed ads were misleading, arguing that government officials would never ignore safety concerns. ''You're not going to have elected officials do things that are terribly unfair to firefighters and police and jeopardizing public safety,'' he said. ''Officials want the firefighters and police endorsing them in the next election.''
He said he backed Senate Bill 5 because ''I want some options besides raising taxes and laying off police and firefighters.'' He said government officials often had little recourse but to increase taxes or dismiss public employees, thereby cutting public services, because unions, usually dominated by more senior workers, often refuse to make concessions. Union leaders recognize that concessions would hurt the more senior workers, while in a financial shortfall resulting from unions' not granting concessions, those laid off would be the more junior workers. Senate Bill 5 allows government to lay off workers outside of seniority.
Tim Burga, the president of the Ohio State A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Senate Bill 5 was an assault on the state's 360,000 public employees and was based on numerous misunderstandings. He said that many government employees already contributed heavily toward their health and pension costs, and that many had accepted wage freezes to help cut budget deficits.
''This shows that collective bargaining works,'' Mr. Burga said. ''I've never seen an issue catch fire like this. You look at the 1.3 million signatures we collected and the outpouring of opposition because this was such a blatant politically motivated attack. The energy is there on our side.''
Mack D.Mariani, a professor of political science at Xavier University in Cincinnati, said an unrelated issue on the Ohio ballot would hurt the repeal effort. The Tea Party is backing a proposed state constitutional amendment that would let Ohioans opt out of the mandatory requirements of the health law that Congressional Democrats enacted last year. That should lead to higher-than-normal conservative turnout, undercutting labor's repeal effort.
''Right now, the unions are definitely winning the ground game in terms of getting people on the streets, knocking on doors,'' Mr. Mariani said. ''If the unions win, it will certainly be seen as a big blow for Kasich.''
Many union leaders and Democrats say that if they win the repeal vote, that should give President Obama momentum in Ohio in the 2012 elections, a pivotal swing state. But if Mr. Kasich's allies prevail, then Ohio Republicans will have a lot to crow about going into 2012.

HEADLINE: Where Did Global Warming Go?

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Elisabeth Rosenthal is a reporter and blogger on environmental issues for The New York Times.
IN 2008, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for president, Barack Obama and John McCain, warned about man-made global warming and supported legislation to curb emissions. After he was elected, President Obama promised ''a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change,'' and arrived cavalry-like at the 2009 United Nations Climate Conference in Copenhagen to broker a global pact.
But two years later, now that nearly every other nation accepts climate change as a pressing problem, America has turned agnostic on the issue.
In the crowded Republican presidential field, most seem to agree with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas that ''the science is not settled'' on man-made global warming, as he said in a debate last month. Alone among Republicans onstage that night, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. said that he trusted scientists' view that the problem was real. At the moment, he has the backing of about 2 percent of likely Republican voters. 
Though the evidence of climate change has, if anything, solidified, Mr. Obama now talks about ''green jobs'' mostly as a strategy for improving the economy, not the planet. He did not mention climate in his last State of the Union address. Meanwhile, the administration is fighting to exempt United States airlines from Europe's new plan to charge them for CO2 emissions when they land on the continent. It also seems poised to approve a nearly 2,000-mile-long pipeline, from Canada down through the United States, that will carry a kind of oil. Extracting it will put relatively high levels of emissions into the atmosphere.
''In Washington, 'climate change' has become a lightning rod, it's a four-letter word,'' said Andrew J. Hoffman, director of the University of Michigan's Erb Institute for Sustainable Development.
Across the nation, too, belief in man-made global warming, and passion about doing something to arrest climate change, is not what it was five years or so ago, when Al Gore's movie had buzz and Elizabeth Kolbert's book about climate change, ''Field Notes From a Catastrophe,'' was a best seller. The number of Americans who believe the earth is warming dropped to 59 percent last year from 79 percent in 2006, according to polling by the Pew Research Group. When the British polling firm Ipsos Mori asked Americans this past summer to list their three most pressing environmental worries, ''global warming/climate change'' garnered only 27 percent, behind even ''overpopulation.''
This fading of global warming from the political agenda is a mostly American phenomenon. True, public enthusiasm for legislation to tackle climate change has flagged somewhat throughout the developed world since the recession of 2008. Nonetheless, in many other countries, legislation to control emissions has rolled out apace. Just last Wednesday, Australia's House of Representatives passed a carbon tax, which is expected to easily clear the country's Senate. Europe's six-year-old carbon emissions trading system continues its yearly expansion. In 2010, India passed a carbon tax on coal. Even China's newest five-year plan contains a limited pilot cap-and-trade system, under which polluters pay for excess pollution.
The United States is the ''one significant outlier'' on responding to climate change, according to a recent global research report produced by HSBC, the London-based bank. John Ashton, Britain's special representative for climate change, said in an interview that ''in the U.K., in Europe, in most places I travel to'' -- but not in the United States -- ''the starting point for conversation is that this is real, there are clear and present dangers, so let's get a move on and respond.'' After watching the Republican candidates express skepticism about global warming in early September, former President Bill Clinton put it more bluntly, ''I mean, it makes us -- we look like a joke, right?''
Americans -- who produce twice the emissions per capita that Europeans do -- are in many ways wired to be holdouts. We prefer bigger cars and bigger homes. We value personal freedom, are suspicious of scientists, and tend to distrust the kind of sweeping government intervention required to confront rising greenhouse gas emissions.
''Climate change presents numerous ideological challenges to our culture and our beliefs,'' Professor Hoffman of the Erb Institute says. ''People say, 'Wait a second, this is really going to affect how we live!' ''
There are, of course, other factors that hardened resistance: America's powerful fossil-fuel industry, whose profits are bound to be affected by any greater control of carbon emissions; a cold American winter in 2010 that made global warming seem less imminent; and a deep recession that made taxes on energy harder to talk about, and job creation a more pressing issue than the environment -- as can be seen in the debate over the pipeline from Canada.
But it is also true that Europe has endured a deep recession and has had mild winters. What's more, some of the loudest climate deniers are English. Yet the European Union is largely on target to meet its goal of reducing emissions by at least 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2020.
Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner on climate action, told me recently: ''Look, it was not a piece of cake here either.''
In fact, many countries in Europe have come to see combating climate change and the move to a ''greener'' economy as about ''opportunities rather than costs,'' Mr. Ashton said. In Britain, the low-carbon manufacturing sector has been one of the few to grow through the economic slump.
''One thing I've been pleasantly surprised about in the E.U. is that despite the economic and financial crisis, the momentum on climate change has more or less continued,'' Mr. Ashton said.
And Conservatives, rather than posing an obstacle, are directing aggressive climate policies in much of the world. Before becoming the European Union's commissioner for climate action, Ms. Hedegaard was a well-known Conservative politician in her native Denmark. In Britain, where a 2008 law required deep cuts in emissions, a coalition Conservative government is now championing a Green Deal.
In the United States, the right wing of the Republican Party has managed to turn skepticism about man-made global warming into a requirement for electability, forming an unlikely triad with antiabortion and gun-rights beliefs. In findings from a Pew poll this spring, 75 percent of staunch conservatives, 63 percent of libertarians and 55 percent of Main Street Republicans said there was no solid evidence of global warming.
''This has become a partisan political issue here in a way it has not elsewhere,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center. ''We are seeing doubts in the U.S. largely because the issue has become a partisan one, with Democrats'' -- 75 percent of whom say they believe there is strong evidence of climate change -- ''seeing one thing and Republicans another.''
Europeans understand the challenges in the United States, though they sound increasingly impatient. ''We are very much aware of the political situation in the United States and we don't say 'do this,' when we know it can't get through Congress,'' said Ms. Hedegaard, when she was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly last month. But she added:
''O.K. if you can't commit today, when can you? When are you willing to join in? Australia is making a cap-and-trade system. South Korea is introducing one. New Zealand and the E.U. have it already. So when is the time? That's the question for the U.S.''
MEANWHILE, in the developing world, emerging economies like India and China are now pursuing aggressive climate policies. ''Two years ago the assumption was that the developed world would have to lead, but now China, India and Brazil have jumped in with enthusiasm, and are moving ahead,'' said Nick Robins of HSBC Global Research.
Buffeted by two years of treacherous weather that they are less able to handle than richer nations -- from floods in India to water shortages in China -- developing countries are feeling vulnerable. Scientists agree that extreme weather events will be more severe and frequent on a warming planet, and insurance companies have already documented an increase.
So perhaps it is no surprise that regard for climate change as ''a very serious problem'' has risen significantly in many developing nations over the past two years. A 2010 Pew survey showed that more than 70 percent of people in China, India and South Korea were willing to pay more for energy in order to address climate change. The number in the United States was 38 percent. China's 12th five-year plan, for 2011-2015, directs intensive investment to low carbon industries. In contrast, in the United States, there is ''no prospect of moving ahead'' at a national legislative level, Mr. Robins said, although some state governments are addressing the issue.
In private, scientific advisers to Mr. Obama say he and his administration remain committed to confronting climate change and global warming. But Robert E. O'Connor, program director for decision, risk and management sciences at the National Science Foundation in Washington, said a bolder leader would emphasize real risks that, apparently, now feel distant to many Americans. ''If it's such an important issue, why isn't he talking about it?''

HEADLINE: Europeans Struggling Toward Debt Solution

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Eric Pfanner contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
PARIS -- European officials said on Saturday that they had moved closer to a comprehensive solution for the debt crisis during a two-day gathering of leaders from the Group of 20 industrial nations, despite a number of unresolved problems that could still widen the scope of the crisis.
With Europe's economic and financial woes weighing on prospects for global growth, officials said they had agreed to take ''all necessary measures needed to stabilize the financial system'' and to contain the troubles. The officials did not provide specifics, but said they were working toward introducing a grand plan at a meeting on Oct. 23 in Brussels. 
The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who along with President Obama has urged the Europeans to move more forcefully to keep the crisis from infecting the global economy, said he was ''encouraged by the direction and speed'' at which the Europeans were moving, and by French and German pledges to find a solution.
''But as you know,'' Mr. Geithner said, the ultimate impact of Europe's efforts is ''all in the details, and it's very hard to judge the impact that something will have until you see it take shape.''
''They clearly have more work to do on strategy and details,'' he added.
European leaders have sharply raised expectations that a comprehensive solution will be introduced by the time the presidents and prime ministers of G-20 nations gather in Cannes, France, in early November to address the troubles in the global economy.
By doing so, they have set a high bar: investors have calmed the wild volatility that hit global stock markets the past couple of months, on the belief that leaders will produce measures to tackle the crisis within weeks.
It remains to be seen whether that trend will reverse if investors are unconvinced that the package will keep the crisis that started in Greece from spreading to Spain and Italy. That is the foremost goal of all the European efforts.
''The results of Oct. 23 will be decisive,'' France's finance minister, Francois Baroin, said at a news conference.
In the search for answers, the International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing the bailout of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, also floated the idea of raising hundreds of billions in new funds from its emerging market and other members. But Europeans want to avoid the perception that they need additional help from the I.M.F., and the plan seemed unlikely to gain traction.
The specter of a downturn in Europe has started to trouble leaders in other countries, including the United States and Britain, where officials have pressed the Europeans to strengthen their rescue fund for weak European economies and banks, and to ensure that the troubles in Greece do not engulf bigger countries like Italy and Spain.
Indeed, while officials pledged unity in fighting the crisis, some thorny divisions still lingered. G-20 leaders said they looked forward to ''further work'' to maximize the impact of the rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, that is meant to keep the sovereign debt crisis in Greece from spreading to other nations and the European banking system at large.
German financial officials continued to express skepticism about expanding the facility, either by injecting additional cash into it, or through other, less conventional means.
Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, said proposals for expanding the effective size of the facility by letting it borrow from the European Central Bank were ''not on the table,'' saying this was against the bank's mandate.
''Of course there are ways of taking advantage of the size of the E.F.S.F. in efficient ways to avert infection, but there is no sense, on the weekend before we have to decide on these things, to speculate about them,'' he added.
After playing down calls by the I.M.F. for Europe's banks to raise more capital, leaders now acknowledge that banks need to set aside hundreds of billions of euros in additional cash. The case became more urgent after Dexia, a troubled French-Belgian lender, had to be bailed out last week, raising questions about the need to recapitalize other banks.

HEADLINE: At Rallies, 2 Candidates Deliver Blistering Attacks on Illegal Immigration

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and EDWARD WYATT; Trip Gabriel reported from Perry, and Ed Wyatt reported from Harriman, Tenn. Julia Preston contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
PERRY, Iowa -- Two Republican candidates vying for of the party's conservative base issued full-throated attacks Saturday on illegal immigration.
Herman Cain, the former business executive who has emerged as a front-runner in some polls, said he would build an electrified fence on the border with Mexico that could kill people who try to cross illegally. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota vowed to make English the government's official language, to build a ''secure double fence'' and to eliminate ''taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.''
Mr. Cain, speaking at a Tea Party-sponsored rally in Tennessee, made some of his most pointed remarks yet on the issue. He said he might use military troops ''with real guns and real bullets'' to stop intruders. 
Responding to anyone who might consider his remarks ''insensitive,'' Mr. Cain said the real fault lies with some illegal immigrants. ''It's insensitive for them to be killing our citizens, killing our border agents,'' he said. ''That's what's insensitive. And that mess has to stop.''
Deploying equally strong language, Mrs. Bachmann gave one of the great stem-winding speeches of her campaign. She described illegal immigration as an economic as well as a security threat. ''This issue cannot be allowed to stand without fighting back,'' she said, drawing applause from a crowd of about 60.
It was no coincidence that she spoke in this Iowa community with the same name as Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. The campaign billed the event as ''Bachmann Takes it to Perry Rally.''
Mr. Perry stole much heat and light from Mrs. Bachmann after entering the Republican presidential race this summer, but since then he has been damaged when conservative voters learned of some immigration policies he advocated in Texas.
Even as he has fallen back in polls nationally and in Iowa, Mrs. Bachmann has not been the beneficiary -- primarily, that has been Mr. Cain.
Mrs. Bachmann's appeal seemed targeted at voters in Iowa, where her campaign has placed most if its bets ahead of the caucuses early next year.
In the speech, she attacked the law Mr. Perry signed in 2001 allowing undocumented students who graduate from a Texas high school to attend a state college on in-state tuition. She said it violates a 1996 federal law.
She also cited figures from a conservative group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, maintaining that illegal immigration costs taxpayers $133 billion a year, most of it spent on education.
This week, some leading conservative evangelical pastors issued an appeal to the Republican candidates to soften their rhetoric and proposals on immigration, warning that the debate was stigmatizing and alienating Hispanics, who have flocked to evangelical churches in recent years. The appeal came from Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention; Matthew D. Staver, dean of the law school at Liberty University; and the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the largest national conference of Hispanic evangelical churches.
Brent A. Wilkes, vice chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, said Mr. Cain's remarks were reflective of increasingly harsh prescriptions offered by the Republican candidates for dealing with illegal immigration.
''These folks who come across the border are at most committing a misdemeanor,'' Mr. Wilkes said. ''To suggest that they would be electrocuted or shot would be to treat them harsher than we treat murderers or rapists.''
Mrs. Bachmann insisted she was not taking aim at Hispanics. It is a matter of fairness, she said. She pointed to her own family of ''honest, hard-working'' Norwegian immigrants, who came to Iowa seven generations ago.
''When they came in, they agreed they'd learn our Constitution, they'd live under the laws of Iowa and the United States, they agreed to learn English and to assimilate into their society.''
''It's high time,'' she said, ''we stand up again unashamedly'' for American values.
Most of the audience applauded. One dissenter who heard her, Eddie Diaz, a resident of Perry, said, ''I'm tired of candidates on both sides using scare tactics against illegal immigrants.''

HEADLINE: City Bike Plan Is Accused Of a Neighborhood Bias

BYLINE: By DAVID LEPESKA. 
david.lepeska@gmail.com

 BODY:
Mayor Rahm Emanuel plans to spend nearly $150 million to make Chicago ''the bike-friendliest city'' in the United States. That challenge is considerable, given Chicago's slow start compared with Portland, Ore., and other bike-centered cities, and Mr. Emanuel's initial plan is drawing complaints about an inequitable distribution of the investment.
The Chicago Department of Transportation's $18 million bike-share program is expected to begin next summer with 3,000 bicycles and 300 rental stations, to be located in areas with dense employment, residential development and retail. The Bloomingdale Trail, to be built in an unused two-and-a-half-mile rail line that runs from Wicker Park to Humboldt Park on the North Side, is expected to cost around $50 million over several years. The city planning commission recently approved designs for a $50 million flyover bridge at Navy Pier, the busiest section of the 15-mile lakefront trail. 
The city's lower-income areas include a protected bike lane on 18th Street in the 25th Ward, and several blocks of another protected bike lane are to be built on Jackson Avenue west of the city's Loop, and sections of the Bloomingdale Trail, a 2.5 mile-long park to be built on an abandoned rail line stretching from Wicker Park to Humboldt Park. The alderman for the 25th Ward, Daniel Solis, is also the chairman of the City Council's zoning committee, and he is traveling to Amsterdam this month at the expense of Bikes Belong, an advocacy group based in Boulder, Colo.
Oboi Reed, a lifelong Chatham resident and founder of the Pioneers Bicycle Club, said Mr. Emanuel is pursuing a good objective, but is on the wrong path.
''I definitely support getting more people on bikes because a lot of the common health problems African-Americans face are a result of not getting enough exercise,'' Mr. Reed said. ''My concern is that the lion's share of the resources are going to go downtown and to the North Side -- the South and West will only see a sprinkling.''
With the city facing a budget deficit of nearly $640 million and a double-digit unemployment rate, Mr. Emanuel may find it difficult to justify spending large amounts on bike facilities.
''It probably isn't going to help many low-income and out-of-work folks,'' said Mark Rank, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who analyzes poverty and inequality. ''You can't spend all your money on a single priority, ignoring transportation or anything else. Given the situation in Chicago, this much spending seems a bit out of whack.''
From 2000 to 2009, the percentage of Chicagoans commuting by bike increased from about 0.5 percent to 1.1 percent. The growth is similar to that seen in other industrial cities like Milwaukee, Detroit and Oakland, Calif., but still lags behind Portland, which tops the United States with 6 percent commuting by bike.
Mr. Emanuel has set a goal of installing 100 miles of protected bike lanes -- at a cost of $28 million -- by the end of his term in 2015. Protected bike lanes are separated from car traffic by cones, curbs or other impediments. Chicago's first protected bike lane opened in July on Kinzie Street. The second lane is to be installed this month, on Jackson Street, with another 20 to be built in the spring -- all in locations chosen by the city.
Sam Schwartz Engineering, a firm based in New York that was hired by Chicago to design a 150- to 250-mile bike lane network, will hold a series of meetings over the next eight months to help determine the best locations for all future bike lanes.
''There's been zero public outreach on where the bike lanes should go,'' said Steven Vance, a former transportation department consultant on bike planning issues and co-founder of GridChicago.com. Mr. Vance said he approved of the city's efforts to increase ridership but questioned the first few bike lane locations.
The lack of outreach could be a concern, according to Alan Berube, research director of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. ''If it's done without public education and public input, there could be some real resistance,'' he said.
Ben Gomberg, the Transportation Department's bike program coordinator, said the city chooses wide streets that either see a lot of bike traffic or connect main arteries. To save money, the department also tries to piggyback on current roadway projects. The city has applied for state support and for federal clean-air financing that could total $50 million.
Mr. Berube said the bike initiatives could help in a city where the unemployment rate is more than 10 percent and nearly one in four residents live in poverty. ''It can connect people to services, to work, and improve their health,'' he said. ''We need more jobs, but we need accessible jobs, too.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Mayor Rahm Emanuel's $150 million plan to make Chicago ''the bike-friendliest city'' in the United States incorrectly stated that a protected bike lane to be built on 18th Street is the only biking-related project slated for lower-income areas. Several blocks of another protected bike lane, to be built on Jackson Avenue west of the city's Loop, and sections of the Bloomingdale Trail, a two-and-a-half-long park to be built on an abandoned rail line from Wicker Park to Humboldt Park, will also be in low-income areas.

HEADLINE: Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me

 BODY:
NPR's ''Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!'' is heard weekends on public radio stations across the country. (npr.org/waitwait)

A. During an intensive seminar on taxes and tax policy at Yale.
B. During a long plane flight.
C. After a convincing visit from the Ghost of Tax Policy Future.
D. While being repeatedly told ''no'' by a pack of German tourists.

A. Mind
B. Composure
C. Religion
D. Right eyebrow
4. According to testimony at the trial of the terrorism suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the crew on his flight in 2009 was first made aware of the threat he posed when a passenger shouted:
A. ''Dude, your pants are on fire!''
B. ''Everybody who's not a terrorist, stand up!''
C. ''Do I smell Semtex?''
D. ''That guy over there has a devious look!''
5. The British soldier Nigel Ely, who served in the early days of the Iraq war, is now auctioning off which piece of war memorabilia?
A. His ''Between Iraq and a Hard Place'' T-shirt
B. A portion of Saddam Hussein's backside

1. (C) He also said, in a debate on economic policy, that we shouldn't be focused on ''whether or not we are going to have this policy or that policy.''
2. (B) They also solved our national defense policy using SkyMall: hide the country under one enormous fake rock so enemies can't find it.
3. (D) It looked as if all the momentum from frowning at the Federal Reserve caused his eyebrow to detach and head to the ground. A spokesman angrily denied the charge of fake eyebrows, blaming the phenomenon on ''a high pollen count.''
4. (A) And they were: Mr. Abdulmutallab confessed to being the Underwear Bomber. Note for people who like upgrades: after his pants bomb failed to explode, he got to spend the rest of the flight in first class.

SEARCHING OF TURBANS
RATTLES AFGHAN MEN
A turban-searching rule at President Hamid Karzai's presidential palace has been rigorously enforced since the chief of Afghanistan's peace process, Burhanuddin Rabbani, was killed by a bomb hidden in the attacker's turban. The searches are seen as deeply intrusive for men in Afghanistan, where turbans carry both religious and social significance. Page 5
FATAL STRIKES HIT YEMEN
Airstrikes, believed to have been carried out by American drones, killed at least nine people in southern Yemen, including a senior official of the regional branch of Al Qaeda and an American, the 17-year-old son of a Qaeda official killed by the United States last month, according to the government and local reports. Fighting also escalated in the capital, Sana, where at least 12 antigovernment protesters were killed by security forces. Page 6 
KING OF NORWAY TESTED
The events in Norway on July 22, when Anders Behring Breivik bombed a government building and then murdered scores of children on the island of Utoya, was a test for King Harald V, and he is considered to have passed it -- serving as a visible symbol of Norwegian patriotism and solidarity in the face of a homegrown horror. Page 11
FRANCE'S POLITICAL ENNUI
Opinion polls in France show that the incumbent president, Nicolas Sarkozy, would lose to either of the two remaining Socialist Party candidates, Francois Hollande and Martine Aubry, who will face each other in a runoff primary vote. But there is not much excitement around either of them, especially with the putative favorite, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, out of the race as a consequence of his encounter with a housekeeper in a New York hotel room.

BIDDING ADIEU TO FOIE GRAS
WITH CULINARY DEFIANCE
In eight months, the sale of foie gras -- the fattened liver of a goose or a duck -- will be banned in California, the first state to do so. In Los Angeles, a fashionable restaurant that hosted a special eight-course foie gras dinner was picketed by animal rights activists, offering a clash of competing passions. Page 14
A BILLIONAIRE'S IDEAS
While protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement camp out across America and Democrats from President Obama on down push the idea of a new surtax on millionaires, Jon M.

A TAMER RUN WITH THE BULLS
Participants in a domestic version of the running of the bulls set up in Arizona this weekend broke rules: they pulled the tail of a bull, stopped running to pick up a fallen cellphone, and wore costumes that made it hard to see the oncoming animals. But because the Arizona animals were tamer than their Spanish counterparts, injuries were kept to a minimum. PAGE 18

BLOOMBERG ENCOUNTERS
THE THIRD-TERM BLUES
A politician's third term is a land of the lost in which third-stringers are press-ganged into becoming first-stringers and City Council members start to talk back. True to historical form, very little has gone swimmingly in recent months for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who secured a third term at not inconsiderable personal cost and has since seen his headaches proliferate. Page 1

CHEERING FOR FAILURE
Three winless teams are in a race for the bottom of the final N.F.L. standings. But with ignominy this autumn comes glory next spring as the team with the worst record and the first overall draft pick would have the opportunity to select the Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, considered the best quarterback prospect since Peyton Manning.

The staggering postseason success that the Texas Rangers' Nelson Cruz has enjoyed over the last two years defies explanation even for a player many scouts, executives and teammates once envisioned as a potential superstar, a hitting freak of the future. Page 1
LITTLE GLORY, MUCH TO GAIN
Blocking has always been the blue-collar part of a running back's job -- falling somewhere behind ''run for touchdowns'' and ''get all the glory'' in any aspiring back's list of duties. But with defenses using more exotic blitz packages and N.F.L. teams passing in record numbers, blocking has become more crucial. Page 2

HEADLINE: Those Third-Term Blues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
''It gets more complex and harder to get your message out and advertising rates keep going up.''
-- Mayor Bloomberg, under oath in court on Oct. 3 at the trial of John F. Haggerty Jr., his former campaign consultant.
Michael R. Bloomberg was testifying this month about his diamond-encrusted campaigns, but he might as well have been talking about the balky state of his mayoral enterprise after 10 years.
The mayor likes to insist that he was de facto drafted for a third term, that City Council members and corporate worthies pulled at his hem, begging him to overturn term limits and run again. ''A number of people kept coming to me and asking if it were possible,'' the mayor also testified. No doubt some importuned. But many, not least his own aides, counseled against it.
A third term is a politician's Death Valley. It's a land of the lost in which third-stringers are press-ganged into becoming first-stringers, midlevel managers space out as you talk, and City Council members start to talk back. Not to mention that miscreants and consultants often grab for what is not legitimately theirs. 
And true to historical form, very little has gone swimmingly for our potentate in chief. He purchased a third term at not inconsiderable personal cost -- he spent a tidy $105 million on his re-election -- and now his headaches proliferate.
City contracts to computerize the time-card and personnel systems have imploded, leading to a billion dollars in cost overruns and indictments in the time-card case. Hundreds of police officers have been implicated in a ticket-fixing scandal. A campaign consultant stands accused of skimming $1 million from the mayor's last re-election effort. And when a blizzard buried subways and highways last year, the mayor advised New Yorkers to use the down time to take in a Broadway play (presumably after residents outside Manhattan strapped on snowshoes and trudged across bridges).
Meanwhile, Occupy Wall Street's demonstrators sit on the metaphoric doorstep of his city, proclaiming that his financier brethren are guilty of gross national neglect.
His personnel choices register as almost eccentric. He appointed Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis without much knowledge of New York, as deputy mayor for operations. Mr. Goldsmith lasted 16 ineffectual months before vanishing in a cloud of mayoral obfuscation.
The mayor appointed Cathleen P. Black, his Upper East Side neighbor, as schools chancellor. She lasted 95 days before he signaled that her expiration date had arrived. The mayor's education record suffered other indignities, even before Ms. Black's appointment. When state officials recalibrated test results, the former Chancellor Joel I. Klein's heralded great leap forward in state test scores became a modest hop.
Numbers, which are supposed to be the sine qua non of Mr. Bloomberg's management style, have proved nettlesome. City contractors made exaggerated, possibly fraudulent claims to reach the mayor's inflated job placement goals; the Finance Department, run by a former Wall Street type, botched tax exemptions and property evaluation reviews; and the public housing authority's claims that it promptly answers emergency calls and fixes elevators contradict available evidence, not to mention common sense.
None of which is to argue that the mayor stands defanged.
He spoke in eloquent defense of the mosque in downtown Manhattan, and put shoulder to the wheel in Albany for same-sex marriage, shelling out hundreds of thousands of dollars to sustain organizers in the final frenetic weeks.
His transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, continues to remake the city's face in intriguing ways, and his housing agencies continue to toss up tens of thousands of often-handsome apartments for working-class New Yorkers, a program without rival in the nation. The recent arrest of an assistant housing commissioner on charges of taking bribes points more to timeless corruption than systemic weakness.
''Given 10 years in office and the totality of many dollars spent, these are aberrations,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic Party operative who was appointed deputy mayor after the last campaign. ''It's far too premature to make an evaluation that the government is moving in the wrong direction.''
But talk to government insiders and the word that keeps rolling off their tongues is drift.
''It looks like a tired administration and it's not getting a lot done,'' said George Arzt, who served as press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch. ''It's the problem with third terms.''
Mr. Arzt knows this subject, as Mr. Koch's third term nearly defined the genre of the Third Term Blues. Mr. Koch's probity was never questioned, but he found himself cutting deals with several borough presidents and Democratic bosses whose probity was questioned frequently and for excellent reasons. They were certifiably corrupt.
The implosion of corrupt bosses and their minions -- Donald R. Manes, the Queens borough president, committed suicide by kitchen knife -- and the resulting cloud of scandal left Mr. Koch, by his own account, severely depressed.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's second term was only slightly less desultory than Mr. Koch's third, as he declared war on jaywalkers and lesser malefactors and called a news conference to announce he was divorcing his wife. Only the Sept. 11 terror attacks arrested a descent into farce.
Mr. Bloomberg might well look at this track record and think to himself: I'm not in such bad shape. He faces, however, his own existential challenge. He is a billionaire politician ruling as the cultural dial turns hard away from the era of money worship. His visit to the Occupy Wall Street campsite in Lower Manhattan last week underlined this dissonance -- Charles Foster Kane amid the Dickensian urchins.
The mayor had spoken with disdain of the demonstrators' demands and defensively of his former Wall Street comrades. In his visit, though, he declared his allegiance to free speech even as he made a housekeeping argument for letting his sanitation people give the plaza a good cleaning. Demonstrators sounded unconvinced of his good will, and after a flurry of angry phone calls from elected officials to the park's owner, Brookfield Office Properties, the cleaning was put off.
And demonstrators continue to eye the mayor warily. ''His problem, and there's nothing he can do about it, is that he embodies everything they detest,'' said a former administration aide, one of several people who asked that their names be withheld because they feared angering the mayor.
So the incongruities and frustrations pile up for the mayor.
''You have to keep asking yourself: Am I bringing the same questions and tough answers every day with me to work?'' said Harvey Robins, who served as a senior official in the Koch administration and as operations chief for Mayor David N. Dinkins. ''You guard against becoming stale by listening to your critics. But that doesn't seem to be Mike's style.''
Seeds of Troubles to Come
Ask administration officials about many of their current headaches -- the runaway technology contracts, the police scandals, even Mr. Haggerty's trial -- and they offer a clarification: Most of these problems took root in the second term.
That is correct. To understand the stumbles of the mayor's third term, you must understand the preoccupations and lost opportunities of his second. The mayor's first term played out by a well-designed and generously financed playbook. He brought in experienced government hands, and he took a transit strike to send a message to a militant union. He wrested mayoral control of the schools for himself and put the strong-willed Mr. Klein in charge. And he borrowed an excellent idea, the 311 phone system, from Mark Green, his former Democratic mayoral rival.
Mr. Bloomberg's style is to give aides great latitude and, as needed, to charm, twist arms and seal deals. His first term may have fallen short of a Bloomberg revolution. (His Olympic fixation, in particular, was thousands of hours expended to no end.) But he delivered a well-governed city without Mr. Giuliani's temple-throbbing histrionics. He was also helped along by President George W. Bush, who poured billions of dollars into Lower Manhattan to help clean up and rebuild after Sept. 11.
Politicians, however, are by nature ambitious, and billionaire politicians perhaps doubly so. As President Bush stumbled about, and the Democrats appeared divided, Mr. Bloomberg's eyes drifted to national politics. Former Deputy Mayor Kevin Sheekey, who charms and schemes in equal measure, encouraged the presidential reveries of his boss. (Mr. Sheekey now occupies a handsomely compensated roost at Bloomberg L.P.)
''Bloomberg started to fix on the brass ring and they lost focus,'' said a former senior city official. ''It's hard enough to run a government when you are 100 percent on task.''
Mr. Bloomberg signed long and lavish union contracts. This purchased peace, and a benign smile from labor if he ran for president. It also sowed the seed of problems that could yet haunt his scheduled 2013 departure. He gave a loose leash to the Police Department, where Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly brooked few questions and less oversight.
As police officers made more than half a million stop and frisks each year, and arrested blacks for marijuana possession in far greater numbers than whites, the mayor deflected criticism by pointing to the murder statistics, which edged down every year.
You want, he seemed to imply, to imperil that?
He tripped into an occupational hazard, which is to say self-love. In the Koch and Dinkins eras, it was not uncommon for the Mayor's Management Report, that compendium of measurements small and grand, to include substantial sections detailing where departments fell short, and how commissioners would remedy these shortcomings. Under Mr. Giuliani, and to a slightly lesser extent Mr. Bloomberg, the emphasis became triumphalist: bigger, better, every milestone grander than the last.
''When you create the continual need for high standards, the system corrupts itself,'' Mr. Robins said. ''You see this with test scores and job placements.''
When the mayor handed out a $66 million contract to revamp the personnel system, and the contractor produced a rudimentary version of the program, mayoral officials swiftly handed out an ''excellence in technology'' award.
It sounded grand. But the contract was bleeding money. ''This,'' said a longtime budget analyst, ''will dog him worse than the snowstorm. It's a lot of money.''
A Comfortable Cocoon
This mayor does not lie awake counting snowplows and calculating salt deliveries; he's no Web-head, writing code for the Finance Department. He is a mogul, a consummate salesman, politically adept and spectacularly confident.
It's a workable model -- if his closest aides are strong, and united. But as the more experienced of his senior officials began to trail off, and he cast about for replacements, he turned to a familiar world: Wall Street.
So he had an opening for deputy mayor for economic affairs? He hired Robert K. Steel, a former Goldman Sachs official who lived in Greenwich, Conn. The finance commissioner slot comes open? He reached for David M. Frankel, of Morgan Stanley. And for schools he recruited Ms. Black, a magazine executive whom he knew from Park Avenue parties.
The sense was of a man too comfortable in his class cocoon.
To preside over this, he relies on Patricia E. Harris, whom he installed as first deputy mayor at the beginning of his second term. Typically a first deputy is the mayor's shipboard captain, who steers through daily storms and keeps commissioners on task.
Ms. Harris is talented, with a background long ago in government, but this does not remotely describe her portfolio.
As her recent testimony at the Haggerty trial and the release of her schedules suggest, she most often serves a client of one: Mr. Bloomberg. She is his closest aide, runs his private foundation, and twice put aside her government work to labor on the mayor's campaigns. (The mayor, in turn, has paid $1 million to name a building after her at her alma mater, Franklin & Marshall College.)
Ask Mr. Wolfson about management and he points, not unreasonably, to the successful commissioners (Shaun Donovan, Mr. Bloomberg's former commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, now serves in President Obama's cabinet as Housing and Urban Development secretary), and innovations from taxicabs outside Manhattan to waterfront parks in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.
Reporters, he notes, fixate on trials and contracting scandals far more than voters do. If you look at the mayor's poll numbers after Tropical Storm Irene, they have taken on helium, he noted.
''How do New Yorkers live their lives? They care about crime, about schools, about garbage pickup,'' Mr. Wolfson said, ''all of the things that are vital to the lifeblood of the city, and they run pretty well.''
Reputations, however, may be more fragile than Mr. Wolfson suggests.
Contract overruns, an incompetent decision by the Finance Department to overvalue co-ops in Queens, cops who make tickets for politicians and friends disappear: The cumulative effect can become corrosive.
The mayor seemed to recognize as much in the spring, when he spent his own money on campaign-style advertisements touting his achievements. This could have helped; Mr. Bloomberg knows marketing.
But the impression left was of a mayor administering CPR to himself.
Befitting a man who has survived a lifetime on Wall Street, our mayor has a nose for politics and for weakness in others.
For the longest time, few in the city challenged him. The mayor would drop a donation on a Brooklyn nonprofit or open the levee-gates for charities in Queens, and council members and many advocates would fall mute.
Slowly, that is changing. In August, a group gathered to debate the city's gains in education. The city's chief academic officer laid claim to substantial advances, and Meryl H. Tisch, chancellor of the State Board of Regents, cast him a look somewhere between quizzical and disbelieving.
Seventy-five percent of those youngsters who go to community colleges need remediation, she noted. And only 24 percent eventually get a degree.
''Are you kidding me?'' she asked to loud applause.
Even the Police Department has come in for some rude questioning at City Council hearings. ''Nothing is untouchable any more,'' a former aide said. ''Even Ray Kelly is learning that.''
In Albany, Andrew M. Cuomo reigns as king. With balled fist inside the velvet glove, he has with apparent ease turned labor to his will. Mr. Bloomberg has had less luck.
The princes and dowagers of municipal labor are not a terribly impressive lot. But they too can smell weakness, and they battle. Of late, District Council 37, the largest and not the most innovative of municipal unions, refused to cut a deal with the mayor. He in turn has dismissed hundreds of school aides.
It was a loser's deal all around.
That said, it is autumn for Mr. Bloomberg, not winter. The City Charter bestows great powers on the mayor. He can elevate the profile of Christine C. Quinn, the council speaker, seemingly his choice as successor. (Whether his benediction will prove to be a blessing or a curse is not yet clear.) And he can redraw the budget and propose tax increases, which could prove necessary as budget problems grow darker.
Legacy is a tricky business.
Campaign finance laws emerged from the rubble of Mr. Koch's third term, as did the housing program that rebuilt New York. Mr. Dinkins, after four hellish years of recession, signed, on his last day in office, the agreement that would revitalize Times Square.
The other day, as Mr. Bloomberg announced ambitious reforms at the Buildings Department, he paused and peered at that uncertain future. ''People are saying, 'What are you doing in a third term?' '' he said. ''This is the kind of thing that will really make a difference.''
More grandly, the mayor and his aides now gallop hard in pursuit of a technology corridor on Roosevelt Island, to be built with Stanford or Cornell and the City University of New York. If successful, and the mayor's team appears to have skillfully laid the groundwork, this could turn Silicon Alley into a broad avenue of innovation and jobs.
But the emphasis, for now, remains on the conditional tense.
''They need a masterstroke that shifts all your attention off the last year and a half,'' a former official who has worked in several administrations said. ''They need the home run in the bottom of the ninth inning.''
Of course, as this official noted, the problem with waiting until the ninth inning is that, as with the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez, you can step up to the plate and strike out.

HEADLINE: To Isolate Iran, U.S. Presses Inspectors on Nuclear Data

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.
If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.
Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank -- a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. 
The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.
The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do -- as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.
All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.
Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, ''You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.''
Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the ''toughest sanctions'' for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.
The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.
Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.
Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that ''the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.'' Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are ''fabrications'' intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.
The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.
In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.
But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran's output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.
''They sought to hide their enrichment activity for years, and their covert facility at Qum, which the president revealed in 2009,'' a top adviser to Mr. Obama, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the topic, said Friday. ''They continue to enrich at 20 percent, and the rationale for doing so is demonstrably false.''
In June, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Tidewater Middle East, a company linked to the Revolutionary Guards that operates strategic container ports through which the Guards and the Quds Force have moved weapons, administration officials said. Last week, the Treasury levied sanctions on an Iranian carrier, Mahan Air, which officials said ferried weapons for the Quds Force.
A Treasury ban on transactions with the Central Bank of Iran would be powerful because any third country that did business with the central bank would be cut off from the American financial system.
''We are looking very actively at the possibility of designating the central bank of Iran, as well as taking other actions in response to this plot,'' David S. Cohen, the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, told the Senate Banking Committee. ''We're looking quite intensively at how to ratchet up the pressure.''
The administration is also weighing whether to designate elements of the Revolutionary Guards that control Iran's oil exports, effectively banning purchases of fuel from Iran. Another option would be to require companies that sell refined fuel to the United States to certify that the fuel contains no Iranian crude oil.
But American allies like Japan and South Korea buy large amounts of oil from Iran, paying their bills through the central bank since most Iranian commercial banks are off-limits. China relies less on the central bank for its purchases but is also a large buyer of Iranian oil.
Cutting off Iran's oil exports would have unpredictable effects on prices, officials said, with even a brief shock posing an economic threat. Iran would find new customers and would probably try to sell fuel to middlemen, who would resell it. But, officials said, the real impact was unknown.

HEADLINE: Mexican Leader Wants Drug War Set in Law

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD, DAMIEN CAVE and ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- As the twilight of his presidency sets in, President Felipe Calderon of Mexico is striving to lock in the militarized approach to drug cartels that has defined his tenure, pushing aside public doubts and pressing lawmakers to adopt strategies he hopes will outlast him.
Mr. Calderon has recently stepped up calls for Mexico's Congress to approve stalled initiatives to remake state and local police forces, codify the military's role in fighting crime and broaden its powers, toughen the federal penal code and tighten laws to stop money laundering.
At this pivotal point, with violence swelling and presumptive candidates jockeying for position ahead of Mexico's presidential election in July, Mr. Calderon has limited time to make the case that his strategy has worked.
He insists that the country will eventually become more secure, although about 40,000 people have been killed since he declared his war against organized crime. He began waging it shortly after taking office in 2006 as violence climbed, and he has continued pressing his offensive against drug organizations as they have splintered and descended into bloody infighting over territory and criminal rackets. 
But in a wide-ranging interview, he could not say that his approach had made Mexico safer.
''What I can say is Mexico will be safer,'' he said, ''and to have not acted, it would have deteriorated much more.''
It is a nuanced, difficult argument to make as his party, the right-of-center National Action Party, faces the real prospect of losing the presidency, raising the question of whether Mr. Calderon's approach will continue after his six-year term ends next year. Term limits prevent him from running again.
The killings in Mexico have reached such a point, analysts say, that no matter who wins the election, there will be intense pressure for a new course to somehow ease the violence without giving in to the cartels. The new president will also face demands from the United States, which has invested heavily in personnel, equipment and expertise and whose political leaders worry about the growing reach of transnational gangs.
''There seems to be a growing consensus that there needs to be a more refined strategy, a more targeted strategy, a more nuanced strategy,'' said Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ''It's anybody's guess what that will be.''
The inability to control the violence, with fresh horrors nearly every week, has rattled even some admirers in the United States Congress, who have begun to question publicly whether Mr. Calderon's strategy -- supported by the $1.4 billion in anticrime aid the United States is providing through the multiyear Merida Initiative -- is making progress.
''I admire him for taking them head on, which is a very dangerous thing to do,'' said Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican on the House Committee on Homeland Security. ''He is the first president to confront the problem and do something about it. But has it been 100 percent successful? Not at all. It seems to keep getting worse.''
The Obama administration, too, while consistently praising Mr. Calderon for taking on the cartels and making some gains against its leaders, has remained concerned about the violence, the spread of Mexican drug gangs into Central America, and the slow pace of strengthening law enforcement and judicial institutions.
''Mexico's military and police still struggle to break the trafficking organizations or contain criminal violence,'' Philip S. Goldberg, an assistant secretary of state, testified in a House hearing on Thursday. He also said that ''rising violence is taking a toll on public perceptions of the government's ability to defeat the trafficking organizations.''
As he took stock of his presidency, Mr. Calderon emphasized what he considered his triumphs, including creating jobs, expanding health care, arresting or killing more than two dozen cartel leaders, and pushing efforts to build trustworthy police and judicial institutions, as well as social programs to fight the root causes of crime.
Still, coming close to self-criticism for someone who has typically blamed the United States or Mexican lawmakers for what goes wrong, Mr. Calderon said he would have shored up state and local police forces that were now overwhelmed as well as hobbled by inexperience, lack of training, incompetence and corruption.
''We would have done it in a more aggressive, much more determined way from the start,'' he said.
No doubt, especially outside Mexico, Mr. Calderon, whom American officials credit for raising cooperation with United States law enforcement agencies to extraordinary levels, has won praise for taking on the fight and steering the Mexican economy through the global financial crisis.
''He has done amazing things for Mexico,'' said Susan Segal, president of the Americas Society in New York, which gave Mr. Calderon an award last month to a standing ovation. ''Mexico has some of the best economic management in the world, and this is the first time Mexico has taken on a lot of really bad people.''
But back at home his approval among voters, 53 percent, according to a recent poll, has fallen to a point lower than the ratings for any recent Mexican president at this point in the six-year term.
''He has not been able, maybe because it has been very difficult to impossible, to explain to Mexicans why the security fight is worth fighting,'' said Luis de la Calle, Mexico's under secretary for international trade from 1999 to 2002.
While Mr. Calderon is barred by law from publicly endorsing a candidate, associates have said he favors his former finance minister, Ernesto Cordero, who has suggested keeping the current public security minister in his cabinet and promises to continue the administration's economic policies. But Mr. Cordero trails most of the other candidates.
Instead, the party that dominated Mexico for 70 years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, could well return to the presidency, invoking a time when criminal organizations and government officials kept the peace but corroded the political system. The party's presumed front-runner for the nomination, Enrique Pena Nieto, leads most polls significantly, though political analysts caution against giving that too much weight so early in the process.
Mr. Calderon looked disgusted at the mere mention of the PRI. When told that Mr. Pena Nieto had criticized the deployment of the military in a recent BBC interview, saying it showed a lack of planning, Mr. Calderon scoffed.
''Imagine me, president of Mexico, waiting 5 or 10 years'' to take action ''while criminals come to your house, taking advantage of people, taking governments they wanted,'' he said. ''It's absurd.''
Mr. Calderon has also warned American legislators about his political rivals.
''He said the PRI candidate is going to be weak on this issue and sleep in the same bed as the cartels,'' said Mr. McCaul, the Texas Republican.
Mr. Pena Nieto declined to comment, but in interviews with local news media he has not outlined a plan drastically different from Mr. Calderon's.
That may reflect the public mood, with polls like one by the Pew Research Center conducted last spring showing that while only 45 percent think the government is making progress in its campaign against drug cartels, 83 percent support the use of the military in the crackdown.
One change Mr. Calderon has pressed for would give the president wide latitude to declare a state of emergency and suspend constitutional guarantees, provoking criticism that the plan would worsen abuses by the military.
Locking in the changes he seeks and solidifying his legacy may be difficult because Mr. Calderon, who won a narrow victory in 2006, faces a divided legislature whose members are already focusing on next year's election. Efforts to revamp local and state police forces under a unified command have languished for months.
Mr. Calderon has toured Mexico and the United States, trumpeting economic gains, the expansion of health care to most Mexicans, and the construction of roads and hundreds of hospitals.
He has remained steadfast in his relationship with the United States, despite obvious friction. While he pushed for the ouster of the previous American ambassador, who had derided Mexican law enforcement and military agencies in diplomatic cables, he declined to criticize the United States over a program known as ''Fast and Furious'' in which American agents lost track of weapons they had allowed to cross into Mexico, with dozens ending up at crime scenes.
Mr. Calderon said he learned of the program just after meeting with Mr. Obama in Washington, from a newspaper account. It troubled him, he said, but lashing out at the United States would not serve Mexico's interests.
''If I take the bait and go against President Obama, against the A.T.F.,'' the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ''the only thing I'm doing is weakening what I know are true allies and falling into the strategy of those who are really damaging Mexico, such as gun dealers.''
All in all, Mr. Calderon said he made no apologies.
''I don't heed what they say in the polls,'' he said. ''Mexico must be cleaned up, and it is up to me to do it.''

HEADLINE: Romney Beating Obama in a Fight For Wall St. Cash

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and GRIFF PALMER; Richard A. Oppel Jr., Susan Saulny and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is no secret that the relationship between President Obama and Wall Street has chilled. A striking measure of that is the latest campaign finance reports.
Mitt Romney has raised far more money than Mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among Wall Street's top sources of donations for the two candidates.
That gap underscores the growing alienation from Mr. Obama among many rank-and-file financial professionals and Mr. Romney's aggressive and successful efforts to woo them.
The imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks, according to a New York Times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama in 2008, based on data from the Federal Election Commission and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. 
It could widen as Mr. Obama, seeking to harness anger over growing income inequality, escalates his criticism of the industry, after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations.
Since this spring, Mr. Romney has raised $1.5 million from employees of firms like Morgan Stanley; Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund; and Blackstone, a private equity firm. Mr. Obama has raised just over $270,000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008.
Employees of Goldman Sachs, who in the 2008 campaign gave Mr. Obama over $1 million -- more than donors from any other private employer in the country -- have given him about $45,000 this year. Mr. Romney has raised about $350,000 from the firm's employees.
Those figures do not account for all Wall Street giving, nor for the full force of each candidate's robust network of Wall Street ''bundlers,'' wealthy individuals who raise money from friends, family members and business associates. And Mr. Obama continues to dominate Mr. Romney -- and the rest of the Republican field -- in overall fund-raising. He has raised close to $100 million so far this year for his campaign, three times more than Mr. Romney, as well as $65 million for the Democratic National Committee.
The gap in Wall Street giving to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney underscores disenchantment with Mr. Obama in the industry and the challenges both candidates will face in grappling with public anger about the financial world.
For much of the last year, aides to Mr. Obama have sought to mollify Wall Street executives still bristling over the president's criticisms of their profits and bonuses, while defending the administration's program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term.
But with Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who once ran the private equity firm Bain Capital, the most likely Republican nominee, Mr. Obama's campaign appears to sense an opportunity to harness public resentment over an industry that has largely thrived while the rest of the economy has not.
''There's no doubt that Governor Romney has raised money off of his belief that Wall Street should be allowed to write its own rules again by repealing Wall Street reform,'' said Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman. ''The president put in place protections to ensure that the financial crisis is not repeated and that unacceptable risks aren't taken with Americans' life savings.''
For his part, Mr. Romney is now pitching himself as the turnaround expert for an ailing national economy. He has personally wooed major Wall Street donors, successfully recruiting several senior financial executives poised to back Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had he opted for a White House bid.
But anger at big banks -- manifested by the growing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City and elsewhere -- is palpable enough that Mr. Romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many Americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages.
''To the extent anyone is supporting Mitt Romney over President Obama,'' said Andrea Saul, a Romney spokeswoman, ''it is because of the state of the economy and the president's failures to create jobs.''
On Friday, Mr. Obama also voluntarily released an updated list of his bundlers for the campaign -- a practice none of the Republican candidates has adopted.
Mr. Obama recruited about 100 bundlers during the three months ending Sept. 30, according to an analysis by The Times, some veterans of his 2008 effort, and some new to the ranks.
Among the new recruits are Harvey Weinstein, the movie mogul, who has raised more than half a million dollars for Mr. Obama; Roger C. Altman, a prominent investment banker who backed Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008 but has raised more than $200,000 for Mr. Obama this year; and John E. Frank, a Microsoft executive, who has raised more than $500,000 for the president.
Mr. Obama also recruited Amy Friedkin, a San Francisco philanthropist of Jewish causes and a former president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, who raised more than $200,000 for Mr. Obama.
All the presidential candidates were required to disclose by midnight on Saturday their fund-raising and spending during the three months ending Sept. 30.
Those filings suggest that Mr. Romney is facing a tough fund-raising challenge from Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Mr. Perry raised $17 million during the quarter ending on Sept. 30, roughly 60 percent from a loyal network of Texas donors.
Mr. Romney raised a little over $14 million, with the largest portion coming from California, where he raised $1.6 million, and New York, where he raised $1.5 million. Mr. Romney raised $637,000 in Texas -- his fifth-biggest fund-raising state.
And while both candidates enter the fall with about the same amount of cash on hand, Mr. Romney's campaign more than doubled its rate of spending over the spring months, spending about $12 million during the quarter, including close to $600,000 in travel, $2.8 million on direct mail and $3.6 million on consultants.
Mr. Perry, who entered the race in mid-August, halfway through the quarter, has spent just $2 million. That included about $460,000 on travel, $46,320 on direct mail and printing and $103,000 on consultants. Because he is a sitting governor, some costs, such as his security detail, are borne by taxpayers. And the fiilings do not reflect salary for some of his top aides, David Carney, and his communications director, Ray Sullivan. A press officer for the campaign said the two aides were first paid in October.
Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican whose libertarian views have won him a loyal grass-roots following, showed $8.3 million in contributions, half in amounts of less than $200 each. Herman Cain, the former pizza chain executive who has shot up in some recent polls, reported raising $2.8 million and having $1.3 million on hand, while Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota raised almost $4 million in the third quarter and spent nearly $6 million, ending with about $1.3 million in cash.
The other Republican candidates appeared to be lagging far behind. Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, reported raising $704,000 during the three months ending Sept. 30 and had just $229,114 on hand.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, has $327,000 left in his campaign account and more than twice that in debt, his campaign said on Friday.
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, raised $808,000 during the quarter ending Sept. 30 with just $353,417 in cash on hand.

HEADLINE: ''You're Nuts!''

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
It wasn't that long ago that Republican moneymen and operatives in Washington were moping around K Street like Eeyore in the Hundred Acre Wood, lamenting their party's extremist image and casting about for a candidate with a chance of beating Barack Obama in 2012. Citing what he called the ''near self-immolation'' of House Republicans during the debt-ceiling fiasco, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, worried in early August that a ''large number of Republican primary voters, and even more independent general-election voters, will be wary of supporting a Republican candidate in 2012 if the party looks as if it's in the grip of an infantile form of conservatism.'' 
But a few months of obstinate unemployment can change a lot in Washington, and these days the mood inside the Republican establishment is, if not quite smug, then certainly relieved. In a slideshow widely circulated among Republicans in recent weeks, one of the party's leading pollsters, Bill McInturff, noted that the consumer-confidence index (as measured by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters), had fallen in August to a score of 55.7. No president, McInturff pointed out, has ever been re-elected with an index score lower than 75. Around this time in 1979, as Jimmy Carter, the modern standard setter for failed presidents, was preparing to seek a second term, the index was at 64.5.
Given such fast-deteriorating conditions, many Republican veterans have come around to the view that they aren't really going to need the perfect presidential candidate, and perhaps not even a notably good one. With Chris Christie having taken himself out of the running -- again -- earlier this month, the field of candidates now appears to be pretty much set, and none of them are likely to inspire any reimaginings of Mount Rushmore. But maybe all the moment requires is someone who can pass as a broadly acceptable alternative -- a candidate who doesn't project the Tea Party extremism of Michele Bachmann or the radical isolationism of Ron Paul. ''If we have a Rick Perry versus Mitt Romney battle for the nomination, it's a little hard to say, 'Ooh, the party has really gone off the rails,' '' Kristol told me just after Perry entered the race, a development that essentially ended Bachmann's brief ascent. Establishment Republicans may prefer Romney to Perry, but their assumption is that either man can be counted on to steer the party back toward the broad center next fall, effectively disarming the Tea Party mutiny.
If that's the case, then it now seems like only a matter of time before the Republican empire, overwhelmed by insurrection for much of the last two years, strikes back at last. ''I think it's waning now,'' Scott Reed, a veteran strategist and lobbyist, told me when we talked about the Tea Party's influence last month. Efforts to gin up primaries next year against two sitting senators -- Utah's Orrin Hatch and Indiana's Dick Lugar -- have been slow to gain momentum, Reed said, and it's notable that more than half of the 50-plus members of the Tea Party caucus in the House ultimately fell in line and voted with Speaker John Boehner on his debt-ceiling compromise. Party leaders have managed to bleed some of the anti-establishment intensity out of the movement, Reed said, by slyly embracing Tea Party sympathizers in Congress, rather than treating them as ''those people.''
Did he mean to say that the party was slowly co-opting the Tea Partiers?
''Trying to,'' Reed said. ''And that's the secret to politics: trying to control a segment of people without those people recognizing that you're trying to control them.''
As I made the rounds of Republican Washington in recent weeks and reflected on all this newfound optimism, though, I found myself recalling what Ken Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004, liked to say back then: ''Hope is not a strategy.'' It's not clear which of those two things -- hope or strategy -- the Republican establishment is really embracing.
After all, in September, not long after I saw Reed, far-right Republicans staged another successful mutiny in the House, temporarily blocking a spending bill that Boehner had championed. Meanwhile, the ''supercommittee'' of lawmakers created by the debt-ceiling legislation is supposed to find more budget cuts by the end of the year, which means Washington faces another very public showdown. The deficit debate in Congress could easily dominate the campaign season, complicating the party's election-year message and making it hard for any nominee to unify pragmatic insiders and Tea Party outsiders.
''What happens on this debt and deficit issue could split us,'' Don Fierce told me when we met in his downtown Washington office. ''This thing is volatile.'' Fierce is a party strategist who worked in the Ford administration and for Lee Atwater during the Reagan years and then founded a lobbying firm whose clients include Apple and the Ford Motor Company. He was clearly worried that some of his oldest friends in Washington were failing to grasp the peril of the moment. ''We have not disarmed the bomb,'' he said. ''Boehner reminds me of the lead in 'The Hurt Locker.' Pull the wrong wire, and this whole thing could blow up. For our people to say, 'Gee whiz, so far, so good, no problem -- ' '' Fierce shook his head emphatically. ''Just wait,'' he said.
You can't talk about the Republican establishment without trying to define what that really means, and this is something on which there is little consensus. Last month, I sat with Fred Malek in the Washington office of his private-equity firm. Malek, now 74, was in charge of fund-raising for his friend John McCain in 2008 and does the same job for the Republican Governors Association. He's the founder of the American Action Network, a two-year-old group whose goal is to make the party's economic agenda palatable to mainstream Republicans and independents. Malek belongs to the Alfalfa Club, whose 200 or so members, the old-line political and business aristocracy in both parties, expect the president to attend their annual dinner, and he occasionally gives exclusive parties at his home overlooking the Potomac River in McLean, Va. -- including one in 2009 that brought together Sarah Palin and the party's Washington elite.
''You think I'm an establishment Republican?'' Malek asked me.
When I said that I did, he let forth a lyrical string of expletives that, sadly, are not printable here. ''My dad drove a beer truck delivering beer to taverns in Cicero and Chicago, Ill.,'' he said. ''I'm the first one in my family to go to college. No, I don't consider myself part of the establishment.''
I then followed his gaze to the photos on his wall: Malek in the Oval Office with Richard Nixon, Malek with Ronald Reagan, Malek with George H. W. Bush after the two jumped from a plane on the former president's 80th birthday.
''I'm looking for pictures on my wall to prove I'm not establishment,'' Malek said.
I suggested he might need to find another wall, and Malek laughed in surrender.
George Will recently said there is no such thing as the Republican establishment, which is a little like Michael Douglas saying there's no such thing as Hollywood. But Will's point, shared by a lot of other longtime Republicans I spoke with, is that the real establishment, the league of Protestant lawyers and bankers from the Northeast and Midwest who once exercised enormous influence, was smashed in 1964 when Barry Goldwater, acting as the advance guard for a new breed of ideological conservatives from the West and South, wrested the nomination from Nelson Rockefeller. (Among Goldwater's most vocal G.O.P. opponents at that time was a liberal Midwestern governor named George Romney.) Since then, this argument goes, the idea of any singular establishment has been little more than a convenient media conceit.
It's a fair point, but it may be just as accurate to say that the establishment has simply evolved over the years to accommodate more regional and cultural diversity, making it less monolithic but still ideologically cohesive. The pragmatic ''white shoe'' lawyers of the Nixon-Rockefeller era were largely stamped out over the ensuing decades by more conservative Reaganites from the West Coast and Bush backers from Texas, by movement conservatives whose constituents included evangelicals and libertarians and neoconservative defense hawks. They don't all belong to the same country clubs, but they have retained a remarkable ability to mobilize around a series of candidates and legislative objectives.
Today's establishment is really a consortium of separate and overlapping establishments: a governing establishment of those who have served in administrations or in Congress; a political establishment of campaign consultants; a media establishment dominated by Fox News or the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and a policy establishment at organizations like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.
If there is any one power center that connects all of these, though, it's what you could call the money establishment -- the group of senior Republicans, many of whom came to Washington as ideological warriors in the 1980s or early '90s, who now make their living principally through the business of government. They wield quiet power as corporate lobbyists or regulatory consultants or prolific fund-raisers, or often as all of these at once. Consider the machinations that transpired last year after Joe Miller, a Tea Party insurgent in Alaska, beat the sitting senator, Lisa Murkowski, in a primary. Murkowski's decision to then run in the general election (which she ultimately won) as a write-in candidate put the establishment in the uncomfortable position of having to abandon either the winner of a legitimate primary or a popular incumbent. ''That debate was held internally, discussed, and everyone came to an understanding,'' Fierce told me. ''We would support whoever won the primaries. No ifs and buts. The alternative would have been disastrous.''
Among establishment figures, Fierce is probably one of the most sympathetic to the Tea Party cause, and yet it's the very existence of such back-room decisions that so ignites the contempt of the Tea Party activists. The way they see it, too many movement conservatives, who in their day espoused fiscal restraint and limited government, have now become stewards of the Washington shop, working alongside Democrats to keep the federal money flowing so that they and their friends in corporate boardrooms can build second homes and write tuition checks to private schools. Tea Party members call such figures ''big-government conservatives'' -- a category that includes the former president George W. Bush and most of the party's Congressional leadership. Or they use an epithet that was popular with an earlier generation of conservative activists: RINO, or Republican in Name Only.
You can imagine how this irritates longtime Republicans in Washington. ''The thing I get a kick out of is these Tea Party folks calling me a RINO,'' John Feehery, a lobbyist who was once a senior House aide, recently told me. ''No, guys, I've been a Republican all along. You go off into your own little world and then come back and say it's your party. This ain't your party.''
Feehery said that Republicans had yet to sort out their ''Ron Paul problem,'' by which he meant the proliferation of a kind of conspiratorial, anti-Washington rhetoric. ''There's that element of paranoia,'' Feehery said. ''Establishment Republicans look at these guys and say, 'You're nuts.' ''
It's worth pointing out that when Republicans express concern about the anti-government militancy in their midst, it has a ring of serious denial. After all, generations of Republican candidates have now echoed the theme of Ronald Reagan in his 1981 inaugural address: ''In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.'' And a progression of ideological uprisings inside the party -- the Reagan revolutionaries, Pat Buchanan's pitchfork brigades, Newt Gingrich's band of guerrilla lawmakers and now the Tea Partiers -- have only pushed the anti-Washington argument closer to its illogical extreme. Thus could a smiling Michele Bachmann stand on a debate stage last month and declare that no one should pay the federal government a penny of taxes, for anything -- a statement that didn't even draw a follow-up question from the panel of Fox News journalists arrayed before her.
Longtime Republicans have been satisfied enough to have their candidates run down activist government as a campaign tactic, even as they themselves retained a more nuanced view of the federal government's role (which is why a Republican Congress, working with a Republican president, managed to pass a Medicare prescription-drug bill in 2003). But when you talk to them now, these same Republicans seem positively baffled that anyone could have actually internalized, so literally, all the scorching resentment for government that has come to define the modern conservative campaign.
Vin Weber was 28 when he was elected to Congress in the Reagan wave of 1980, and he soon became one of Newt Gingrich's chief allies -- part of a group of rebellious young conservatives who rose up against their affable minority leader, Bob Michel. Weber left Congress before the 1994 Republican takeover, forced out by the House banking scandal, but soon reinvented himself as one of the more powerful lobbyists in town. When I sat with Weber on a late-summer day in his corner office across the street from the National Portrait Gallery, I suggested that he had been, in effect, the Bachmann of his day. He laughed out loud. ''Yeah, probably so,'' he said.
Like nearly every other establishment Republican I visited, Weber went out of his way to tell me how much he admired these Tea Party lawmakers and shared in their essential cause. ''One thing I do notice about them,'' he added, ''is that when I ask them, 'So how are you enjoying it?' almost none of them will say, 'Oh, jeez, I'm really loving this.' They all say some version of, 'This is not what I'd want to be doing, but I've got to do it for the country.' '' Weber seemed genuinely surprised that this aversion to Washington didn't melt away once they arrived in town.
''I can just tell you, when I came to Congress, we were rabble-rousers, but, boy, if you'd asked any of us six months into it how we were enjoying it, we'd have said this was the greatest opportunity of a lifetime,'' Weber said. ''It just struck me. And it's part and parcel of this anti-government mind-set.''
I wondered if maybe the Tea Partiers' contempt for Washington was just a kind of outsider's shtick.
''I'd feel better about it if I thought it was,'' Weber said glumly.
He had on his mind the infamous 1990 tax increase that the first President Bush negotiated with Democrats and signed into law, despite having made his ''read my lips'' pledge against doing exactly that. Weber was among those who adamantly opposed the deal, in much the same way that today's Tea Partiers resist any compromise on spending.
''I've thought about that a lot since then and how it might have been handled differently,'' Weber said, sounding a little pained at the memory. ''I don't regret what we did, although it's hard to see how much good came out of it. We ended up with a tax deal that moved to the left, after we defeated it in the House the first time, and may have contributed to the defeat of the president.''
There was a lesson in all this for the Tea Partiers, Weber said -- one he had been trying to impart to them whenever he got the chance. ''I think I know what they want to accomplish, and I agree with most of it,'' he said. ''But if they want to accomplish it, they need to 'rise to the level of politics.' I mean, you can't just stand there and take a stand and say, 'I'm not going to compromise on my position.' Because you won't achieve anything.''
This issue of compromise versus absolutism came up in most of the conversations I had with longstanding Washington Republicans, because it gets to the essential quandary they face in trying to exploit a popular movement for their own policy ends. Most establishment Republicans, including those who would be derided by the Tea Partiers as big-government conservatives, were disheartened by the rate of spending during the Bush years. This is especially true for the economic conservatives who sit on the boards of policy and advocacy groups and who stood by, quietly seething, while Dick Cheney declared that deficits no longer mattered. Their No. 1 policy goal is to change the trajectory of spending on entitlement programs, namely Medicare and Social Security, before public debt becomes an all-out crisis. And many of the Republicans I talked to confided that they would be willing to accept some higher taxes on corporations, or even on millionaires, in exchange for a deal to meaningfully roll back entitlement spending -- something Obama and Boehner briefly explored during the debt-ceiling negotiations.
For these Republicans, the rise of the Tea Party has been a great turn of fortune, because the movement suddenly exerted more public pressure to cut spending than anyone would have thought possible just two years ago. But the same Tea Party members who created this more conducive climate are also opposed to even a hint of compromise on taxes. (The Boehner-Obama talks failed after lawmakers on both sides rebelled, but the biggest roadblock was the opposition of strident House Republicans who were threatening to take the American economy over a cliff if they didn't get their way.) And while the Tea Partiers like to talk about trimming programs like Medicaid, they've not put much of their energy behind the kind of radical restructuring that Paul Ryan, the Republican congressman, has proposed.
Instead, the loudest members of the Tea Party caucus tend to dwell almost exclusively on cuts to discretionary domestic spending, which accounts for less than a fifth of the federal budget. Not only does this do little to change the long-term fiscal outlook, but it also puts the caucus in direct conflict with establishment Republicans like Vin Weber, who are inclined to protect some of those discretionary programs -- either because they actually believe the programs have merit or because some company is paying them to preserve the status quo.
''I believe in foreign aid,'' Weber told me. ''I believe it's important to America.'' He said he opposed the steep, 10-year cuts to defense and discretionary spending -- including programs in biomedical research -- that Republican newcomers backed. ''If you actually did that, you would do tremendous damage to the important things government does in this country,'' Weber said. ''And I think the government does do important things in the country.''
Sitting across from Weber, I found it possible to understand why most establishment Republicans are optimistic that they can ultimately co-opt the House freshmen, prevailing on them to accept the wisdom of compromise. After all, here he was, the aging insurgent, now managing partner at the lobbying firm of Clark & Weinstock. A lot of the stridently ideological Republicans who came to town in the Reagan and Gingrich years quickly flamed out and were never heard from again, but Washington has more than its share of Vin Webers and Grover Norquists and Karl Roves -- Republican politicians and activists who arrived crusading against the city's corrupt culture and subsequently became fixtures in its boardrooms and restaurants. ''They'll become the establishment,'' Charlie Black, the longtime Republican strategist and lobbyist, confidently predicted when we talked about the more radical members of the freshmen class.
Still, absorption into the establishment, even if possible, takes time to unfold, and Washington Republicans are focused only on the year ahead, preferring to see this disorderly period as little more than an interlude. For the past year or so, voters have viewed Republican politics almost exclusively through the lens of Capitol Hill, and they haven't loved what they've seen. In polling by the Pew Research Center, negative views of the Tea Party jumped 11 points between January and August, and Congress as a whole has seen its approval ratings fall to as low as 12 percent in recent months. (It makes you wonder: who exactly is this 12 percent who say Congress is doing a fine job?) Soon enough, however, all heads will swivel to Iowa and New Hampshire, where a Republican nominee will emerge at last to put his or her stamp on the party's image. And this is where, the establishment presumes, the long season of Tea Party zaniness will finally recede into the background, subsumed into some more enlightened, and more practical approach.
For most of the last century, Republicans were an almost exclusively executive party. While Democrats controlled Congress, with only minor interruptions, for more than 40 years until 1994, Republicans focused their energies on gaining power through the presidency, which they held for about two-thirds of the time between the elections of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and Barack Obama in 2008. Perhaps that explains why the Republican establishment has proven so remarkably adept at mobilizing behind tested candidates, men who have proved themselves as campaigners and fund-raisers, and shepherding them through an increasingly perilous primary process.
In the last 10 presidential elections, the party has chosen only two nominees who hadn't run previously; one, George W. Bush, was the son of a president, and the other, Gerald Ford, was already holding the office. (In contrast, Democrats during that same period nominated seven candidates who were running for the first time.) The establishment's preferred nominee rarely makes it to the convention without a serious primary challenge, but not since Barry Goldwater shocked the party in 1964 has that candidate failed to make it there at all. In other words, while some strange things can happen when the Republican faithful get restless in the off years, the presidential process is the means by which the party establishment has traditionally reasserted control.
A lot of the establishment's power, of course, derives from its ability to raise money and, thus, to exercise control over the party's message to voters. Now that the campaign-finance rules have changed, making it illegal for individual donors to write unlimited checks to a party, the insiders are deploying a new tool: an independent group, with the nebulous name of American Crossroads, that can lawfully accept such donations. The group was founded by Rove and includes, among its top advisers, insiders like Ed Gillespie, the former party chairman and Bush aide, and Haley Barbour, Mississippi's governor. They're hoping to raise and spend as much as $240 million for the general election, mostly from longtime party donors. (To date, much of the money has come from Rove's home state of Texas.)
Rove was publicly critical last year of some of the more controversial Senate candidates and their effect on the party's image, particularly Christine ''I'm not a witch'' O'Donnell. And American Crossroads serves as a kind of fire wall for the party establishment -- a way to project, through massive television buys in every critical market, a message aimed at independent voters, while reducing to static the more extremist rhetoric that might emanate from local Tea Parties or their heroes back in Washington.
You could say, then, that everything is in place for the establishment to get a grip on the party and the White House once again -- except, of course, for the small detail of having an actual candidate. For the first time in what feels like forever (though it's more like 1968), Republicans are going into this election without a consensus choice or a guy who had clearly earned his shot. (In the desire of some prognosticators to cast Mitt Romney as the proverbial next-guy-in-line, it's often overlooked that Mike Huckabee actually earned more delegates in 2008.) Even as Romney and Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman came pleading for their support earlier this year, the party's traditional fund-raisers and Washington validators resisted making commitments, hoping to enlist a candidate they knew and trusted.
The establishment's preferred candidate, generally speaking, was Mitch Daniels, Indiana's second-term governor, who served as a political aide in the Reagan administration and as budget director for George W. Bush. Probably more than any elected official in America today, Daniels makes an argument about the moment that precisely reflects the thinking of most establishment Republicans. He did so, most memorably, in a rather unlikely forum -- at the annual gathering of far-right activists known as the Conservative Political Action Conference, held in Washington this past February. Daniels devoted much of his keynote speech to the establishment case for reducing federal debt and remaking entitlement programs, which he calls a generational challenge, rather than trimming government on the margins through discretionary spending. But he also made a forceful case for the willingness to compromise and for broadening the party's appeal beyond the most conservative voters. He didn't say overtly that he was open to new taxes, but he told the audience of activists that Republicans simply couldn't succeed in solving the nation's intractable problems without giving something up in the process.
''Purity in martyrdom is for suicide bombers,'' Daniels said, a comment that must have jarred some of his listeners. ''I for one have no interest in standing in the wreckage of our republic saying, 'I told you so' or 'You should have done it my way.' '' And he warned, ''We should distinguish carefully skepticism about big government from contempt for all government.''
When I met Daniels last month in his cavernous Statehouse office, he cautioned that the Tea Party movement, like all effective popular movements, had an effect far beyond the proportion of its actual numbers. ''I wouldn't minimize for a minute their importance,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't fixate too much on the Tea Party. There's a whole lot more to the Republican Party than the Tea Party.''
This was essentially his message for the party's presidential candidates too, none of whom he has thus far endorsed. ''It would be dumb to try to walk away from our most passionate -- and I never use words like this -- base,'' Daniels told me. ''But I think it's fair to say that the most impressive achievements in political leadership are those who lead a party or a movement to a different place, who create some change in their own party so that it can achieve greater things. Reagan changed the Republican Party in an additive way. Bill Clinton changed the Democratic Party in an additive way. Tony Blair is the best example I can think of.''
To hear Daniels talk about the party's challenge was to get some clarity on why establishment Republicans have been so dissatisfied with the candidates they actually have. What they want is what you might call a ''channeler'' -- someone, like a Reagan or a Clinton, who won't simply give voice to populist fury but who might channel it in a way that makes it palatable to a wider swath of voters, someone who can take the call for austerity in Washington and make it sound more like a high-minded reform movement (in the tradition of a Robert La Follette or even a Ross Perot) than like something you would expect to hear at a survivalists' convention. They're looking for a candidate who has the requisite charisma and the towering conservative credentials to persuade these new activists that the party has to be -- and sound -- pragmatic.
In some quarters, the search for that channeler may go on until every major elected Republican in America has politely said no, twice. Every few weeks, it seems, a new potential savior becomes the target of relentless pressure and speculation; most recently it was Christie, who despite having once suggested his own suicide as a means of ending such conjecture, made a spectacle earlier this month of seriously reconsidering his resistance, before again deciding to abstain. And yet, when you talk to establishment Republicans in Washington, most now seem, if not entirely enthralled with their choices, then at least resigned to them. National polls, which are often unreliable at this stage of a campaign, have shown a pronounced volatility in the field, with Herman Cain most recently surpassing Perry in some surveys. But most experienced Republicans still expect Romney and Perry to outlast their rivals. And in these two most likely nominees, insiders see the potential to remake the party's image and to close its internal breach. The vexing question for Republicans is whether either man, Romney or Perry, has the capacity to do both things at once.
For the type of establishment Republican who merely endured the Bush years, there isn't a lot to love about the prospect of a President Perry. A. B. Culvahouse, a former White House counsel to Reagan who is now the chairman of the giant law firm O'Melveny & Myers, told me that Perry's style as a candidate reminds him of the tent revivalists who blew through town when he was a boy in East Tennessee.
While they roll their eyes privately at Perry's coyote-killing-cowboy routine, a lot of the old guard -- the ''weak, tepid, milquetoast, establishment'' Republicans, as Culvahouse wryly described himself to me -- seem to view him as the best possible kind of Tea Party candidate, a far more desirable brand of populist than Bachmann or Palin. However much he may make a show of his disdain for Washington, Perry is nonetheless a three-term governor, and that makes him, at the very least, an honorary establishment type, the kind of guy with whom you can do business.
And yet there is a growing fear among Republicans that the things about Perry that might call to mind tent revivalism -- the constant and overt religiosity, the naked appeal to popular resentment -- won't play well with independent voters and especially not with those who find it all too reminiscent of the last Republican president's swaggering self-reliance. In a USA Today/Gallup poll in mid-September, 44 percent of voters said they were sure they wouldn't vote for Perry -- about the same percentage who ruled out Obama, and nine points higher than the percentage who definitely wouldn't vote for Romney. And this was before Perry's strangely garbled debate performance later in the month (and before it surfaced that he used to frequent a hunting ground affectionately known as ''Niggerhead'').
At the same time, Romney, who's supposed to be the establishment front-runner, incites no great passion on K Street and Capitol Hill, where he is regarded as a sort of well-designed political android. ''Mitt Romney is a really smart, experienced guy, and he may well be exactly what you need as president right now,'' Charlie Black told me. ''He's not a gregarious guy who's easy to get to know.'' Still, as summer turned to fall in Washington, discernible mostly by the slow disappearance of seersucker, the denizens of the Republican fund-raising circuit began tilting en masse toward Romney. There was a sense that the field was more or less settled, and that Romney, with his moderate pedigree and private-sector resume, was the candidate most likely to win in pivotal Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. And if he wasn't going to co-opt and transform the Tea Party movement in the way the establishment might have hoped, then at least he wasn't going to recommend the hanging of Ben Bernanke or run around repeating the charge that Obama was a socialist -- something he pointedly refused to do, at least outright, in the same debate in which Perry came unglued. If Perry's entry had any net effect in Washington, it was to drive much of the establishment into Romney's sterile but relatively benign embrace.
The chief dilemma here, though, is that the guy who may be best positioned to take the Republican message to the heart of the electorate may not be the guy who's capable of holding his fractured party intact. Perry is probably the candidate who can unify the insider and outsider elements of the party, because he's a natural fit for the Tea Party and can mollify the establishment by incorporating longtime Republicans into his campaign. A good precedent for this might be the 1980 campaign. Reagan was a hero to movement conservatives, but he also shrewdly managed to reassure a nervous establishment by selecting George H. W. Bush as his running mate and bringing into the fold respected senior aides like James Baker.
In this regard, Romney brings to mind the older Bush, who picked Dan Quayle as his own running mate in a gesture to conservatives, but who never really persuaded the movement that he was with them -- a suspicion that was confirmed when he reached the tax deal. Romney would be in an especially precarious position if the next year in Washington is dominated by intraparty arguments over spending cuts and whether to compromise with Democrats, forcing him take positions that could alienate either independent voters or his own party's activists.
Romney's team contends that the party's real unifier isn't going to be their guy or Perry, but rather the current president, whose very existence will lead to increased activism and turnout for the eventual Republican nominee. The thinking here is that the Tea Party activists are just like all those working-class Democratic voters who supported Hillary Clinton in 2008, but who were so incensed by the Bush years that they turned out in huge numbers to elect Obama anyway. This may be an apt comparison, except that the Clinton voters, to the extent that you can generalize about such things, were essentially party loyalists. A lot of the Tea Party members, on the other hand, are new to politics and don't consider themselves core Republicans. It's a widespread notion within the movement that Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts -- and its resemblance to ''Obamacare'' -- make him a nonstarter as a nominee.
''If Romney becomes the nominee, two or three things might happen,'' Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, told me. Kibbe's organization, led by the former House leader Dick Armey, is probably the most influential Tea Party-aligned group in Washington. ''First of all, people might hold their noses and vote for him, but that doesn't mean they're going to walk their neighborhoods for him or ask their neighbors to show up, so you lose a lot of the energy that defines get-out-the-vote efforts. Option B is to just stay home and throw up your hands and say: 'O.K., I've been disenfranchised. I'm not interested in this election.'
''The other things they could do,'' Kibbe said, ''is split off and go third party. If you end up with the wrong guy as the challenger to Obama, it potentially creates a real dilemma for Tea Partiers. And they're going to have to make one of those decisions.'' One of FreedomWorks's vice presidents, Adam Brandon, jumped in to remind me that Tea Party activists well remember last year's elections in Florida and Alaska, where establishment candidates for governor and Senate, jilted by primary voters, turned around and ran anyway. The insiders won't have a lot of credibility now if they argue that bolting the party is a treacherous act.
Most of the Republicans with whom I talked over the past few months -- though not all, by any means -- were dismissive of the notion of a third-party candidacy. Such an effort, they pointed out, would almost certainly serve to get Obama re-elected, and for that reason no splinter group of conservatives would consider undertaking it, nor would any halfway serious candidate. They're probably right, but then again, this assumes that we are still living in an age of rational political actors, where politicians run for public office because they actually want to serve or at least advance an agenda -- an assumption that may be hopelessly out of date.
In today's political arena, a certain class of outsider candidates seems mostly intent on achieving a kind of cultural relevance -- the type of broader celebrity that attracts mega book deals and Twitter followers and reality-television contracts. (Palin, in a moment of astounding candor, recently mused that she might find the presidency just too shackling for her ambitions as a public figure.) So it's not really all that hard to imagine some entrepreneurial candidate like Palin or Bachmann looking to fill the vacuum in the Tea Party movement sometime next year, especially if the popular narrative holds that the establishment has somehow triumphed again.
Even putting the presidential race aside, the friction between Republican insiders and outsiders will almost certainly manifest itself next year in other ways. Another wave of Tea Party-backed challengers for the Senate are already preparing to take on establishment candidates in states like Nebraska, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Indiana. Washington Republicans may rejoice that enthusiasm for these campaigns has been slow to build, but after all, the elections aren't for another year, and at this time in 2009 no one had yet heard of Marco Rubio or Rand Paul, either. Tea Party activists who were protesting outside their Statehouses two years ago have now grown more sophisticated; they're quietly organizing through social media, running local candidates and pressuring lawmakers in private meetings. ''We're not protesting in the streets now,'' David Kirkham, the organizer of the Utah Tea Party, told me. ''We are going one on one with state legislators.'' Kirkham, a custom-car maker who was new to politics when I first met him last year, is now mulling a primary against Utah's sitting governor or possibly against Orrin Hatch.
You can look at all this and say that the Tea Party has simply begun the natural process of being absorbed into the establishment, as its leaders become the next generation of legislators and Statehouse lobbyists, much like an earlier generation of social conservatives and crusading libertarians. But there is another interpretation, too, which is that the movement is actually starting to alter the makeup of the party from the bottom up, and it only appears to be losing intensity because its leaders are no longer interested in shouting into bullhorns. If that's true, and if more Tea Party members start streaming into Washington in the years head, then the next chapter of Republican politics in Washington could look less like ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and more like ''Attack of the Clones.''
''I think we're going to have to have at least one more election cycle before people get that this isn't just a typical wave in the business cycle of politics, if you will,'' Kibbe told me. ''We've described the Tea Party movement as a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. And we mean that in the technical-economic term. You have tired leadership, and you have bad ideas and just an inability to serve customers well. And that's when someone comes in with new management and cleans house and either restores the company or breaks it up.''
Kibbe's metaphor sounded jarringly familiar to me, because it was exactly the kind of language I heard from liberal venture capitalists in Silicon Valley back in 2004, when they were busy fomenting insurrection inside the ranks of the Democratic Party. In fact, a lot of Kibbe's rhetoric -- about hostile takeovers and the ''democratization of politics,'' for instance -- could have come directly from the left-leaning activists and donors who gained influence through forums like Moveon.org and Democracy for America in the latter part of the Bush era. It was this same process of ''democratization,'' the breakup of the party's monopoly on money and manpower, that ultimately enabled a black first-term senator to topple his party's presumed nominee on the way to winning the White House.
There are practical explanations for why both party establishments have undergone some version of this same devolution. The most important, and most obvious, is the proliferation of broadband Internet and the way it has redefined, within the space of just a few years, the very concept of a political movement. Another is the change in campaign-finance rules, which incentivizes ideological contributors to send their checks to outside groups or set up their own, thus creating a network of parallel parties whose influence grows with every election cycle.
But of course, what's really going on here is a broader cultural assault on the very idea of establishments, which has affected virtually ever other industry in American life in the last 20 years or so, from television networks and music labels to carmakers and local banks. The Tea Party may fade into history, but there will almost certainly be other Tea Parties, and more of them, affecting both parties and arising in ever quicker succession. To believe yourself now to be, literally, an establishment -- that is, the one legitimate arbiter of just about anything in American life -- is to be tragically misguided.
Some Republicans have accepted this larger reality. ''I get annoyed with all the establishment types here who speak as if they're supposed to be controlling everything, who sound like they're annoyed when things happen that they don't expect,'' Bill Kristol told me. ''I mean, welcome to the world.'' What more pragmatic conservatives like Kristol are trying to do, ultimately, is to strike a highly precarious balance -- to somehow embrace the Tea Party sentiment, as they must, while not allowing themselves or their party to become marginalized as a result.
''Like a lot of other conservatives in Washington,'' Kristol said at one point, '' I've been slightly -- not worried -- but I've just regarded it as one of the things I can do as a genuine Tea Party sympathizer to counsel the Tea Party types to be sensible and not to go overboard and not to go in the wrong direction.
''From my point of view, I wouldn't want them to win all of their fights,'' he went on. ''But I wouldn't want them to go away, honestly. Now, maybe that's too cute, and maybe I can't manage it. And maybe I can't tell Jim DeMint to cause this amount of trouble, but not that amount. And is there a risk he'll win on an issue when I think it's ill advised? Sure. But that's democracy, and I still think that turmoil is the price you pay for a certain kind of vitality and vigor.''
I suggested to Kristol that by trying to exploit the fury of a grass-roots movement for their own ends, while also hoping to temper it, he and his colleagues might be playing with fire.
''The only thing I would object to in that formulation is that we could wish the fire away,'' he told me. ''The fire exists.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 16, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 44 this weekend about the struggle for control of the Republican Party refers incorrectly to a prescription-drug bill passed in 2003 under President George W. Bush and mentioned as an example of a ''nuanced view'' of the government's role. It was for Medicare recipients, not Medicaid. The article also misidentifies a state described as part of the Rust Belt. It is Michigan, not Missouri.

HEADLINE: We Thought They Wanted to Be Like Buffett

 BODY:
When Warren Buffett pointed out that the American tax system was so egregiously rigged that he paid a smaller share of his income in taxes than his secretary, very few of his peers chimed in. It was so quiet that one might have thought Mr. Buffett's case was a fluke. It wasn't. 
The Congressional Research Service found that 200,000 millionaires -- almost two-thirds of taxpayers with taxable income above $1 million -- paid a lower tax rate (combining income and payroll taxes) than the typical taxpayer making less than $100,000.
This is mostly because the rich make a huge chunk of their income from stocks and other investments, in the form of capital gains and dividends. Those are not subject to payroll taxes and are taxed at 15 percent, lower than the 25 percent marginal rate paid by a family earning wages of $100,000 a year.
Many wealthy people -- and their Capitol Hill defenders -- argue that the comparison is unfair because dividends and capital gains are also subject to taxes when corporations pay taxes on profits. Yet even taking corporate taxes into account, and excluding itemized and other deductions, the Congressional Research Service found that 94,500 millionaires paid a lower share of their income in taxes than 10.4 million taxpayers making less than $100,000 a year.
When President Obama outlined his ''Buffett Rule'' -- that no millionaire family should pay a lower tax rate than a middle-class family -- Republicans attacked it as ''class warfare.'' Steve Forbes suggested that if Mr. Buffett really wanted to help he could donate as much of his money as he wanted to the I.R.S. Bankers looked at their brogues.
Demanding a modicum of fairness is not class warfare. It is sound policy. With the government in need of money for programs to revive the economy, create jobs, help the most vulnerable, and wrestle down the deficit, the undertaxed riches of the rich are a natural place to look.
President Obama has put several proposals on the table, like allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for high-income taxpayers, or taxing the earnings of investment managers as regular income rather than capital gains. Senate Democrats have proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on millionaires to pay for provisions of Mr. Obama's jobs bill. Congress should pass all of them. It's fair.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From an Interview With President Felipe Calderon

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from an interview of President Felipe Calderon by The New York Times, as recorded, translated and condensed by The Times:
On the hunt for Joaquin Guzman, the most-wanted drug lord, known as El Chapo, who has eluded capture since escaping from prison in Mexico in 2001.
The Mexican Army probably a couple of times has been in the place where hours before Chapo was. But sooner or later he will fall as well as other leaders. 
On decriminalization and whether his call for ''market alternatives'' to curb drug organizations' profits is a step toward that.
I think the responsibility of policy makers in the United States or members of Congress is to explore all alternatives that may allow the flow of money to be reduced. They come and tell me they have a policy to keep young people away from drugs, and what I see are all the stereotypical examples. From Michael Phelps, an Olympic champion, smoking marijuana, to the most admired American actors happily smoking marijuana and cocaine on screen. Instead of warning about the health risks of taking drugs, there is powerful lobby to declare that marijuana is medicinal and that makes young people think it is good.
On the reduced flow of migration to the United States and its impact.
I hope it changes the perception there is about us, because as you have published, as studies by Princeton and other universities have demonstrated, the net migration rate has been reduced not only to its lowest level, but nearly to zero. And I admit, it's not only because of the opportunities that we've generated, but perhaps also as a result of migration policy, of the economic crisis, of fear of organized crime, but also because of the hospitals, the more than 1,000 hospitals and clinics we've created, the 800,000 jobs that we're generating annually, the universities we've built that I already mentioned, nearly 100 new ones, and as you write in that very good article, young adults now have opportunities they didn't have before. I hope this changes the prejudice which nearly borders on fanaticism, that Mexicans are harming the United States economy or its society. Not even before, when migration was higher.
On the closing wage gap between Mexico and China.
I don't think that the wage differential, the reduction in the wage differential between China and Mexico, is necessarily damaging. It has also signified a decrease in China's competitiveness in Mexico's favor. Many companies which left to China are now trying to establish themselves in Mexico, and it's not to build up, because salaries in China, in spite of the decrease in the wage differential, are still substantially lower. I would say in some cases, even inhumane. Salaries in Mexico are still higher, however, be it because of elevated transportation costs as a result of the price of fuel, or be it, also, because of the rise in real competitiveness in Mexico. Today, it is much more profitable to invest in Mexico, and that is our alternative for the future.
On whether he will be remembered for the surging violence in Mexico.
It's possible some will remember me for that or will want me to be remembered for that. But if Mexico triumphs as I am sure it will, if Mexico has new institutions in the future, if Mexico subdues the criminals, if Mexico reconstructs its social fabric there will also be those that remember me as the president who dared to take on the criminals and indicate the long path of institutional reconstruction of the country.
On the prospect that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which dominated Mexico for decades, might return to power and fall into a corrupt relationship with organized crime.
It depends on who it is. There are many in the PRI who agree with the policy I have, at least they say so in secret, while publicly they may say something else. There are many in the PRI who think the deals of the past would work now. I don't see what deal could be done, but that is the mentality many of them have. If that opinion prevails it would worry me.
On his hopes that his reforms will outlast his presidency.
Building a new legal framework, a new legal scaffolding is what will allow the security strategy to become state policy and not an issue for this president and not another.
On delays in reworking the economy and attracting more foreign investment.
Have we done enough? Of course not. What Mexico needs are structural reforms. Although those don't just depend on the president. We have a Congress in which the parties or the party that has a majority -- for all it presents itself as modernizing in the world -- is still terribly obsolete in economic terms. The possibilities of opening up energy have been closed off. The possibilities of a labor reform have been closed off. Well, I think that economic modernity should be reflected in deeds rather than speeches.

HEADLINE: Let's Admit It: Globalization Has Losers

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER

 BODY:
Steven Rattner is a contributing writer to Op-Ed and a former counselor to the secretary of the Treasury and lead auto adviser. He has spent nearly 30 years on Wall Street.
FOR the typical American, the past decade has been economically brutal: the first time since the 1930s, according to some calculations, that inflation-adjusted incomes declined. By 2010, real median household income had fallen to $49,445, compared with $53,164 in 2000. While there are many culprits, from declining unionization to the changing mix of needed skills, globalization has had the greatest impact.
Yes, globalization. The phenomenon that free traders like me adore has created a nation of winners (think of those low-priced imported goods) but also many losers. Nowhere have these pressures been more intense than in the manufacturing sector, which I saw firsthand as head of President Obama's Auto Task Force. 
A typical General Motors worker costs the company about $56 per hour, which includes benefits. In Mexico, a worker costs the company $7 per hour; in China, $4.50 an hour, and in India, $1 per hour. While G.M. doesn't (yet) achieve United States-level productivity in China and India, its Mexican plants are today at least as efficient as those in the United States.
G.M. has responded with inarguable logic. While reducing its United States hourly work force to 50,000 from 89,000 over the past five years, its Mexican hourly head count has risen, to 9,235 from 9,073.
Pressed by high unemployment and eager to keep jobs in this country, the United Auto Workers agreed that companies could cut their costs by hiring some workers at $14 an hour, with lower benefits. Most recently, Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, Tenn., with 2,000 much-welcomed jobs -- but all with starting pay of $14.50 per hour. At this pay rate, although some workers will quickly exceed it at that plant, yearly income would be $30,000 per year, hardly the American dream of great middle-class jobs.
In these troubled times, any jobs are surely welcome. But we need to reverse the decline in incomes, and this requires a more thoughtful approach than the pervasive, politically attractive happy talk nostalgically centered on restoring lost manufacturing jobs.
So let's start by acknowledging that just as occurred decades ago with agriculture, the declining role in our economy of manufacturing, which over the last half-century is down from 32 percent of the work force to 9 percent, will continue. Let's also recognize that retreating into protectionism would turn a win-lose into a lose-lose.
And even if organized labor could force wage rates back up, that would hardly help domestic manufacturing compete against lower-cost imports.
Instead, we should follow the example of successful high-wage exporters in concentrating on products where we have an advantage, as Germany has done with products like sophisticated machine tools.
While America still leads in sectors like defense and aviation, our greatest strength, and a source of high-paying jobs, lies in service industries with high intellectual content, like education, entertainment, digital media, and yes, even financial services. Facebook, Google and Microsoft are all American creations, as are the global credit card companies American Express, Visa and MasterCard.
Achieving higher wages also requires a greater commitment to education; wages for those with college degrees rose 1.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, after inflation. Following the German model of greater emphasis on engineering and technical training would also be advantageous.
Finally comes the tricky question of what role government should play. The prospect of Washington lurching into the private sector is terrifying, as illustrated by the debacle of Solyndra, the solar energy company that failed with $535 million of taxpayer loans. While countries like China have put large resources behind industries they want to nurture, we should resist the temptation to plunge deeply into industrial policy. Particularly in its current dysfunctional condition, Washington is ill-equipped to pick winners and should concentrate its capital on infrastructure and other public investments that the private sector won't make.
To assist the private sector, particularly young companies, which are the biggest source of new hiring, tax incentives could be used to foster the creation of well-paying jobs.
In addition, the Kauffman Foundation, which focuses on entrepreneurship, has identified other possible solutions, including providing visas to entrepreneurs, easing access to public financing markets and reform of the patent and regulatory apparatus. Sadly, Congress shows little sign of addressing all of this.
With global competition and its pressure on American wages intensifying, American workers deserve a more focused approach from Washington.

HEADLINE: ''You're Nuts!''

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
It wasn't that long ago that Republican moneymen and operatives in Washington were moping around K Street like Eeyore in the Hundred Acre Wood, lamenting their party's extremist image and casting about for a candidate with a chance of beating Barack Obama in 2012. Citing what he called the ''near self-immolation'' of House Republicans during the debt-ceiling fiasco, Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, worried in early August that a ''large number of Republican primary voters, and even more independent general-election voters, will be wary of supporting a Republican candidate in 2012 if the party looks as if it's in the grip of an infantile form of conservatism.'' 
But a few months of obstinate unemployment can change a lot in Washington, and these days the mood inside the Republican establishment is, if not quite smug, then certainly relieved. In a slideshow widely circulated among Republicans in recent weeks, one of the party's leading pollsters, Bill McInturff, noted that the consumer-confidence index (as measured by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters), had fallen in August to a score of 55.7. No president, McInturff pointed out, has ever been re-elected with an index score lower than 75. Around this time in 1979, as Jimmy Carter, the modern standard setter for failed presidents, was preparing to seek a second term, the index was at 64.5.
Given such fast-deteriorating conditions, many Republican veterans have come around to the view that they aren't really going to need the perfect presidential candidate, and perhaps not even a notably good one. With Chris Christie having taken himself out of the running -- again -- earlier this month, the field of candidates now appears to be pretty much set, and none of them are likely to inspire any reimaginings of Mount Rushmore. But maybe all the moment requires is someone who can pass as a broadly acceptable alternative -- a candidate who doesn't project the Tea Party extremism of Michele Bachmann or the radical isolationism of Ron Paul. ''If we have a Rick Perry versus Mitt Romney battle for the nomination, it's a little hard to say, 'Ooh, the party has really gone off the rails,' '' Kristol told me just after Perry entered the race, a development that essentially ended Bachmann's brief ascent. Establishment Republicans may prefer Romney to Perry, but their assumption is that either man can be counted on to steer the party back toward the broad center next fall, effectively disarming the Tea Party mutiny.
If that's the case, then it now seems like only a matter of time before the Republican empire, overwhelmed by insurrection for much of the last two years, strikes back at last. ''I think it's waning now,'' Scott Reed, a veteran strategist and lobbyist, told me when we talked about the Tea Party's influence last month. Efforts to gin up primaries next year against two sitting senators -- Utah's Orrin Hatch and Indiana's Dick Lugar -- have been slow to gain momentum, Reed said, and it's notable that more than half of the 50-plus members of the Tea Party caucus in the House ultimately fell in line and voted with Speaker John Boehner on his debt-ceiling compromise. Party leaders have managed to bleed some of the anti-establishment intensity out of the movement, Reed said, by slyly embracing Tea Party sympathizers in Congress, rather than treating them as ''those people.''
Did he mean to say that the party was slowly co-opting the Tea Partiers?
''Trying to,'' Reed said. ''And that's the secret to politics: trying to control a segment of people without those people recognizing that you're trying to control them.''
As I made the rounds of Republican Washington in recent weeks and reflected on all this newfound optimism, though, I found myself recalling what Ken Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004, liked to say back then: ''Hope is not a strategy.'' It's not clear which of those two things -- hope or strategy -- the Republican establishment is really embracing.
After all, in September, not long after I saw Reed, far-right Republicans staged another successful mutiny in the House, temporarily blocking a spending bill that Boehner had championed. Meanwhile, the ''supercommittee'' of lawmakers created by the debt-ceiling legislation is supposed to find more budget cuts by the end of the year, which means Washington faces another very public showdown. The deficit debate in Congress could easily dominate the campaign season, complicating the party's election-year message and making it hard for any nominee to unify pragmatic insiders and Tea Party outsiders.
''What happens on this debt and deficit issue could split us,'' Don Fierce told me when we met in his downtown Washington office. ''This thing is volatile.'' Fierce is a party strategist who worked in the Ford administration and for Lee Atwater during the Reagan years and then founded a lobbying firm whose clients include Apple and the Ford Motor Company. He was clearly worried that some of his oldest friends in Washington were failing to grasp the peril of the moment. ''We have not disarmed the bomb,'' he said. ''Boehner reminds me of the lead in 'The Hurt Locker.' Pull the wrong wire, and this whole thing could blow up. For our people to say, 'Gee whiz, so far, so good, no problem -- ' '' Fierce shook his head emphatically. ''Just wait,'' he said.
You can't talk about the Republican establishment without trying to define what that really means, and this is something on which there is little consensus. Last month, I sat with Fred Malek in the Washington office of his private-equity firm. Malek, now 74, was in charge of fund-raising for his friend John McCain in 2008 and does the same job for the Republican Governors Association. He's the founder of the American Action Network, a two-year-old group whose goal is to make the party's economic agenda palatable to mainstream Republicans and independents. Malek belongs to the Alfalfa Club, whose 200 or so members, the old-line political and business aristocracy in both parties, expect the president to attend their annual dinner, and he occasionally gives exclusive parties at his home overlooking the Potomac River in McLean, Va. -- including one in 2009 that brought together Sarah Palin and the party's Washington elite.
''You think I'm an establishment Republican?'' Malek asked me.
When I said that I did, he let forth a lyrical string of expletives that, sadly, are not printable here. ''My dad drove a beer truck delivering beer to taverns in Cicero and Chicago, Ill.,'' he said. ''I'm the first one in my family to go to college. No, I don't consider myself part of the establishment.''
I then followed his gaze to the photos on his wall: Malek in the Oval Office with Richard Nixon, Malek with Ronald Reagan, Malek with George H. W. Bush after the two jumped from a plane on the former president's 80th birthday.
''I'm looking for pictures on my wall to prove I'm not establishment,'' Malek said.
I suggested he might need to find another wall, and Malek laughed in surrender.
George Will recently said there is no such thing as the Republican establishment, which is a little like Michael Douglas saying there's no such thing as Hollywood. But Will's point, shared by a lot of other longtime Republicans I spoke with, is that the real establishment, the league of Protestant lawyers and bankers from the Northeast and Midwest who once exercised enormous influence, was smashed in 1964 when Barry Goldwater, acting as the advance guard for a new breed of ideological conservatives from the West and South, wrested the nomination from Nelson Rockefeller. (Among Goldwater's most vocal G.O.P. opponents at that time was a liberal Midwestern governor named George Romney.) Since then, this argument goes, the idea of any singular establishment has been little more than a convenient media conceit.
It's a fair point, but it may be just as accurate to say that the establishment has simply evolved over the years to accommodate more regional and cultural diversity, making it less monolithic but still ideologically cohesive. The pragmatic ''white shoe'' lawyers of the Nixon-Rockefeller era were largely stamped out over the ensuing decades by more conservative Reaganites from the West Coast and Bush backers from Texas, by movement conservatives whose constituents included evangelicals and libertarians and neoconservative defense hawks. They don't all belong to the same country clubs, but they have retained a remarkable ability to mobilize around a series of candidates and legislative objectives.
Today's establishment is really a consortium of separate and overlapping establishments: a governing establishment of those who have served in administrations or in Congress; a political establishment of campaign consultants; a media establishment dominated by Fox News or the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and a policy establishment at organizations like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.
If there is any one power center that connects all of these, though, it's what you could call the money establishment -- the group of senior Republicans, many of whom came to Washington as ideological warriors in the 1980s or early '90s, who now make their living principally through the business of government. They wield quiet power as corporate lobbyists or regulatory consultants or prolific fund-raisers, or often as all of these at once. Consider the machinations that transpired last year after Joe Miller, a Tea Party insurgent in Alaska, beat the sitting senator, Lisa Murkowski, in a primary. Murkowski's decision to then run in the general election (which she ultimately won) as a write-in candidate put the establishment in the uncomfortable position of having to abandon either the winner of a legitimate primary or a popular incumbent. ''That debate was held internally, discussed, and everyone came to an understanding,'' Fierce told me. ''We would support whoever won the primaries. No ifs and buts. The alternative would have been disastrous.''
Among establishment figures, Fierce is probably one of the most sympathetic to the Tea Party cause, and yet it's the very existence of such back-room decisions that so ignites the contempt of the Tea Party activists. The way they see it, too many movement conservatives, who in their day espoused fiscal restraint and limited government, have now become stewards of the Washington shop, working alongside Democrats to keep the federal money flowing so that they and their friends in corporate boardrooms can build second homes and write tuition checks to private schools. Tea Party members call such figures ''big-government conservatives'' -- a category that includes the former president George W. Bush and most of the party's Congressional leadership. Or they use an epithet that was popular with an earlier generation of conservative activists: RINO, or Republican in Name Only.
You can imagine how this irritates longtime Republicans in Washington. ''The thing I get a kick out of is these Tea Party folks calling me a RINO,'' John Feehery, a lobbyist who was once a senior House aide, recently told me. ''No, guys, I've been a Republican all along. You go off into your own little world and then come back and say it's your party. This ain't your party.''
Feehery said that Republicans had yet to sort out their ''Ron Paul problem,'' by which he meant the proliferation of a kind of conspiratorial, anti-Washington rhetoric. ''There's that element of paranoia,'' Feehery said. ''Establishment Republicans look at these guys and say, 'You're nuts.' ''
It's worth pointing out that when Republicans express concern about the anti-government militancy in their midst, it has a ring of serious denial. After all, generations of Republican candidates have now echoed the theme of Ronald Reagan in his 1981 inaugural address: ''In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem.'' And a progression of ideological uprisings inside the party -- the Reagan revolutionaries, Pat Buchanan's pitchfork brigades, Newt Gingrich's band of guerrilla lawmakers and now the Tea Partiers -- have only pushed the anti-Washington argument closer to its illogical extreme. Thus could a smiling Michele Bachmann stand on a debate stage last month and declare that no one should pay the federal government a penny of taxes, for anything -- a statement that didn't even draw a follow-up question from the panel of Fox News journalists arrayed before her.
Longtime Republicans have been satisfied enough to have their candidates run down activist government as a campaign tactic, even as they themselves retained a more nuanced view of the federal government's role (which is why a Republican Congress, working with a Republican president, managed to pass a Medicare prescription-drug bill in 2003). But when you talk to them now, these same Republicans seem positively baffled that anyone could have actually internalized, so literally, all the scorching resentment for government that has come to define the modern conservative campaign.
Vin Weber was 28 when he was elected to Congress in the Reagan wave of 1980, and he soon became one of Newt Gingrich's chief allies -- part of a group of rebellious young conservatives who rose up against their affable minority leader, Bob Michel. Weber left Congress before the 1994 Republican takeover, forced out by the House banking scandal, but soon reinvented himself as one of the more powerful lobbyists in town. When I sat with Weber on a late-summer day in his corner office across the street from the National Portrait Gallery, I suggested that he had been, in effect, the Bachmann of his day. He laughed out loud. ''Yeah, probably so,'' he said.
Like nearly every other establishment Republican I visited, Weber went out of his way to tell me how much he admired these Tea Party lawmakers and shared in their essential cause. ''One thing I do notice about them,'' he added, ''is that when I ask them, 'So how are you enjoying it?' almost none of them will say, 'Oh, jeez, I'm really loving this.' They all say some version of, 'This is not what I'd want to be doing, but I've got to do it for the country.' '' Weber seemed genuinely surprised that this aversion to Washington didn't melt away once they arrived in town.
''I can just tell you, when I came to Congress, we were rabble-rousers, but, boy, if you'd asked any of us six months into it how we were enjoying it, we'd have said this was the greatest opportunity of a lifetime,'' Weber said. ''It just struck me. And it's part and parcel of this anti-government mind-set.''
I wondered if maybe the Tea Partiers' contempt for Washington was just a kind of outsider's shtick.
''I'd feel better about it if I thought it was,'' Weber said glumly.
He had on his mind the infamous 1990 tax increase that the first President Bush negotiated with Democrats and signed into law, despite having made his ''read my lips'' pledge against doing exactly that. Weber was among those who adamantly opposed the deal, in much the same way that today's Tea Partiers resist any compromise on spending.
''I've thought about that a lot since then and how it might have been handled differently,'' Weber said, sounding a little pained at the memory. ''I don't regret what we did, although it's hard to see how much good came out of it. We ended up with a tax deal that moved to the left, after we defeated it in the House the first time, and may have contributed to the defeat of the president.''
There was a lesson in all this for the Tea Partiers, Weber said -- one he had been trying to impart to them whenever he got the chance. ''I think I know what they want to accomplish, and I agree with most of it,'' he said. ''But if they want to accomplish it, they need to 'rise to the level of politics.' I mean, you can't just stand there and take a stand and say, 'I'm not going to compromise on my position.' Because you won't achieve anything.''
This issue of compromise versus absolutism came up in most of the conversations I had with longstanding Washington Republicans, because it gets to the essential quandary they face in trying to exploit a popular movement for their own policy ends. Most establishment Republicans, including those who would be derided by the Tea Partiers as big-government conservatives, were disheartened by the rate of spending during the Bush years. This is especially true for the economic conservatives who sit on the boards of policy and advocacy groups and who stood by, quietly seething, while Dick Cheney declared that deficits no longer mattered. Their No. 1 policy goal is to change the trajectory of spending on entitlement programs, namely Medicare and Social Security, before public debt becomes an all-out crisis. And many of the Republicans I talked to confided that they would be willing to accept some higher taxes on corporations, or even on millionaires, in exchange for a deal to meaningfully roll back entitlement spending -- something Obama and Boehner briefly explored during the debt-ceiling negotiations.
For these Republicans, the rise of the Tea Party has been a great turn of fortune, because the movement suddenly exerted more public pressure to cut spending than anyone would have thought possible just two years ago. But the same Tea Party members who created this more conducive climate are also opposed to even a hint of compromise on taxes. (The Boehner-Obama talks failed after lawmakers on both sides rebelled, but the biggest roadblock was the opposition of strident House Republicans who were threatening to take the American economy over a cliff if they didn't get their way.) And while the Tea Partiers like to talk about trimming programs like Medicaid, they've not put much of their energy behind the kind of radical restructuring that Paul Ryan, the Republican congressman, has proposed.
Instead, the loudest members of the Tea Party caucus tend to dwell almost exclusively on cuts to discretionary domestic spending, which accounts for less than a fifth of the federal budget. Not only does this do little to change the long-term fiscal outlook, but it also puts the caucus in direct conflict with establishment Republicans like Vin Weber, who are inclined to protect some of those discretionary programs -- either because they actually believe the programs have merit or because some company is paying them to preserve the status quo.
''I believe in foreign aid,'' Weber told me. ''I believe it's important to America.'' He said he opposed the steep, 10-year cuts to defense and discretionary spending -- including programs in biomedical research -- that Republican newcomers backed. ''If you actually did that, you would do tremendous damage to the important things government does in this country,'' Weber said. ''And I think the government does do important things in the country.''
Sitting across from Weber, I found it possible to understand why most establishment Republicans are optimistic that they can ultimately co-opt the House freshmen, prevailing on them to accept the wisdom of compromise. After all, here he was, the aging insurgent, now managing partner at the lobbying firm of Clark & Weinstock. A lot of the stridently ideological Republicans who came to town in the Reagan and Gingrich years quickly flamed out and were never heard from again, but Washington has more than its share of Vin Webers and Grover Norquists and Karl Roves -- Republican politicians and activists who arrived crusading against the city's corrupt culture and subsequently became fixtures in its boardrooms and restaurants. ''They'll become the establishment,'' Charlie Black, the longtime Republican strategist and lobbyist, confidently predicted when we talked about the more radical members of the freshmen class.
Still, absorption into the establishment, even if possible, takes time to unfold, and Washington Republicans are focused only on the year ahead, preferring to see this disorderly period as little more than an interlude. For the past year or so, voters have viewed Republican politics almost exclusively through the lens of Capitol Hill, and they haven't loved what they've seen. In polling by the Pew Research Center, negative views of the Tea Party jumped 11 points between January and August, and Congress as a whole has seen its approval ratings fall to as low as 12 percent in recent months. (It makes you wonder: who exactly is this 12 percent who say Congress is doing a fine job?) Soon enough, however, all heads will swivel to Iowa and New Hampshire, where a Republican nominee will emerge at last to put his or her stamp on the party's image. And this is where, the establishment presumes, the long season of Tea Party zaniness will finally recede into the background, subsumed into some more enlightened, and more practical approach.
For most of the last century, Republicans were an almost exclusively executive party. While Democrats controlled Congress, with only minor interruptions, for more than 40 years until 1994, Republicans focused their energies on gaining power through the presidency, which they held for about two-thirds of the time between the elections of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and Barack Obama in 2008. Perhaps that explains why the Republican establishment has proven so remarkably adept at mobilizing behind tested candidates, men who have proved themselves as campaigners and fund-raisers, and shepherding them through an increasingly perilous primary process.
In the last 10 presidential elections, the party has chosen only two nominees who hadn't run previously; one, George W. Bush, was the son of a president, and the other, Gerald Ford, was already holding the office. (In contrast, Democrats during that same period nominated seven candidates who were running for the first time.) The establishment's preferred nominee rarely makes it to the convention without a serious primary challenge, but not since Barry Goldwater shocked the party in 1964 has that candidate failed to make it there at all. In other words, while some strange things can happen when the Republican faithful get restless in the off years, the presidential process is the means by which the party establishment has traditionally reasserted control.
A lot of the establishment's power, of course, derives from its ability to raise money and, thus, to exercise control over the party's message to voters. Now that the campaign-finance rules have changed, making it illegal for individual donors to write unlimited checks to a party, the insiders are deploying a new tool: an independent group, with the nebulous name of American Crossroads, that can lawfully accept such donations. The group was founded by Rove and includes, among its top advisers, insiders like Ed Gillespie, the former party chairman and Bush aide, and Haley Barbour, Mississippi's governor. They're hoping to raise and spend as much as $240 million for the general election, mostly from longtime party donors. (To date, much of the money has come from Rove's home state of Texas.)
Rove was publicly critical last year of some of the more controversial Senate candidates and their effect on the party's image, particularly Christine ''I'm not a witch'' O'Donnell. And American Crossroads serves as a kind of fire wall for the party establishment -- a way to project, through massive television buys in every critical market, a message aimed at independent voters, while reducing to static the more extremist rhetoric that might emanate from local Tea Parties or their heroes back in Washington.
You could say, then, that everything is in place for the establishment to get a grip on the party and the White House once again -- except, of course, for the small detail of having an actual candidate. For the first time in what feels like forever (though it's more like 1968), Republicans are going into this election without a consensus choice or a guy who had clearly earned his shot. (In the desire of some prognosticators to cast Mitt Romney as the proverbial next-guy-in-line, it's often overlooked that Mike Huckabee actually earned more delegates in 2008.) Even as Romney and Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman came pleading for their support earlier this year, the party's traditional fund-raisers and Washington validators resisted making commitments, hoping to enlist a candidate they knew and trusted.
The establishment's preferred candidate, generally speaking, was Mitch Daniels, Indiana's second-term governor, who served as a political aide in the Reagan administration and as budget director for George W. Bush. Probably more than any elected official in America today, Daniels makes an argument about the moment that precisely reflects the thinking of most establishment Republicans. He did so, most memorably, in a rather unlikely forum -- at the annual gathering of far-right activists known as the Conservative Political Action Conference, held in Washington this past February. Daniels devoted much of his keynote speech to the establishment case for reducing federal debt and remaking entitlement programs, which he calls a generational challenge, rather than trimming government on the margins through discretionary spending. But he also made a forceful case for the willingness to compromise and for broadening the party's appeal beyond the most conservative voters. He didn't say overtly that he was open to new taxes, but he told the audience of activists that Republicans simply couldn't succeed in solving the nation's intractable problems without giving something up in the process.
''Purity in martyrdom is for suicide bombers,'' Daniels said, a comment that must have jarred some of his listeners. ''I for one have no interest in standing in the wreckage of our republic saying, 'I told you so' or 'You should have done it my way.' '' And he warned, ''We should distinguish carefully skepticism about big government from contempt for all government.''
When I met Daniels last month in his cavernous Statehouse office, he cautioned that the Tea Party movement, like all effective popular movements, had an effect far beyond the proportion of its actual numbers. ''I wouldn't minimize for a minute their importance,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't fixate too much on the Tea Party. There's a whole lot more to the Republican Party than the Tea Party.''
This was essentially his message for the party's presidential candidates too, none of whom he has thus far endorsed. ''It would be dumb to try to walk away from our most passionate -- and I never use words like this -- base,'' Daniels told me. ''But I think it's fair to say that the most impressive achievements in political leadership are those who lead a party or a movement to a different place, who create some change in their own party so that it can achieve greater things. Reagan changed the Republican Party in an additive way. Bill Clinton changed the Democratic Party in an additive way. Tony Blair is the best example I can think of.''
To hear Daniels talk about the party's challenge was to get some clarity on why establishment Republicans have been so dissatisfied with the candidates they actually have. What they want is what you might call a ''channeler'' -- someone, like a Reagan or a Clinton, who won't simply give voice to populist fury but who might channel it in a way that makes it palatable to a wider swath of voters, someone who can take the call for austerity in Washington and make it sound more like a high-minded reform movement (in the tradition of a Robert La Follette or even a Ross Perot) than like something you would expect to hear at a survivalists' convention. They're looking for a candidate who has the requisite charisma and the towering conservative credentials to persuade these new activists that the party has to be -- and sound -- pragmatic.
In some quarters, the search for that channeler may go on until every major elected Republican in America has politely said no, twice. Every few weeks, it seems, a new potential savior becomes the target of relentless pressure and speculation; most recently it was Christie, who despite having once suggested his own suicide as a means of ending such conjecture, made a spectacle earlier this month of seriously reconsidering his resistance, before again deciding to abstain. And yet, when you talk to establishment Republicans in Washington, most now seem, if not entirely enthralled with their choices, then at least resigned to them. National polls, which are often unreliable at this stage of a campaign, have shown a pronounced volatility in the field, with Herman Cain most recently surpassing Perry in some surveys. But most experienced Republicans still expect Romney and Perry to outlast their rivals. And in these two most likely nominees, insiders see the potential to remake the party's image and to close its internal breach. The vexing question for Republicans is whether either man, Romney or Perry, has the capacity to do both things at once.
For the type of establishment Republican who merely endured the Bush years, there isn't a lot to love about the prospect of a President Perry. A. B. Culvahouse, a former White House counsel to Reagan who is now the chairman of the giant law firm O'Melveny & Myers, told me that Perry's style as a candidate reminds him of the tent revivalists who blew through town when he was a boy in East Tennessee.
While they roll their eyes privately at Perry's coyote-killing-cowboy routine, a lot of the old guard -- the ''weak, tepid, milquetoast, establishment'' Republicans, as Culvahouse wryly described himself to me -- seem to view him as the best possible kind of Tea Party candidate, a far more desirable brand of populist than Bachmann or Palin. However much he may make a show of his disdain for Washington, Perry is nonetheless a three-term governor, and that makes him, at the very least, an honorary establishment type, the kind of guy with whom you can do business.
And yet there is a growing fear among Republicans that the things about Perry that might call to mind tent revivalism -- the constant and overt religiosity, the naked appeal to popular resentment -- won't play well with independent voters and especially not with those who find it all too reminiscent of the last Republican president's swaggering self-reliance. In a USA Today/Gallup poll in mid-September, 44 percent of voters said they were sure they wouldn't vote for Perry -- about the same percentage who ruled out Obama, and nine points higher than the percentage who definitely wouldn't vote for Romney. And this was before Perry's strangely garbled debate performance later in the month (and before it surfaced that he used to frequent a hunting ground affectionately known as ''Niggerhead'').
At the same time, Romney, who's supposed to be the establishment front-runner, incites no great passion on K Street and Capitol Hill, where he is regarded as a sort of well-designed political android. ''Mitt Romney is a really smart, experienced guy, and he may well be exactly what you need as president right now,'' Charlie Black told me. ''He's not a gregarious guy who's easy to get to know.'' Still, as summer turned to fall in Washington, discernible mostly by the slow disappearance of seersucker, the denizens of the Republican fund-raising circuit began tilting en masse toward Romney. There was a sense that the field was more or less settled, and that Romney, with his moderate pedigree and private-sector resume, was the candidate most likely to win in pivotal Rust Belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan. And if he wasn't going to co-opt and transform the Tea Party movement in the way the establishment might have hoped, then at least he wasn't going to recommend the hanging of Ben Bernanke or run around repeating the charge that Obama was a socialist -- something he pointedly refused to do, at least outright, in the same debate in which Perry came unglued. If Perry's entry had any net effect in Washington, it was to drive much of the establishment into Romney's sterile but relatively benign embrace.
The chief dilemma here, though, is that the guy who may be best positioned to take the Republican message to the heart of the electorate may not be the guy who's capable of holding his fractured party intact. Perry is probably the candidate who can unify the insider and outsider elements of the party, because he's a natural fit for the Tea Party and can mollify the establishment by incorporating longtime Republicans into his campaign. A good precedent for this might be the 1980 campaign. Reagan was a hero to movement conservatives, but he also shrewdly managed to reassure a nervous establishment by selecting George H. W. Bush as his running mate and bringing into the fold respected senior aides like James Baker.
In this regard, Romney brings to mind the older Bush, who picked Dan Quayle as his own running mate in a gesture to conservatives, but who never really persuaded the movement that he was with them -- a suspicion that was confirmed when he reached the tax deal. Romney would be in an especially precarious position if the next year in Washington is dominated by intraparty arguments over spending cuts and whether to compromise with Democrats, forcing him take positions that could alienate either independent voters or his own party's activists.
Romney's team contends that the party's real unifier isn't going to be their guy or Perry, but rather the current president, whose very existence will lead to increased activism and turnout for the eventual Republican nominee. The thinking here is that the Tea Party activists are just like all those working-class Democratic voters who supported Hillary Clinton in 2008, but who were so incensed by the Bush years that they turned out in huge numbers to elect Obama anyway. This may be an apt comparison, except that the Clinton voters, to the extent that you can generalize about such things, were essentially party loyalists. A lot of the Tea Party members, on the other hand, are new to politics and don't consider themselves core Republicans. It's a widespread notion within the movement that Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts -- and its resemblance to ''Obamacare'' -- make him a nonstarter as a nominee.
''If Romney becomes the nominee, two or three things might happen,'' Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, told me. Kibbe's organization, led by the former House leader Dick Armey, is probably the most influential Tea Party-aligned group in Washington. ''First of all, people might hold their noses and vote for him, but that doesn't mean they're going to walk their neighborhoods for him or ask their neighbors to show up, so you lose a lot of the energy that defines get-out-the-vote efforts. Option B is to just stay home and throw up your hands and say: 'O.K., I've been disenfranchised. I'm not interested in this election.'
''The other things they could do,'' Kibbe said, ''is split off and go third party. If you end up with the wrong guy as the challenger to Obama, it potentially creates a real dilemma for Tea Partiers. And they're going to have to make one of those decisions.'' One of FreedomWorks's vice presidents, Adam Brandon, jumped in to remind me that Tea Party activists well remember last year's elections in Florida and Alaska, where establishment candidates for the Senate, jilted by primary voters, turned around and ran anyway. The insiders won't have a lot of credibility now if they argue that bolting the party is a treacherous act.
Most of the Republicans with whom I talked over the past few months -- though not all, by any means -- were dismissive of the notion of a third-party candidacy. Such an effort, they pointed out, would almost certainly serve to get Obama re-elected, and for that reason no splinter group of conservatives would consider undertaking it, nor would any halfway serious candidate. They're probably right, but then again, this assumes that we are still living in an age of rational political actors, where politicians run for public office because they actually want to serve or at least advance an agenda -- an assumption that may be hopelessly out of date.
In today's political arena, a certain class of outsider candidates seems mostly intent on achieving a kind of cultural relevance -- the type of broader celebrity that attracts mega book deals and Twitter followers and reality-television contracts. (Palin, in a moment of astounding candor, recently mused that she might find the presidency just too shackling for her ambitions as a public figure.) So it's not really all that hard to imagine some entrepreneurial candidate like Palin or Bachmann looking to fill the vacuum in the Tea Party movement sometime next year, especially if the popular narrative holds that the establishment has somehow triumphed again.
Even putting the presidential race aside, the friction between Republican insiders and outsiders will almost certainly manifest itself next year in other ways. Another wave of Tea Party-backed challengers for the Senate are already preparing to take on establishment candidates in states like Nebraska, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Indiana. Washington Republicans may rejoice that enthusiasm for these campaigns has been slow to build, but after all, the elections aren't for another year, and at this time in 2009 no one had yet heard of Marco Rubio or Rand Paul, either. Tea Party activists who were protesting outside their Statehouses two years ago have now grown more sophisticated; they're quietly organizing through social media, running local candidates and pressuring lawmakers in private meetings. ''We're not protesting in the streets now,'' David Kirkham, the organizer of the Utah Tea Party, told me. ''We are going one on one with state legislators.'' Kirkham, a custom-car maker who was new to politics when I first met him last year, is now mulling a primary against Utah's sitting governor or possibly against Orrin Hatch.
You can look at all this and say that the Tea Party has simply begun the natural process of being absorbed into the establishment, as its leaders become the next generation of legislators and Statehouse lobbyists, much like an earlier generation of social conservatives and crusading libertarians. But there is another interpretation, too, which is that the movement is actually starting to alter the makeup of the party from the bottom up, and it only appears to be losing intensity because its leaders are no longer interested in shouting into bullhorns. If that's true, and if more Tea Party members start streaming into Washington in the years head, then the next chapter of Republican politics in Washington could look less like ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and more like ''Attack of the Clones.''
''I think we're going to have to have at least one more election cycle before people get that this isn't just a typical wave in the business cycle of politics, if you will,'' Kibbe told me. ''We've described the Tea Party movement as a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. And we mean that in the technical-economic term. You have tired leadership, and you have bad ideas and just an inability to serve customers well. And that's when someone comes in with new management and cleans house and either restores the company or breaks it up.''
Kibbe's metaphor sounded jarringly familiar to me, because it was exactly the kind of language I heard from liberal venture capitalists in Silicon Valley back in 2004, when they were busy fomenting insurrection inside the ranks of the Democratic Party. In fact, a lot of Kibbe's rhetoric -- about hostile takeovers and the ''democratization of politics,'' for instance -- could have come directly from the left-leaning activists and donors who gained influence through forums like Moveon.org and Democracy for America in the latter part of the Bush era. It was this same process of ''democratization,'' the breakup of the party's monopoly on money and manpower, that ultimately enabled a black first-term senator to topple his party's presumed nominee on the way to winning the White House.
There are practical explanations for why both party establishments have undergone some version of this same devolution. The most important, and most obvious, is the proliferation of broadband Internet and the way it has redefined, within the space of just a few years, the very concept of a political movement. Another is the change in campaign-finance rules, which incentivizes ideological contributors to send their checks to outside groups or set up their own, thus creating a network of parallel parties whose influence grows with every election cycle.
But of course, what's really going on here is a broader cultural assault on the very idea of establishments, which has affected virtually ever other industry in American life in the last 20 years or so, from television networks and music labels to carmakers and local banks. The Tea Party may fade into history, but there will almost certainly be other Tea Parties, and more of them, affecting both parties and arising in ever quicker succession. To believe yourself now to be, literally, an establishment -- that is, the one legitimate arbiter of just about anything in American life -- is to be tragically misguided.
Some Republicans have accepted this larger reality. ''I get annoyed with all the establishment types here who speak as if they're supposed to be controlling everything, who sound like they're annoyed when things happen that they don't expect,'' Bill Kristol told me. ''I mean, welcome to the world.'' What more pragmatic conservatives like Kristol are trying to do, ultimately, is to strike a highly precarious balance -- to somehow embrace the Tea Party sentiment, as they must, while not allowing themselves or their party to become marginalized as a result.
''Like a lot of other conservatives in Washington,'' Kristol said at one point, '' I've been slightly -- not worried -- but I've just regarded it as one of the things I can do as a genuine Tea Party sympathizer to counsel the Tea Party types to be sensible and not to go overboard and not to go in the wrong direction.
''From my point of view, I wouldn't want them to win all of their fights,'' he went on. ''But I wouldn't want them to go away, honestly. Now, maybe that's too cute, and maybe I can't manage it. And maybe I can't tell Jim DeMint to cause this amount of trouble, but not that amount. And is there a risk he'll win on an issue when I think it's ill advised? Sure. But that's democracy, and I still think that turmoil is the price you pay for a certain kind of vitality and vigor.''
I suggested to Kristol that by trying to exploit the fury of a grass-roots movement for their own ends, while also hoping to temper it, he and his colleagues might be playing with fire.
''The only thing I would object to in that formulation is that we could wish the fire away,'' he told me. ''The fire exists.''

HEADLINE: Cutting Through Cute To the Real Japan

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
ONE thing is certain about the artist known as Tabaimo: her animated videos have never followed the fashion for kawaii, or cuteness, that has ruled Japanese contemporary art for years. Instead, they focus on the anxieties bubbling beneath the surface of everyday life.
Her first installation, ''Japanese Kitchen'' (1999), made at the tail end of her nation's so-called lost decade, shows a housewife cooking while an untuned violin plays and the radio broadcasts news about teenage suicides and job cuts; before long, a politician is spinning in her microwave, spouting platitudes, as she scrubs young girls' legs like carrots and chops off her salaryman husband's head. ''Japanese Bathhouse-Gents'' (2000) tackles changing gender roles: in one scene, businessmen are soaking in their suits in a giant tub when a naked woman suddenly scales the bathhouse wall that separates the sexes and plops down among them with a big splash. Elsewhere, Tabaimo has evoked Japan's commuter trains, urban cityscapes and public toilets. 
Yet although she has become a star inside and outside Japan, with dozens of biennials, triennials and museum shows to her credit, Tabaimo, 36, seems surprisingly untouched by the acclaim -- at least judging from a recent interview at the James Cohan Gallery in Chelsea, where her third New York solo show, ''danDAN,'' continues through Oct. 29.
Even as a student at the Kyoto University of Art and Design, one of Japan's most prestigious art schools, ''I really didn't think about becoming an artist,'' she said, laughing, as she spoke through an interpreter. ''I wanted to become a graphic designer. But when I tried to look for jobs, that didn't work out so well. I was somehow luckily picked up'' by the art world.
A demure woman dressed in a denim workman's jumpsuit, she was initially hard to tell apart from the rest of the team installing her show. Her unassuming demeanor contrasted sharply with the work itself, which has transformed the gallery from the prototypical Chelsea white cube into three flamboyant environments, each of which seems to address some disparity between outer appearances and inner life.
In ''guignorama'' (2006), blue-veined hands emerge from the darkness of a black-curtained room, scratching and rubbing against each other as they sprout toes and metamorphose into feet. (''I had eczema when I was younger,'' Tabaimo explained, ''so I spent a long time looking at my hands.'') Then there is ''Blow'' (2009), staged in a space whose curved walls appear to be submerged in some sort of primordial soup. Limbs, organs and blood vessels stretch upward from the bubbling water, blossoming into plants and flowers when they find air.
''Every day you think about things that happen and you try to verbalize them,'' she said. ''But what one feels inside and what comes out when one expresses oneself, they don't match up.''
For the third piece, ''danDAN'' (2009), a three-channel video depicting apartments in a Japanese housing estate is projected into a three-sided box, creating the sense of looking down from surveillance cameras positioned on the ceiling. As footage of the identically shaped rooms scrolls by, viewers catch glimpses of the lives they contain -- from the mundane (a messy closet, a tidily organized living room) to the disturbing (a blood-spattered bed, a woman washing her face in the toilet and a man climbing into his refrigerator). Tabaimo said the piece was inspired by the six years she spent living in Tokyo.
''You get a glimpse of your neighbors and you begin to characterize them,'' she said. ''Your imagination takes flight.''
For many viewers, Tabaimo's appeal starts with her unusual aesthetic, a melange of surreal happenings, mangalike line drawings and the softly modulated coloration of Ukiyo-e woodblock prints. Although her animations are digitized -- usually by her younger sister and primary assistant, Imoimo -- they begin with hundreds of drawings, made by Tabaimo with pens or an automatic calligraphy brush.
The combination fascinated Shelley Langdale, the associate curator of prints and drawings at the Philadelphia Museum of Art who put Tabaimo's 2007 ''dolefullhouse'' video in the first Philagrafika triennial last year. (The piece, which had its debut at the 2007 Venice Biennale, depicts giant human hands playing with a westernized dollhouse; an octopus keeps creeping into the rooms and the walls soon crack open to reveal a pulsating vascular system.) ''There is an anime look to her work,'' Ms. Langdale said, ''but she is also calling on traditional Japanese visual culture to allude to this constant tension in Japanese society between old customs and increasing globalism.''
From a Japanese viewpoint, Tabaimo's biting social critique packs the hardest punch.
''When I first saw her work, I really couldn't believe that a university student made it,'' said Yuka Uematsu, a curator at the National Museum of Art in Osaka and the commissioner of the Japanese pavilion at the Venice Biennale who organized Tabaimo's show there this year. ''Not only because it was a video installation, but because of the theme itself. She was focusing on typical Japanese society'' -- a realism Ms. Uematsu had not seen in Japanese art before -- ''but critically, in her own way.''
The piece Ms. Uematsu encountered was ''Japanese Kitchen,'' Tabaimo's first student work, whose mundane setting suddenly erupts into matter-of-fact savagery: after the housewife decapitates her laid-off husband, his headless body rises and shoots her dead. As if to hammer home the point that such intense feelings were simmering behind the shoji screens of recession-era Japan, Tabaimo displayed it inside a four-walled enclosure reminiscent of a typical Japanese room, its walls emblazoned with the Japanese flag.
Tabaimo soon found herself included in a number of international shows, including the 2001 Yokohama Trienniale and the 2002 Sao Paulo Biennale. She also won the prestigious Kirin Contemporary Award competition, which led to her first solo show in 2000 at the Kirin headquarters in Osaka. Yet because Tabaimo, whose real name is Ayako Tabata, assumed that competition would be a one-time event, she showed under her nickname, a contraction of her surname and imouto, or ''little sister'' in Japanese.
''It was playful,'' she said. ''I thought that would be it for shows, because I would get a real job.''
Fixated on that idea, it took Tabaimo several years to accept her success. After spending 2003 working for a graphic designer in London, she finally realized that art was the better path. That year ''I decided on what direction my life should take,'' she said. But it was the experience of living in a more multicultural society that changed her work. Meeting Japanese people who had been raised elsewhere overturned her notions about what being Japanese meant.
''Things that I thought were for certain suddenly became uncertain,'' she said. ''I needed to reconfirm that by looking more closely at myself.''
Recently she has gained inspiration from another unusual source: her parents. Four years ago, she and her younger sister moved home to live with them in Karazuiwa, an Aspenlike mountain resort town outside Tokyo. Her mother, a ceramicist, makes dinnerware for elaborate multicourse kaiseki meals, and her father, formerly a salaryman, helps her mother in the studio. As Tabaimo put it, laughing, ''We have two creative teams going'' at home.
Having a closer connection with her father, especially, she said, has enriched her insight into her own culture. ''I'm beginning to understand his generation better,'' she said. ''I'm interested in trying to bridge the generations in my work.''
As her knowledge has deepened, her animations have grown increasingly metaphorical and abstract, with hair, hands, flowers and the sea replacing cultural specifics. And her installations have become more elaborate: her most ambitious work to date, ''teleco-soup,'' now representing Japan at the 2011 Venice Biennale (through Nov. 27), uses mirrors, curved walls and multiple-channel projections to give visitors the illusion that they are walking through a city subsumed by floodwaters, blossoming roses and fire. (Although the drawings for the piece were conceived and executed well before the earthquake and tsunami devastated the Tohoku region of northern Japan last March, some saw in it an allusion to these events.)
When making a work today, Tabaimo starts by focusing on the exhibition space. ''I go there and I see what the air feels like,'' she said. ''Then I go home. That's when words, images, motifs and movements come to me a little at a time. It's a matter of combining them for the work to emerge.''

HEADLINE: Mad About Her: Pauline Kael, Loved and Loathed

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS and A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
THE longtime New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael didn't just write about movies -- she made it seem as if they were worth fighting about. Nearly 20 years after her retirement and a decade after her death, she remains an often polarizing figure. On Oct. 27, the Library of America will publish ''The Age of Movies: Selected Writings of Pauline Kael,'' followed four days later by the publication of ''Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark,'' a sometimes surprising biography by Brian Kellow, from Viking. A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis discuss her work and its legacy. 
MANOHLA DARGIS I was talking to a critic friend recently who, with a sigh of regret, mentioned what he characterized as the assault on critical authority. This isn't a new topic for professional opinionators like us: in the age of Rotten Tomatoes, with its hundreds of reviewers weighing in on new movies, and Yelp, where nonprofessionals thrust their thumbs up or down, the idea that critics don't have the say they once had has been much discussed during the Great Decline (of critical influence, the publishing industry, the economy). The notion that critics once had power is certainly one of the selling points on the jacket for the Kael biography, which states that during her time at The New Yorker (1968-91) she ''became the most widely read, the most influential, the most powerful, and, often enough, the most provocative critic in America.''
A.O. SCOTT I have to say that the idea of critical authority has always struck me as slippery, even chimerical. Authority over whom? Power to do what? The importance of particular critics can't be quantified in lumens of fame, circulation numbers or box office returns, though by all of these measures Kael, in her heyday, certainly enjoyed unusual prominence. But like every other critic, she was above all a writer, and a writer only really ever has -- or cares about -- one kind of power, which is the power to engage readers.
I think Kael is remembered not for her particular judgments or ideas, but rather for her voice, for an outsized literary personality that could be enthralling and infuriating, often both. A lot of people read her for the pleasure of disagreement, and the resentment she was able to provoke -- in critical targets and rival critics -- is surely evidence of power. An awful lot of our colleagues are still, in both senses, mad about her. To reread her is to understand why.
Her sensibility was passionate, abrasive and rarely consistent. Reviewing ''Deeper Into Movies,'' a 1973 collection of Kael's reviews and essays, Irving Howe noted that she did not write out of ''a secure critical tradition. Its absence allows her a pleasing freedom of improvisation, but makes very hard the achievement of reflective depth or delicate judgment.''
That seems to me both fair and arguable. You will search Kael's collected work in vain for a theory, a system, or even a consistent set of principles. The Library of America volume is an anthology of hunches, prejudices, preoccupations and reactions. But that is what makes it so lively, and what makes Kael such a thrilling and vexing writer even now, when the particular movies she wrote about have either faded into semi-oblivion or been granted safe passage into the canon. She will not lead you to correct positions, but she is an example of the right way to do criticism, which is with everything you have.
DARGIS Given how badly she comes across in the biography -- palling around with filmmakers she reviewed is merely the beginning -- she doesn't set a good example. Her passion for film burned bright and long, but what's missing, at least in this telling, is an equal passion for, and pleasure in, life beyond the screen. The book is queasily readable, but it reconfirms that Kael's work no longer speaks to me. I rarely if ever, find myself thinking, gee, I really want to reread her hyperventilated rave of Robert Altman's ''Nashville.'' What's more interesting now is how she continues to function as a player and signifier in certain discussions about '60s and '70s American cinema, at least for an earlier generation.
If she still casts a shadow it's less because of her ideas, pugilistic writing style, ethical lapses and cruelties (and not merely in her reviews), and more because she was writing at a time when movies, their critics and, by extension, the mainstream media had a greater hold on American culture than they do now. In his book ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' Peter Biskind relates a story from the mid-'80s when Kael turned to Richard Schickel at a meeting of film critics and said, ''It isn't any fun anymore.'' Mr. Schickel asked her why and she replied: ''Remember how it was in the '60s and '70s, when movies were hot, when we were hot? Movies seemed to matter.'' The thing is, they did matter and still do, just differently.
One thing that changed was the role of the film critic, who by the mid-'80s no longer had to persuade a skeptical, sometimes hostile general audience that it was necessary to take movies seriously. In 1967, though, Kael had to explain in The New Yorker why and how ''Bonnie and Clyde'' was important (and in 9,000 words!). She was part of a critical vanguard spreading the new film gospel in reviews, books, talk shows, everywhere. They were true pop cultural figures. The critic Judith Crist even shilled for a feminine-hygiene spray. She later said that she did the ad because Richard Avedon took the photos, she could write most of the text and the ad would reach more than 100 million readers. Also: she got $5,000.
But by the mid-'80s, when Kael was missing the old hotness, Siskel and Ebert were already famous.
SCOTT I think it's still fun, still hot -- though maybe not feminine hygiene hot -- and that mourning of lost golden ages is a recipe for reactionary myopia. Still, it certainly helped that Kael was around at a time when movies were newly and contentiously acknowledged as a serious art form while still thriving as a medium of mass entertainment. Perhaps more than any other film critic, she dramatized in her writing a tension between the seductions of pop and the demands of art. (Not that she was alone. Susan Sontag grappled with similar contradictions, as, in their way, did first-generation rock critics like Robert Christgau and Kael's friend Greil Marcus.)
She's often characterized as a champion of trashy pleasures, but that's not quite right. She could be withering about the ''Fantasies of the Art-House Audience'' but also suspicious of the mindless sensationalism (''jolts for jocks'') that commercial cinema seemed intent on feeding the larger public. As a result, she was accused of snobbery and also of philistinism, and at various points in her oeuvre both charges seem to stick.
One thing I learned from Mr. Kellow's book was that, in her younger years, Kael (who was born in 1919), was part of an avant-garde literary and artistic scene in San Francisco and New York that included the poet Robert Duncan and, somewhat tangentially, the composer Samuel Barber. But she was impatient with this world. The filmmaker James Broughton, her former lover (and the father of her daughter, Gina James), once wrote: ''She deplored little magazines, little theater, little films. She valued the big time, the big number, the big screen.'' She was, that is, at once a bohemian rebel and also a rebel against bohemianism, which explains some of the intellectual syncopation of her work -- the embrace of the mainstream and the recoil from it, the contradictory desire to find in movies both specialness and universality.
DARGIS Her bohemian background is intriguing, more so than her tenure at The New Yorker. It's hard not to wonder if her later antipathy toward avant-garde cinema was born out of those early San Francisco years, including her relationship with Broughton. Certainly her outsider identity, as a Californian among other things, remained significant. You quoted Irving Howe as saying that she wasn't writing from a secure critical tradition, but she didn't need to. She was writing from the gut, the heart, the heat of the moment, but more crucially, she was writing at a time in cultural history when the lines between high and mass art had broken down, liberating movies and her.
As critics, all we have are our beliefs, ideals, prejudices, blind spots, our reservoirs of historical and personal knowledge, and the strength of our arguments. There are empirical truths that we can say about a movie: it was shot in black and white or color, on film or digital, in widescreen or not, directed by this or that filmmaker. But beyond these absolutes there is only our thinking, opinions, ideologies, methodological approaches and moments in time. That isn't to say that criticism is a postmodern anything goes; it is to admit that critics are historical actors and that our relationships with movies, as with everything in life, are contingent on those moments. Her moment was exciting. So too is ours.
Movies and criticism have kept moving and it's worth noting that because of the Internet, there are now more critics than ever and more cinematically knowledgeable ones, too -- the diffusion of expertise is one reason that critics no longer have the impact they did. They have an effect -- if not the visibility, book contracts or talk-show stints -- and what's out there now is more of a din than the chattering of a water cooler discussion. And there's an astonishing amount of exciting work coming out of academia. These are boom times for new and old media studies, though you wouldn't necessarily know that from the entertainment media and its obsessive emphasis on celebrity, the Oscars and the box office.
SCOTT I agree that notwithstanding a certain amount of fluff and noise, we are living in an age of varied and vigorous criticism. And that if a certain cachet and bravura has been lost, quite a bit has been gained in terms of intellectual brio and open debate.
Speaking of which, I confess that I've never quite understood the Andrew Sarris-Pauline Kael beef, which supposedly galvanized and polarized the critical world in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The personal animus and coterie vendettas are quite real, of course, and still have some vestigial presence in our profession, but the idea that Mr. Sarris and Kael represent opposed positions does not really stand up to scrutiny.
Though he is famous as the leading American proponent of the ''auteur theory,'' Mr. Sarris has often pointed out that it is not a theory in the strong, scientific sense (like the theory of evolution or the theory of relativity), but rather a guiding intuition: that a film is a work of art and the principal artist is the director. For all the scorn she heaped on Mr. Sarris, in practice Kael's habit was to focus on the director, to champion the ones she thought were advancing the art and to rap their knuckles when they fell short of her expectations. And Mr. Sarris, for all his reputation as a formalist, has always been interested in movies as a source of aesthetic pleasure. What their rivalry defined was not a war of ideas but a climate of argument.

HEADLINE: Give Young Boys in Morocco a Camera ...

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
FOR the last five years the Spanish filmmaker Oliver Laxe has lived mainly in the northern Moroccan city of Tangier, where he developed a film workshop at a shelter for disadvantaged children. At first glance, Mr. Laxe's debut feature, ''You All Are Captains,'' looks to be a straightforward reflection of this experience: he appears as himself, lecturing on photographic optics and showing his young charges, all preadolescent and adolescent boys, how to operate a 16-millimeter camera.
But the film, which won the international critics' prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010 and opens at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan on Wednesday, soon steps into a hall of mirrors. Scenes are replayed, actors break character and at around the halfway point Mr. Laxe is ejected from the movie, after the children complain about his self-absorption and the confounding collaborative project he has foisted on them. (''This isn't a film.'' ''A film needs a story.'') 
His replacement, a local musician named Shakib, leads the children on an outing to the countryside. Their film project seems to have been abandoned, or perhaps, it has been absorbed into the film we are watching. With the on-screen Oliver banished but Mr. Laxe still behind the camera, ''You All Are Captains'' becomes a pastoral of sorts -- lingering on the landscapes, olive trees and animals that the boys had earlier said they wanted to film -- ''but with a little bit of fiction,'' as one of them puts it.
A shape-shifting movie that becomes increasingly hard to categorize and contain, ''You All Are Captains'' has been described as a documentary-fiction hybrid. But it is perhaps more instructive to call it a metafiction, concerned with the way stories can be activated and reframed, or a documentary of its own making, revealing both the conflict and the labor of the creative process.
Mr. Laxe said that he came to a crucial realization early on: ''I am the biggest child in the film,'' he said by e-mail. ''I had to accept that the film was not about the children but about me.''
Born to Spanish parents in Paris, Mr. Laxe, 29, studied filmmaking at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. He first traveled to Tangier in 2006 on what he called a ''purely random'' impulse, drawn in part by the mythic portrayals of earlier expatriates like Paul Bowles and William S. Burroughs.
Mr. Laxe is the first to admit that there was an element of self-interest in his decision to work with children: their curiosity inspired him, and he valued the freshness of their perspectives.
''I wanted to rediscover a part of my personality,'' he said. ''I wanted to film in a much freer way, as children do, shooting just what you think is interesting and stimulating, with the constant feeling that the world is strange.''
The goal of seeing the world anew also underlies Mr. Laxe's short film, ''Paris #1'' (2007), made in collaboration with friends in Galicia, in northwest Spain, who were entrusted to ''film what they like, without preconceived ideas.'' Likewise, ''You All Are Captains,'' shot in a limpid black and white that resists the usual touristic depictions of colorful Morocco, emphasizes the transformative act of looking from the first scene, in which the children debate the color of a chameleon and gaze up at a passing plane. One boy suggests they close their eyes to ''see it better.''
Self-consciously framed as the misadventures of a foreign interloper, ''You All Are Captains'' takes a deceptively light hand to quandaries that have long plagued filmmakers who approach their subjects from across cultural and economic divides. Mr. Laxe doesn't solve these problems so much as delight in complicating them. The imbalance of power between the filmmaker and the filmed, the troubling subtext of many a documentary, is front and center here, and as the struggle between the teacher and his students plays out in unpredictable and not always visible ways, this tricky dynamic is highlighted, critiqued and reversed. (Even before their midfilm mutiny, the children are seen training their cameras on a group of European tourists, who grumble, ''They should ask for our permission to film us.'')
Mr. Laxe's boldest strategy is to insert himself into his movie, and more than that, to implicate himself by playing the nominal villain: ''the typical European neocolonialist artist,'' as he put it. He described his dual role of protagonist and director as ''a negotiation between my cynicism and my romanticism'' -- in other words, between the sometimes callow figure on screen and the more thoughtful and generous one making the movie.
''What struck me about Oliver's work is how successfully it occupies this no-man's-land between fact and fiction,'' said David Wilson, the co-director of the True/False Film Festival in Columbia, Mo., where ''You All Are Captains'' had its United States premiere in March. ''He forces the viewer to stop caring about whether something is factually true or not and instead asks us to follow him into this space which is uniquely his.''
Down to its title, the movie could be seen as a gesture of empowerment or of ultimate empathy: an attempt to see the world through the eyes of its subjects. But it is of course Mr. Laxe the director who remains the movie's guiding hand, its true captain.
''I chose the title for its musicality, but for me it's a film about the cruelty of creation, which is undemocratic,'' he said. ''We all are captains or have the right and opportunity to be, but it will be some more than others.''
Both in his work and his remarks, Mr. Laxe seems less interested in resolving contradictions than in embracing them. He described his next project, ''Las Mimosas,'' which he said would deal with Moroccan caravans, the myth of Faust and a Sufi wise man, as an ''idealistic film about the absurdity of idealism.''
Mr. Laxe's insistence on taking play seriously recalls ''Homo Ludens'' (''playing man''), the seminal 1938 work by the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, which argued for the central role of creative play in society and culture. Mr. Laxe said he thought of ''You All Are Captains'' as a game, played with his collaborators and the audience, in a spirit not of trickery but of openness and discovery. He invoked the iconoclastic Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who said that the liberated viewer rejoices in ''the freedom of the artist.''
''What surprises me most about filmmaking is to constantly rediscover that all the director does is to put things in motion, to provoke,'' Mr. Laxe said. ''Art becomes a matter of attitudes and gestures. Everything depends on the energy that triggers things.''

HEADLINE: A Downtown Icon's Nurturing Spirit

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Ellen Stewart, the founder and longtime impresario of La MaMa Experimental Theater Club in the East Village, was speaking to her entire staff at a nearby restaurant when she dropped a bombshell. ''Mia,'' she said, ''will be the new me.''
That would be Mia Yoo, who, while it was widely understood was being groomed as a successor, had no idea this announcement was coming. She was so stunned that she promptly ran out the door. '' 'Oh my God,' I said, 'it's my kid's bedtime!' '' she recalled, laughing during a recent interview in the Ellen Stewart Theater, the largest of the three spaces at La MaMa.
The flamboyant Ms. Stewart, who died in January at 91, may have been known as the mama, giving the 50-year old downtown institution its name and identity, but Ms. Yoo, 40, and now its artistic director, is more likely to refer to herself as a mother. 
''I am not the mama,'' she said. ''Now the institution is.''
Replacing a founder, whether it's a Joseph Papp or a Steve Jobs, is never easy, but taking over at La MaMa poses peculiar challenges as well as opportunities. At a time when many major adventurous theater companies have either lost their space (St. Ann's Warehouse) or are temporarily homeless (Performance Space 122), Ms. Yoo has a very precious asset: downtown real estate.
At the same time, she inherits a theater that often inspires more nostalgia than buzz. In a sign of its fading critical reputation, The Village Voice, the alternative weekly where the term Off Off Broadway was coined, recently published an article in which three out of its four drama critics cited La MaMa as the theater they were least excited to visit.
Mark Russell -- who runs the Under the Radar festival, the Public Theater's annual showcase for cutting-edge work, and who has advised Ms. Yoo -- describes her challenge as striking a balance. ''The trick is to hold on to relationships while also reaching out to new ones,'' he said. ''Ellen held on to her artists, and that's not always necessarily a good thing.''
Ms. Yoo was practically born into La MaMa's family. Her father, a Korean director who met her Jewish-American mother while studying theater at Trinity University in San Antonio, was close with Ms. Stewart and staged productions at La MaMa in the late '60s. Ms. Yoo, who did some acting as a Brown University undergraduate, was unsure of her plans after graduating until she went to Italy to visit a branch of La MaMa.
Stewart ''changed my life,'' said Ms. Yoo, who originally had in mind a life in public service. ''That's when I saw a theater bigger than just the art,'' she added. ''It was about community and what it means to be human.''
Ms. Yoo emphasizes the continuity of the transition, and her first season, which she has billed ''Homecoming,'' includes many familiar names (Ping Chong, Dario D'Ambrosi) as well as tributes to the theater's founder. On Sunday there will be a free block party outside the theater's home, and on Monday a big-ticket gala bringing back many La MaMa veterans will celebrate the theater's 50th anniversary. Bill Irwin, Estelle Parsons and Wallace Shawn are scheduled to appear, and Sam Shepard is slated to receive the first annual Ellen Stewart Award. There will also be a sneak preview of a play with music, ''La MaMa Cantata,'' composed and directed by Elizabeth Swados and comprising quotes from Stewart and her admirers.
While the founding mama's name has hardly gone away, signs of a new direction are detectable. Ms. Yoo is championing a high-tech project called Culturehub that allows theatermakers in different countries to work together by video conference. She calls this system, which allows for life-size images, ''Skype on steroids.'' The pioneering multimedia artist John Jesurun will hold master classes and workshops with students from New York, California and Korea using the system this season.
Ms. Yoo has also programmed shows by artists making their debuts at La MaMa. Karin Coonrod, currently directing ''Love's Labour's Lost'' at the Public, will direct a new Romanian drama, ''I Killed My Mother,'' in February. She reached out to Ms. Yoo, who knew her reputation but had never seen her work. ''I don't want to sound hokey,'' said Ms. Yoo, ''but there was a connection between us.''
Of course, picking artists based on intuition was a hallmark of Ms. Stewart's, who, legend has it, would judge a script based on weight and a director on smell.
To make room, Ms. Yoo had to make some tough choices, including informing the theater's resident companies (some of them affiliated with La MaMa since its early decades) that they would no longer be able to present work annually.
''Unlike Ellen, I don't feel so territorial about this place,'' Ms. Yoo said. ''It's a people's theater. The more people involved in the process, the better.''
At the same time, Ms. Yoo -- an actress whose most famous credit might be in Peter Hall's nine-hour ''Tantalus'' -- said she's fiercely committed to Ms. Stewart's support for diverse and international work.
She said she was too busy to see any theater outside of the nearly 60 productions put on yearly at La MaMa, adding that the space's core mission is not merely to be a home for new experimental artists. ''It was never our vision to be the next wave,'' said Ms. Yoo. ''I think of it as a home for artists at all stages of their career.''
Ms. Yoo, who had been working as co-artistic director for two years, will need to stabilize the economic and physical foundations of the theater, which she estimated will have a $2 million budget for the coming season. Staff salaries have already gone up slightly.
''Ellen said, 'I chose poverty and everyone who comes along with me chooses it, too,' '' Ms. Yoo said. ''Maybe it's because I have a kid, but I want the people working here to have stability.'' To that end, she has planned two major galas for the season, one more than last year.
Building renovation is on the agenda, too. The theater is hardly slick or modern, retaining a musty, bare-bones feel of the old Off Off Broadway.
''Ellen didn't focus on the buildings,'' said Frank Carucci, the president of the board. ''She was focused on the artists. She was a humanitarian and an artist, but we have buildings and they need to be upgraded.''
He hinted that later this year, the board will commence a long-term capital campaign that will renovate lights, the roof and air-conditioning.
The biggest change, however, might be a matter of personality. Ms. Yoo is more soft-spoken and down-to-earth than Ms. Stewart. It's hard to imagine her banning the color green from productions because it was bad luck, as Ms. Stewart did. When asked about her favorite night at La MaMa, Ms. Yoo cautiously declined to answer. She deflected, too, an attempt to have her define her aesthetic point of view.
But several days after the interview, she followed up with an e-mail. She said she wanted to honor the history of La MaMa, which ''includes the principles of inclusivity, internationalism, intergenerational dialogue, giving opportunities and creating a home for the artist.''
She added, ''That means that probably there will be times when the work that is presented is not necessarily what I would like artistically, but the mission is bigger than one person's artistic judgment.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street, With Calm, Not Hysteria

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
ON the day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, shattering confidence in the banking system and sending the stock market into a tailspin, the trading floor at the firm's Midtown Manhattan headquarters appeared surprisingly calm. Bankers conferred in whispers; some quietly fiddled with resumes. The only obvious signs of tumult were the television news trucks parked outside.
I happened to be there that morning in 2008, not as a banker but a trespasser: a reporter covering Wall Street, I had sneaked into the building with the help of a trusted source. As I avoided security guards and surreptitiously filed reports from a men's-room stall, what struck me most was the absence of panic, the strange stillness that seemed to permeate the place: the melancholy silence of a once-great global corporation staring into the void. 
Wall Street movies, which must find entertainment in ticker symbols and balance sheets, tend to fall somewhat short of Wall Street reality, where millions of dollars can be won and lost with all the pomp of a mouse click. Filmmakers like Oliver Stone and others have tried to inject a palpable sense of the underlying stakes. Think of the mano a mano Blue Star Airlines fight in Mr. Stone's ''Wall Street,'' the glamorous merger in ''Working Girl,'' or the commodities frenzy at the end of ''Trading Places.''
Then there's the new film ''Margin Call,'' which recounts 24 hours in the life (and near death) of an unnamed firm facing a Lehman-like crisis. It may be one of the quietest films about Wall Street ever made.
Its showdowns take place not on Hamptons estates or at motorcycle races but in sterile boardrooms, where lives and careers are upended in muted conversation. It forgoes screaming-on-the-phone scenes for coolly lighted images of traders calmly working their desks. Gordon Gekko, this is not. And that's fine with J. C. Chandor, the film's first-time writer and director, who was never aiming for the master-of-the-universe approach.
''You walk onto most trading floors, and the more tense things get, the quieter they become,'' Mr. Chandor said over lunch the other day. Pausing for a laugh, he added later: ''It is sort of a challenge! It's not very exciting visually, a bunch of people stressing out.''
''Margin Call,'' which Mr. Chandor, 37, wrote in the days after Lehman failed, was an effort to understand the human side of a financial crisis, or as he put it, ''the decision-making process that got us into this mess.'' The idea was to avoid oversimplification. ''Everything in my gut said don't lie here,'' he said. At the same time, he told himself, ''Don't blow this up into something that it isn't.''
Other cinematic takes on the financial crisis have aimed for grander themes. Mr. Stone made ''Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps'' as a morality tale, pitting Good against Gekko. Like the original ''Wall Street,'' with its pro-labor overtones, it also served as something of a liberal manifesto against the evils of unchecked capitalism and consumption. The more recent ''Too Big to Fail,'' an adaptation of Andrew Ross Sorkin's play-by-play account of the Lehman collapse, tried to make an action hero of Henry M. Paulson, the former treasury secretary -- perhaps the ultimate in Hollywood fantasy.
Mr. Chandor said his approach ''doesn't mean there isn't a great truth'' to those other films. ''But they are a little bit amped up.''
In its attention to human fears and foibles, ''Margin Call'' resembles a higher-end version of ''Boiler Room,'' also a low-budget Wall Street film, but one set in the unsavory world of penny stocks. Yet Ben Younger, that film's writer and director, laughed at the idea of another stock-market-related film.
''I'm frankly surprised they're still making them,'' Mr. Younger said. ''Between 'Wall Street,' 'Boiler Room,' 'Wall Street 2' and then 'Too Big to Fail,' I felt that kind of covered every iteration of a finance movie.''
For Mr. Younger, the inevitability of financial folly -- and real bankers' odd veneration of ostensibly evil characters like Gekko, an irony he highlighted in ''Boiler Room'' -- has turned him sour.
''These people keep taking advantage of the system, and we keep getting burned,'' he said. ''What else is left to explore? It's in the headlines every day, and nothing else seems to change.''
''Margin Call'' did not stem from a desire to indict the system. Somewhat akin to Mr. Stone, the son of a stockbroker, Mr. Chandor grew up watching his father, a Merrill Lynch investment banker, muddle through the day-to-day challenges of a career on Wall Street.
''He was a lifer,'' Mr. Chandor said of his father, who recently retired. ''I was watching that human side of it: when you're depressed, when you're not depressed, when you're up or down.''
A realistic film also fit with Mr. Chandor's realistic budget: a former director of commercials who briefly detoured into real estate, he was doubtful that he would have much money to play with: ''How do you tell a story about one of the biggest global things that's happened in the last 15 or 20 years for under a million bucks?''
The budget ended up at $3.5 million, after the project was picked up by Before the Door Pictures, the actor Zachary Quinto's production company. It helped attract a cast of name actors, including Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey and Stanley Tucci, in addition to Mr. Quinto (''Star Trek''), who plays a junior bank analyst.
''A lot of what our film is really exploring is that it's easy to vilify, it's easy to moralize and judge and blame people for what happened,'' Mr. Quinto said. ''And not inappropriately, completely! But there's also a whole swath of people who were just doing their jobs, who weren't complicit in the decision-making process that led to all of this.''
So is this supposed to be Requiem for a Banker? ''It was a little more complicated,'' Mr. Quinto said. ''I knew I came out of it with a strong intention to not invest in the stock market, that's for sure.''
Peter Sullivan, Mr. Quinto's character, is the one who discovers the sour assets that may doom the company. Though he spends much of the film wondering whether the world of seven-figure paychecks is worth saving, it's fair to say Peter is no Bud Fox, the ''Wall Street'' character who is slugged by his boss, Gordon Gekko, while wearing a wire for the feds.
''He has a deeply rooted moral ambiguity about it,'' said Mr. Quinto, who added that he and the filmmaker discussed his character's arc at length. ''It was hard for me as an actor to reconcile Peter's choices.''
Yet those contradictions were among the reasons that Mr. Quinto and his colleagues backed the project. ''We want to generate those kinds of conversations that make people think,'' he said.
''Margin Call'' happened to be screening around the corner from the old Lehman offices, and I stopped by for a look. The building is now festooned with the logos of Barclays, which acquired Lehman after its bankruptcy, and the trading floor was filled with a new crop of bankers, plugging away at their desks. It looked a lot like business as usual.
Correction: October 16, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 10 this weekend about the new Wall Street movie ''Margin Call'' reverses the names of the two characters in the 1987 movie ''Wall Street'' who slugged each other in a scene in Central Park. It was Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Gekko, who punched Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen.

HIGHLIGHT: This is getting interesting. 

 BODY:
A couple of scattered notes on what's going on.
First, Suze Orman endorses the protests:
I want to publicly say thank you to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Thank you for not accepting the status quo. Thank you for not assuming there is nothing to be done. Thank you for rattling the cages. Much coverage of Occupy Wall Street has cast this as the beginning of something new. That's only partly true. What I find so encouraging is that Occupy Wall Street's more important message is that this marks an end point. An end to just shrugging and putting up with the inequity. An end to patiently waiting for government to get its act together and take steps to reduce the pain felt by millions of Americans who are unemployed, the millions more who are underemployed, and the millions more again who worry that if we indeed slip into a double dip recession they will soon become unemployed. An end to letting Washington just continue further down its dysfunctional dark hole without being called out. 
I think we can definitely say that the effort to dismiss the whole thing as a bunch of smelly ignorant hippies has failed.
Second, I'm a bit behind on this, but the Times had an excellent piece yesterday on what the lords of finance are saying in private. Whiners take all!
I especially liked the guy who said that we must treat finance nicely because it's the only thing America is still good at. Aside from the fact that this is an insult to American workers, who are actually quite productive in a lot of areas given a chance, how, exactly, did we become a society in which so many of our elite students end up going into finance? Was that, you know, sort of a choice -- and a bad one?
It's also useful, for a bit of perspective, to go back to another good Times article from the summer of 2007, The Richest of the Rich, Proud of a New Gilded Age:
These days, Mr. Weill and many of the nation's very wealthy chief executives, entrepreneurs and financiers echo an earlier era - the Gilded Age before World War I - when powerful enterprises, dominated by men who grew immensely rich, ushered in the industrialization of the United States. The new titans often see themselves as pillars of a similarly prosperous and expansive age, one in which their successes and their philanthropy have made government less important than it once was. 
The prosperity, such as it was -- it never did trickle down much -- is gone. But these guys still think they earned it all, and the rest of us should be grateful to have them.

BYLINE: DON H. DOYLE


HIGHLIGHT: How a mild-mannered Parisian professor revolutionized European attitudes about the Union. 

 BODY:
Soon after he arrived in Paris, in early October 1861, John Bigelow, the newly appointed American consul general to France, paid a visit to a quiet house on Rue Taitbout, about a mile north of the Louvre. The home belonged to the grandly named Edouard-Rene Lefebvre de Laboulaye, a small, soft-spoken professor of history at the College de France, one of the country's elite institutions of higher learning. Laboulaye was an expert on American history, and Bigelow was there to ask him for a small favor: to change the way the French thought about America's civil war.
Bigelow was a veteran New York newspaper man and savvy Republican Party operative. Though nominally a diplomat, his real task in Paris was to counteract anti-Union sentiment; fellow agents had been sent to London, Rome and other European capitals. All were charged with giving "a right direction to public sentiment" by making himself acquainted with the leading men of the national press. Today we would call this "public diplomacy," though, of necessity, they operated largely in secret.
Upon arriving at Rue Taitbout, Bigelow was "conducted into rooms crowded with books and numerous tables groaning under all the apparatus and teeming with the confusion of active and prolific authorship." He gazed at the "curious and rare engravings" on the walls and dozens of books on American history and government. Soon Laboulaye entered the room. His thin hair was smoothed against his head framing the olive-complexion of his face. He wore a black frock coat buttoned close to the chin giving him, Bigelow thought, a "slightly clerical appearance." 
Laboulaye was the leading European expert of his day on American history and government. Though he never visited America, he admired it enormously. For Laboulaye the still-young country was a rare and successful example of self-government, one that France had much to learn from. As he often reminded his students, since 1789, when France experienced its Revolution and America ratified its Constitution, France had gone through 14 constitutions and 10 revolutionary changes of government. 
Laboulaye won his professorship the year after the Revolution of 1848 and began immediately lecturing and writing on America and its Constitution as a model for France. Two years later Napoleon III engineered a "coup d'etat," proclaimed the Second Empire, and introduced a dark new era of political repression and intellectual censorship. Laboulaye watched as his liberal colleagues were dismissed from their professorships, and he decided to follow a safe course by teaching and writing on the legal history of Ancient Rome. His lectures were, by all accounts, pedantic and poorly attended, this probably to Laboulaye's relief, for he was terrified of speaking before a large audience. 
Now America's Civil War threatened to prove the entire experiment in self-government a failure. The crisis reawakened Laboulaye's intellectual mission to educate France about America. By 1859 he resumed lecturing on American history and law. His classes soon filled with students and visitors, including foreigners, workers and political reformers, eventually so many they formed a line outside the lecture hall. "Until now I have lived and spoken in an honorable solitude, and for a small circle of devoted friends," Laboulaye told his students that year. Now, France needed "ideas that constitute the grandeur of man," and he felt great joy at being part of this "general reveille." "La question americaine" suddenly created an arena within which liberals could safely talk about the central political issues of the day - by talking about America. 
What had caught Bigelow's eye was a lengthy article on "La guerre civille aux Etats-Unis" by Laboulaye in the "Journal des Debats," one of the most influential journals in Europe. What impressed Bigelow about Laboulaye's essay was not just the "spirit of cordial sympathy with the North" but also his "singularly correct appreciation of the matter at issue." First, he made it clear that "the desire of perpetuating and propagating slavery and of making it the corner stone of a new public policy was the true cause of the revolt." Second, secession was not a lawful constitutional process - this was a rebellion. Third, the commercial and geo-political interests of France depended on the success of the Union, not the South.
The piece particularly stood out because the journal's editor for American affairs was Michel Chevalier, who used "Debats" as a platform for trumpeting the cause of the South. A strong pro-South bias had already been planted in the minds of French government officials and opinion leaders by the outgoing American diplomatic corps, most of whom were pro-southern Democrats. "Public sympathy at court in the press in the clubs and in general society," Bigelow noted, "was very largely with the insurgents." Napoleon III seemed eager to grant recognition to the Confederacy, and it looked like he would find little opposition at home. 
France wasn't the only place where pro-Confederate sympathy was on the rise; indeed, the Union was not just losing the battle of public diplomacy in Europe, it wasn't even showing up at the fight. When Bigelow visited London en route to Paris, he was appalled to learn Charles Francis Adams Jr., the Union minister in London, was not only unacquainted with the leading journalists of the city but indifferent toward those offering to lend their pen to the Union cause. William Dayton, the minister in Paris, was a New Jersey politician who seemed completely at sea in French court politics and social affairs. Dayton neither spoke nor read French and was making no effort to learn, depending on interpreters for even the most banal exchanges. 
To his credit, it was Dayton who suggested appointing as consul someone familiar with the French and its press and made it possible for Bigelow to begin redirecting public opinion. Bigelow poured himself into all things French. Every day he read French newspapers, journals, histories and biographies. He worked diligently to improve his command of the language, and he reported with schoolboy pride to his diary how he was coming along, and scolded himself when his conversation sputtered. He wrote in French, attended lectures, plunged into conversations in French and made acquaintance with the leading intellectuals of the day, notably those liberals who opposed Napoleon III and began to use the Union cause as a proxy for their own liberal, republican ideals. 
But Bigelow's primary job was not so much to translate Union propaganda into French, as it was to animate native voices capable of interpreting the American cause to the French mind in its own idiom. That's why he had come to Rue Taitbout. His meeting with Laboulaye was to discuss publishing and distributing a revised version of the review essay he had done for "Debats." 
Bigelow was overjoyed to find the professor in hearty agreement. "I am completely at your disposal," Laboulaye responded. "I shall be charmed to serve a cause which is the cause of all the friends of liberty." Though Bigelow had at his disposal a generous purse funded by the State Department to encourage authors and open the doors to editors, Laboulaye refused compensation, except for a few gifts of books on America. 
Within days of their first meeting, he delivered a revised and greatly expanded essay running over 50 printed pages and including a reminder of Napoleon I's words of 1803: "In ceding Louisiana I strengthen forever the power of the United States and give to England a rival upon the sea which sooner or later shall abase her pride." It was an adroit reference to the first Napoleon that cleverly placed his nephew ("Napoleon le petit," as his detractors called him behind his back) in an unfavorable light for not standing by America in its hour of need. 
Bigelow saw to it that Laboulaye's pamphlet was delivered to each member of the Institute of France, a prestigious group of academics; the entire Paris bar; every diplomat residing in Paris; prominent statesmen throughout Europe' and the leading journals of Europe. 
The publication was a hit. "The effect of it was far greater than I had ventured to anticipate," Bigelow later mused. "Friends of the Union multiplied and those who had been discouraged and silent before were now emboldened to come forward and confess their sympathy and their hopes." "Debats" immediately changed its editorial policy, reassigned Chevalier to economic topics and gave its columns on American affairs over to those who supported the North.
But Laboulaye wasn't done. A stream of essays, pamphlets and books poured forth from his study on Rue Taitbout. The next August he produced a pair of brilliant essays in "Debats" in which he amplified his interpretation of the American war. Bigelow saw to it that these essays were immediately republished as a pamphlet, "Les Etats-Unis et la France," which he then distributed to leading officials and intellectuals in France and Europe. 
Laboulaye's achievement was to translate the American conflict into something French readers could grasp, to depict it as part of a historic, international contest between slavery and liberty, democracy and despotism. The "old and glorious traditions of France," he wrote, call upon it to defend the North and the cause of liberty and justice everywhere. 
Much of his writings on the war found their way into English, thanks to the heroic exertions of Mary Louise Booth, a young writer in New York who tirelessly translated Laboulaye and several other leading French authors writing on the American war. Booth's translations allowed Americans to see their war in a new light reflected in a distant international mirror. "Nothing better has been produced in Europe or America by the discussion of the war," wrote Senator Charles Sumner to Laboulaye after reading his essays. 
In this quiet academic, John Bigelow found a resonating French voice for the American cause of Union and liberty. And in "la question amercaine," Laboulaye and French liberals found a way of reawakening the debate over the future of democracy in France, America and the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Cain Says His Deadly Fence Plan Was 'a Joke'

BYLINE: SUSAN SAULNY AND SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain's remarks on a deadly border fence were taken seriously, but the candidate says they shouldn't have been. 

 BODY:
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
At two campaign rallies in Tennessee on Saturday night, the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said that part of his immigration policy would be to build an electrified fence on the country's border with Mexico that could kill people trying to enter the country illegally.
But by Sunday morning, in a dramatic change of tone, Mr. Cain, a former restaurant executive, said he was only kidding.
"That's a joke," Mr. Cain told the journalist David Gregory during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," where he was asked about the electrified fence. "That's not a serious plan. I've also said America needs to get a sense of humor."
Mr. Cain's attempt to pass off incendiary comments as nothing but a joke may take more effort, however. In making the initial remarks about an electrified fence killing illegal immigrants, Mr. Cain was detailed and repetitive. He did not introduce his thoughts as anything but serious commentary, beginning with the words, "We have a crisis of illegal immigration."
And the crowds responded with cheers, not laughs.
As Ed Wyatt reported on Saturday from Tennessee: 
The remarks, which came at two campaign rallies as part of a barnstorming bus tour across the state, drew loud cheers from crowds of several hundred people at each rally. At the second stop, in Harriman, Tenn., Mr. Cain added that he also would consider using military troops "with real guns and real bullets" on the border to stop illegal immigration.
The remarks were among the most pointed yet by Mr. Cain about illegal immigration, and they come as he is enjoying a surge in national political polls on the back of his victory in a recent Florida straw poll.
When Mr. Gregory asked if Mr. Cain would describe himself as a "neoconservative," -- the foreign policy approach championed by the Bush administration that favored the aggressive use of military power to promote American interests and values abroad -- Mr. Cain seemed unsure:
MR. CAIN: I'm not sure what you mean by neoconservative. I am a conservative, yes. Neoconservative -- labels sometimes will put you in a box. I'm very conservative.
MR. GREGORY: You're familiar with the neoconservative movement?
MR. CAIN: I'm not familiar with the neoconservative movement. I'm familiar with the conservative movement. Let me define what I mean by the conservative moment: less government, less taxes, more individual responsibility.
Mr. Cain also found himself on the defensive on his tax plan when he addressed a Washington Post report that his proposal to impose a 9 percent income tax, 9 percent corporate tax and a 9 percent sales tax would hurt many poor and middle-class families. Analysts say that since those families pay little to no taxes under the current tax structure, they would now pay both income and additional sales taxes.
"Some people will pay more," he said. "But most people will pay less, is my argument."
Mr. Cain also dismissed a Wall Street Journal editorial critique that "a 9% rate when combined with state and local levies would mean a tax on goods of 17% or more in many places."
"Don't combine it with state taxes," he said. "This doesn't address state taxes. If you combine it together, yes, you would get that number. This is a replacement structure. These are replacement taxes, they're not on top of anything."
Mr. Gregory asked then him, "Are you saying they're going to be repealed?" 
Mr. Cain replied: "With the current structure, you have state taxes, right? So with this new structure, you're still going to have state taxes. That is muddying the water."

HEADLINE: Jokes and Their Relation to Crisis

BYLINE: MICHAEL MARDER


HIGHLIGHT: People say that a crisis is not a laughing matter. But what if crisis is precisely what humor is about? 

 BODY:
In June, the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney found himself under attack for a joke he tried to make at a meeting with a group of unemployed people in Tampa, Fla. "I am also unemployed," Romney announced, insinuating that the job he lacked was the presidency.
His mistake, of course, was to have ignored the very meaning of the economic crisis, including the class-based divisions and anxieties it has aggravated. His statement of identity and identification ("I am X") achieved the exact opposite effect, underscoring the unbridgeable gap between the "unemployed" multimillionaire and the out-of-work Floridians. But in a sense, the joke ultimately worked, though not in the way Romney intended: it showed, above all, his own cluelessness. The joke was on him.
The subsequent moralizing responses of Romney's critics were remarkably uniform. They boiled down to the admonishment that the crisis is not a laughing matter, that poking fun at unemployment is disrespectful to the unemployed, and so forth. But what if, on the contrary, humor and crisis share a common provenance? What if humor invariably germinates in response to a crisis, as a reaction to the excessive splits between us and our social, political or economic reality; or to the divisions within us; or to the rifts within reality itself?
If so, then laughter, instead of mending the multiple fissures of the crisis, only further accentuates them, makes them finally and fully what they already are. Humor is not, as some believe, a coping strategy or an outlet for the frustrations that cannot be expressed in any other way or at least it is not just that. At its best, it is the self-consciousness of crisis.
Without changing anything in "objective" reality, humor permits reality to laugh at itself, and in doing so, to stand outside of itself, to become other to itself. At the core of the word "crisis," which, like "critique," is derived from the Greek verb , connoting separation and division, is this hyperbolic distancing from itself of the entity that undergoes it. And humor might well be the mechanism that triggers the transition from one sense of separation to the other: from crisis to critique.
Consider, for instance, the following joke: "In America, banks rob people because that is where the money is!" In the reversal of commonsense, which is but another name for ideology, this pithy remark echoes the rhetorical question of Bertolt Brecht, "What is robbing a bank compared to founding a bank?" Implying that the financial system as a whole is an institutionalized robbery of even greater proportions, the joke instantaneously pierces through the veil of ideology. To be sure, a humorous accusation often stops at just that. It accepts the target of its critique as a brute fact of life. While no one supports the conduct of banks stealing from the people, laughter confirms that the audience fatalistically accepts this political-economic reality. is the secret motto of humor.
Still, fatalism is only one piece of the puzzle here. Also at stake in the logic of crisis is nothing less than time and human finitude: our limited capacity to manipulate the future, ageing and our impending death.
Suffice it to look at two popular jokes to realize that the issue of time shadows everything that has to do with the crisis:
1. What's the definition of optimism? An investment banker ironing five shirts on a Sunday evening.
2. A man goes to his bank manager and says: "I'd like to start a small business. How do I go about it?" "Simple," says the bank manager. "Buy a big one and wait."
In each case, finite time - time that is about to reach its term; the future, more threatening than ever before - is the object of concern, animating the joke. If crisis puts us face to face with the unknown, it cannot help but provoke extreme anxiety.
How does humor relate to this future and how does it cope with this sentiment? Far from assuaging the anxieties stimulated by the unknown, it is a symbolic device that enables human beings collectively to confront their own finitude and ageing, not to mention the limits of their social, political and economic realities. In the insecure employment (even) of the investment banker and the melting away of savings, we recognize ourselves in the present and, more importantly, in the future, forming, perhaps, a basic bond of solidarity.
Hence: (1) the temporal fissure between the present and the future is the site of the crisis; and (2) humor puts this divide under a symbolic spotlight. But who, exactly, laughs at whom when the temporal structure of the crisis is made visible? Is it the present that laughs at itself? Does it chuckle at its grim future? Or is it our future, laughing at us in the present?
Laughing at ourselves, at the various crises in which we find ourselves, means laughing at our finitude, our irremediable weakness, the feeling of being overwhelmed and crushed by the future. This would suggest a straightforward interpretation, whereby the present laughs at the future, or, at any rate, at its own fear of what is to come. To make fun of the future is to put it under our control, if only for a brief instant of a shared explosive laughter, by mastering the fear it provokes.
At the same time, however, humor reveals the strength weakness, and, hence, our capacity to face our own predicament without dissimulations, false reassurances or unrealistic expectations. Instead of endeavoring to master the future, we plunge into the chasm between what is to come and the present, deepening the crisis in ironic self-consciousness.
Jokes, even if they are meant to be shared against a background of common cultural and linguistic presuppositions, are the sites of friction: herein lies their affinity to the situations of crisis. Internally contradictory, they spell out the fatalistic acceptance of reality discontent with what has been thus accepted; powerlessness a new empowerment; a confrontation with the terrifying future an openness to the weakness it portends. Humor, therefore, is one of the best outlets for expressing the crisis, itself a result of internal contradictions and divisions that have become unsustainable in their current state.
Paraphrasing Martin Heidegger, we might say that the essence of humor is nothing humorous; it is, rather, the separation, variously called "time," "self-consciousness," "critique" or "crisis," of the I from itself and from the world it lives in. When humor responds to a crisis, it reverts back to its own essence, launching a tacit critique that retraces the divisions and contradictions from which the crisis has erupted. But while the essence of humor is nothing humorous, this should not prevent us from having a good, hearty laugh.

HEADLINE: Daley Struggles to Please Both Wall Street and Left

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: William M. Daley, the White House chief of staff, comes from a big business and Main Street Democratic background, but he has having trouble satisfying either group. 

 BODY:
William M. Daley might have picked a harder time than autumn 2011 to explain Democrats and Wall Street to each other.
But could you find one?
Nine months into his tenure as White House chief of staff, Mr. Daley feels the chill from former Wall Street colleagues who now see President Obama's administration as a hostile force.
At the same time, he eyes the swelling Occupy Wall Street protests against the industry that made him rich. Those demonstrations could give his party a counterweight to the Tea Party right - but also underscore Mr. Obama's inability to invigorate the economy.
It wasn't supposed to be this hard when the president tapped Mr. Daley to help adjust to the Republican resurgence in the 2010 elections.
He is the son and brother of two legendary mayors of Chicago, the party's giant Midwestern redoubt. Speak the language of bread-and-butter Democrats? Check.
He is also the pro-business former commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton who collaborated with Republicans to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and later became an executive at JPMorgan Chase. Understand political opponents and executives? Check.
Yet the recovery has flagged. Mr. Daley's attempt to orchestrate a centrist "grand bargain" with Congressional Republicans on deficit reduction shattered against conservative opposition to tax increases. 
And the president's resulting retreat to his partisan corner has exacerbated the estrangement from business executives that Mr. Daley hoped to smooth over.
"There is a disconnect" between Wall Street and Main Street, Mr. Daley observed in an interview.
And how.
A New Approach
Mr. Daley represents a generation of Democrats who have aimed to modernize the party's economic philosophy from the era when his father ruled Chicago. Thus even when little else can move past Republicans on Capitol Hill, the White House last week won new trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea.
Most Congressional Democrats voted no, renewing longstanding complaints that such deals benefit large multinational businesses more than American workers. That reasoning matches a core Occupy Wall Street objective: fighting "corporate greed."
"Some people would like the world to go back to the 1950s," Mr. Daley said of the trade deals' opponents. He acknowledged "negatives" to the agreements that the administration seeks to ameliorate with benefits for displaced workers.
"You have a tremendous reservoir of smaller and medium-sized businesses that have done well by having chances to sell their products around the world," Mr. Daley said. Over all, "You're creating jobs in the U.S. because of lowering barriers in foreign countries."
Such thinking endeared Mr. Clinton to business during the boom times of the 1990s. It isn't doing the same for Mr. Obama now, as new financial regulations and proposals to raise taxes on high earners have left Wall Street feeling under siege.
Consider Mr. Daley's friend and former boss at JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive. Once an Obama backer, Mr. Dimon recently met with Mitt Romney and attended a Romney fund-raiser.
What makes Wall Street complaints so exasperating to Obama advisers is their belief that they've struck a reasonable middle ground in updating oversight of a system Mr. Daley said "had gotten out of control."
Moreover, "Many of the leaders in the financial sector would admit right up front that the controls weren't there," he said.
Administration critics on the left, which wanted big banks broken up, insist the system hasn't been changed enough.
'Super Sensitivity'
If some on Wall Street appreciate Mr. Obama's restraint, their disgruntled colleagues have been louder.
Mr. Daley cites the insularity produced by increasing power and rewards for financial executives in the 21st century economy. Before joining the administration, he was himself paid as much as $5 million a year by JPMorgan Chase.
In this "very different society," he noted, even personal assistants to top Wall Street executives may earn $125,000 - enough to place them in the top 10 percent of earners.
"There's a super sensitivity of some people in the financial sector to criticism," Mr. Daley explained. "They may feel under siege. But go out there and talk to the average American who's struggling mightily just to get by. That's where the real pain is, not in that 5 percent or 10 percent at the top."
But Democrats can hardly ignore the wishes of the top 5 percent, not with an evolving national coalition that has seen the party in recent elections reap increasing campaign donations and votes from affluent Americans. Those crosscurrents are only getting tougher to navigate.
Former Vice President Al Gore, once considered a Democratic moderate, has endorsed the Occupy Wall Street protests. Mr. Daley, chairman of Mr. Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, was "not really" surprised by that decision - and not interested in commenting on it, either.
"I saw him the other night," Mr. Daley said drily. "He looked good."

HEADLINE: Energy Efficiency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Leonhardt's news analysis ''The Depression: If Only Things Were That Good'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 9) correctly judges that it would be wise for the United States to be nourishing a productive industry in dire times. 
In fact, there is a perfect candidate, if only the federal government would support it in a big way: energy efficiency. Devising affordable approaches to designing, manufacturing and installing renewables such as solar hot water systems; continuing large-scale support of weatherization for low-income home and building owners; and requiring existing and new buildings to go green would go a long way toward retooling the economy. That's the new frontier.

HEADLINE: On Taxes and Fences, Cain Stumbles a Bit

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
Herman Cain found out how tricky being in the national spotlight is on Sunday as he was pushed to admit that his signature economic plan, 9-9-9, would result in increased taxes for some people.
The Republican presidential candidate also sought to back away from fiery comments he had made just hours earlier, saying he was only joking about killing people trying to cross the border from Mexico with an electrified fence. And he said that the American people need to ''get a sense of humor.''
Beyond that, Mr. Cain acknowledged that he was unfamiliar with the neoconservative movement, and was not exactly sure what the word ''neoconservative'' meant. 
All this was in the space of a 20-minute interview with David Gregory on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
Mr. Cain, a former restaurant executive who has never held public office, is a candidate being tested for the first time, particularly now that some polls show him perched at the top rung of the Republican field. And his lack of experience is beginning to show itself in the form of missteps or as he confronts more pointed questions about his tax plan.
After months of being dismissed as a nonstarter in the primary race, Mr. Cain is enjoying increased interest in his so-called 9-9-9 tax plan, which would set personal and business income tax rates at 9 percent each and institute a 9 percent national sales tax, eliminating all other federal taxes.
But instead of seizing his moment on the campaign trail, Mr. Cain has mostly removed himself from the ritual of retail politics to concentrate instead on the promotion of his new book, ''This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House.'' And his campaign continues to operate on a shoestring budget. A finance report filed Saturday to the Federal Election Commission showed that he raised $2.8 million over the summer, a figure that represented only a slight increase over the $2 million he gathered as a lesser-known candidate in the spring.
''It's very hard to be a first-time candidate who is in the lower tier of attention, and to suddenly vault into the top tier, and that's what happened,'' said Steve Duprey, a Republican National Committee member from New Hampshire. ''I'm sure Mr. Cain is going to have some growing pains. He has to be careful, because sometimes you can make a mistake that can be a serious impediment.''
At two campaign rallies in Tennessee on Saturday night, Mr. Cain made repeated, detailed comments about his immigration policy, which he said would include building an electrified fence on the country's border with Mexico that could kill people trying to enter the country illegally.
But by Sunday morning, his tone had changed.
''That's a joke,'' Mr. Cain said of his comments. ''That's not a serious plan. I've also said America needs to get a sense of humor.''
Mr. Cain also found himself on the defensive on his tax plan when he addressed a Washington Post report that his 9-9-9 proposal would hurt many poor and middle-class families. Analysts say that those families pay little to no taxes under the current tax structure and would now pay both income and additional sales taxes under the plan.
''Some people will pay more,'' he said on ''Meet the Press,'' acknowledging that some people could face combined state and national sales taxes as high as 17 percent. ''But most people will pay less, is my argument.''
When Mr. Gregory asked if Mr. Cain would describe himself as a ''neoconservative'' -- the foreign policy approach championed by the Bush administration that favored the aggressive use of military power to promote American interests and values abroad -- Mr. Cain seemed unsure.
''I'm not familiar with the neoconservative movement,'' he said.
Still, Mr. Duprey said that voters seemed to have more sympathy for beginners' blunders than those from more experienced politicians. (Note the slide in popularity of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas after poor performances in recent debates.)
''I think the newcomer gets a little bit extra rope,'' Mr. Duprey added. ''There's a tremendous learning curve.''

HEADLINE: 2 Top Suitors Are Emerging For New School Of Engineering

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
With less than two weeks left to apply in the competition for $400 million in land and subsidies to build a science and engineering graduate school in New York City, some of the world's great universities continue to change plans and jockey for position, and there is a growing view among them that Cornell and Stanford have emerged as the favorites.
City officials discourage the idea that there are any front-runners, but the president of Stanford, John L. Hennessy, says bluntly that his school and Cornell -- both seeking the same piece of city-owned land on Roosevelt Island -- have the best chances, and officials at some of the competing institutions privately agree.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has roiled the field by suggesting lately that he might anoint by year's end not one winner but two, which has bolstered the hopes of Columbia and New York University, which are both seeking to expand without using the free land the city has offered. But university administrators say they are unsure whether the talk of multiple winners might mean approving two proposals for two separate sites, or forcing a shotgun marriage between competing institutions, and city officials will not say. 
With Cornell emphasizing its connections to the city, including its medical school on the Upper East Side, Stanford last week announced an affiliation with City College of New York, and Columbia confirmed that a proposed alliance with City College's parent, City University of New York, had been dropped.
N.Y.U. said the coalition it is leading -- including CUNY and several other institutions -- wants to build on land in downtown Brooklyn that is not among the sites the city has offered.
People briefed on the universities' plans, whose cost estimates exceed $1 billion in some cases, speculate that one or more of the contenders will try to improve their standing by forgoing the city's offer of up to $100 million to upgrade roads, water and power supplies, offering to pay those costs themselves.
Stanford and Cornell, both rated among the best in the country in computer science and engineering, have been the most aggressive contenders, hiring public relations and political consultants to press their cases with city officials and journalists.
David J. Skorton, Cornell's president and a physician, and Mr. Hennessy, an electrical engineer, have devoted significant time and effort to personally shaping their proposals and selling them to alumni, faculty, business leaders, government officials and donors. Each has labeled the new campus one of his university's top priorities for the next generation.
''I think if we're not going to do this to the hilt, we shouldn't do it,'' Dr. Skorton said. ''This is the future of our university.''
Both Stanford and Cornell plan to submit proposals by the Oct. 28 deadline that are significantly bigger than plans they outlined earlier this year -- approaching two million square feet of classrooms, laboratories and housing to be built over the next generation.
''If Stanford and Cornell are prepared to develop two million square feet that don't exist now or aren't already in the works, and that's the criterion, they may be the only ones,'' said John E. Sexton, president of N.Y.U. ''It may well be if the question is drawn that narrowly, then Stanford and Cornell are the only two players.''
Stanford proposes to replicate the role it has played in the growth of Silicon Valley, as an incubator of high-tech talent, innovation and business. ''We know how to get young people involved in start-ups,'' said Mr. Hennessy, whose campus has spawned Hewlett Packard, Cisco Systems, Yahoo, Google and countless smaller tech companies. ''Cornell's disadvantage is all its start-ups put together are smaller than Google.''
Cornell's plans are more tailored to New York's particular economy, with four hubs: technology for cleaner and more efficient building; information science and engineering for health care; social mobile networking, particularly in fields like media and advertising; and what it calls ''intelligent trustworthy systems,'' which include areas like cloud computing and information security.
The rules of the competition offer points for working with local institutions. Officials of Stanford said last week that while its new partnership with City College would, among other things, channel top engineering students from there to Stanford's graduate schools, the Roosevelt Island campus would be Stanford's alone. Some competitors suggested that this would not be a substantial enough affiliation to satisfy the judges of the competition or the City Council, which will have to approve some aspects of the winning plan.
But Stanford may have the financial edge. Its endowment exceeds $16.5 billion, more than double Columbia's $7.8 billion or Cornell's $5.2 billion, as of this summer. And Stanford raised more than $2 billion in the three years ending in mid-2010, more than any other American university and nearly twice what was raised by each of its main rivals for the New York campus.
When Mr. Bloomberg proposed the competition late last year, it was an audacious idea: to lure a prestigious university to build from scratch a top-flight school of applied sciences that would, in turn, seed businesses that would turn New York into the world's next great high-tech hub. ''We certainly can't sit here and let Silicon Valley be bigger than us,'' Mr. Bloomberg said last week in his first appearance at the New York Tech Meetup, a monthly gathering of entrepreneurs.
Whether or not his vision will have such a transformative effect on the city's economy, it has taken a powerful hold on the imaginations of great universities. Some of the schools have sharpened, expanded and accelerated the early plans they submitted in March, proposing to start classes in leased space as early as next September.
The city received 18 submissions early, including several from overseas. But it is unclear how many of those will turn into actual applications.
Several local universities reacted badly to the announcement of the competition and its attendant implication that New York lacked first-rate science schools. Columbia's graduate school of engineering is ranked 16th in the country by U.S. News & World Report; Stanford is 2nd, Carnegie Mellon -- which plans to submit a solo proposal and is also involved in N.Y.U.'s -- 6th, and Cornell 10th.
But Columbia has a selling point the others lack: Well before the mayor's brainchild, Columbia had already embarked on a huge expansion on 18 acres north of its Morningside Heights campus, with up to seven million square feet. With the city's help, part of that space -- with permits long ago approved and construction under way for a year -- could be revamped into the kind of graduate school Mr. Bloomberg envisions, while leaving city-owned sites on Roosevelt Island, Governor's Island and the Brooklyn Navy Yard for other projects.
''We are ready to go,'' Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia's president, said. ''This can be up and running very quickly.''
Columbia plans to focus on themes similar to Cornell's: new media, ''smart'' cities, electronic security, health analysis and finance. In all, seven of its schools would be involved, not just engineering.
''You can't just take a department and say, 'Go create this.' You need the entire institution,'' Mr. Bollinger said. ''Obviously, that is an argument against bringing in an outside university.''
N.Y.U. did not have an engineering school until 2008, when it affiliated with Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, now Polytechnic Institute of N.Y.U. (66th on the U.S. News list).
But the coalition it is leading includes institutions with highly regarded programs, like Carnegie Mellon, the University of Toronto and the University of Warwick in Britain. Their plan would focus on the technology for cleaner, more efficient and healthier cities.
N.Y.U. has experience establishing new campuses away from its Greenwich Village home, including a college in Abu Dhabi. Like Columbia, N.Y.U. is in the early stages of an unrelated, major expansion, but both universities express confidence that big ideas generate big fund-raising.
Even if another university is chosen, Mr. Sexton said, making the city a technology hotbed will benefit every local school.
''I don't think educators could do anything but be excited about this,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 18, 2011 

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a proposed engineering graduate school in New York City contained a number of errors.
Because of an editing error, the article misidentified the university that has dropped plans for a partnership with City University to develop the school. It is Columbia University, not Stanford. Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to a partnership between Stanford and City College, a branch of City University. Such a partnership is indeed planned; it is not the case that Stanford officials said last week that the university would not enter such a partnership.
The article also described incorrectly an unrelated 7-million-square-foot expansion that Columbia University is planning. A portion of the expansion that will be devoted to studying the brain will occupy about 7 percent of the space, not ''much of it.''
And the article referred incorrectly to the teaching of engineering at New York University. The university had a school of engineering at its Bronx campus until 1973; it is not the case that N.Y.U. did not have an engineering school ''until 2008.''

HEADLINE: Safety Regulators Don't Add Costs. They Decide Who Pays Them.

BYLINE: By ROBERT S. ADLER. 
Robert S. Adler is a lawyer and a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

 BODY:
Washington
THERE'S a lot of talk in Washington these days about the importance of cost-benefit analysis.
The House of Representatives recently approved a bill to create an independent committee to conduct cost-benefit analyses of some highly controversial regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, ignoring the fact that the agency already does its own analyses. So, for that matter, do all executive agencies, under a directive issued by President Obama last January reaffirming the administration's commitment to that approach.
I support the president's initiative, but not all voices raised on this issue have been as thoughtful as his. To the contrary, we at the Consumer Product Safety Commission and our sister health and safety agencies have faced a barrage of calls from some politicians and business interests to cut back ''oppressive'' and ''job killing'' regulations in order to ''jump-start'' the nation's stalled economy. And the way to do this, we are told, is to subject everything we do to elaborate cost-benefit analysis. 
What many of our critics really want to do is to stop government from regulating, period. They are invoking cost-benefit analysis as their weapon of choice -- and to impose ''paralysis by analysis.''
Unfortunately, they ignore a vital point: health and safety agencies rarely impose new costs on society when we issue safety regulations. We simply re-allocate who pays the costs.
Think about it: when we write a safety rule, we do so to eliminate or reduce deaths and injuries that consumers suffer daily in product-related accidents. The commission estimates that roughly 31,000 people die and 34 million people suffer product-related injuries every year. These deaths and injuries impose significant costs on consumers -- roughly $200 billion annually. They do so first as household tragedies and then as higher premiums for health insurance (or higher taxes to pay for the uninsured). Moreover, product-related tragedies almost always result in lost economic productivity.
Anyone who insists that regulations necessarily impose new costs on society shouldn't be taken seriously. The costs are already there, in the form of deaths and injuries -- and are often as much of a drag on our economy as any safety rule. So the real issue is who should bear the costs.
For example, we recently required manufacturers to make sturdier cribs to eliminate the predictable deaths from suffocation caused when infants slip between flimsy slats and crib mattresses. In doing so, we may well have increased the costs of making cribs for companies that had not previously taken adequate safety measures. And, yes, our safety rule might increase the price of some cribs to consumers. But these are not new societal costs; they are simply costs that those manufacturers had previously offloaded on innocent, vulnerable children. Our rule makes manufacturers price their products in a fairer, more accurate way.
More than 40 years ago, Guido Calabresi, a giant in the field of law and economics, argued that a truly rational approach to injury reduction would move selected accident costs into manufacturers' production budgets rather than impose them on the public at large. This makes particular sense where even careful consumers cannot easily avoid the accidents. One of his suggested solutions was to use the tort system to impose those costs, but regulation certainly is another method.
I don't claim that Judge Calabresi, a former dean of Yale Law School who is now a senior judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, would endorse every safety rule that we have written, or believe that making manufacturers internalize every accident cost that they impose on society always optimizes injury reduction. But his advice is as wise today as it was decades ago. And applying his wisdom, one sees pure fantasy in the idea that eliminating vital safety regulations would miraculously eradicate societal costs.
Not all regulation is bad, nor is it always more costly. And one of the ways to ensure that our safety rules are cost-effective is to use thoughtful cost-benefit analysis. So, I don't quarrel with the president's cost-benefit executive order, especially because it explicitly permits agencies to consider values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including ''equity, human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts'' in their cost-benefit calculations.
My objection is that many of those who insist on cost-benefit analysis have no interest whatsoever in making regulation more focused and rational. In their world, costs to business are the only measure; benefits to consumers somehow never make it to the table. Unfortunately, that's misleading and unfair. Someone always pays.

HEADLINE: Pleasant Surprise for East River Ferries: Crowds

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
After several failed attempts at encouraging the use of boats to commute across the East River, city officials have an unforeseen problem: too many ferry riders.
The ferry service that the city started in June has attracted twice as many riders as its planners had expected. On sunny weekends, it has been so popular with tourists and wandering residents that some boats have been too full to take on everybody waiting on the piers in Brooklyn.
Now, with service scheduled to be reduced for the winter on Nov. 1, the operator of the ferries, BillyBey Ferry Company, is worried about having to turn away more customers. But city officials do not want to pay the operator more than the $3.1 million annual subsidy called for in a three-year contract signed this year. 
''The only major complaint I've heard is that people want more of it,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, which oversees the service.
Mr. Pinsky said that the city was considering ways to add capacity but that, ''in an era of limited resources,'' it would be difficult to find more public money for the service.
The East River service is an experiment to spur development in revitalized sections of the industrial riverfront in Queens and Brooklyn. The boats connect Midtown and the financial district near Wall Street with, for the fall and winter, five spots on the east side of the river.
On weekdays, the boats have been running every 20 minutes during peak commuting hours, attracting people who live in new condominiums in Brooklyn and work in Manhattan. But on weekends, they have been drawing a more diverse crowd of foreign tourists and locals heading to the Brooklyn Flea in Williamsburg or to Brooklyn Bridge Park.
Swen Harrington, 26, of Brooklyn, quick-stepped through the rain on Friday afternoon to catch the 4:29 p.m. departure from the dock at the east end of 34th Street in Manhattan. A broker at Laidlaw & Company on Park Avenue, Mr. Harrington oozed contentment as he described his switch two months ago from riding the subway, even though he now pays $4 each way, compared with the subway fare of $2.25.
''I think it's worth it for my sanity,'' he said, settling into an upholstered seat and laying his book, ''Boomerang,'' by Michael Lewis, on one of the tables near the rear of the cabin.
Mr. Harrington said he was usually one of only four or five people on the first boat leaving the North Williamsburg dock at 6:55 a.m. on weekdays. But in contrast with his quiet commutes, he added, ''I've been on on the weekend when it was packed.''
According to data supplied by city officials, nearly 350,000 people have paid to ride the ferries since late June, far more than the 134,000 they had projected. On weekdays, the number of riders has averaged 2,862, almost double the forecast of 1,488.
The weekday riders have not all been commuters, either. On Friday evening, two visitors from Zurich, Michael Luetscher and his 13-year-old daughter, Bignia, rode from Pier 11 near Wall Street to the Greenpoint apartment they had been staying in all week. They were returning from shopping and checking out the Occupy Wall Street demonstration, which Mr. Luetscher said was smaller and calmer than he had expected.
The big surprise for the ferry operator has come on the weekends, when ridership has averaged almost 4,500, more than six times the city's projection. On Sunday, Oct. 9, the service carried about 6,500 passengers, said Paul Goodman, the chief executive of BillyBey, which operates under the flag of New York Waterway. ''The enthusiasm that we've seen from these communities tells us that even though the city was in some manner hoping to encourage development along the waterfront, we've tapped into demand that was already there,'' Mr. Goodman said.
He said he had urgently been trying to persuade city officials to provide financing to run more boats than the contract requires on weekends and capitalize on the momentum. He said he had offered to add boats in exchange for a more favorable financial arrangement, but Mr. Pinsky said he was reluctant to agree to a change that would be tantamount to increasing the public subsidy.
City officials are in less of a hurry because their ultimate goal is to attract more developers to the east bank of the river. Mr. Pinsky said the ferries could ''really unlock'' the construction of an additional 21,000 apartments in those neighborhoods, creating jobs and economic activity.
Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, said she had walked past the ferry stop in Lower Manhattan on Oct. 9 and ''the line was huge.'' The early success of the service is proof, she said, that her campaign for ''five-borough ferry service'' has merit.
''Things often have to be tried a couple of times and not work out, then tried again a second or third time before you get it right,'' Ms. Quinn said.

HEADLINE: Seeing Value in Ignorance, College Expects Its Physicists to Teach Poetry

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Sarah Benson last encountered college mathematics 20 years ago in an undergraduate algebra class. Her sole experience teaching math came in the second grade, when the first graders needed help with their minuses.
And yet Ms. Benson, with a Ph.D. in art history and a master's degree in comparative literature, stood at the chalkboard drawing parallelograms, constructing angles and otherwise dismembering Euclid's Proposition 32 the way a biology professor might treat a water frog. Her students cared little about her inexperience. As for her employers, they did not mind, either: they had asked her to teach formal geometry expressly because it was a subject about which she knew very little.
It was just another day here at St. John's College, whose distinctiveness goes far beyond its curriculum of great works: Aeschylus and Aristotle, Bacon and Bach. As much of academia fractures into ever more specific disciplines, this tiny college still expects -- in fact, requires -- its professors to teach almost every subject, leveraging ignorance as much as expertise. 
''There's a little bit of impostor syndrome,'' said Ms. Benson, who will teach Lavoisier's ''Elements of Chemistry'' next semester. ''But here, it's O.K. that I don't know something. I can figure it out, and my job is to help the students do the same thing. It's very collaborative.''
Or as St. John's president, Chris Nelson (class of 1970), put it with a smile only slightly sadistic: ''Every member of the faculty who comes here gets thrown in the deep end. I think the faculty members, if they were cubbyholed into a specialization, they'd think that they know more than they do. That usually is an impediment to learning. Learning is born of ignorance.''
Students who attend St. John's -- it has a sister campus in Santa Fe, N.M., with the same curriculum and philosophies -- know that their college experience will be like no other. There are no majors; every student takes the same 16 yearlong courses, which generally feature about 15 students discussing Sophocles or Homer, and the professor acting more as catalyst than connoisseur.
What they may not know is that their professor -- or tutor in the St. John's vernacular -- might have no background in the subject. This is often the case for the courses that freshmen take. For example, Hannah Hintze, who has degrees in philosophy and woodwind performance, and whose dissertation concerned Plato's ''Republic,'' is currently leading classes on observational biology and Greek.
''Some might not find that acceptable, but we explore things together,'' said Ryan Fleming, a freshman in Ms. Benson's Euclid class. ''We don't have someone saying, 'I have all the answers.' They're open-minded and go along with us to see what answers there can be.''
Like all new tutors, Ms. Benson, 42, went through a one-week orientation in August to reacquaint herself with Euclid, and to learn the St. John's way of teaching. She attends weekly conferences with more seasoned tutors.
Her plywood-floor classroom in McDowell Hall is as almost as dim and sparse as the ones Francis Scott Key (valedictorian of the class of 1796) studied in before the college's original building burned down in 1909. Eight underpowered ceiling lights barely illuminated three walls of chalkboards. While even kindergarten classrooms now feature interactive white boards and Wi-Fi connected iPads, not one laptop or cellphone was visible; the only evidence of contemporary life was the occasional plastic foam coffee cup.
The discussion centered not on examples and exercises, but on the disciplined narrative of Euclid's assertions, the aesthetic economy of mathematical argument. When talk turned to Proposition 34 of Book One, which states that a parallelogram's diagonal divides it into equal areas, not one digit was used or even mentioned. Instead, the students debated whether Propositions 4 and 26 were necessary for Euclid's proof.
When a student punctuated a blackboard analysis with, ''The self-evident truth that these triangles will be equal,'' the subliminal reference to the Declaration of Independence hinted at the eventual braiding of the disciplines by both students and tutors here. So, too, did a subsequent discussion of how ''halves of equals are equals themselves,'' evoking the United States Supreme Court's logic in endorsing segregation 2,200 years after Euclid died.
Earlier in the day, in a junior-level class taught by a longtime tutor about a portion of Newton's seminal physics text ''Principia,'' science and philosophy became as intertwined as a candy cane's swirls. Students discussed Newton's shrinking parabolic areas as if they were voting districts, and the limits of curves as social ideals.
One student remarked, ''In Euclid before, he talked a lot about what is equal and what isn't. It seems here that equality is more of a continuum -- we can get as close as we want, but never actually get there.'' A harmony of Tocqueville was being laid over Newton's melody.
The tutor, Michael Dink, graduated from St. John's in 1975 and earned his master's degree and Ph.D. in philosophy from the Catholic University of America. Like most professors here, he long ago traded the traditional three-course academic career -- writing journal articles, attending conferences and teaching a specific subject -- for the intellectual buffet at St. John's. His first year included teaching Ptolemy's ''Almagest,'' a treatise on planetary movements, and atomic theory. He since has taught 15 of the school's 16 courses, the exception being sophomore music.
''You have to not try to control things,'' Mr. Dink said, ''and not think that what's learned has to come from you.''
This ancient teaching method could be making a comeback well beyond St. John's two campuses. Some education reformers assert that teachers as early as elementary school should lecture less at the blackboard while students silently take notes -- the sage-on-the-stage model, as some call it -- and foster more discussion and collaboration among smaller groups. It is a strategy that is particularly popular among schools that use technology to allow students to learn at their own pace.
Still, not even the most rabid reformer has suggested that biology be taught by social theorists, or Marx by mathematicians. That philosophy will continue to belong to a school whose president has joyfully declared, ''We don't have departmental politics -- we don't have departments!''
Anthony T. Grafton, a professor of history at Princeton and president of the American Historical Association, said he appreciated the approach.
''There's no question that people are becoming more specialized -- it's natural for scholars to cover a narrow field in great depth rather than many at the same time,'' he said. ''I admire how St. John's does it. It sounds both fun and scary.''

HEADLINE: Wireless Devices Eclipse People

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Watching all those people juggling phones and tablets and e-readers in stores, subways and coffee shops, not to mention the many small shops continually offering new models of phones, you could think that there are more wireless devices than people. 
You would be right. Data released this week from CTIA, the wireless industry association, shows that there were 327.6 million wireless customer connections, equal to 103.9 percent of the United States population. This is the first time there have been more customers than people. It is also a 9 percent increase from the 300.5 million connections of a year ago. Not bad, for a country teetering near recession, where about one-third of the population lives with little or no discretionary income.
The math only works because several people have multiple accounts and devices, using one or more cellphones, tablets, wireless hookups for their laptops, readers, and other connections. There were 95.8 million smartphones and wireless PDAs at the end of June, up 57 percent from a year before, and 15.2 million wireless laptops, netbooks and modems, up 17 percent.
When you think about it, it is not all that surprising. The carriers have refused to sell an omnibus data plan that would allow people to connect all their wireless devices to one account. Instead, a customer with an iPhone, iPad and a Kindle can actually have three accounts.
So why do they do it this way? That's easy to answer.
However we are amassing all this stuff, the industry must be grateful for the numbers. The real eye-popping growth was in revenue from data services, which rose 21.2 percent, to $30.1 billion, from a year earlier. The money from hauling data, things like video and texts instead of calls, is now 35.9 percent of total service revenue.
Service revenue rose 5.8 percent, to $83.7 billion, in the first half of 2011, while the average monthly bill fell 0.5 percent, to $47.23. Each device earns less, but there are a lot more devices.
The phone networks carried 341.2 billion megabits of traffic in the first half of the year, according to the survey, up 111 percent from a year earlier. In other words, in the first half of 2011 people sent and received wireless data equal to almost 90 percent of all of 2010. Talk, meantime, may be falling slightly out of fashion, with just 2.251 trillion billable minutes in the 12 months ending June 2011, a drop of 6 billion minutes from the June 2010 figure. The average length of a call was 1.83 minutes, up from 1.62 minutes a year ago and the second consecutive year it has been below two minutes.
As recently as 2007, the average call was near or above three minutes. Who's got time to talk, when there's all that video to watch?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Dedication to King, And the Work Yet to Do

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and HELENE COOPER; Jada F. Smith contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- They came from across the country, some arriving before dawn, carrying folding chairs, cameras and a strong, proud sense of history. Thousands stood and sat together under a bright blue sky Sunday as a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- the first honoring an African-American in the area of the Mall -- was dedicated at last.
The morning ceremony, which ended with a speech by President Obama, took the audience back through 48 years of history, to 1963 and a defining moment for the civil rights movement, when Dr. King led the March on Washington and gave his ''I Have a Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Mr. Obama is a direct beneficiary of the civil rights movement, a point he has made in past speeches. And at times Sunday, when he spoke of Dr. King's struggles, it was easy for many to think that the president was speaking of himself. 
''For every victory, there were setbacks,'' he said. ''Even after winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. King was vilified by many.''
Before Mr. Obama spoke, a star-studded list of other speakers -- including Dr. King's children, civil rights leaders like Jesse Jackson and Representative John Lewis, and performers including Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder -- invoked Dr. King's principles of social justice. Calling them all the more relevant today, at a time of economic hardship and growing inequality, the speakers implored the crowd to apply them.
''We should never adjust to 1 percent of the people controlling 40 percent of the wealth,'' said Bernice King, Dr. King's daughter. ''I hear my father say, 'We must have a radical revolution of values and reordering of priorities of this nation.' ''
The audience, which was overwhelmingly black, cheered its approval, the heads a sea of white baseball caps, which had been handed out at the entrance, interrupted by the occasional Sunday hat.
''I'm so happy. Aren't you happy?'' said Pat Harris, 53, clad in a purple sweat suit and a white vest and dancing in the grass to Mr. Wonder's music shortly after the president's speech.
Ms. Harris grew up in poverty and segregation in the Mississippi Delta town of Belzoni, she said. Now she is a federal employee in Washington, where, she said, she lives better than her parents did, progress that she credits to Dr. King.
''We stand here today, economically O.K., because of that man,'' she said.
The memorial -- a four-acre tract along the Tidal Basin that is dotted with elms and cherry trees and anchored by an imposing granite statue of Dr. King -- is the product of more than two decades of work. It was conceived in 1983 by members of Dr. King's fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha, and authorized by Congress in 1996.
It was originally scheduled to be dedicated in August to coincide with the 48th anniversary of the March on Washington, but Hurricane Irene intervened.
The monument to Dr. King is the first to a black man on the Mall, ,heightening the emotion for visitors. His stone figure faces the Jefferson Memorial across the water. Lincoln is at his back, and Roosevelt to his right.
''This is just wonderful. It's a thrill,'' said Hattie Jones from Arlington, Va. ''Tears just ran down my eyes automatically when I saw it. It's really inspiring.''
The presence of Mr. Obama seemed to energize the crowd, with a loud ovation and shouts of ''Four more years!'' and ''That's the man!'' as he took the stage. But his speech drew tepid applause from some in the audience who said they felt he was too restrained.
''He has the ability to put it where the goats can get it, but instead he keeps it all in a little box,'' Ms. Harris said, a reference to Mr. Obama's oratory skills. She added: ''We like him. We just wish he would fight harder.''
Some of the loudest cheers were for the Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered a series of memorable one-liners in a speech laced with religious references in the style of Dr. King.
Of the Republican plan to change Medicare, he said: ''This is not about Obama. This is about your mama!''
A number of speakers made direct appeals to people to vote for Mr. Obama. Mr. Jackson, twice a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s, referred to Mr. Obama's Republican opponents as ''men that seem willing to sink the ship just to destroy the captain.''
Most speakers cast today's struggle as being as much about economics as race, and mentioned Dr. King's effort to organize the nation's poor shortly before his death in 1968. Several pointed to the Occupy Wall Street protests as evidence of modern-day protest and discontent.
''They changed the game on us,'' said Andrew Young, a friend of Dr. King's and a former mayor of Atlanta. ''Now it's economics that controls the politics.''
He added: ''Just like we won the battle of voting rights, we can win the battle of economic rights.''
Carolyn Bledsoe, 70, a retired teacher who lives in Washington and who participated in the 1963 march, praised the progress since her childhood in the Jim Crow South, where her father was a sharecropper. But racism, she said, has simply changed form -- more insidious, less direct.
''Now it's on paper,'' she said.
Ms. Bledsoe recalled the shame of being turned away from the first McDonald's in Goldsboro, N.C., in the 1950s because she was black, a feeling that most of her young students have not experienced. Race still binds them, she said, just in subtler ways.
The March on Washington she recalled fondly and a little wistfully. Most young people do not understand how her generation struggled, Ms. Bledsoe said. The country has come a long way, but not far enough.
''Some days I feel like we're at the beginning,'' she said. ''Some days I feel like we're in the middle. But I never feel like we're at the end.''
Lonnie Bunch, founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, said he believed the monument would help.
''For so long, we either tried to ignore race, tamp it down or try to say that it's over, that we've solved all the problems,'' Mr. Bunch said. ''His struggle helped us realize there's still a great deal of ambiguity about race. His monument will ensure we don't forget it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 18, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the dedication of a memorial to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King on the National Mall erroneously attributed a distinction to the monument in some copies. While the monument is the first on the Mall and its adjoining parks honoring an African-American, it is not the first to honor someone who was not a president. (A monument was dedicated in 2002 to George Mason, who wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights and has sometimes been referred to as the ''forgotten founding father.'')

The Jets' inability to establish a consistent running game has heaped more responsibility on Sanchez to make plays and has, at times, also minimized one of his strengths -- throwing on the move.

HEADLINE: Long-Shot Alternative to Demolition: The Tappan Zee as a Walkers' Haven

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Today the High Line. Tomorrow the High Zee?
It is probably a long shot, but just a few days after the Obama administration announced it was putting the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge on a fast track, one official in Westchester County began floating the idea of turning the old one into a pedestrian walkway, like the wildly popular High Line on the West Side of Manhattan or the equally successful Walkway Over the Hudson linking Poughkeepsie and Highland. 
Paul Feiner, the Greenburgh town supervisor, said his vision of a suburban High Line would be good for property values, business and tourism and would link Rockland and Westchester Counties in a way that had not been done in the past. He said a pedestrian bridge, supported by donors as the High Line has been, would save hundreds of millions of dollars in demolition costs and take some of the sting from the new plan's failure to include mass transit or other nonautomobile features.
''What they're talking about now is really turning a 1950s bridge into a 1980s bridge,'' he said, reflecting on what he views as the replacement bridge's deficiencies. ''This has so much potential, it could make construction of the bridge really exciting.''
Not everyone was so excited. Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County executive, Rob Astorino, said the planning process for the new bridge had considered keeping the old one open as a fishing pier or for another use but instead recommended demolition.
''I don't see that as something the county executive would support now,'' she said.
Mr. Feiner cited the success of the High Line, which reuses abandoned railroad tracks. A better comparison may be Walkway Over the Hudson, the new incarnation of the old Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge, which had been abandoned since a fire in 1974.
The idea was long dismissed as a quixotic fantasy, but since it finally opened two years ago as a 1.28-mile walkway, it has far exceeded projections, with roughly 600,000 visitors a year.
Elizabeth Waldstein-Hart, executive director of the walkway, now managed by the state park service as Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, said total costs for building and maintaining the walkway were far less than the $50 million it would have taken to demolish it.
''The long-term economic development of the Hudson Valley and this part of New York is all about the river and river access,'' she said. ''So why not have another knock-them-dead walkway?''
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office and State Department of Transportation officials declined to comment.
But some have noted that the three-mile length of the Tappan Zee might be too long for walkers. Another issue is whether the bridge would attract suicides, as it has in the past.
Lou Klein, a member of the Westchester Cycle Club, said the steep pitch of the Tappan Zee, roughly a 20 percent grade to the peak, might be a deal killer compared to the flat, eminently walkable High Line and Walkway Over the Hudson.
''I think what Feiner wants is a great idea, but I'm not sure he's thought about the actual incline of the bridge,'' he said. ''It's a serious beast to climb.''

HEADLINE: Astride the Great Divide

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
William M. Daley might have picked a harder time than autumn 2011 to explain Democrats and Wall Street to each other.
But could you find one?
Nine months into his tenure as White House chief of staff, Mr. Daley feels the chill from former Wall Street colleagues who now see President Obama's administration as a hostile force.
At the same time, he eyes the swelling Occupy Wall Street protests against the industry that made him rich. Those demonstrations could give his party a counterweight to the Tea Party right - but also underscore Mr. Obama's inability to invigorate the economy. 
It wasn't supposed to be this hard when the president tapped Mr. Daley to help adjust to the Republican resurgence in the 2010 elections.
He is the son and brother of two legendary mayors of Chicago, the party's giant Midwestern redoubt. Speak the language of bread-and-butter Democrats? Check.
He is also the pro-business former commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton who collaborated with Republicans to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and later became an executive at JPMorgan Chase. Understand political opponents and executives? Check.
Yet the recovery has flagged. Mr. Daley's attempt to orchestrate a centrist ''grand bargain'' with Congressional Republicans on deficit reduction shattered against conservative opposition to tax increases.
And the president's resulting retreat to his partisan corner has exacerbated the estrangement from business executives that Mr. Daley hoped to smooth over.
''There is a disconnect'' between Wall Street and Main Street, Mr. Daley observed in an interview.
And how.
A New Approach
Mr. Daley represents a generation of Democrats who have aimed to modernize the party's economic philosophy from the era when his father ruled Chicago. Thus even when little else can move past Republicans on Capitol Hill, the White House last week won new trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea.
Most Congressional Democrats voted no, renewing longstanding complaints that such deals benefit large multinational businesses more than American workers. That reasoning matches a core Occupy Wall Street objective: fighting ''corporate greed.''
''Some people would like the world to go back to the 1950s,'' Mr. Daley said of the trade deals' opponents. He acknowledged ''negatives'' to the agreements that the administration seeks to ameliorate with benefits for displaced workers.
''You have a tremendous reservoir of smaller and medium-sized businesses that have done well by having chances to sell their products around the world,'' Mr. Daley said. Over all, ''You're creating jobs in the U.S. because of lowering barriers in foreign countries.''
Such thinking endeared Mr. Clinton to business during the boom times of the 1990s. It isn't doing the same for Mr. Obama now, as new financial regulations and proposals to raise taxes on high earners have left Wall Street feeling under siege.
Consider Mr. Daley's friend and former boss at JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive. Once an Obama backer, Mr. Dimon recently met with Mitt Romney and attended a Romney fund-raiser.
What makes Wall Street complaints so exasperating to Obama advisers is their belief that they've struck a reasonable middle ground in updating oversight of a system Mr. Daley said ''had gotten out of control.''
Moreover, ''Many of the leaders in the financial sector would admit right up front that the controls weren't there,'' he said.
Administration critics on the left, which wanted big banks broken up, insist the system hasn't been changed enough.
'Super Sensitivity'
If some on Wall Street appreciate Mr. Obama's restraint, their disgruntled colleagues have been louder.
Mr. Daley cites the insularity produced by increasing power and rewards for financial executives in the 21st century economy. Before joining the administration, he was himself paid as much as $5 million a year by JPMorgan Chase.
In this ''very different society,'' he noted, even personal assistants to top Wall Street executives may earn $125,000 - enough to place them in the top 10 percent of earners.
''There's a super sensitivity of some people in the financial sector to criticism,'' Mr. Daley explained. ''They may feel under siege. But go out there and talk to the average American who's struggling mightily just to get by. That's where the real pain is, not in that 5 percent or 10 percent at the top.''
But Democrats can hardly ignore the wishes of the top 5 percent, not with an evolving national coalition that has seen the party in recent elections reap increasing campaign donations and votes from affluent Americans. Those crosscurrents are only getting tougher to navigate.
Former Vice President Al Gore, once considered a Democratic moderate, has endorsed the Occupy Wall Street protests. Mr. Daley, chairman of Mr. Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, was ''not really'' surprised by that decision - and not interested in commenting on it, either.
''I saw him the other night,'' Mr. Daley said drily. ''He looked good.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: NBC Anchor Broadens His Portfolio

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
There is something disconcerting about seeing Brian Williams sitting in front of the television.
At his apartment in New York last Thursday night, he fussed with the remote, scanned CNN and checked the local news, all while chatting about the fact that two weeks from Monday, NBC will add to the pile of television news with a one-hour show called ''Rock Center With Brian Williams.'' It may not knock ''60 Minutes'' off its perch, but NBC, now owned by Comcast, hopes it is good enough to one day be mentioned as a competitor.
Mr. Williams likes the idea of calling the show ''Rock Center,'' not only because it conjures the building he works in, but because it brings to mind ''30 Rock.''
''People could tune in expecting to see Tina,'' he said, referring to the sitcom's star, Tina Fey. ''I think the name confusion can only help us, right?'' 
Right.
''Rock Center With Brian Williams,'' an attempt to spread his broadcast charisma over a newsmagazine show, is a smart but not sure bet for Comcast, which made the show a priority after buying the network in 2009 and getting government approval to buy NBC at the beginning of this year. True, ''60 Minutes'' is more venerable than vulnerable, but NBC, with the ''Nightly News'' hosted by Mr. Williams, ''The Today Show'' and ''Meet the Press'' -- all No. 1 in their categories -- has a lot of talent and muscle. So it is hard to go wrong adding shelf space in the form of a long-form news show.
The economics of even a lavishly produced news program (typically $250,000 to $300,000 an episode) are much tidier than a dramatic show ($3 million or more per episode). ''Rock Center'' is taking over a Monday night slot being vacated by the short-lived ''Playboy Club'' at 10 p.m.
The history of serious attempts at a newsmagazine is characterized by brave rhetoric followed by abundant carnage. Remember that ''Dateline'' and ''48 Hours'' rolled out with great fanfare before sliding into the slime of sexual predators and reheated celebrity tawdriness.
But NBC is not just dipping a toe in: ''Rock Center'' has hired 70 people at a time when other network news divisions continue to shrink, spending substantial money on talent in front of and behind the camera. And the executive producer, Rome Hartman, is a highly regarded veteran of both the BBC and ''60 Minutes,'' where he produced over 100 segments.
The correspondents include Harry Smith, Meredith Vieira, Kate Snow, Richard Engel and -- as was just announced last week -- Ted Koppel. They are backed by a group of hotshot producers, a few of them grabbed from ''60 Minutes,'' a notoriously difficult place for talent to rise because there is so much of it.
Those names and credentials have impressed people in the business, but the rest of us will be tuning in to see Mr. Williams.
Somewhere between the anchor chair and his funny turns with late-nighters like David Letterman and Jon Stewart, there is a runway for his brand of abnormal normalcy. He's just like us, only better, or at least more famous.
I have heard people in Midwestern V.F.W.'s say nice things about him, but he also received favorable mention at a breakfast of digital media savants I recently attended. In a niched-up world, Mr. Williams is someone we all seem to hold in common, not because he is Uncle Walt, but because he reflects an appealing mash-up of earnestness and knowingness.
The first promo for the show is built on a friendly smirk at the trappings of network television. ''I am sitting on the 'NBC Nightly News' set and behind us,'' he says, with a jerk of the thumb, ''is the set for 'Rock Center.' My life will basically take place in this room.'' Scanning the place, he points to a corner. ''There is a plan for a pasta bar back over there.''
The studio segments between stories will be live, which will provide a contrast to the carefully scripted interstitials on ''60 Minutes.'' But, more to the point, Mr. Williams prefers to work that way.
''When you see me on television, I am there, that is where I am,'' he said, gesturing toward the glowing box on the wall of his apartment. ''I am a creature of live television.''
Mr. Williams is adept at speaking to millions in real time. He has been the top-ranked anchor on the evening news since he took over the chair seven years ago. Some might suggest that's like being the one-eyed king in the land of the blind given the entropic arc of network news. But he is winning, because he can credibly anchor a newscast amidst a revolution in Cairo, but also because he is enough of a regular guy to get away with calling Target ''Tar-zhay'' during the broadcast, as he did last week.
It is that wink, along with the impression that he actually knows his way around a Target store, that makes him appealing. He is like the local anchor that we love to watch, the funny one, the nice one, the handsome one, except he talks to almost eight million people every night about global and national matters.
He often acts as if his professional life accidentally ended up on steroids, that he has risen above his station, and pleads ignorance about the metrics that make him and his broadcast valuable.
''I have no idea what it costs to send a news truck to Dallas to feed live pictures on the 'Nightly News,' '' he said. ''I don't know what a commercial costs on our air. It is much better if I stay in my lane. They hire me to put word with pictures. And I like doing that very much.''
He swears he would happily go to work at NY1 if he got fired tomorrow. (In fact, during Hurricane Irene he sat in for an hour on WNBC, the local New York affiliate, just to give the anchors there a break.) Mr. Williams is talent, but he skews normal and is the kind of guy who would be happy working as a volunteer fireman, which he has, or the type who didn't finish college because he got interested in other things, which he also did.
Because he is busy getting ready for the new show, and I am on deadline, we met at the Midtown apartment he shares with his wife, Jane, who covers education for Bloomberg Radio, and with his daughter, Allison, an actress who will soon appear on the HBO series ''Girls.'' As he speaks, the window behind him offers a nocturnal postcard of Manhattan, including Rockefeller Center, still marked with the initials of the now-minority owner, G.E.
Mr. Williams won't say it directly, but the change in ownership, if not signage, has been a happy turn.
''I asked Jeff Zucker about doing something like this a few years ago,'' he said, referring to the newsmagazine format, but the new owners, including Steve Burke and Brian Roberts, asked me. Right from the start, they said, 'Let's do this.' ''
He interrupts our interview to switch to ''NBC New York.'' He is a freak about local news. He came from it, watches it and worries over it.
''I worked in local television for 12 years and that is our delivery system,'' he said, ''I want them to do well.''
Steve Capus, the president of NBC news, said Mr. Williams understood ''the mood of the country and has a great understanding of the stories that will click.''
So Mr. Williams will wave his wand, and great stories will appear on command that will wow affiliates and their audiences?
''Um, not exactly,'' he said. ''I will write the words that you hear me speak, I will be doing some stories and interviews of my own, but you don't want me selecting the pieces that will run. They would all be about presidential history, the Supreme Court, the military and aviation. No one would watch that show.''

HEADLINE: Good News! No, Really!

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Bored by the soggy sleep-ins and warmed-over anarchism of Occupy Wall Street? Fed up (Fed Up!) with the presidential Race to the Bottom? Depressed by the warning signs of the next Depression?
I bring relief. Like Nurse Jackie scavenging in the medicine chest for stray painkillers, I have assembled some capsules of hope from places you probably haven't noticed lately, because the dominant news is so disheartening you can't bear to proceed beyond the front page.
Admittedly some of these nuggets come from countries where you might not want to live. But I offer them as evidence that once in a while our sorry species gets something more or less right. Maybe we can extract a lesson, or a little encouragement. At the very least, we can remind ourselves -- at a time when our own politicians are competing to be the most ardent champion of ''American exceptionalism'' -- that we are not God's only gift to civilization. 
Let's start with Slovakia, the little country that is the less famous half of the former Czechoslovakia. Last week, though, plucky Slovakia was the last of 17 European countries to vote on a bailout plan intended to prop up the endangered economies of countries like Greece and Portugal while they curb their spendthrift ways. After 16 affirmatives, the fate of Europe came down to the Slovakian Parliament. And the Slovaks, prodded by a new opposition party that caters to the Facebook generation, said ''NO.'' The naysayers challenged the idea that Slovaks, who are themselves among the least affluent of Europeans, should pay to bail out profligate neighbors and the bankers who poured money into them.
After the rejection, the government fell. And then a new, temporary coalition went to work and agreed to ratify the agreement after all.
Slovakia thereby accomplished two things. By signaling that it was running out of patience, it struck more fear into the hearts of the world's bankers than the cumulative protests of Occupy Wall Street have done in a month of poster-waving. And then, the warning delivered, it regrouped and gave Europe one more chance, demonstrating an important level of maturity for a little country that not so long ago was a ward of the Soviet Union.
''We are similar to Americans,'' a Slovak official told me. ''We have fragmented domestic politics, but at the end of the day we get things done.''
I told him I was flattered to have my country compared to Slovakia, and he was right about the political fragmentation, but I wasn't so sure about the getting things done.
On to Liberia. You may recall it as the West African country founded by freed American slaves, and famous for 25 years of madness involving child soldiers, blood diamonds, rape and mutilation, among other atrocities. Liberia is still a wreck of a country, dirt poor, illiterate and corrupt, but these days it has elections that are free, fair, consequential and respected.
Last Tuesday Liberia held an election in which the two top presidential candidates were both Harvard-educated -- and not in the least ashamed of it! The incumbent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a former World Bank economist and a new-fledged winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, would stand out as the most qualified candidate in many countries' elections, possibly including ours. Her main rival, Winston Tubman, also has degrees from Cambridge and the London School of Economics and a long career in diplomacy. It's true that he brought in a soccer star as his running mate, but he's still regarded as a pretty solid guy. Of course, after former President Charles Taylor, who is in The Hague awaiting judgment on charges of committing crimes against humanity, the greatness bar is not high.
There will be a runoff. Sirleaf tells voters that she's got things in hand, and Tubman should get in line. Or, as the campaign slogan puts it: ''Monkey Still Working, Let Baboon Wait Small.'' Probably wouldn't work in Iowa.
Now we go south to Peru. While his counterparts in neighboring Brazil and Ecuador have been flamboyantly consolidating their own power, nationalizing industries and picking fights with the U.S., Ollanta Humala, the new president of Peru, so far seems bent on a quiet, moderate pursuit of systemic reform. He has eschewed left-wing nationalist rhetoric, appointed an investment-friendly cabinet, and calls the U.S. a ''strategic partner.''
Last week, announcing a campaign against corruption, he fired 30 of the 45 generals at the top of a national police force that is widely mistrusted by Peruvians as a league of shakedown artists. Of course, this has the advantage of creating a new police force loyal to the president, but if he gets police to stop putting out their hands for bribes and deploys them effectively against mounting crime and drug trafficking, Peruvians will thank him. Fingers crossed for Peru.
Next, let's put our hands together for Somalia -- arguably the saddest place on earth, ravaged by militant Islamists, pirates, bandits and dire famine. Last week residents of Mogadishu gathered in a soccer stadium for what The Times called ''one of the largest rallies in years.'' To demand handouts? To call for tax cuts? No, to denounce the Shabab, the Qaeda-supporting guerrilla group that has terrorized Somalia for years.
To be sure, Somalia is no poster child for postcolonial Africa, but it's not every day you hear of people packing a soccer stadium to rally against armed evil. On second thought, don't applaud. Send money. God knows they need it.
And finally Myanmar -- a k a Burma -- a beautiful land oppressed for most of the last 50 years by one of the more eccentrically awful military juntas. I made the round of its splendors 25 years ago, and have never quite shaken the memory of a Burmese student who took us quietly aside to plead for attention to the country's miserable isolation. He drove home to this visitor that Burma's secession from the world may have created a museum for tourists, but it made a fearsome prison for the Burmese. For decades protests have met repression, elections have been stolen or nullified, and Western sanctions have encountered intransigence.
Now there are signs of a thaw. The military regime installed a new parliamentary government six months ago, opened talks with the pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and last week it began to free some dissidents. It's a long way from democracy, but it's a rare beam of hope in a place hungry for it.
YES, much of Southern Europe teeters on the edge of default, the Arab Spring shows signs of turning sour, even China's economy is slowing, Ukraine is backsliding into authoritarian rule, Iran is allegedly commissioning hit men in America and last week we learned that our Afghan allies have been engaged in the wholesale torture of prisoners. (Wherever could they have gotten THAT idea?) We have no end of countries behaving badly.
So I return you now to your regularly scheduled gloom. But, Slovakia, Liberia, Peru, Somalia, Myanmar: Thanks! And keep up the good work!

HEADLINE: For Rangers, a Strong Team Behind the Team

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
MILWAUKEE
On the podium at Rangers Ballpark on Saturday night, as he accepted the American League championship trophy for the second year in a row, Jon Daniels thanked his scouts before anyone else.
''These things aren't flukes, and it doesn't happen without a ton of good people,'' Daniels, the Texas Rangers' general manager, told reporters on the pitchers' mound, just after the ceremony. ''And I'm just kind of the pretty face in front of it.''
Daniels, 34, fits the profile of the modern baseball executive. He did not make the freshman team at Hunter College High School in Manhattan, and he did not play at Cornell, where he earned a degree in applied economics and management. 
Yet even as an intern for the Colorado Rockies, in 2001, Daniels voraciously studied the written reports from the team's area scouts. Before he held a position of authority, he saw the importance of inclusiveness.
''I would show up for meetings, and he'd say, 'I've been reading your stuff,' '' said Billy Eppler, a former Rockies scout and now a top assistant to Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman. ''You could see the interest level he had. It was a good feeling, a warm feeling.''
Daniels moved to the Rangers in 2002, and by October 2005, he was their general manager, the youngest in major league history. His top assistant has been a former Rockies colleague, Thad Levine, a Haverford College graduate with a similar perspective.
The stereotype of the brainy outsider ruled by statistics, shunning scouts the way Brad Pitt does in ''Moneyball,'' did not apply.
''We respected the numbers,'' Levine said, ''but we had a real high level of respect for the scouts and the contributions they could make to the decision-making process.''
The Rangers' roster is a study in smart decisions. Some players predate Daniels's tenure as general manager, including Ian Kinsler, C. J. Wilson and Michael Young. But mostly, the roster is loaded with impact players who arrived in trades before they reached their potential.
The list includes Elvis Andrus, Nelson Cruz, Neftali Feliz, Josh Hamilton, Matt Harrison, David Murphy and Mike Napoli, with a free-agent signee from Japan (Colby Lewis) mixed in. Alexi Ogando, the converted outfielder who won twice in relief in the A.L.C.S., came as a Rule 5 draft pick recommended by A. J. Preller, Daniels's Cornell roommate who is now the Rangers' senior director for player personnel. Only one outside acquisition, third baseman Adrian Beltre, was a star before joining the Rangers.
No general manager could have so many moves work without shrewd evaluations and effective coaching. But Daniels and Levine also needed the humility to learn from one major mistake that preceded all the good moves.
In January 2006, in his first off-season as the general manager, Daniels traded two future All-Stars -- first baseman Adrian Gonzalez and starter Chris Young -- to San Diego in a six-player deal for the forgettable pitchers Adam Eaton and Akinori Otsuka. It was one of the most lopsided trades in recent history.
''The fundamental flaw we made is we thought we were a lot closer to competing than we were,'' Levine said. ''We felt as if we were the proverbial one player away from finishing it off. We improperly assessed where we were as a franchise. So that was a huge lesson we learned from that, and there were a lot of other subtle lessons, too.''
One, Levine said, was the need to place more emphasis on a player's makeup. Another was the danger of devaluing a player in the marketplace; just because the Rangers already had a first baseman -- Mark Teixeira --they did not have to settle for a low return on Gonzalez.
The 2006 Rangers flirted with contention long enough to trade for the Milwaukee slugger Carlos Lee, knowing they would not re-sign him. Daniels gave up four players but asked that the Brewers throw in an outfielder who would stay after Lee left.
That player turned out to be Cruz, the home run sensation of the A.L.C.S. But as Daniels quickly pointed out in Detroit last week, the Rangers could have lost Cruz on waivers when they left him off their opening day roster in 2008. Daniels acquired Cruz, but others made him a star.
''Bobby Jones, our Triple-A manager; Scott Servais, our farm director; and Mike Boulanger, our hitting coordinator -- those guys got with him, and Nelly was wide open,'' Daniels said. ''He said, 'I want help, I'm open, what do you guys got?' ''
The Teixeira trade in July 2007 was Daniels's boldest move. He traded a homegrown slugger a year and a half before free agency to stock the farm system with prospects like Andrus, Feliz and Harrison.
In a few months, the Rangers were staggered by the amount of talent within the 45 or so prospects at instructional camp. Normally, Daniels said, about five or six of those players would reach the majors. Yet from that group, nearly 20 have made it.
Daniels could not have predicted consecutive World Series appearances for some of those players. But he said he knew then that the Rangers had a foundation for long-term success -- as long as he and his staff did not mess it up. They have not.
''It's scouts making the recommendations; it's knowing your own people; it's the philosophy and the process,'' Daniels said. ''It's all of the above. But most importantly, it's the people.''

HEADLINE: Losing Their Immunity

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As the Occupy Wall Street movement continues to grow, the response from the movement's targets has gradually changed: contemptuous dismissal has been replaced by whining. (A reader of my blog suggests that we start calling our ruling class the ''kvetchocracy.'') The modern lords of finance look at the protesters and ask, Don't they understand what we've done for the U.S. economy?
The answer is: yes, many of the protesters do understand what Wall Street and more generally the nation's economic elite have done for us. And that's why they're protesting. 
On Saturday The Times reported what people in the financial industry are saying privately about the protests. My favorite quote came from an unnamed money manager who declared, ''Financial services are one of the last things we do in this country and do it well. Let's embrace it.''
This is deeply unfair to American workers, who are good at lots of things, and could be even better if we made adequate investments in education and infrastructure. But to the extent that America has lagged in everything except financial services, shouldn't the question be why, and whether it's a trend we want to continue?
For the financialization of America wasn't dictated by the invisible hand of the market. What caused the financial industry to grow much faster than the rest of the economy starting around 1980 was a series of deliberate policy choices, in particular a process of deregulation that continued right up to the eve of the 2008 crisis.
Not coincidentally, the era of an ever-growing financial industry was also an era of ever-growing inequality of income and wealth. Wall Street made a large direct contribution to economic polarization, because soaring incomes in finance accounted for a significant fraction of the rising share of the top 1 percent (and the top 0.1 percent, which accounts for most of the top 1 percent's gains) in the nation's income. More broadly, the same political forces that promoted financial deregulation fostered overall inequality in a variety of ways, undermining organized labor, doing away with the ''outrage constraint'' that used to limit executive paychecks, and more.
Oh, and taxes on the wealthy were, of course, sharply reduced.
All of this was supposed to be justified by results: the paychecks of the wizards of Wall Street were appropriate, we were told, because of the wonderful things they did. Somehow, however, that wonderfulness failed to trickle down to the rest of the nation -- and that was true even before the crisis. Median family income, adjusted for inflation, grew only about a fifth as much between 1980 and 2007 as it did in the generation following World War II, even though the postwar economy was marked both by strict financial regulation and by much higher tax rates on the wealthy than anything currently under political discussion.
Then came the crisis, which proved that all those claims about how modern finance had reduced risk and made the system more stable were utter nonsense. Government bailouts were all that saved us from a financial meltdown as bad as or worse than the one that caused the Great Depression.
And what about the current situation? Wall Street pay has rebounded even as ordinary workers continue to suffer from high unemployment and falling real wages. Yet it's harder than ever to see what, if anything, financiers are doing to earn that money.
Why, then, does Wall Street expect anyone to take its whining seriously? That money manager claiming that finance is the only thing America does well also complained that New York's two Democratic senators aren't on his side, declaring that ''They need to understand who their constituency is.'' Actually, they surely know very well who their constituency is -- and even in New York, 16 out of 17 workers are employed by nonfinancial industries.
But he wasn't really talking about voters, of course. He was talking about the one thing Wall Street still has plenty of thanks to those bailouts, despite its total loss of credibility: money.
Money talks in American politics, and what the financial industry's money has been saying lately is that it will punish any politician who dares to criticize that industry's behavior, no matter how gently -- as evidenced by the way Wall Street money has now abandoned President Obama in favor of Mitt Romney. And this explains the industry's shock over recent events.
You see, until a few weeks ago it seemed as if Wall Street had effectively bribed and bullied our political system into forgetting about that whole drawing lavish paychecks while destroying the world economy thing. Then, all of a sudden, some people insisted on bringing the subject up again.
And their outrage has found resonance with millions of Americans. No wonder Wall Street is whining.

HEADLINE: From Britain, It's Legoland

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. -- The Merlin Entertainments Group is one of the world's largest operators of amusement parks and tourist attractions, entertaining more than 40 million visitors annually. But the company operates almost entirely overseas, and it has no presence in central Florida, the sweaty epicenter of the theme park universe.
With the opening of a new Lego-themed park here last Saturday -- built on the roller-coaster-strewn carcass of the late and not-so-great Cypress Gardens -- Merlin has a message for North America: We are coming after you. ''Our ambitions for this marketplace are tremendous,'' said Nick Varney, Merlin's chief. 
Legoland Florida, which hopes to attract about 1.5 million visitors annually, is one of six new or coming United States attractions from Merlin, which is based in Poole, England. A $15 million Sea Life aquarium at the Mall of America in Minnesota opened in March. Legoland Discovery Centers -- indoor ''fun zones'' built at about $12 million apiece -- are coming to Atlanta and Kansas City; one opened in Dallas earlier this year.
And Merlin -- which also owns the Madame Tussauds chain of wax museums, including a location in Manhattan -- is a major part of a $100 million tourist complex planned for Orlando in 2013. Merlin's contributions will include a Madame Tussauds, an aquarium and a 425-foot-high Ferris wheel similar to the popular London Eye, which the company also owns.
Merlin's push comes amid increased jockeying by the media giants that dominate this corner of the entertainment industry. NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, spent $1 billion in June to buy full control of Universal Orlando. Disney has been pouring money into its parks, recently announcing an ''Avatar''-themed area at Walt Disney World that will cost an estimated $400 million.
Theme parks require steep, continual investments in new rides and upgrades, and their exposure to outside factors like weather and the economy makes investors nervous. But most parks are also reliably profitable and have continued to grow even during the recession, as people seek escape.
''We would much rather see increased investment in parks than in other media areas, like film -- the returns are simply better,'' said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst for Nomura.
Indeed, other entertainment businesses like movies and television, always high-risk endeavors, look even more so than usual at the moment. The Web is starting to make good on its promise of changing how people watch television, and movie studios are coping with the collapse of DVD sales and declining attendance in theaters.
For the year, attendance in North America is down by about 5 percent compared with the same period last year, which ended about 6 percent down from the year before.
Mr. Varney says he is not trying to compete with Disney World, which by some estimates attracts 30 million visitors a year, as much as shave off some of its overflow and expand into cities where families face a shortage of entertainment options. His company's sudden addition of new parks was meant to lead up to an initial public offering. Citing the sputtering economy, however, Merlin abandoned that plan last year.
Merlin reported a pretax profit of $40.4 million last year compared with a loss of about $21 million a year earlier. Revenue was $1.3 billion in 2010. Merlin employs about 17,000 people globally; major holdings include Alton Towers in Britain and a fast-growing Legoland park in California.
The company is 36 percent owned by Kirkbi, the Danish investment company that is itself owned by the family behind the Lego brand; the private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and the Blackstone Group essentially split most of the rest.
Here in Florida, Merlin spent about $25 million to acquire Cypress Gardens, a historic 150-acre property that was a symbol of the carefree, water-skiing Sunshine State of the 1950s.
The park closed in 2009 after a series of owners failed to compete with Disney and Universal, and for good reason: getting to Winter Haven from Orlando requires a 50-minute trek on more roads than your average corn maze.
''Oh dear, I've got a problem here,'' Adrian Jones, Legoland Florida's general manager, recalled thinking after getting lost on his inaugural visit to the property. He added, ''It's true, the biggest challenge is to cement in people's minds that this isn't the other side of the world.''
Merlin is largely counting on the strength of the Lego brand and the refurbishment of the park itself. Although the company refuses to say what it has spent on new rides, restaurants and landscaping, the cost appears to be considerable. An estimated 50 million Lego bricks now adorn the park, where ''pink-knuckle'' roller coasters (in keeping with the focus on young children) have been re-themed to fit Lego toy lines like castles and jungle adventuring.
''The condition of the park was worse than we thought -- mold, dry rot, termites -- but we completely Lego-ized it,'' said Bill Vollbrecht, the park's creative director.
Merlin is also working with local government officials to improve the roads and add better signage along the route. Mr. Jones takes comfort in internal research that shows 80 percent of theme park visitors in Orlando rent cars, but Legoland Florida will also offer $5 roundtrip shuttle service from the city.
And Merlin executives note that they have overcome the hurdle of location at their Lego park in California, which is about 40 minutes north of San Diego. That park has become a success by cultivating a reputation among parents for extreme cleanliness and its intense focus on younger children.
''Let's put it this way,'' said Duncan Dickson, a professor of theme park management at the University of Central Florida. ''If anybody has a chance of making it in Winter Haven, they do.''

HEADLINE: Pleas Unheeded as Students' U.S. Jobs Soured

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Alain Delaqueriere contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The college student from Moldova was in the United States on a cultural exchange program run for half a century by the federal government, a program designed to build international understanding by providing foreign students with a dream summer of fun in America. So he summoned his best English for the e-mail he sent to the State Department in June.
''Pleas hellp,'' wrote the student, Tudor Ureche. He told them about ''the miserable situation in which I've found myself cought'' since starting a job under the program in a plant packing Hershey's chocolates near the company's namesake town in Pennsylvania.
Students like Mr. Ureche, who had paid as much as $6,000 to take part in the program, expected a chance to see the best of this country, to make American friends and sightsee, with a summer job to help finance it all. 
Instead, many students who were placed at the packing plant found themselves working grueling night shifts on speeding production lines, repeatedly lifting boxes weighing as much as 60 pounds and financially drained by low pay and unexpected extra costs for housing and transportation. Their complaints to the contractor running the program on behalf of the State Department were met with threats that they could be sent home.
Events this summer at the Hershey packing plant in Palmyra, Pa., revealed major holes in the State Department's oversight of its summer work and travel program, the largest and most ambitious of its cultural exchanges. The program, which placed 130,000 foreign students in all sorts of jobs across the country this year, has a large impact in shaping the country's image for young generations overseas.
The Hershey students finally got the department's attention on Aug. 17 when 200 of them, waving placards and chanting union slogans, walked out of the plant, the first labor protest in the 50-year history of the department's exchange programs.
The protests raised questions about whether the State Department is equipped to manage what has become a vast temporary work program, especially in times when suitable jobs for foreign students -- even short-term jobs -- are harder to come by as high unemployment persists in the United States.
The protests also exposed serious lapses by the Council for Educational Travel, USA, a nonprofit group based in California and one of more than 70 sponsors contracted by the State Department to organize the students' trips to the United States and find jobs and housing for them.
The group, known as Cetusa, placed nearly 400 foreigners from 18 countries, many of them graduate students in medicine, engineering and economics, in physically arduous jobs at the Palmyra factory that were overwhelming for some.
The students, who were earning about $8 an hour, said they were isolated within the plant, rarely finding moments to practice English or socialize with Americans. With little explanation or accounting, the sponsor took steep deductions from their paychecks for housing, transportation and insurance that left many of them too little money to afford the tourist wanderings they had eagerly anticipated.
Program documents and interviews with 15 students show that Cetusa failed to heed many distress signals from students over many months, and responded to some with threats of expulsion from the program.
A Cry for Help
Mr. Ureche, 22, an engineering student, said he had begun to appeal to Cetusa for a different job as soon as he went to work lifting boxes loaded with Hershey's candies.
''I've been having serious back pains since the first day of work,'' Mr. Ureche reported in his e-mail to the State Department on June 6, sent two weeks after he started on the job. ''If I continue in this rythm of work, it may cause me serious health damages.''
He felt ''mistreated and ignored by my sponsor,'' he wrote. And the organization told him, he said, that if he complained to Washington, ''they will immediately cancel my visa.'' A few days later Mr. Ureche quit his job, making his way to New York and finding work.
When the walkout came two months later, State Department officials reacted swiftly, opening an investigation centering on Cetusa that has not yet concluded.
The department was already on notice about trouble in the program, after an Associated Press investigation last year found abuses of foreign students in several states. Officials started a broad review earlier this year, and on July 15 they inaugurated new regulations, which tighten requirements on sponsor organizations to ensure that students are matched with jobs that are appropriate and safe. A newly expanded staff of 18 inspectors will begin on-site audits of sponsor organizations this fall, officials said.
''We are asking hard questions,'' said Rick Ruth, the State Department official in charge of cultural exchange programs -- including whether the program should be scaled back in light of the hard times in the United States.
Cetusa responded to the protest by arranging for students to have a paid week off from the plant and by paying for two trips to historic sites in Pennsylvania. The Hershey Company hosted a daylong visit to its headquarters so students could learn about its business strategies.
''This is a beautiful, great program,'' Rick Anaya, Cetusa's chief executive, said of the cultural exchange.
Mr. Anaya said he was aware that the work in Palmyra was strenuous. ''It is hard to lift,'' he said. ''But they get used to it and they are fine with it after a week or so.'' He said all students had received and signed job descriptions before going to Palmyra. If packing work seemed too difficult, he said, ''they didn't have to sign up for the job.''
Mr. Anaya blamed the discontent on the National Guestworker Alliance, a labor group that helped organize the walkout, together with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other unions.
''It's clear and obvious to me that this whole thing was started and fueled by the unions,'' he said.
The foreign students' travails did prove fertile ground for the alliance, an advocate for temporary foreign workers. Joined by some of the students, the alliance since August has led a campaign against the Hershey Company, accusing it of exploiting foreign students to displace American workers. Some students agreed.
''They take students who came on a cultural exchange to slave for them and make next to nothing, when these jobs could be going to families in Pennsylvania,'' said Godwin Efobi, 26, a Nigerian medical student who was a protest leader.
Created under a 1961 law, the State Department's summer work and travel program was designed to give foreign university students who do not hail from wealthy elites at home a brief plunge into American life, at no cost to the American taxpayer. The students come on a visa known as a J-1, which allows them to work for up to four months and travel for a month.
Students in the program, a legacy of the cold war, come mainly from China, Russia and Eastern European countries, with some from Latin America. Traditionally they have been employed in national parks, amusement parks, summer camps, beach resorts and restaurants, in low-wage but congenial jobs.
Over the years the program has won many happy reviews after students returned home. But in recent years it grew rapidly, to 150,000 students in 2008 from about 30,000 a decade earlier. It is now bigger than most federal programs explicitly dedicated to importing temporary foreign workers.
As a cultural exchange, the program is not monitored by labor authorities, said Daniel Costa, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington who studies the J-1 program. Unlike the Department of Labor, he said, the State Department does not collect employment data that would show, for example, how many students have been placed in factories like the Palmyra plant, or how recently.
Mr. Anaya said his organization began by sending small numbers of students to Palmyra six years ago, for the annual summertime surge packing Hershey's candies for the Christmas holidays.
Many students were surprised to learn when they arrived that they would not work for Hershey, but for SHS OnSite Solutions, a staffing subcontractor for Exel, the contractor Hershey hired to operate the packing plant.
This summer Cetusa placed nearly 400 students in jobs in which, according to the fine print of the visa papers, the worker ''spends 100 per cent of the shift standing, walking, stooping, bending or lifting'' and ''involved in repetitive motion work,'' and must be able to ''lift up to 27 kilograms throughout the shift'' (about 60 pounds) and ''function effectively'' in a cold room.
'This Is America'
Many students -- including many who left Hershey before the labor groups arrived -- said the jobs were an immersion in misery.
Ignacio Torres Sibaja, a 21-year-old graphic arts student, said he started to weep when he read news about the walkout from his home in Costa Rica as he recalled three months when he worked in Palmyra last winter.
''I spent some of the worst moments of my life during that exchange,'' Mr. Torres said. Speaking by telephone from San Jose, he said he had applied for a resort job in Colorado, learning only at the last minute that he would go to Palmyra. He did not focus on the job description. He thought working for Hershey would be fun.
A partner organization of Cetusa in Costa Rica had assured him he would earn back the $4,000 he borrowed from his parents to pay airfare and charges by Cetusa for his visa and their fees, Mr. Torres said. But that partner went out of business days after he arrived in the United States. With no guidance from either group, Mr. Torres spent two sleepless days, including one night he passed in a mall, finding a bus from Kennedy Airport to Harrisburg, Pa., where Cetusa has an office.
A representative of the sponsor greeted him with a demand for $800 to cover a rental deposit on an apartment, Mr. Torres said. The agency provided small apartments, often 15 miles away in Harrisburg, charging each student $400 a month to live in cramped quarters with four or five others.
Mr. Torres turned over all the spending money -- $500 -- he had scraped together for the trip. ''I spent a week not eating,'' he said.
At the plant, Mr. Torres said, ''the packing line gets really, really fast and stressful.'' Even though the plant was chilled below 60 degrees, he said, ''I would be sweating all over.''
Mr. Torres echoed many students when he said his lowest moment came with his first paycheck. After deductions by Cetusa for rent, utilities, bus fare and other items, he took home $85 for 35 hours of work.
''You wanted a cultural exchange,'' Mr. Torres was told by the group representative, he said. ''This is America and this is the way we do things here.'' Although Cetusa is a nonprofit organization in the United States, commercial affiliates manage housing and insurance for its international student programs.
Mr. Torres finished his job too broke to travel in the United States, he said, and went home in debt, feeling cheated.
Hoping to Be Fired
In June, a student from China, Tian Jia Yi, started on the packing line at the Hershey plant. Mr. Tian, 20, a hotel management student at a college in Qingdao, quickly discovered that the work was too much for him.
''My supervisor always ordered us to carry these chocolate boxes every day that were too heavy,'' Mr. Tian said in a telephone interview, striving to express himself in correct English. After he pleaded for weeks for a different task, he said, a manager fired him.
''In a stupid way it was my dream that she would fire me because I can't bear that work anymore,'' he said.
Cetusa offered Mr. Tian a new job in California -- but he had no money to travel there. Then the organization ordered him to leave his Pennsylvania apartment. Stranded and alone, he managed to locate a relative in Flushing, Queens, and retreated there to search, unavailingly, for a new job.
''I feel very ashamed that I have to spend a lot of money that my parents sent to me,'' Mr. Tian said.
Under program regulations, sponsors are required to monitor their students throughout their stay here. But according to State Department officials, Mr. Anaya told them shortly after the walkout that his organization had not received any complaints from Palmyra before the protest.
Mr. Torres, however, recalled a gathering in March when dozens of students assailed Cetusa representatives with their grievances. ''Everybody rose up and starting confronting them,'' he said. In early August, a representative of the organization, Malgorzata Tekgoz, worked a night shift at the Palmyra plant to assess conditions there.
''It was fine, of course I got tired at the end of the shift,'' she reported in an e-mail. She said students had raised ''many standard complaints,'' particularly about ''the frequency of lifting boxes.''
With some students who pressed their case, Cetusa played tough. When the agency learned that Mr. Ureche had complained to the State Department, it terminated his participation in the program, putting him in violation of his visa, according to correspondence between Alan J. Leahy, a lawyer for the organization, and a labor lawyer Mr. Ureche contacted, Laurence E. Norton.
Still, dozens of foreign students employed at the Palmyra plant did not join the protests, State Department officials noted. Some had returned this summer for a second tour there.
Lenka Vavrova, 23, a student from Slovakia, told Cetusa in an e-mail that she was ''ashamed of who some of these students are.'' She wrote, ''We came here for a short time so we should respect the conditions and laws.''
Mr. Anaya said he was convinced the demonstrators had been ''misled and sold a bill of goods that is unfair to them'' by the labor groups. ''I do believe in the kids,'' he said. ''I believe eventually they will feel sorry for what they did.''
Saket Soni, director of the National Guestworker Alliance, said mobilizing the students had not been hard. ''We talked about fundamental labor and civil rights protections that cover these students, and all workers in America,'' he said. After the walkout, Exel, the contractor, said it would not longer use J-1 students at Palmyra.
Mr. Ureche said he remained disappointed by his experience here. ''The students are not cheap workers,'' he said. ''They are coming here to meet new people, make some money for travel. This program is not for living without food, without money, without nothing.''

HEADLINE: Republican Debates Are a Hot Ticket on TV

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
In September 2007, Fox News put Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Ron Paul, Rudy Giuliani and a man who was, back then, a long shot for the Republican presidential nomination, John McCain, on a debate stage in New Hampshire. The face-off attracted 3.2 million viewers -- the most of any debate so far that year.
This September, Fox's debate -- in Florida, with Mr. Romney, Mr. Paul and new names like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann -- attracted almost twice as many viewers: 6.1 million, the highest so far this year. The very first televised Republican debate this spring attracted almost 3.3 million viewers, while the first debate in the spring of 2007 had 1.8 million. 
What explains the fact that debates this year are garnering almost twice as many viewers as any of the early debates, Democratic or Republican, did four years ago? Cable news executives don't know for sure, but they have theories. Chief among them is that widespread anxiety about the economy and disapproval of the political system is building viewership.
''The 'pox on all of their houses' sentiment of the summer debt limit debate is clearly affecting voters,'' said Mark Lukasiewicz, the senior vice president for NBC News specials. ''It's driven them to be a lot more interested and more engaged in the process early on.''
''The issues have never quite hit home to this degree,'' said Michael Clemente, senior vice president for news editorial at Fox News.
Other theories involve livelier contenders, showier production values for the debates and an increase in online chatter about them -- some of the same traits that make reality TV shows successful.
The record-high ratings do not benefit the cable news networks directly through advertising sales, because there are few ads during debates. But the debates do benefit the networks indirectly, by attracting election-season sponsorships and by lending prestige to their brands. ''It's a great tent pole,'' Mr. Clemente said. ''You get to showcase your best people.''
While that has been true for decades, it may matter more now that cable news channels are effectively politics channels around the clock, making them more eager than ever to have screen time with the candidates. Exceptionally early interest in the election has revealed itself not just in the debate ratings but ''in clicks online for political stories and in ratings for candidate interviews,'' said Sam Feist, the Washington bureau chief for CNN, which will host the next debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas.
Television producers have added a little more sizzle to the debates this year -- the introduction to September's CNN-Tea Party debate reminded many of a ''WrestleMania'' match -- and they say they have, in some cases, spent a little more than in previous years on the productions.
CNN intentionally held its debates this summer in large arenas. ''I'm not sure that there's a direct correlation between production values and ratings, but just anecdotally, the bigger the event feels on TV, the bigger the audience'' that tunes in, Mr. Feist said.
(The introductory theme for Tuesday's debate sounds a lot like an Olympics opening ceremony theme.)
Over all, though, Mr. Feist and his counterparts say they have made no major changes to the marketing, publicity or format of debates. For the most part, they credit the people on stage and the dramatic situations that those characters, for lack of a better word, create. Mr. Clemente said, ''If I said, 'There's going to be a show on where you can find out how you might get a better job or retirement income,' you'd go, 'Geez, all right, let me listen to that.' ''
In the early days of the presidential primary race, in May and June, the audience was more than three million each for the first debate on Fox and the second debate on CNN. The audience rose to five million on Fox in August and to 5.4 million on MSNBC in early September. A week later, the CNN-Tea Party debate drew 3.6 million; that decline was attributed to competition from ''Monday Night Football'' and tennis matches on other channels. Then came the current cycle's record-setter, 6.1 million on Fox.
Polling data shows that Republicans, determined to make President Obama a one-term president, are more enthusiastic about this election cycle than they were in 2008. Many of the Democrats that felt upbeat then do not feel nearly as upbeat now. But that enthusiasm swap alone does not explain the ratings gains, because no Democratic or Republican debate drew more than five million viewers until January 2008.
Debates have been focal points of the Republican campaign to a greater degree than they were in 2007 and 2008. While the candidates are traveling and speaking in early primary states, ''a debate is a much better way for them to see all of them at once,'' Mr.Clemente said, referring to voters.
Because there are no debates on the Democratic side this season, Democrats may be tuning in to the Republican debates earlier than they did in 2007 to sizeup the competition for Mr. Obama.
''Clearly, on the Democratic side, there's a lot of recognition that there's going to be a tough battle at the ballot box,'' Mr. Lukasiewicz said.
The most recent debate, on Oct. 11, was shown on Bloomberg TV, which is much smaller than Fox or CNN and does not subscribe to public Nielsen ratings. But Bloomberg, too, saw a huge spike around 8 p.m. when the debate started, according to a Kantar Media study of set-top box data. Kantar projected that an average of 1.3 million people watched the debate, Bloomberg's first.
For that debate and other debates, access to online streaming and conversations seem to have helped the question-and-answer sessions gain more attention. Fox and Google counted more than six million online streams for its debate last month, for instance. Just as Twitter and Facebook have steered viewers to sports telecasts and awards shows, the sites may be reminding people of the debates, too.
There are 12 more Republican debates scheduled in the next six months, and the channels said they were interested in hosting even more -- assuming, Mr. Clemente of Fox News said, ''the candidates are up for it.''

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Warren's Appeal

 BODY:
For a few years now, politicians straining against all of the antigovernment demagogy have been searching for a way to energize public interest and remind voters of the essential government services and protections they rely on and all too often take for granted.
President Obama has struggled to find that language, only recently beginning to draw a clear contrast between his goal to revive the economy and put Americans back to work and the stagnation that is the inevitable result of the Republicans' antitax, antispending policies. 
While most other Democrats are afraid to talk about the need for higher taxes and are running away from the problem, Elizabeth Warren, the leading Democratic candidate for a Senate seat in Massachusetts, has engaged the fight and is beginning to rally supporters.
Ms. Warren talks about the nation's growing income inequality in a way that channels the force of the Occupy Wall Street movement but makes it palatable and understandable to a far wider swath of voters. She is provocative and assertive in her critique of corporate power and the well-paid lobbyists who protect it in Washington, and eloquent in her defense of an eroding middle class.
It is an informed and measured populism, and it helps explain why she immediately became the leading Democratic contender in the race to challenge Senator Scott Brown, the Republican who is up for re-election next year.
Ms. Warren, a law professor at Harvard, helped to design the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Because of her fierce advocacy on behalf of consumers, Senate Republicans and the financial industry made clear they would never allow her to run it.
She is a remarkably eloquent and appealing Senate candidate. ''Washington is well wired for big corporations that can hire armies of lobbyists,'' she said last month, soon after joining the race. ''But it's not working very well for middle-class families, and that's what I care about.''
She is both knowledgeable and accessible when she explains the destructive credit-swap and subprime mortgage games that created the financial crisis. She draws a detailed map back to the early deregulation of the 1980s that began to rip the nation's economic fabric -- the same deregulatory fervor the Republicans are preaching today.
Her larger appeal, though, comes from her ability to shred Republican arguments that rebalancing the tax burden constitutes class warfare. In a living-room speech that went viral on YouTube last month, she pointed out that people in this country don't get rich entirely by themselves -- everyone benefits from roads, public safety agencies and an education system paid for by taxes. And those who have benefited the most, she says, need to give back more.
''You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea -- God bless!'' she said. ''Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.''
Democrats should not be cowed by conservative taunts that the speech advocated ''collectivism,'' and use this argument to push back against the Republicans' refusal to raise the taxes of people who make more than a million dollars a year -- sometimes far more. Senate Democratic leaders say they plan to employ poll-tested phrases like ''Tea Party economics'' and ''Tea Party gridlock'' in their campaign for a jobs bill and beyond. They would be better off listening to Elizabeth Warren.

HEADLINE: Storming the Capitalist Castle

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The current protests on Wall Street effectively call attention to the extreme and growing income inequality in the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Wall Street is not literally a castle, and the small green space of Zuccotti Park claimed by Occupy Wall Street may soon be emptied. But an upstart movement has spray-painted a new slogan onto the ramparts of the economic establishment.
"We Are the 99 Percent" effectively publicizes a message consistent with research on the distribution of income and wealth: the top 1 percent of households in the United States represents an economic aristocracy.
Over the last 30 years, it has consolidated and amplified its privileged position, making strategic political investments in policies ranging from financial deregulation to cuts in top marginal tax rates.
It took home 21 percent of the nation's pretax income in 2008, up from 9 percent in 1976. It controlled 36 percent of the nation's private wealth in 2009.

Some economists argue that inequality has no downside -- a view critically dissected by Timothy Noah in a terrific essay, "The United States of Inequality."
As a poster I admired at the park last Wednesday succinctly put it: "We want democracy, not plutocracy."
The protesters don't necessarily demonize the top 1 percent or suggest that taxing them at a higher rate will balance the budget. What brings them together is the conviction that this group exercises disproportionate control over our economic and political life.
Republicans seem to confirm this view when they assert that higher taxes on millionaires would stunt employment growth - as though a small reduction in disposable income would demoralize otherwise mighty job creators.
The very rich are depicted as champions of the people who would graciously repay further tax cuts with economic growth. Yet Republican tax cuts dug much of the budget hole we live in.
A quarter of the millionaires in the United States pay lower tax rates than some middle-class households, vindicating concerns expressed by Warren E. Buffett, the investor king of Omaha now widely considered a traitor to his class.
The posters I saw didn't propose class war, but they did express class rage. "I paid for your bailout" said one, "and I want a refund." "Health care, not wealth care," said another. Several said simply, "I need a job."
The protestors I heard didn't pretend to offer a political program. One held up a sign saying, "We're Here, We're Unclear, Get Used to It." He genially described his participation in a week's worth of workshops and discussions as a "think tank of democracy."
Another, more discursive poster described the ideals of the "solidarity economy," starting with: "I don't have a boss. I'm a worker-owner in a cooperative business," and ending with, "I joined a credit union so my money stays in the community."
What seems to be emerging is what the historian Gar Alperowitzdescribed as a process of "evolutionary reconstruction." It might start by making capitalism more distinct from feudalism.
This idea came to me while reading about a great new product that just hit the market: a $6,400 toilet with its own remote control for water spray and drying fan. Marie Antoinette would have loved it for Versailles.
Whether the ramparts are breached or not, I predict a long and fascinating siege.
